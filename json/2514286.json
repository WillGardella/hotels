Because this was an impulsive trip, we didn\u2019t find many available central places to stay and ended up with Andrews. After seeing pictures of the rooms on the internet we were very skeptical, but became happily surprised when we arrived. The expedition was poor, but the top floor, where we had our room was newly renovated. The room was clean, had it's own new bathroom and was totally OK. The hotel is overall ok (but nothing more), as long as your room is at the top floor. It was cheap and relatively central. We didn\u2019t try the breakfast. The lady in the reception was very helpful and kind.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cJust passing through worth the money\u201d", "Author": "cdoublee", "ReviewID": "UR109370408", "Content": "My boyfriend and I were back packing and decided to stay at this hotel. Overall, the hotel was good. The owner was very friendly and helpful. The hotel provided breakfast, but we had tours booked so we never tried the food. The room provided clean sheets and towels daily. The room was clean, no bugs. The hotel is in a cute part of town that is easily accessed by train or bus. We had friends that stayed at the Hilton down the street and they were paying 3x the amount of money, and breakfast was not included. If you're not interested in staying in a room that is just merely a place to lay your head and shower than I suggest you stay in a fancy hotel, but be prepared to pay a lot!", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cSHUT IT DOWN NOW!!!\u201d", "Author": "tracieEngland", "ReviewID": "UR68463592", "Content": "after arriving in london early hours very tired , desperate for sleep, we found a room in this disgusting place hotel not! greeted by a strange but freindly old lady. we could not believe it it stunk, the stairs carpet which, was filthy and thick of dust was taped together (health and safety) as we went up stairs it got worse, it was dingey rotten i have never been in a place like it aggie and kim would have a ball at this hotel to be honest it was like something from the twilight zone ,scary it needs shutting down dont they have hotel inspectors", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely shocking!\u201d", "Author": "mairead_10", "ReviewID": "UR68153014", "Content": "Our room was on top floor and our toilet was in the basement.The carpet on stairs was filthy&held together with tape.There was dust everywhere,shower in room was like a wardrobe.Tea/coffee making facility-no milk,tea/coffee.Had to use a bottle to keep window open.carpet in room was nailed to floor.TV didn't work.Smell of smoke through the house.All in all,this was the worst hotel ever, absolute disgrace and disgusting.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "kFm_22", "ReviewID": "UR43779430", "Content": "I've been in London, marvelous city, but I've had to sleep in that horrible hotel, where everything was absolutly dirty, I could say even disgusting!

We had to go there because the one we had booked was overbooked. Andrewshouse Hotel is the most ramshackled, shabby place I have ever seen in my life and I have travelled all over the world including Asia. When we arrived an old man opened the door, totally unfriendly, uncooperative and indifferent. We had to ask him again and again about a manager's name which was given to us from the other hotel which booked us in there. The room price was \u00a365, which would be only worth like \u00a3 20 I would say because this place is the most terrible hotel on this earth. The hotel is totally delapidated, run-down and I am really wondering how the City of London keeps such a rotten place running for international guests in this area wich is one of the poshest. The lady , wife of the unfriendly old frustrated man, was actually a nice Brazilian woman, eldery lady, and very very nice. She cut the price by \u00a35 because she found us so nice. The ensuite room with WC is shown on their website and indeed on the website the bed and courtain was there but the picture was taken a century ago. The room was totally yuck,, tapestry coming from the ceilings, ashes on the little lamp next to the bed from the previous guest who left the ashes from his cigarette just there. A cubicle in the middle of the room which was a shower unit. The white inside curtains were almost brown, never washed and the brocate curtaines were kept together by a piece of green package band. I couldn't close an eye because it was absolutely ice cold the room. Under the cover blanket was a woolen blanket from like 60 years ago with a whole from burning... The breakfast was totally miserable, just a totally cheap jam of I don't know nature, just sweet, 4 hyperthin slices for us 2 of the cheapest white toast bread, NESCAFE, corn flakes and an egg which looked like moulded (was green) or then 5 hours boiled. This place should be immediately closed and I will contact the authorities. It is a hell of a place! Don't ever go, book into Ibis or so...", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Asia", "Title": "\u201cHell on EARTH\u201d", "Author": "Traveller_tm_777", "ReviewID": "UR19322516", "Content": "HELL on EARTH!!
