If you a savvy traveler like my self all you're looking for is somewhere to stay that is perfectly located, clean, has a nice staff, and is within a college students budget, making New York Inn the place you need to be. I have visited NYC quite a few times before, but I have never stayed anywhere that has literally gone out of their way to make sure that my stay was pleasant and that I had absolutely everything I needed. The hotel is tucked away, primly located right on 8th avenue. When you walk in you are happily greeted by someone working at the front desk. There is no elevator so you do have to walk up a narrow, somewhat steep staircase, but people, this is New York City, if you're looking for that kind of service and convenience you better be ready to pay the big buck$$ for it. The rooms are rather small, but like I said before, you didn't come to the city to sit in your room all day. The only time we spent in our room this whole trip was to sleep and to shower. We were given a complimentary breakfast of bagels, croissant, and toast every morning, can you say free food! There is free wifi in every room and a computer available for your use at no cost. You can't get that anywhere. Every morning while leaving the hotel the staff asked if there was anything we needed help finding and made sure to answer any and all of our questions with great knowledge. I will definitely be staying at New York Inn any and every time I'm in New York from now on!", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNew York Inn - Definitely the place for travelers\u201d", "Author": "gaynde", "ReviewID": "UR123506433", "Content": "Hi there, i am from Montreal....

It was in the middle of the holiday season (25th Dec - 3th Jan) and all the hotels were too expensive for us. Sadly, I didn't look at the photos on Tripadvisor, I would have avoided this place. The stairs were disgusting and in mold. Also the \"hotel\" had an awful smell. There is no lift so we had to drag our luggages to the 7th floor. I almost cried when I saw our room. Everything was covered with dirt, the bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen and covered with mold. We had to wear flip-flops when walking in the room and while taking the ice-cold shower. There was hot water only one time during our stay. The security chain was taken off from our door and other window was broken, covered just with some kind of plastic (!!!) Anyone could have just walked in, cause the lock in the window was broken. Only one plug point worked, others were life-threatening. Not to mention the awful stains in the walls.. The list goes on and on... The \"cafeteria\" was an old storage room with nasty dirty curtains. Only plus was that breakfast was complimentary, serving bagels, toast and butter/cream. We paid a total 1800$ for this experience. All I wanted was a simple, clean, SAFE room. The day it rained, our roof went completely moist and I could almost feel the roof falling down. I even offered to my fiancee to sell my other kidney if he would take me out of there. But the front desk made us pay the entire stay in advance, so there was nothing we could do. Ok, the front desk was very polite and staff friendly, Also the hotel is situated perfectly. Still there is too much gone wrong with this place. Please believe that this is the worst and most dangerous place you can spend your nights.

This place should NOT be operating. Besides comfort issues such as a very (very!) small bathroom, lack of blankets and a questionable breakfast, there are some real health issues that need to be addressed at this \"hotel.\" The stairs feel like they are about to collapse at any second, I leant on the bannister at one point and almost fell down three floors. The first room we were put in was so filthy I cried when I saw it. After two nights in that room I realised the odd smell in the room was because the water from the back of the toilet was constantly leaking over the bathroom floor. After asking to be moved, we were told to go to breakfast and everything would be sorted. When we came back the manager had forgotten about getting us a new room and we had to wait another 10mins to be moved. Within 1hr we saw another guy being checked into the room we moved out of! The new room was slightly bigger, although the shower was so small I could not reach my hands up to wash my hair. Showers were few and far between as the hot water only lasted a few minutes at best. The window would not close so we asked for extra towels and rolled them up in front of the window to keep the cold out. The heater seemed to be on a half hr timer, so we would have to turn it back on regularly. The sheets were too small for the bed so it was a struggle to keep them on or in place. For the final two days the electricity in our room kept cutting out if we had more than one item on (turning on the light in the bathroom meant turning off the room light first, turning the heater on meant having no lights or tv on). In the end I was making such frequent calls to reception to get our power switched on, the maintenence man showed me to the fuse box myself and showed me how to ref-use our room. All in all this place is an absolute dump and it is dispicable that it is still in operation!

Even small hostels on the chinese countryside were better. The rooms are tiny and very dark, with a strange odor. The sheets are cover in holes and strange stains. We woke up in the middle of the night because of a strange sound, and when I turn on the light, I saw a mouse run across the floor and in under our bed. This was in June 2010. We wen't down to the front desk and telled the man there what had happened, and he didn't seem surprised. He just asked us if we wanted to change room, which we did. The other room was also in lousy condition. We stayed there for one more night, and then we changed hotel. The bathroom in the new room was a disaster. It was so small that we had to stand in the shower to use the sink, and when we sat on the toilet we had to have our legs twisted or have one foot in the shower. There were also a power outlet in the shower, which is extremely dangerous. I have uploaded some pictures so you can have a look. When we came back the second day, the health services had put a sign up on the front door which said \"DO NOT ENTER\". There were two police officer in the reception looking for a suspect living at the hotel. The breakfast that is included is a complete joke. It's not a standard Subway-sandwich. It consist of a tiny peace of white bread, a small package of cottage cheese and jam. You won't last long on that \"breakfast\", so you might as well eat at a good place. This place is a complete disaster, and it is not cheap compared to what you get. I promise that you will be VERY disappointed (and disgusted). Their website states that they are renovating the rooms which is a complete lie. They don't. What they have done is installed flat screen-tv:s, and I guess that is what they call renovating.

The room was very small, but the size of the room wasn't really a big problem. The condition of the room was terrible. They have bought new flatscreen tv's. Why? There is not a single soul in the world who would lay in bed watching tv in that room. Trust me. On our first night a mouse woke us up in the middle of the night. It was sitting on the floor eating our chocolate. We told the man at the front desk and he didn't even apologize! We got a new room on the first floor, which wasn't much better. There was an electricity plug in the shower, which is really dangerous, the cieling was coming down, and the linen in the bed were torn and had stains on them. The following morning I had bedbug bites on my hand. On our second day the department of health ( i think) had put a sign on the front door of the hotel saying DO NOT ENTER. Two police men were at the front desk looking for someone, who appearantly lived next to our room. When we got back to the hotel after having dinner a mouse had been in our room again! The man at the front desk didn't apologize, he more or less told us that it was our mistake, bringing chocolate to our room. Come on, it's year 2010 in NYC and you should be able to have a Mars-bar in a plastic bag without any rodent eating it. Anyway, we said that we wanted our money back and that we wanted to check out. I have read many reviews, and people seem to be pleased with the service. I'm not that impressed. We had to pay for the first night, but was promised to get the rest of our money back. I hope the money comes back, it's been a week but the money is still not on my account, but I guess it can take a while. This place needs to be shut down, or have major renovations.

But it left quite an impression on me. I was just out of college, a single guy, so I don't need anything too fancy. Just a clean place to sleep. If I was travelling with my girlfriend I would be more picky, but for myself, just wanted something cheap. Well the price was about $135. a night at the time, reasonable for a place so close to Times Square. The place is above a subway restaurant, easy to find. The guy on the phone told me \"above a subway\", I though he meant the underground subway system, not the sandwich place. So I laughed when I arrived. I stayed there for 2 nights, and walk into the lobby to check in. The lobby is tiny, and there are a few women hanging out. I get my key and walk down the corridor to my room and notice a few more women staring at me in the hallway. I later realize that these women are prostitutes. I am surrounded by professional women getting paid to do their thing. Must say a little creepy. I get to my room and open the door, the door almost hits the bed. Smallest room I have ever seen. There is a bed and a small dresser and no room for anything else. My key barely works in the lock, the sheets don't look clean, the carpet seems dirty to the point that I feel uncomfortable unpacking and putting my belongings on the floor. The bathroom is the smallest bathroom I have ever seen, and I end up showering with shower shoes because the floor is covered in mildew. I had a real concern sleeping on the sheets that might have been dirty, but again, I'm a guy and just tried to put it out of my mind. Laying down and looking up at the ceiling, I see about 6, not 1 but 6, ceiling panels missing, so I am just staring up into the rafters. Weird. The main problem was the walls. They were so thin I got the impression they weren't solid, remimded be of partition walls in an office cubicle. The problem with thin walls is the prostite issue, I could hear people having sex all night long. Kind of funny, but if I was with a spouse, this would have really creeped her out.

Eventually helped by a really helpful assistant manager called Luke at the Milford Plaza who at least found us 3 rooms for the sunday night. Nothing for the Saturday night. OH NO, this meant we had no option! Room was incredibly small with the bed jammed between 3 walls. How they have the nerve to call it ensuite with a shower stuck in the corner with both the sink and the toilet both overhanging into it. Did I mention how dirty it was! There was a 1950's dresser with a tv on top with a hanger stuck in for an aerial. A broken A/C unit was stuck in the window which might as well have been a wall as it was so dirty. The bedding was dirty looking and all the skirting boards were hanging off and before I could even try to sleep in this Hell hole we went for some drinks and jammed the suitcase against the door as the lock didn't seem very secure.

Finally one of the hotels gave us the number to the Hilton Garden Inn right up the street. She had a friend that worked there. He got us in for $285 and this hotel is one block over from Times Square. Our issue now was the NY Inn had already charged our card for the 4 night stay there.

I can see why there were only a couple of pictures on the website. New York is ridiculously expensive to stay in, but at over \u00a3120 per night (now over \u00a3140 with the exchange rate) I was expecting more than we got. You couldn't argue for the location. It was great, OK, people have complained there was a peep show place on the corner, but you get them in any city. It was right off broadway and times square, in midtown manhattan which is the best place to be for seeing all the tourist sites. You could walk to the train station and most of the interesting sites. But, it was really rough. We had a choice of two rooms. They were equally as bad as each other. The staff seemed nice, though a couple of people didn't seem to speak much English. This was the worst place I have ever stayed in, and my partner who has done a lot of travelling to some really bad places, said this is the worst place he has stayed in for donkeys years. You wouldn't expect it in America. The whole place was filthy. The room was tiny with nowhere to put anything. We scrapped around trying to manouevre round two suitcases in the room. The rooms had a funny smell and certainly hadn't been cleaned in a long time. There were trails of green stuff running down the bedroom wall, and the bathroom door was patched up with pieces of wood and the door wouldn't stay shut. The bathroom was tiny. The world's smallest sink was hanging off the wall, as were the tiles in the bathroom. It was too small for my partner to be able to shave in without great difficulties and the floor was really sticky. The shower wasn't great and there was no hot water in the evening when we tried to shower. I fully expected to find roaches crawling round everywhere, but gladly we didn't see any. The 'contintental breakfast' we'd had advertised was at subway next door and consisted of a bagel with half an omelette, a cookie and a hot drink. That said, it did fill us for the morning but by the end of three days I was ready to be eating something else. We were glad it was in the place next door as I'm sure looking at the state of the rooms, we would have got horrendous food poisoning. The floors were black where they should have been red and we didn't dare walk on the carpet barefoot. We put newspaper down and a towel on the bathroom floor. I'm not a clean-freak or anything but there is bad and BAD. I was pleased to find the sheets were clean, and they did change the sheets and towels everyday. We were worried about what would happen in a fire, the fire escapes we could see from the outside were not evident from the inside and the two people we asked about escape routes didn't understand what we were trying to say. I hadn't seen these other reviews before we went, but will be checking this site in future, as I certainly wouldn't have stayed here if I'd read what people had said. So if you don't mind cleanliness and want somewhere cheaper than other places in a good location then this is the place for you, but if you have any kind of standards and respect for your health I would stay well away.

The second night is when we seen the first mouse in our room i was a little paranoid it case it was running around the bed when we were sleeping. The housekeepers only cleaned our room once and we stayed there for seven nights. That was horrible. The batroom was absolutley disgusting it was so small and so dirty i felt sick when I had to shower i just had to jump in and out the bathroom floor would just become a swimming pool during your shower.

We ended up staying at the New York Inn because there were no other options available to us. It is a little hole in the wall, beside a Subway, facing out onto 8th avenue.

Our room was small but comfortable - the television worked, it was clean, and it had a nice view out the fire escape facing 8th ave. The bathroom door didn't close very well but it was certainly serviceable. We loved it exactly for the dingy, disreputable atmosphere.

The bathroom was shockingly disgusting and the base of the bed had a big massive hole in it (God only knows what was living in there!) Well I thought, Im not having this so went back down to the desk and complained. The man moved me to another room and it was just as horrid with screaming and shouting coming from next doors room. I thought to myself, if I don't laugh, I'll cry! and wondered what to do alone in such a flea pit. I decided that I really could not stay in the hellhole and went down again and kicked up a stink and demanded my money back. He tried to fob me off saying it was a credit card booking so I couldnt get a refund but I argued my case and the guy said he would book me into his friends hotel instead.

The bathrooms are tiny - well microscopic and we did have water running onto the tiles from the floor above but they sorted that out pronto. If you accept that you are paying practically nothing for a room in a fab location in New York then it is fine. We were on the second floor at the front so I don't know what the rooms higher are like. When they knew we were on honeymoon they moved us down as we were originally supposed to be on the 4th floor.
