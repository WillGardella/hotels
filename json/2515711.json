One one hand, the hotel is located immediately adjacent to the airport, which creates a really terrible situation for many rooms which are subjected to ongoing jet noise. The side of the hotel which faces the airport and the eastern most wing is close to the point of takeoff on the main runway ..so the jet noise starts very early in the morning (6-7AM) and continues to late at night (11-12pm). If you really want peace and quiet, don't choose this hotel!!! I have stayed at airport hotels in other parts of the world, and this is the worst example I know of. The one saving grace for this location may be a view, if you happen to have a room facing the bay, you can enjoy a nice view of the marina and downtown San Diego skyline. There are numerous other service issues which plague this hotel, ranging from inadequate attention to staffing at the front desk (particularly for Starwood Preferred guests) which lead to overly long waits for handling any issue, problems with daily room service for upkeep of rooms, and problems with card key access to the rooms. It turned out that I needed to get my room key cards reissued every day, since almost every day they stopped working for unknown reasons. Security finally decided to change the entire lock on the door to solve the problem! Most of the staff are in need of additional training. For club level guests, morning food service is monotonous and only of average quality.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuitable for a stopover or a longer stay.\u201d", "Author": "karlowsj", "ReviewID": "UR128624138", "Content": "This is a very nice property close to the airport and by a marina in lovely San Diego. My husband and I have stayed here on previous occasions - usually overnighting before a cruise. This trip we spent 7 days at the hotel with a room overlooking the marina. Previous reviewers are correct that there are two distinct properties so advised to check which one is most suitable. As it is a little out of the downtown area - you either need to rent a car (but be forewarned overnight on site parking is $22.00 per night) or take the shuttle to the airport which runs frequently and is 7 minutes away and then catch the 992 city bus which takes you by the cruise ships and then turns to downtown and the trolley connections. Its fun if you don't mind public transportation and for $5.00 you can purchase a day pass which you can even use to get to Sea World/the wonderful Zoo or Mission Beach. The service at the hotel is very good - the front desk personnel were always friendly. If you have a breakfast package you do get a breakfast buffet daily. The staff there varies and the service isn't great. But for OJ, coffee and a croissant its fine. The main hotel has a beautiful pool and complete fitness centre. The other hotel has a pool but the fitness centre is undergoing renovations and will be reopening in the future. All in all this is a great spot for visiting San Diego and area.

The beds are so comfy and the blackout curtains really help when you need rest. The pool was nice and heated; there are towels that can be used outside. I did not use the fitness room.

There is a bus (9..?)that will take you downtown and you can catch any bus from there. The hotel is walking distance to the marina (behind the hotel) and across the hotel you can cross the street and sit and view the water. Thats it! Nothing is in walking distance...except this small grill in between the marina tower and the bay tower. Food in the hotel is very expensive! I had a breakfast for $26.

There were about 130 participants at the meeting including clients. We knew going into the weekend that the hotel was sold out the night before the meeting began but at the last minute the hotel determined they did have some rooms for the few of us and the clients who were checking in early. Here is where the tale of two towers begins..... The hotel has 2 \"towers\" as they call it and the majority of the group was checked into the Bay Tower. I got a room in the Marina tower along with 2 others. Usually when a hotel has 2 towers you assume they are in the same building just using separate elevator banks and at opposite ends. However, these are really two completely separate hotel buildings separated by a 5-8 minute walk outside. (Two of my posted pictures show a view from my room and the lounge and the view from my Marina Tower room looking at the Bay Building so you can see the distance.) Note that the hotel does provide free shuttle service. You can see the map of the buildings and layout on the SPG page for the hotel under \"Meetings & Events\" and then \"View Floor Plans & Capacity Charts.\" I asked the front desk staff who checked me in what the difference was between the two towers and she said \"Well the rooms in the Bay tower are generally 30% larger.\" That may be true but some extra space is all you will get and it's not worth the trade off. Because I was a Platinum member after asking \"Well check me into a room YOU would prefer...\" I was given a room in the Marina Tower. As we met for dinner that first night naturally everyone asked how comfortable the rooms were and for the three of us in the main Marina tower (the main hotel building/entrance) the rooms were clean, renovated, and just fine. (Pictures of my Marina Tower room are posted) However, I heard nothing but bad comments the rest of the weekend from any meeting participant that was over in the Bay Tower. Distance was a problem but they commented how the hotel was old and run down, bathrooms were not as clean as they could be. They really had a completely different hotel experience than anyone who stayed in the Marina Tower. It's also not a quick trip to get between towers should you have a short break in your meeting and want to \"run back to your room.\" When booking rooms on the hotel website you do choose which tower you would like a room in so BEWARE. In my opinion, if you are not staying in the Marina Tower, do not stay here or at least be prepared. The unexpected highlight was the Club Level Lounge (Marina Tower)! I have also posted pictures of the lounge. Many people who go to the lounges can tell you that most of the time, it's just a sleeping room on a standard floor at the end of the hall with some sofas and chairs in it - small, cramped, dark and not relaxing at all. Maybe there are some cold drinks but it's really depressing and pretty useless. However, the lounge here could not be more enjoyable. As I arrived at the hotel at 11am (and room not available) I asked to have access to the lounge as a Platinum member. The lounge is the entire top floor of the hotel. It's almost all windows with 2 TVs, lots of workspace and comfortable chairs and sofas, and times where food is provided. It's bright with lots of light and comfortable. Internet is also free in the lounge. It was really relaxing and what a great place to work especially since I couldn't check in until 3:30pm. I didn't mind working with a great view of the Marina and Bay. In regard to hotel location - It's DIRECTLY across the street from the airport. Yes it's a short commute from the airport but you can't walk to ANYTHING around there.

The staff was helpful, by room was clean and comfortable and the food during conference was great. The only negative was the relatively isolated location. I am a big fan of walking, and you really needed to take a cab to get to town (although it is an easy walk from the airport). The hotel itself is clean and up to date. I was given a small suite with a little balcony where I could see downtown and the water through the trees (I was on a low floor). The bed was the usual very comfortable sheraton bed, and the linens were clean and fresh. Lunch at the hotel restaurant was tasty (I had a nice seafood cobb salad), but everything on the menu is $15-$20 for lunch before drinks, tax and tip. There are no other options to dine nearby, other than walking to the airport for fast food. The other hotel facilities were good. The gym contains several bikes, treadmills and ellipticals, as well as weight machines. The pool looked great. Lots of places to sit. There is a very nice club level lounges, with a great view. The lounge included cold breakfast choices each morning (cereal, oatmeal, pastries, fruit and cold cuts). Unlike some other Sheratons I visit, there were no hot choices. There is a free shuttle from the airport, and it is only about a 10 minute walk, so I did not experience parking. It looked like overnight parking was around $20. The property itself consists of several buildings, so the experience might depend on which building you end up in. The main tower houses the restaurant, bar, lounge and a much nicer gym than the other tower. The other tower is not right next door- it is a bit if a hike. There are also some annex buildings where the rooms have exterior corridors and doors. The overall value varied. My conference rate was over twice the auto club rate I paid the final night., so check around for deals.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Retreat on the Marina\u201d", "Author": "Cisco96", "ReviewID": "UR127103903", "Content": "OVERVIEW OF BRAND Sheraton is the \u201cflagship\u201d brand of the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) family of hotels as it has the largest number of hotels. As of April 1, 2011, all Sheratons must have a club lounge that is open on the weekends. They also have a computer/WiFi area in the lobbies known as \u201cLink@Sheraton.\u201d Hotel bathrooms are stocked with \u201cShine\u201d products. SHERATON\u2013SAN DIEGO MARINA This Sheraton opened approximately 40 years ago, and this was my first stay. It is located next to the airport, and it was renovated approximately 6 years ago. The hotel consists of two buildings: the main hotel with a conference center and the Bay Tower, which is 7\u201310 minute walk away. Both buildings have a \u201cLink,\u201d a fitness center, pool access, and restaurants. However, the main building has more and bigger of everything; and the only restaurant in the Bay Tower has limited hours and closed for lunch. The only Sheraton Club Lounge is on the 12th Floor of the Main Building. THE ROOM The rooms and hallways reflect its location on the Marina with lots of blue, pictures of boating, and nautical flags. The standard/deluxe room has a 37\u201d LG LCD flat-screen TV, a coffee maker (Starbucks coffee), bar fridge with sensors (i.e., it\u2019ll charge you if you pick it up), and an iron/ironing board. Most rooms have a balcony/patio, but you may want to ask to make sure. Most rooms also seem to have nice views as it\u2019s on a narrow island and no other tall buildings are close by; views may be of the bay, marina, downtown, or airport. SPG Platinum Members receive free Internet in the room. Otherwise, Internet in your room will cost $15\u201319 for 24-hours. They have a \u201cLink\u201d on the first floor of both buildings, which offers free Internet for all. GYM AND POOL Both buildings have a gym and pool. However, the main building has more pools and is close to many activities that would be fun for children (e.g., an area with Ping Pong tables, and a massive Pirate Ship). The gym is also larger in the main building. SPG SPECIFIC Only the main building has a Club Lounge, which is open all day. The Lounge overlooks the Marina and is very nice and comfortable. There is a computer, a flat screen TV, and a fireplace. The Lounge fridge is stocked with bottled water throughout the day, but no soft drinks or coffee like at other Sheratons. The Lounge has breakfast (Monday\u2013Friday = 6:30\u20139:30AM; Saturday & Sunday = 6:30\u201310:30AM) and evening appetizers (Daily = 5:00\u20138:00PM) with a cash bar (average price for drink = $9.00). I am not sure what the Platinum Amenities are as I wasn\u2019t offered any (I assume I\u2019ll get 500 Starpoints). MY RATING This is a really nice Sheraton. The rooms are comfortable, and the views are amazing. Although it is showing some wear and tear (e.g., the lamp shade in the room was beat up and the carpet by the balcony got wet due to a rainstorm because of bad weatherproofing), it\u2019s still in very good condition. My main reason for giving this hotel 4 vs. 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of the Club Lounge. There should be a mini version of it in the Bay Tower just like there are \u201cmini duplicates\u201d of everything else given the Main Building isn\u2019t convenient to get to. Although you can drive to the Main Building or take a Shuttle, that may not work if you are in a rush and/or just want to get a drink to take to your room. Notwithstanding this limitation, I actually think this is a great Sheraton. There are other nice Starwood Hotels closer to the Convention Center (e.g., The W and The Westin\u2013Gas Lamp District), but unless you need to repeatedly go the Convention Center, then I\u2019d opt for this Sheraton. It\u2019s close enough to the downtown action, but serves as a nice retreat from your busy day. The pools and the views are very relaxing\u2014especially if you are having drinks from your balcony while watching the sunset.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location and great staff!\u201d", "Author": "bklady", "ReviewID": "UR126942521", "Content": "I recently visited for a conference and was enchanted by the beautiful city of San Diego.

The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy. The bed was uncomfortable and the furniture looked old and dingy. I did ask for an adjustment on the bill, but guest services would not budge and did not seem to care at all. I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work.

From the outdoor grounds to the club floor, everything was clean and looked fresh. The hotel is broken up into two buildings. The Marina Tower being the \"main\" tower with restaurants, pools, gym, tennis courts, Starbucks and club lounge. The Bay Tower is about a 5 minute walk along the marina and while not a huge deal it would be a little inconvenient if you were wanting to be close to the action of the hotel. The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet. Equally enjoying is the club lounge on the top floors which is a wonderful place to relax and watch the sunrise over breakfast or the sunset over appetizers and drinks. The front desk agents we encountered were very friendly and helpful, even when we asked to check in at 9am. Although a room wasn't immediately available, it was shortly thereafter and well before the normal afternoon hotel check in time. The restaurant waiter we had was also very attentive and friendly.

We booked connecting rooms and paid for the upgrade to the Club Level Floor. Airport Shuttle was waiting for us, with a very helpful and pleasant driver. Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great. We enjoyed our time in the lounge. Took a cab into San Diego proper for a few hours....15 bucks each way, so reasonable if you are not wanting to rent a car. I would highly recommend this airport property if you have a lay over or early flight. It was a great station for us to stay at for the night. One other note, we were not bothered by airport noise, but our room faced the Marina and not the airport. Stay here without hesitations.

Seeing as how I was only destined to sleep a few hours over two nights at this hotel, I elected to stay. The rooms were outdated, especially the bathroom. Lights above the mirror were about 5'8\" high, which wasn't conducive to a slightly taller person who has to shave. Fixtures were rusty, shower curtain was too long (about 4\" on the bath floor, inside the bath), and the sink was once-overed with crud collecting against the wall below the mirror. It was pretty much unacceptable and if I had arrived at a decent time or normal state of mind I would have definitely requested a room change. The on-site dining charged resort rates for food, which I feel based on the overall condition of things is overpriced. I did not order any of the food.

We were there for the graduation of my son from USMC boot camp, and the lights went out all over the entire city that afternoon. Literally, no one had power. We were there with our younger children, and I had so many concerns over where we would feed them, if we would even be able to check into the hotel, etc. The temperature that day was around 100 degrees. Well, we got to the Sheraton, and the line to check in was long because they only had 2 computers working off generators and all these people were trying to check in whose flights had been cancelled (it's right by the airport). The staff were walking around handing out water bottles to all of us and light sticks because there was no power in the rooms. The cold water was such a blessing and I just thought the light sticks were such a nice thing to do. Then, if you can believe it, they had a cold buffet set up in the dining area that evening that had cold cuts, cheeses, pasta salad, green salad, etc. I was so relieved to know my kids would get to eat! They had very few lights on, but the servers were friendly despite the circumstances they were working in, and the presentation offered was amazing considering they only had a short time to put this together and make sure their guests could have something to eat. I felt taken care of. Really. Of course the rooms had no lights, but it was clean and comfortable. The sun had gone down and we had a nice breeze from the bay through our balcony's sliding glass door, so it actually was cool in our room by the time we went to bed. The power came back on around midnight thankfully. In summary, as a mom being away from home in a city I didn't know with no power, with my young children, I can't say enough about how well taken care of I felt by the Sheraton.

The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment.

However, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay at this hotel. I never had an unplesant experience at a hotel ever. It all started the day after I checked in. That morning I had NO hot water. None whatsoever, not even warm or room temperature water, just COLD water. I took a nice cold shower! Then I went to the front desk and I got moved to a new room on the 6th floor. I was staying in the Bay tower. Then the water in the new room was not working either.I was then moved AGAIN to a new room, finally to room 697. Finally I got working hot water. The mechanic said the entire wing of rooms on the 6th floor lost hot water due to the line going into most of the rooms. The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some \"super duper\" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C.

The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you.

The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWish our 2 Nights were 20 !\u201d", "Author": "OBGAL", "ReviewID": "UR120632355", "Content": "We were attending a family wedding, and our room had been established for us for One night, we added a night to just relax after the wedding and take in the beauty of the area.

It is very near the airport and also very close to the reason for our trip Marine Corps Recruit Depot. We stayed in the bay tower portion of the hotel. The lobby was clean and desk help was exceptional! They informed us that the package we booked included breakfast all the days of our stay as well as a free shuttle to and from MCRD This by itself was a fantastic bonus! We asked for a higher floor and rather than bay view, we chose the marina view. Decorated in a nautical theme; the rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable, had an amply stocked mini bar and a large balcony to enjoy San Diegos beautiful weather and watch all the boats sail. The hotel was close enough to either take a taxi to Old Town for some sight seeing (which we really enjoyed)..or rent a car..which we also did..and took the short drive over to Coronado Island had some fantastic pizza, a little shopping and played on the beach.

It is a large, sprawling hotel (> 1,000 rooms) with a couple of towers and a sprawling \u2018resort\u2019 wing called Lanai . There is also a second tower (350 rooms) which is about a 10 minute walk along the marina from the main hotel. We were put in the \u2018Lanai\u2019, a wing that if you squint your eyes a little you would think is a Mexican Resort Hotel complete with aqua painted pools, palm trees and outdoor type \u2018hall ways\u2019. The main difference from Mexican resorts are the hot tubs associated with each pool and reliable hot water in the rooms. Our room was nice enough, it had been tastefully updated in the last several years so everything, except the bathtub, which hotels seem reluctant to update, was new. The tub was a little worn and corroded around the drain. The marble sink counter was also stained, a problem I have seen in other hotels with marble counter tops. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet except when the folks upstairs were moving around. In the tradition of expense account hotels things like WiFi and internet ($20/day) and parking ($30/day) cost extra not to mention the exorbitant cost of the contents of the mini bar, the restocking fees of the minibar and the fact that you can\u2019t use the minibar fridge for your own stuff. In addition the restaurant/breakfast buffet were expensive for what you got. That said the service was great, check in was fast, there is a shuttle that runs every ten minutes from the airport. If you are just flying in and out to a conference and you are on an expense account it is a great place to be. If you want to see the city, which is definitely worth seeing, then this hotel is definitely a bit out of the way, about a $15- 20 taxi ride. Public transportation in the vicinity of the hotel is negligible. The waterfront tourist attractions are about 3 miles away but there is a nice wide promenade type sidewalk between Harbour Drive, a main thorough fare, and the water if you are up to walking. So it wasn\u2019t a great location for a spouse along for the trip as was our case. The hotel also seems to be a bit of a staging place for folks who are going and coming from cruise ships. Probably it works well for them.

Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 \"experience adjustment\" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example).

You arrive and discover it's a friendly place with great accomodations and you are near the aiport. How convenient. But you are dismayed to learn you are away from the action of lovely San Diego and restricted, for meals, to the hotel's two restaurants -- a pub that is reasonably priced but cacaphonous and crowded and a luxurious but overpriced restaurant. You would like to see the sights of Dan Diego but you dont want to rent a car because your down time is restricted to evenings and periods when you are not in convention sessions. Here's how we dealt with it. 1. We requested the pub menu in the restaurant, so we got less expensive meals in refined surroundings. 2. If you are willing to stroll, you can go to three other resturants at the marina. We recommend the closest one, Island Prime, particularly its less expensive wing, Level C, It has a great view of the skyline and the service is friendly. They have a good wine tasting option and the Mud Pie ice cream is to die for (and big enough for six people). 3. Downtown San Diego is a $15 cab ride away including generous tip. But the best option is the inexpensive one. Take the Sheraton Shuttle to the airport and ask the driver to leave you at the MTS bus stop. The 923 bus goes to downtown San Diego ($2.25 per ride, $1.10 for seniors over 60). Once downtown you are in the Gaslight District and you can connect to other buses, including ones we took to Coronado and Balboa Park. 4. We loved Balboa Park. You can spend a whole day there at the zoo and museums. If you want to stretch your legs there are trails alongside. The whole experience is better than Epcot in our opinion. (For lunch try the Japanese Garden restaurant. Teryaki meat, fish and vegeratian over rice are yummy. $11 each with drinks) 5. The Gaslight District has terrific restaurants.

The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice.

The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print.

The rooms all have views; our preference is an end room with city view becuase we love to watch the planes arrive flying low over the city. Great area for walking around the marina; or riding bikes. It is quiet and beautiful and you can walk a mile or 8 miles; all in a safe and pretty area along the water. The food at club level was very good, attractive and crisp fruits and veggies; pita chips and hummus, small empanadas; well planned. You can order a cocktail in the club which is a plus in a place with as good a view as this I love being able to have a nice drink before going down to dinner.

During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a \"nice\" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as \"second-class\" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer. Bottom line, this Sheraton isn't terrible, but you can do much better.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClose to the airport but not close to anything else\u201d", "Author": "Kinezo23", "ReviewID": "UR119665826", "Content": "This was a nice hotel that is conveniently close to the airport.

On arriving in San Diego we waited for 30 mins for the shuttle to the hotel, but it never turned up - it was 11 PM though. We ended up getting a cab, not realising it is VERY close to the airport! The cab took us to the wrong section of the hotel, so after a bit of a walk we ended up in the main part of the hotel. Check in was quick and easy, but when we asked about food and drink they told us that the bar was about to close but you could get food there. We therefore skipped going to our rooms and had a few pints of Blue Moon and a steak burger and chips. Apparently since the recession hit there are very few hotels with 24 hour bars in the States - very frustrating! So at midnight I went and found my room, which was on the 11th floor and fell asleep. In the morning I took stock of the room. Two king size beds (nice, just for me!) smart decor, flat TV, coffee maker and reasonable bathroom - shower over bath. Nothing fantastic but all new and stylish. On opening the blackout curtains I had an interesting view of the airport, the carpark and alot of the marina. I love boats so I was happy. You could see a couple of battleships and an aircraft carrier from my room. There was also a little private balcony which was fab for smoking cigars on and for sunbathing - great suntrap! It is MUCH less noosy than one might expect. We had booked club rooms which meant that we had breakfast in the club lounge included. This is great since you get a good continental breakfast in the lounge, which is nice and relaxed with an AMZING view across the marina and out towards the sea. It is quite difficult to actually find and access but worth it when you arrive. One very good thing about the club lounge is that you get free wifi (you only get wired internet in the rooms) so I chatted to Mrs M-B and the kids via Skype and could show off the great views too. The club lounge is quiet and relaxing and if I was not at a conference I would have chilled out there most of the time. We din't eat in the hotel other than on the first night at the sports bar, but we did order many drinks from there. Annoyingly they do not deliver drinks to the outside flame pits where you could chill out in the sun - we had to constantly try and carry trays of drinks through doors and down stairs. They also don't allow glass outside, but we didn't find that out until the last day! The hotel is not exactly in the centere of town but it is very easy to get a cab to where ever you wanted to go, although they did add up eventually. It is nice and quick to get back to the airport (5 mins). If you have things to do, such as conferencing, or sitghtseeing, then this hotel is great. If you booked it just to chill out in the pool, I suspect that you would be a bit bored after the first day. Hopefully I will come back to San Diego, but if I was given the choice and I was a single traveller I would stay at the W Hotel which is more central and funkier.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel near the airport\u201d", "Author": "calalb", "ReviewID": "UR119461857", "Content": "6$ cab ride or free shuttle to airport.

There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work.

The next morning on the way to the conference, I mentioned the problem to the Front Desk and they advised they would send Maintenance to fix the problem. I returned to my room at lunch and found the thermostat was displaying in Celsius and the unit was blowing heated air (as in furnace). I called Guest Services who reported that Maintenance reported the problem as fixed. Guest Services scheduled a second visit from Maintenance and I went back to the conference. I returned to the room at dinner and found no evidence of a visit from Maintenance. I contacted Guest Services who advised they had not heard back from Maintenance and would send someone right away. I advised I would be back in the room around 8 PM and if the problem was not fixed the problem would be escalated to the manager. I returned at 8 PM and the problem was not fixed and the room was super hot. I contacted Guest Services who advised Maintenance was on their way. Fernando from Maintenance quickly arrived and within five minutes determined the unit was broken and would only blow heated air until it was repaired. Fernando contacted the Front Desk and advised them to move us to another room and send a bellhop up to assist in the move. I waited 30 minutes (sitting outside on the balcony to stay cool) and no bellhop. I walked down to the Front Desk and spoke with the manager Dana over the phone. Dana guaranteed the bellhop would be up quickly to assist us and she was researching ways to properly compensate me for my unnecessary troubles. We received a call from Sue at Guest Services asking how our new room was (by calling us in our old room?). We advised we are still waiting on a bellhop and keys to the new room. Sue advised she was working on a compensation package for us to make up for the full day off troubles. Thirty minutes later, I went back down to the front desk and received the keys to room 1172 and I moved myself into the new room. I did meet a maid as I was transferring to the new room that was sent to clean my old room (???). We never saw a bellhop, Sue from Guest Services never called back to offer compensation and Dana the manager never called back to offer compensation. During checkout, I had to argue my point as to why the hotel should remove a charge for a movie rental never finished in the old room.

Yes, that's right, we haven't even stayed at this hotel yet, but the experience thus far has not been very good. I called the hotel a week ahead of my scheduled stay (9/21/11) to make a request for a \"great room with a great view.\" Simple enough, right? First, let me tell you why I made this seemingly simple request. I'm planning on proposing to my girlfriend while in San Diego, and, of course, I want everything to go well...everything from the hotel to the restaurants to the proposal itself. I want it to be an experience. So I called up Sheraton reservations and was told that I would need to speak to the front desk reception, as I booked through a third party (Priceline). After being connected to the front desk, I explained that I am proposing to my girlfriend and want to get the best room for this experience. The woman I was speaking with seemed to care less. Don't get me wrong, she did the minimum of what she was asked to do, but she showed no real care. She explained that I was currently booked in the Bay Tower and could only stay on a floor no higher than the 4th. Really? She went on to explain that if I wanted a higher floor I would have to pay $20 extra per night. Ok..if that's what it takes, no problem. I mentioned to her that I had read lots of reviews saying the Bay Tower was not preferable and the main hotel was much better. She admitted that the Bay Tower was kind of far away, but it was quieter and the rooms were bigger. Ok...sounds fine, but I told her that I was concerned because of all of the reviews. So I asked what she would prefer if she were receiving a marriage proposal...which tower/room/view would she prefer. All she said was it is up to me what I want to do and she will make the request. This was less than friendly or personable, and it showed a real lack of caring. At any rate, I agreed to pay the $20 extra per night for a Bay Tower room \"above the 4th floor.\" I made a request for room on the 10th floor with a good view...so let's see if I get it. I hope the concierge is more caring and sincere, as I plan to ask him/her to have champagne waiting for us upon our return to the hotel after I propose. I will stop the review here for now.

The service at this hotel was horrible. The night before I arrived, I called to ask if the workstations had MS Office. They could not provide an affirmative answer. Only after I tweeted SPG did I get a firm answer (which is \"yes\" by the way). Every time my friends would call the lobby, the phone would ring endlessly -- literally. Sometimes, they wouldn't answer. I also signed up for green service, meaning they don't clean your room unless you specifically ask. Well, on Friday night, after I got through to the lobby after at least 8 rings, they said they'd remove me from green service and get my room cleaned on Saturday. Well -- that certainly didn't happen. That was just me. My friend, who was getting married, had a cocktail hour at BTL, the lounge in the Bay Tower, on Friday night. They tried to close early on her because they were shorthanded and the bartender had to get home to attend to a personal matter. I feel sorry for the bartender, but this is my friend's wedding! They have the reception in this very hotel and have a bunch of family/friends staying here. Provide a little service! The Marina Tower pool area is much larger and nicer than the one at Bay Tower.

Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous. And although the card next to the phone says in small print that direct dialed calls will be charged AT&T operator assisted prices, they forgot to mention \"bend over and look out!\" But if you don't use the room phone and make sure to read all of the fine print, it was a decent place.

We were hungry but there was no restaurant in the tower so we walked a few yards to a deli down the marina. Our room had two double beds, nothing special and not very comfortable (in my opinion). The bathroom was small but when we requested extra towels they were delivered immediately. We spent the afternoon in our private cabana at the pool which was fantastic. The only issue I have is in talking with some children in the pool, found out they and their family of at least 12 people, were \"pool crashers.\" Apparently that location is a regular spot for them! Later in the evening, we attended the Dive-in Movie at the pool which was fun. I thought the noise from the airplanes (right across the marina is SD airport) was very loud.

We booked on priceline and got the Sheraton SD Hotel and Marine for $81, plux tax, approximately $95 - NOT BAD! If I had paid the $169 rate plus tax, this would have been 2 stars for my liking. Valet - very nice and quick, but $30. Seriously? Are we in NY or SF? You can self park for $22. Check-inand Room- Again very nice, but slow. Although, the girl was new. Because I am a Starwood preferred guest, we were upgraded to the 10th floor overlooking the Marina and the pool which was excellent. The room was adequate the balcony was wonderful. I loved waking up in the morning, reading the paper and sipping on coffee while the sun broke thru the morning cloud layer, truly a fabulous way to start the day! I will say it was a long walk to the ice machine and there were no robes (which is unusual for preferred rooms in most hotels) neither were a big deal. Pool - It was right on the bay and in my opinion beautiful. Not because the pool is that great, but because how can you not love being on a pool, with great weather and on the water? From a nine year old perspective, \"it sucked\". Although, he seemed to enjoy it from the first two hours. But, soon became bored because there was no deep water, slide or other attractions to keep him busy. There were mostly younger kids here, but for a one or two night vacation, perfectly adequate for any age. Pool side service - Was sporatic. It took about twenty minutes to get a menu (2pm) and another twenty to come back for our order. But, once we ordered, the food was very quick and the service was friendly and very accomodating. The food is a mixed bag, my sons pizza was $12 (I think) and was a medium cheese pizza which was way above the standard I am use to for hotel pizzas. He ate half for lunch and the other half for dinner. GREAT VALUE!!!! I ordered a a lemon drink which was awful, but I ordered it that way, so my bad. I was hungry and ordered the fish burrito which was terrible, I couldn't eat it. In all fairness, I was raised in SD and we are home of the Fish Taco, so I should have known better. Oh well. Game Room - Game room, hmmmm. Not exactly what we expected, but turned out ok. The \"game room\" was a room inside the gym that had a wii in it with not really anything games other than the standard package. Also, the parents need to be in the room supervisng the kids at all times (I get that), but wasn't really how I wanted to spend the day, so we moved on to upstairs. This was FABULOUS! My friend joined me at the bar for a glass of vino while my son played the complimentary Xbox with kids that were coming into the lobby (he was 10 feet from me). This entertained him for two hours and he made new friends. Tapatini Tapas & Martini Bar - I have mixed reviews on this. Scott was attentive and was good with all the clients. There seems to be a mix of regulars here which is nice. They come in for dinner and drinks from their boats. My one complaint which is HUGE is the food. Scott recommended the beef skewers, which I was not in the mood for. His second recommendation was the scallops. I should have known better not to order a scallop tapa from a hotel bar - dumb on me. The scallops were good size, 3 on the plate with I believe walnuts and currants on the bottom, a ton of them. It was super sweet, totally gross and the scallops were rubber. I took one bite, disgusting. But, I took a sip of wine and tried another small bite - even more disgusting. The scallops sat in front of me for an hour until I paid the check. Really? I put my napking over them and my fork and knife, isn't this a subtle enough hint to take them from me and maybe ask me if I want something else? Guess not. My son was having such a good time with one of his new friends I asked them if they would like dessert. They both ordered the apple tart and Hagan Daaz icecream. They were like $11 or $12 each. I'm find with that, but neither of them had more than a bite of the tart and said it was too much crust. I tasted it, yep, not awful, but definitely not worth the money. I didn't complain about that either. As long as my son is happy, I am happy! Here is the funny thing though - when I said it was time to go, neither the new friend or the friends dad thanked either Alec or I for the dessert or said goodbye.....really? Here is why I probably wouldn't stay at the hotel again, but only because I am addicted to my computer and the internet. No wi-fi in the rooms and you have to pay $11.95 to be tethered to the desk to get internet there. The positive is it is absolutely free downstairs and it is very good and a wonderful seating area that even provides computers. If you are on vacation here, this should not be a drawback.

Now, the cons--as noted by other reviewers--the hotel is isolated. If you want to see San Diego, you will need to rent a car, and if you rent a car, you will have to pay the outrageous (in my view) parking fees--$22 per day for self park, $28 for valet. I would prefer to stay some place where I could walk to restaurants and shopping. Secondly, in-room internet is costly, although wi-fi is free in the lobby. Finally, the food and drinks in the on site restaurants were mediocre and way over priced, and the restaurants and bar always seemed to be understaffed. I spent two nights checking out restaurants in the Gaslight District. I would recommend taking a cab rather than driving, as parking was scarce and very $$$.

Long since there was only one person waiting on guests checking in. In fact, we rarely saw more than one or two people at the reception desk, therefore there was always a long line of tired travelers. Our room was still not ready so we were given a room with the city view, which is very nice but faces the airport and freeway so is substantially noisier. Back to the line for another 10-15 minute wait. Can we wait for our original room, we ask? There was no record of our original request. Okay, so we head out for dinner, the parking gate was not working properly. Back to the line. They explained there's something wrong with the computers and to just use the assistance button at the gate. Later after dinner, can't get into our room. Back to the line. My husband gets two new cards and we are assured they work. Breakfast in the club room the next day. Can't get up with our cards. Back to the line.

This is a very nice hotel with two towers that are very different from each other. Depending on your tastes and needs it is important you are given a room in the appropriate tower. The main tower is called the Marina Tower. This is where you will find the main lobby, bars and restaurants. This is also where you will find Starbucks (open 5:30 for us early risers). The main pool is here as well. This is also where you will find the majority of the noise and commotion associated with a large resort like hotel. The smaller Bay tower is located a 5 minute walk away. It too has a bar and restaurant and pool, but everything in the Bay Tower is on a smaller scale. I found it to be perfect for my needs. The rooms are large and well appointed. I found my room to be clean. I asked for a higher floor and was placed on 11. My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity. The opposite side faces the bay and some might prefer that view. If you are worried about sleeping noise the airport is quiet at night and I slept very well. I made the walk between the two towers several times a day and found that I enjoyed it very much. Had the weather been bad I might not have felt that way. I did rent a car while here and found the hotel close enough to all the attractions. You can self park your car if you want to. The Bay tower is much closer to the car park. There are 2 restaurants off the hotel property which are walkable. The first is The Lighthouse and it is very good (I highly recommend it and you will need a reservation). The second, The Boat House, is closer but I found the food and service to be terrible. This is a very nice hotel which can offer two different experiences at the same time.

If I had to give it a review it would be more like 2.5 instead of 3. It wasn't the best I've stayed but at the same time it wasn't the worst. A few of my thoughts: 1) The major perk of staying there is that it is close to the San Diego International Airport. The hotel does offer a free shuttle from the airport however when I called the customer service representative stated that it runs every 20 minutes. It took them longer than that. The hotel that I stayed while in San Diego previously they told me that their shuttle would be there in 10 minutes and that they were leaving so I didn't have to wait that long. 2) When I arrived at 3pm there was a line of 4 people. There was two people assisting other people and about 20 minutes later somebody came to assist. Thankfully, I am a patient person. I was told from a phone call from me that I could add $20 a night for breakfast, internet access and hor d'oeuvres so I paid additional money to get that. 3) I really loved my room. The bathroom was perfect for 1 to 2 people but it would be crowded for 3 or more people. The bed was comfortable. The view of the marina was nice and I did get an upgrade with a balcony. The big screen was nice and there was a lot of room for my clothes (a closet and drawer set). There was a desk and chair. The coffee pot for two cups is a nice touch. I wished there was a refrigerator and microwave. 4) The thing that irritated me is the fact that the hotel DOES NOT have wifi. I was told at checking out that it is something they are working on getting but it's something that they have been working on for 2 years. There is a dial up connection. On Thursday night when I tried to get the dial up set up the cord was frayed so I requested to get a new one. It took three phone calls to get them to bring me up a new one. That is unacceptable customer service. I also called because the hair dryer wasn't working. That also took three phone calls. I didn't get any of this fixed until Friday Night. 5) The breakfast they serve was very basic. Everyday I was there they offered: A) Turkey, Ham, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese. B) Hard boiled eggs C) Muffins, Croissants, White & Whole Wheat Bread, Bagels (There is a toaster) D) Decaf & Regular coffee, Tea, Orange Juice, Grapefruit juice and two others that look suspicious to me. There is sugar and artificial sweeteners. E) The waiters were very personable & helpful. F) The $20 extra I paid for included breakfast and hor d'oeuvres. The snacks was only for between 5 - 8pm. The snacks was basically the same as breakfast except they had small size burritos and cheese quiche. I only went there twice and it was good but it would of been nice to see them spice things up a bit. 6) It was convenient to have the shuttle to get to leave for the airport on Sunday. However, to take a cab to downtown San Diego will cost you about $30 round trip. For Comic Con there was a shuttle to get to the convention center which was free but to get back to the hotel you really need take a cab especially if you are staying out late. It was very easy to catch a cab at the hotel because there is a stand for them and the valet escorts was very quick to get me a cab. 7) The heated pool and hot tub is clean and very comfortable to go swimming in. Overall, it was good but not excellent. I am planning on going to Comic Con next year but next time I will stay in a hotel that is closer to the convention center which means I will have to pay more money but it would be worth it due to the near $200 I spent on getting a cab back to the hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cYou Kidding?

The receptionist Juan was checking us into the hotel, and he told us our room was \"not ready\" and all the other \"ready\" rooms were full. This is totally unacceptable, given the fact that we were checking in 12 midnight, which gives them 12 hours of room cleaning time and the hotel is only 12 floors tall. Afterwards Juan's manager gave us this room on the first floor, which was really the basement because the lobby is on the second floor. Our room had traces of insects, because the first thing i found was a dead bug on my pillow. Although the room looked clean, you never know what is on the carpet. On the next day we took a walk around the marina, and the only good thing about this hotel is the view (which we didn't get, thanks to Juan and his manager) and the presence of a Starbucks next to the lobby. We are truly disappointed with Sheraton with this stay. I thought an elite international hotel chain like Sheraton could have done better with their customers. We paid over $200 for our room and we didn't expect poor service and a basement room with dead insects. I have stayed in other Sheraton hotels and the rooms and service are on a higher level.

I stayed with my wife and yo ungest daughter while my oldest daughter and her husband joined two days later. Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel! I can tell you that not only will I ONLY seek out this hotel every visit I have to San Diego, but because of this team, I have become a Sheraton Evangelist all over! I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen! And because of the service of other members of their team it reflects their value and class of care from the management on down. It may be a four star hotel, but in my book it was at least 5 stars!

The Sheraton Marina had none of the above. We stayed in the second, smaller and definitely second rate Bay Tower. The rooms were fine apart from the noise of the ice machine across the corridor all through the night. It was unclear just how close the airport was from the web site (literally behind the hotel), so noise levels were unexpected. The lobby staff were miserable, we were never greeted with a smile and when I called guest services with a query about coins needed for the laundry, the guy said he didn't know and left it at that! Great training and service (not)! The public areas need serious upgrading and the bar and restaurant area was uninviting and dead most of the time. The pool was appalling - small with a bar area that was closed when we were there and seriously out of date. We felt like poor relations to the guests in the main tower where lobby, bar and pool areas were far superior. Not sure if the staff also felt miserable to be working in the second rate tower, but their indifference to service and general apathy was very disappointing after the high standards we had experienced through the rest of our trip.

We liked the look of the Sheraton and marina, but were aware that it was some distance from the downtown area, so we had to factor in extra cost for cabs and plan our days' events. The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service. All of the staff that we met - front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, valets, cleaning - were extremely friendly and helpful.

Exceptionally clean with 42\" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social/computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most 4 star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $12-16 range. Although parking is $22, this is the same if not less than what many 3 star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $36. Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city. Although only 2 miles from the heart of downtown, it is on a peninsula and a little detached from anything other than the marina and airport.

At $22 a day, which again we realize parking is always going to be high and we spent $22 at the next hotel we stayed at on this vacation, although that was for valet parking. The lot that you park in is a dirt lot that is easily 1/2 mile from your room while they are allowing non-guests to also park in the lot for a fee which makes it even more difficult to find a spot.

We walked down to the desk and were told that there was a problem with our enitre floor's keys and they would send someone up. Not exactly sure why they didn't have someone stationed on our floor to let everyone in if they knew there was a problem. Fifteen minutes later someone finally showed up to let us in. Meanwhile, a couple down the hall had no problem getting in their room - so much for the entire floor having problems. We were told it would be fixed. The next day we were getting ready to leave in the morning, trying to catch the city bus on time. I forgot something in the room and ran upstairs to grab it. But the key still didn't work.

From reading other entries, I realized that I should request the Bay Tower, which I understand the rooms are a little older (although recently renovated) and a little bigger. We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby.

I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11.

My room was located in the Bay tower which is not connected to the main hotel where most of the amenities are located. It was a 3-4 minute walk to the other tower where the pool, main restaurant, Starbucks and fitness room were located. This ended up working fine for me as I was only staying one night and just walked to the main area, however if I was booking a longer stay I would request a room in the main tower.

The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name). Sheraton should take more care in training their entire staff to meet the needs of their guests, especially their managers.

I paid almost $300/night to stay here and it is only worth $90. This hotel is directly across from the airport, meaning that you are kept up all night and early morning by the booming of planes taking off and landing. I reserved a high rise water view with a king bed. While I did receive a high level room with a view of the water, the water was across 2 parking lots and a street, and again right next to the airport. Not a relaxing view. On top of that I got 2 small double beds instead of a king that would in no way fit 2 adults. When I asked at check-in I was told that even though I had reserved my room 3 months before, they overbooked and were out of the rooms I had reserved. They did not offer many any compensation. There is no wireless in the rooms, and if you would like to use the plug in it is $13 day. Since it is across from the airport it is also near absolutely nothing, so unless you want to eat overpriced mediocre food at the hotel restaurant you will need to pay an expensive roundtrip cab to for all your meals or activities. I also tried asking the concierge about getting to downtown and what to do and was met with a snide comment about taxis being outside. The positives were that the rooms were kept clean, the bed was comfortable (if only one person slept in each bed), they had a good hair dryer, and their was a complimentary van to the airport (although not to downtown which would have been highly desirable). Overall I would NEVER stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Accounting told me that the items in the mini bar are sensored, so if you remove an item (to read the label in my case) you will automatically be charged for it. Apparently the 'sensors' are to stupid to know when you've replaced the item back in its place. Anyway as a 'courtesy' I was credited back for the other 3 items I had been charged for - wow thanks guys.

We were allocated a room on the marina side and the views were quite serene and pleasant especially in the morning \u2013 the Coronado bridge, ships, and bay were nice to view . A few things to note: internet in the rooms is not included and neither is self \u2013 parking for $22. Parking we can somewhat understand as that is typically part of a nicer hotel stay but we feel the rate is rather elevated. The internet fee, however, is in our opinion outdated and unnecessary. We would venture to guess that a charge for the net may result in loss of business. Also, the refrigerator in the room is for their food and drinks only. Do not remove any of it to store your items as some sensor will automatically charge the removed items to your bill. Just some info\u2026 Overall, we would recommend this Sheraton because of the friendliness and customer service, clean and spacious room, and nice views. We would stay there again.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

We used Priceline's \"name your price option\" and this was the hotel that was chosen and we paid through priceline.com. We went to check in and it was clear that the Front Desk could care less about her job and she handed us a key packet. We then soon find out that pricing is $22 dollars PER DAY for parking in their lot (and that is \"self park\"). Then, we realized that there are two 'towers' and the front desk associate never told us where we were suppose to park, which tower the room was in or how to get there. We finally found the room, got settled in, and pulled out the laptop to look up ideas for places to go, only to find out that it costs 12.95 PER DAY to use the internet in your room. Seriously, what hotel does not have complimentary internet?! Hole in the wall hotels even do!!! On the morning of check-out we got a bill under our door. The bill showed a $16 charge for \"Other Hotel Charges\". I called down to the desk and explained to the front desk lady that we paid for this room on Priceline so we should not have any charges on the room. She precedes to say that even though we paid for the room and tax through Priceline, we still had to pay some tax to them as well. I was a hotel manager so I know this was bull, but just to make sure that it wasn't some weird CA tax, I called the Holiday Inn down the street from the Sheraton and asked if there would be any additional tax charges if I booked my room online, which they obviously said NO. So, I went down to the desk and spoke to a different person and explained that we should not have any room/tax charges because we booked it through Priceline. She took the receipt, did some stuff on her computer, and handed us a new receipt with the charges taken off...without saying what those charges were actually for. The only think I could think of is that they try to stick you will just another hidden fee and try to pass it off as \"tax\". And, guess what? It doesn't end there..... We get home and look at our bank statement and it shows that 16 dollar fee CHARGED!! We were furious. We called the front desk and they transferred us to the accounting department. The accounting department said that they would send us a new receipt showing the \"breakdown\" of why we were charged, but that there were 3 people ahead of us so the email probably wouldn't go out until the next day! Are you kidding me?! Wow.

Not my kind of hotel, but acceptable when there's no better choice. I stayed here because everything else was booked because of 2 conventions in town. But my biggest beef is the deceitful \"bait & switch\" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the \"property\" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main building\u2014but you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harbor\u2014facing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main \"Marina Tower\"\u2014not the second-rate \"Bay Tower.\" This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good place\u2014but I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor.

Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way!

Yes, the hotel is not in the downtown area. But, there are two buses that stop a five minute walk away that go directly to downtown. As well, there is a nice walking path (that is safe) that is about 4 km to the heart of the city. I only took one cab the entire visit. There are lovely running trails right out of the hotel.The gym was fantastic as well. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and polite. I also found the service in the bar area to be superb. Room service was expensive, but that is to be expected. The room was spacious and clean, although I could not be given a king bed because I had made the booking on priceline. I would advise anyone who is a light sleeper to choose to stay on the marina side. The side that overlooks the city is closest to the airport and was quite noisy on my first night. But, the front desk let me change rooms after the fist sleepless night. There were some cons to this place. The hotel is promoting this \"green\" concept that is supposed help the environment with reducing waste with washing of linens. If you sign up for this program, you get a five dollar voucher to use at the hotel in return for not getting your sheets and towels washed. I felt this program was pushed on me and I felt bad declining it. What they do not mention is that \"going green\" means that housekeeping doesn't even enter your room for your stay. My garbage was loading up and I put them outside of my room to get emptied, only for them to completely disappear. As well, there are complimentary teas in the room that would normally be topped up if housekeeping was in daily. Because they weren't, I had to get my own tea from Starbucks which was how I ended up spending my five dollar voucher. I'm all for going green, but I believe this is just a ploy for the hotel to save money on staff and cleaning rather than saving the environment. All I was left with was a dirty room with an unmade bed. I will not be doing this initiative in the future. I will just ask housekeeping not to change the sheets and keep my towels on the racks. My second complaint was when I switched rooms the first night because of the airplane noise, I ended up being in a room that had a door directly connecting my suite to another suite. I could hear practically every breath of the people next door, some of which was quite embarrassing. Make sure you request a room without a door connection in it. It is really kind of archaic and I did not feel safe as I was travelling alone and the door only had a cheap looking lock on it. All in all, I paid 75 dollars a night for the room. I got what I paid for. Nothing more, nothing less.

Floor #1 is for pool, gym, etc - its elevator bank is located far away from main bank of elevators but no signage at main elevator bank to this effect. Rode up + down main elevators for a while (where there is a floor #1 marked on the panel) but it would not stay lit . Needless crazy making when a few clearer signs would help. Though a nice idea in theory, hors d'oeurves offered in Club Level evening reception Tues-Thursday (gratis though bar charges for drinks) were marginal, a polite word for almost inedible. I have a caste iron stomach and they gave me indigestion!

On the other hand, being an aircraft fan as I am, you will appreciate the close view to the starting and landing aircrafts from your balcony. There is no noise though if you keep the balcony doors closed. Bad things - 22 $ parking charge a night. No complimentary internet. Quite a distance to the city.

Pros: \u2022Beautiful lobby in Marina Tower \u2022Excellent and helpful staff. Special Kudos to Scott and Bryan at Tapatini bar. We had a great conversation with them and they gave us some great advice on restaurant choices (don\u2019t let this review add to your narcissism Scott \uf04a ) \u2022Excellently maintained grounds.

Cons: \u2022Bathrooms in the Bay Tower are VERY small and have no exhaust fan. \u2022Walls are thin and you can easily hear what is going on in hall and other rooms. \u2022No free internet access in room\u2026Really? It\u2019s 2010. You can pay for access, so it\u2019s available\u2026but not free. How about joining the 21st Century Sheraton?? \u2022The Harbor restaurant was WAY overpriced for the d\u00e9cor. Does anyone really want to pay $30+ for dinner and sit in a restaurant that looks like an outdated Long John Silver? Obviously not, I saw maybe 2 couples eating there the entire time.

There was a huge red stain on the carpet when we walked in. The people in the room next to us were so loud we could just about hear their whole conversation.

It took a good 10 minutes for the shower to drain before the next person could shower.

The pool, whirlpool and fitness room are far superior to the Bay hotel. This hotel fronts a very upscale marina. pricing for items like food reflect this.

The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it \"ain't gonna happen.\" They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday.

The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, and pretty close to downtown (about a $12.00 cab fare), yet the setting by the marina and bay give one the feeling of being in a private oasis. I had a sixth floor room with a view of the harbor (and airport) and despite the fact I could see planes taking off, it felt very peaceful. Saturday night I was even able to watch the fireworks at Seaworld from my (nice sized) balcony! The room itself was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only negative remark I could make is that the size of the bathroom was a little small, not that of a four star hotel. Both mornings I used room service for breakfast and the meals were great, delivered timely and fresh. Coffee in the room is Starbucks and delicous and super easy to make. Directly across the street from the hotel is a walking path along the bay. It's lovely and is a great place to unwind and watch the boats and take in a terrific view of the San Diego skyline. I also walked over to the Marina building checked out the lobby, pool, grabbed an ice tea at the Starbucks and sat on a veranda there for a bit - very pleasant!

The pickup from the airport was smooth and sure enough we were put in the bay tower which I had heard was worse than the marina tower. We had several air crew in the shuttle with us and they were directed to the marina tower so we felt a natural discrimination towards us the priceline customers. oh well. The bay tower was not bad surprisingly enough. It was a very pleasant less than 5 minute walk from the marina to the bay tower and our room was on the 10th floor with a nice view of the marina. Seriously, sitting outside on the balcony in the morning and drinking my coffee was a nice start to the day. We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win. The shuttles from the hotel drop you to the airport and then you can take the car shuttle from there to the car lot.

Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, \"This is nice\", or \"This goes above & beyond a normal hotel\", or basically, \"Wow, this is fancy!\" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27\" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a \"business center\" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a \"business center\", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying \"Wow this is fancy\". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience.

Also this place is across the street from the San Diego International Air Port. You can hear every departure (they start early and so will you!).

Ping Pong tables are situated in the \"Game room\" which has two ping pong tables and a non-functional coin-operated pool table.

I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion.

That was the most disgusting experience of my life. Not only was the stench overwhelming but we found rodent feces in the bedsheets.

Everyone greeted me when I passed them and always looked me in the eye which made me feel like they were really focused on me. The ambiance of the hotel was lovely. The comfortable seating areas in the lobby were great for socializing and relaxing. There were computers available for guests which helped me a great deal. The decks and patios were lovely to sit on to gaze at the beautiful view of the marina. In the evening it was so nice to sit outside at one of the fire pits and relax in a rocking chair in the cool San Diego night air. My room was on the ground floor which made me a little nervous because of the sliding glass door. Therefore, I didn't open the drapes. I would have liked to have let light in but it was too easy for anyone to see inside the room since I faced the parking lot. I would have preferred a view of the marina and a room higher up. However, the room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and had a cheerful decor. I was surprised that being so close to the airport, I rarely heard a plane. Maybe being downstairs was a plus!

We got the \"Romance Package\" and stayed in the Marina Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, very clean and had a picture postcard view of Downtown San Diego. We were even impressed that we barely heard the planes taking off and landing at the San Diego Airport which is just about 1/4 mile away. The bed was very comfortable. We slept so well. Also, the newly decorated room was very nice. Probably most important for us was that they welcomed our dog with no added charge and no fuss. Sure they wanted us to be responsible for our little guy, but it was nice that we felt welcome. There was even a very nice restaurant on the island called the \"C-Lounge\" that welcomed him on their patio. The view of the city at night was breathtaking from the restaurant's vantage point. Now back to the Romance Package, it was a great value. The complementary \"breakfast in bed\" EACH DAY was impressive. We ordered off of the menu what we wanted and had deliciously prepared FULL breakfasts delivered to the room both days we stayed there. Then on our anniversary night we got a complementary bottle of champagne and 6 huge chocolate covered strawberries. Finally, they offered us a very late checkout of 4pm, which we gladly used. We enjoyed every minute of time just relaxing on one of the two balconies overlooking the city, sail boats and Navy ships on the bay. The only downsides were that daily self-parking was $22.00 and in-room high speed internet was $11.95 per day (up to $18.95 for super fast internet). NO WIRELESS IN ROOM, BUT FREE WIRELESS IN THE LOBBY. This is pretty steep compared to other properties we've stayed at. But we felt that, given the total value of the package we booked, it was ok.

We just returned from a 3 night stay at this property, at which I'd reserved the AAA 'Hot Deals' rate which includes an upgrade to a deluxe room and $50.00 food/beverage credit per day. I printed the confirmation which stated our rate of $159.00 per night was for a room in the Bay Tower, along with the upgrade/credit Terms associated with that AAA deal. When we arrived, I was given the keys to a room in the Lanai section of the hotel (basically, out in the boondocks .. obviously an older part of the hotel and on the ground floor). I asked about the Bay Tower room on my confirmation and was informed the hotel was100% booked and it was all they had. I could check the next day for an upgrade. It was somewhat late (9:45pm) and we were exhausted - - so we went to the room. It was clean, and decorated in a crisp nautical decor .. but the ceiling seemed lower than normal, giving it a cavelike feel and the windows opened up to the back of the green tarp surrounding the tennis courts and a rooftop full of steam vents, etc. peaking over that. The extremely bright lights of the tennis courts were a nuisance. The showerhead was impressive looking.. the size of a dinner plate! ...but the water pressure was pitiful. I couldn't believe we'd paid $159.00 .. plus $22.00 parking and taxes, amounting to about $200.00 a night - for this! I've gotten some pretty decent rooms through Priceline for less than half that at other hotels. Ugh. The next morning, I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. They had a room available in the Marina Tower, 7th floor...which sounded like a drastic improvement over the room we spent the night in. My husband and teenage daughter were off taking sailing lessons in the harbor for Father's Day .. so I decided to take the room and move our stuff so they could be happily surprised at the end of their day. Silly me, I asked if there could be SOME sort of compensation .. perhaps a comp. day of parking? .. for my troubles and the fact that we were actually downgraded instead of upgraded - - but the gentleman said the parking is separately owned and he couldn't discount it. Terrible customer service, in my opinion. After getting all of our belongings into the new room, I noticed the air conditioner was not working! Aaaggghh!!! I called maintenance not once, but twice .. and after 2 hours of waiting - - the guy arrived and quickly fixed it. At that point I was just relieved to not have to move again. LOL. Now for some positives .. the hotel itself has a very appealing ambiance with the nautical decor and gorgeous views of the water, boats, etc. The pool area is nice as well, with rock work and waterfalls and daily activities for the kids. The restaurant food was good, although pricey ($68.00 for breakfast for the 3 of us, $20.00 for a plate of chicken nuggets/fries and a soda) and is set along an expansive wall of windows overlooking the harbor as well. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, so at least there's an option for something less expensive. The rooms are comfortable and fresh, lovely views (from the tower rooms..haha) but be prepared to hear the sound of jets taking off at the airport which is in very close proximity. The Fitness Center is large, lots of equipment. And next to that are a couple of ping pong tables .. which people seemed to be enjoying every time I was in the gym. The parking lot is also a big negative. WAY too small for such a large property. If you go down one aisle and can't find a spot, it is blocked on one end and you have to actually back up to exit to look down the next aisle! Two out of the three nights, we returned after going into town - - only to find NO parking available except for way out on the Lanai side of the hotel. We had to walk all the way through that section to the Marina Tower to our room. Shoulda stayed in the cave, I guess. Last, but not least, when we received our bill on the last day - - the $50.00 per day food/beverage credit was nowhere to be found.

We tried Quinn's, and enjoyed it, but more, really enjoyed several meals at Papanani's, a little deli/eatery located between the two towers (the prices were very low, food was excellent, and the ambiance was incredible). Additionally, half-way through the week, we found that we had to extend our stay a day; the hotel was very accommodating and gave us the conference rate for the extra day. Parking is a little steep for us East Coasters ($22/day), but we found fairly cheap fares in the shuttles and vans available to hotel guests. Very conveniently located across the interstate from the airport; however, while inside the hotel room itself, we could not hear planes taking off and landing.

The first one I got a room miles from the main tower right next to the swimming pool pump room. The second time I got a room overlooking the parking lot. I was at a convention then, so it wasn't really a big deal, but this was a nice getaway with my hubby. Thanks to other reviews, I knew to ask for the Marina Tower with a Harbor view. I did not use the automated check in system just so that I could request a room with a view. The check in chick was really friendly and gave us a room on the 9th floor facing west over the harbor and marina. The sunsets were fantastic and hubby and I even ordered room service one night just so we could enjoy the view. The room was decorated in a red, white and blue nautical theme. It was very tasteful. We had breakfast one day in the restaurant. It was really nice and we had a nice window table by the marina. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very efficient. The price was less expensive than I thought it would be. There was a rude dude at the table next to us watching sports on his laptop and talking on his cel phone. We asked him nicely to turn down his computer or use an earpice. He continued to talk on his cell phone. I can't believe these kind of people, but it isn't really a reflection on the hotel. All of the hotel staff seemed exceptionally nice. We even observed some staff trying to help out the UK guests in accomodating them with additional nights and telling them what parks and other places were offering free or reduced admissions for them because of the volcano and ash that caused them to have to stay longer. All in all, I wish I could relive my weekend again in exactly the same way (minus the rude dude at breakfast). The only thing I didn't like was having to pay for parking. I was prepared for it as my reservation clearly stated the price of parking. $22/day isn't bad if it's a covered parking garage, but for a parking lot it's kind of steep, especially when we had to park way out in the dirt/gravel.

The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a \"spa\" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you. Either way, it's in beautiful San Diego, and that's all that matters!!!!!

When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English.

It\u2019s really pointless to pay for valet when the valet parking lot is right beside the standard lot. I know paying to park is pretty standard in SD, but $22/day is just getting up there.

Got both for around $70, one at Hilton Gaslamp (which was GREAT) and one here. First, it has been noted in the reviews that they treat Priceline/Hotwire customers differently. I also found this to be true -- and I think it is a silly way to do business, since we are more likely (in my opinion) to go squawk about our experiences on the internet. But anyway... Yes, we were placed in the Bay Tower, which they called the West. We were on the fourth floor -- which was really the third -- and we overlooked the parking lot. Lovely. Yes, there was some water and city views beyond, but with the parking lot three floors below it is hard to enjoy. Tried to take a dip after check-in at 8:30 PM... all towels gone and the pool a bit murky. The room looked nice, but had a few issues. One, there was no information in the room about the hotel services, cost of internet, location of amenities -- nothing. We had to call to find out about all of these things. Do they charge for the coffee and tea? I still don't know. Though I do know that if you put personal items in the minifridge they will charge you a $25 cleaning fee. Really. Two, and I have not seen this mentioned here before, but the duvet, while attractive, weighed about two hundred pounds. The only way I can imagine sleeping with it would be if the room was ice cold --- which brings us to problem three. I set the air conditioner on the coldest possible setting and it was still relatively balmy in there. Could only sleep with a sheet, and it was very hard to sleep. Four, the toilets flush with incredible force, which is fine... but you also hear all the toilets flushing in all neighboring rooms. All night. Five, of course, the parking is a racket. The existence of this hotel would make me nervous to do Priceline for San Diego again. And finally, I didn't take it seriously, but the Bay Tower really is far, far away from the Marina tower. I think it is disingenuous for them to both be a part of the same hotel since they are so separate.

We had an awesome experience but only after we did some tweaking of our room location. We booked through Hotwire at a rate of $114 and upon arriving at the Marina Tower (there are two towers - the Marina and the Bay - around the corner from each other) the valet politely informed us we were in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews we expected this as it appears the Bay Tower is used for their Hotwire and Priceline customers. We arrived in the beautiful Bay lobby and were informed our \"standard\" room was either on the first floor in the back of the tower facing the marina or on the second floor in the front of the tower which was level with the parking lot. We choose to look at the first floor room and found a very large, very clean room with floor to ceiling windows that didn't open, a walkway right outside the windows and a beautiful view of the marina. The second story room, although we didn't go into the room, had a balcony but looked right onto the parking lot and then the bay. We didn't like the idea of feeling trapped with windows that didn't open, the lack of privacy with a walkway just outside the windows or staring at cars so we asked for a room higher up. We were informed we were only entitled to a first or second story room and that we'd need to pay $20 a night (plus taxes) to move up. We decided to upgrade and asked to be moved to the Marina tower. The Bay Tower's rooms are large, the pool is very nice, and there's free wi-fi in the lobby, a breakfast room and a business center. The two towers are about a 5 minute walk around the marina and is quite lovely. Perhaps in bad weather it would not be so pleasant. The Bay Tower is a lot quieter if that's what you are looking for. The Marina Tower is where the action is. Our Marina Tower room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool and the marina. FABULOUS! The small balcony was wonderful and when we closed the sliding doors we could barely hear the airplanes. The room was large (not quite as large as the Bay Tower), very clean, beautifully decorated, and with a good sized bathroom. We enjoyed Happy Hour and a beautiful sunset at the Shoreline Restaurant next to the pool, then dinner at Quinn's, the pub that overlooks the pool and marina. The pub had decent prices and good food and wasn't dark like you'd expect a pub to be. There were two billiard tables for their customers to use. There are two pools in the Marina tower, the main one which is large and next to the Shoreline and the other is smaller and quieter. There are hamocks to relax on and rocking chairs around a fire pit. Harbor Island is flat so it's great for walking and running. I rented a bike one morning ($7 an hour, 4th hour free) and totally enjoyed riding along the water to the Star of India, USS Midway and Seaport Village. I felt very safe as I never had to be on the road with the cars and it only took 25 minutes to get to Seaport Village. The $20 upgrade was well worth it as we loved our room and the view it offered. The elevators were slow, in fact two of the days one of the elevators was being working on but we didn't mind much. We enjoyed the free US Today newspapers and the Starbucks coffee and tea in the rooms. Parking is $22 a night but it seems to be the going rate in the downtown area. We've stayed at other downtown hotels and have paid that amount and more to park. If you don't have a car taxis are readily available (at least at the Marina Tower, I'm not sure about the Bay Tower). Being right next to the airport would be very handy if you have an early morning flight as the Sheraton has a free shuttle, doesn't feel like an airport hotel and yet you are so close. The only negative thing I can say about the Sheraton was how they initially made us feel since we booked with Hotwire. My husband and I have booked a number of hotels through Hotwire and never before have we been made to feel \"cheap\" or told \" . . because you booked through Hotwire . . .\" Our past experience is that if a hotel has available rooms it will upgrade us at no charge and there's never any mention of who we booked through. It appears that Sheraton sets aside the least desirable rooms for their \"cheap\" customers, in fact the entire first floor of the Marina tower had different lighting and lower ceilings than the other halls. I think the only windows that don't open are those on the first floor on the Bay Tower so that's why they are given to the Hotwire and Priceline customers. All in all, a great experience and we will come back.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable with GREAT views!\u201d", "Author": "Lorio", "ReviewID": "UR36178683", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for five days in July as a quick summer get-a-way - I do love this hotel because of the location by the marina and it has more of a resort feel.

Not only were we not within walking distance of anything but we had no public transportation options other than a taxi at $25-30 round trip to the Gaslamp. As an added pleasure the hotel charges a $22 to self park. A great example of going broke saving money. Having said that the hotel would be great for the business traveler who just needs an over night stay or has an early morning flight.

The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options.

We arrived on a 12pm flight and I was worried we'd be waiting around until 3 or 4 to check-in. I had called ahead a couple days and spoke with Melissa. She informed me we could use the pool and enjoy the hotel while we waited if our room was not ready. We were allowed to change in the Spa area and let our kids swim a while. I rented a large blow-up alligator for an hour ($7) that was their highlight. . .we only had it an hour before I received a call on my cell phone that our room was ready (it was shortly after 1pm!) I was very happy for the early check-in and even more happy to find we'd been upgraded to a two-story townhouse room in the Lanai building. The pool rental place let us return the gator and said we could return later to use up the remain hour I had paid for. There were a few downsides. After swimming a bit we arrived to our room barefoot and found the floor was quite damp. I can only imagine it had recently been shampooed. The doors to the outside had about a 2\" gap between the bottom and the floor, plenty of room for bugs and such to crawl in but we were lucky and had none. Then there were two balconies. . the wood in dire need of staining and new chairs (current ones were old and dirty). Other then that we enjoyed having the downstairs for out two six yr olds on the pull out couch with their own tv, and my husband and I upstairs in a comfortable king with our own tv. There were two bathrooms, one with a shower/bath, also a coffee maker up and downstairs, and a small fridge and sink. This came in handy when we purchased some grocery items & beverages from Papanani's Deli, located between the Marina and Bay Towers. I highly recommend stopping at the deil. . the hotel charges $6 per bottle of beer and at the deli you can purchase a six-pack for $9, along with tasty sandwiches, cereal, and many other items at a fair price. The kids LOVED the Marina tower pool and the entire family enjoyed the Club Lounge on the Penthouse floor. The lounge was beautifully decorated and a decent variety of snacks in the evening and helpful lounge attendant (wish I had gotten his name - very nice).

Our room had recently been re-done (it was evident) and it was immaculately clean--I'm a complete germaphobe, so this should carry some weight. We also had access to a separate pool and hot-tub, which we all used and enjoyed a lot. As far as getting around was concerned, we did rent a car for the week so that we could visit San Diego attractions, such as the zoo and Sea World. Although $22 a day for parking sounds steep, it really isn't, considering it's $10 an HOUR in most San Diego locations. And a shuttle came promptly to the hotel every morning to go to the Convention Center, so that was super convenient, as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a business traveler (nice lobby internet/computer hub, too) or a family traveling with young children.

Our beds were extremely comfortable. We had a Starbucks in the lobby - a great convenience! But also discovered \"Papa's\" restaurante on the walk over to see the Bay tower. It is a GREAT little inexpensive place to get your breakfast or lunch. It even had a really nice outdoor seating area that was directly on the marina (we will definitely make this our breakfast place on our return trip). Don't bother with the hotel restaurant for breakfast - way overpriced. The food in the sports pub was awesome and a very comfortable space for gathering with our family for a drink - it has a great view of the marina. The hot tub pa and pool were beautiful. Unfortunately, the spa was not open during our stay. The only disappointment was how the staff handled the situation with the spa.They kept saying it was open - when it wasn't and never apologized for the inconvenience. They also had two fire pits with rocking chairs around it which were a huge hit with guests at night. The Bay tower is much smaller but a more direct view of the bay. It just didn't have that \"vacation resort\" feeling as much as the Marina tower. Free shuttle service was very efficient and reliable. The view from the hotel is spectacular and location to the airport couldn't be better for travelers. Overall, it was a fabulous stay and I will definitely return again.

It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina.

We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any \"pardon our mess signs\" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast.

The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there.

Upon arrival parking was relatively easy to find as it is adjacent to the hotel BUT the parking lot was full, so once we found a parking spot, we went through the nearest hotel entrance we could find and it was a very long TIRING walk to the front desk. The front desk staff was very courteous and cordial and check-in was speedy. We were checked into a room in the Marina Tower (the main tower) and we were VERY disappointed. We had requested a room with a King bed but were checked into one with two beds instead. The room was very basic and it was quite noisy, as well. IF we had stayed in this room for the duration of our stay, I would have been thoroughly dissapointed. The following morning we received a call from the Front Desk stating that if we desired we could move to a room in the Bay Tower. We packed up our things, drove to the other Tower (it IS necessary to drive between the Towers...too far to walk) and boy, were we pleased. The Bay tower has quite the resort feel to it and it is adjacent to the Marina (not sure about the Marina Tower as our room there faced the main street) The lobby was very elegantly decorated and the rooms were very large and cozy and were decorated in a tasteful nautical theme. It was much quieter in this Tower and the vibe was much more laid-back than it was at the main tower. They should be two different hotels!! My advice: Stay at the Bay Tower unless you are there overnight on a layover and only care about the bed... Also for those attending Comic-Con, this hotel is located at a very good location.

The solution? PapaNani's (see above) The Ugly: The internet in the business center went down on my final night (friday.) I could not check airport schedules or email family or work. Front desk responded by saying, \"IT went home at 5, they'll be back monday morning.\" So basically internet down all weekend? The front desk staff did offer to check on airport schedule for me. And there was a computer in lobby which allowed for guests to print their airline boarding passes. Overall, my stay was a great one. I did not have access to a car, but you can take free shuttle to airport to board the city bus #992 (i recommend a $5 all day pass) and make as many transfers as you like to get to where you want to go. The concierge was helpful in helping me get to Coronado for the afternoon. I did not eat at hotel.. since conference provided some meals..but for snacks I definitely recommend Papa Nani's deli.

After booking our room on Hotwire, I read a few reviews on the Sheraton Hotel and Marina on Yahoo, Hotels.com, and here on TripAdvisor, and was filled with great remorse for agreeing to book a hotel without knowing the name of the place, so I must admit we had low expectations for our stay. However, as soon as we stepped out of the car, we were treated with respect, which was surprising since we are in our early 20's and aren't ever taken seriously, and the staff was very friendly and professional. The front desk was very slow and very busy with a whole line of guests, but the receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a Deluxe Room in the Marina Tower, which had a beautiful view of the marina and the city lights surrounding it. However, the walls were so thin, you could hear the conversations in the hall and in the room next door. Despite this, and the fact that the airport is a half mile away, I very rarely noticed the noise of the planes, unless the balcony door was left open. Our room was smaller than I had expected, and the color scheme of dark blue and bright red gave me a headache, but as mentioned before, the view was beautiful. It seemed like the hotel was understaffed, especially since it was a weekend. We called for room service, and were placed on hold for at least 5 minutes. It then took over a half hour for them to just send up tea, and about 10 to 15 minutes for towels, and when we called valet to prepare our car, they did not answer the phone a good portion of the time. The pool area was beautiful. We went swimming during the night, when there weren't any pool attendents, but that didn't bother us. What did bother us was the fact that the bottom of the pool was falling apart. There were little pieces of plaster that would stab your foot, and big chunks of plaster missing from the ground. If you plan on going out of the hotel to sight see and what not, then this hotel is just fine. But if you want to actually stay in the building to relax, this might not be the best place. Sometimes it would reek of chemicals in the middle of the night, mostly in the hall, when there wasn't any cleaning going on.

The room was 'ok', a bit worn ... slightly noisy when the neighbors got loud. The view was wonderful, but make sure you get the bay side, not the marina side.

As such, I booked the Bay Tower to be a little removed from the large conference chaos. The main building is probably a nicer hotel and with more restaurants and facilites, but the Bay Tower served us well. First, room 1188 was VERY spacious, with two queen-sized beds, good closet space and drawers, in-room safe, iron/ironing board, in-room coffee maker, and other amenties typical of a business class hotel. All rooms seem to come with a balcony -- absolutely delightful with morning coffee or a cocktail in the evening. The housekeeping was generally spotless. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and courteous throughout, and there is a concierge desk. This room overlooks the marina (which was lovely) and airport (which we find interesting, and were not at all bothered by any airport noise.) Odd-numbered rooms look over the bay and downtown in the distance. There is a complimentary internet access terminal in the lobby, and (I think) free wireless internet access in the public rooms. While the larger main hotel has larger pools and more restaurants, this place was a nice respite. The Bay Tower pool is large enough to paddle around in, and the facilities were quite nice with chaises and garden plantings. There is also a hot tub. Since it was on the far side of the hotel complex, it seemed less crowded than the main hotel pools (although the pool by the lanai rooms is also less crowded.) It is a reasonably short walk to the main hotel when you want more options for bars and restaurants. There is also an outdoor casual cafe operated by the marina along this walkway for coffee, sandwiches and casual breakfast and meals. You can book various harbor tours, fishing boats, bicycles, etc. in this area, although not part of the hotel operations. The location of the hotel is what you make of it. It is near the airport, with a complimentary shuttle. The hotel is not on the beach, but you can get to many beaches by car. With a car, it is also reasonably convenient to the zoo, Fashion Valley shopping center, etc, with easy access to Hwy 5. Compared to staying downtown, it was reasonably easy to zip around, unless you wanted to be right in the Gaslight Quarter or Old Town, but these areas are still very do-able from this hotel. The hotel provides excellent driving directions to many attractions and interesting areas. Harbor Island is not that large, but provides a nice venue for walks, bike rides, harbor viewing, etc. If you want to be on the beach, the historic Hotel Del Coronado is a lovely place (been there, done that,) but it is often overrun with tourists just walking through. The beach is very nice, and there is much to like about this charming hotel and area (including the hotel shops,) but the Sheraton may be more convenient if you want to get around to the zoo, Sea World, aquarium in La Jolla, hiking in Torrey Pines, etc. You can still go to the beach in Coronado (Imperial) without staying at the hotel. Frankly, if the beach was a priority, going up the coast to La Jolla or Del Mar might also be an option. But if you want a convenient location for general running around, the Sheraton is pretty good. There were some downsides that we could easily overlook. The tub had been re-done, but the covering was peeling. This Bay Tower hotel has very little in the way of a bar or restaurant (it was open at lunch, but often looked closed;) and generally less impressive than the main building. But again, when a large conference is swarming, you might want to be in this somewhat-removed location. The mini-bar has one of those annoying electronic systems. This meant that when we took a bottle of wine out to see what kind it was, we were charged (but the front desk very quickly reversed the charge when we pointed out the problem.) Finally, I still find it annoying when a hotel of this calibre charges for in-room internet access. There is a parking charge of $20 a day for self-park, $26 for valet, but it is reasonably convenient, and there are few hotels around that don't charge for parking in such prime areas. The hotel itself does not have much around it for dining, i.e. very little option to walk to other than hotel dining. However, with a car, much is possible, and/or a quick cab ride away. 'Strongly recommend that you try Miguel's for Mexican in the nearby Shelter Harbor area. You might be the only tourist in the place -- very full of locals. Not far from this restaurant, there is also a Von's and TRader Joe's to supply your excursions. Ask for directions. So: I'd be happy to stay here if a conference booked into this hotel again, or if I was generally touring the area. I can also see it as reasonably convenient for families who wanted to do a lot of touring in the area, assuming the room rate was acceptable. But if I really needed to be on the beach or have a greater number of cafes and shops to visit by walking to them, I'd go elsewhere.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "centralNJ", "Title": "\u201cCareful\u201d", "Author": "shess10", "ReviewID": "UR19010039", "Content": "Booked a 3 night downtown 4 star hotel via Hotwire at the Sheraton.

We were to continue down the road to another Sheraton. The Bay Tower wasn't too bad but definately not as nice as the main sheraton. The front desk seemed very excited to tell us about the beautiful view of the Bay from our room, which it's true, we could see the bay...but the ugly parking lot was in between us and the bay. The room was clean but didn't seem to be up to par with other Sheraton's we've stayed at prior to this trip. On our confirmation email, it stated to please enjoy the Continental Breakfast which at any Best Western or any other cheaper hotel/motel...translates COMPLIMENTARY! Wrong we were, The set up was like that of a help yourself complimentary station with the typical muffins, fruit, oatmeal, and coffee. EXCEPT we were charged $3.00 for a coffee that we poured ourself ( had we known, we could have just made coffee in our room with the provided coffee pot). There was a starbucks at the main Sheraton but we would have had to walk quite a distance or get in our car just to get a cup of coffee. The muffins were $3.00/ea. and the banana's were $1.50/ea. Which seemed like such a rip off...I mean we were spending $200/night and they had to charge us for a banana! On the day of Check out we got our bill slipped under our door and it had five (5) addit'l. charges. We inquired what these were at the front desk and they said that we ate the food out of the mini fridge. in the room, which we didn't. It was over $30.00 in charges that kind of just looked like service/tax fees had we not looked into it. They quickly got rid of the charges without any questions. Interesting enough our friends who were staying at the hotel too recieved charges from the fridge. which they had not even opened either. What a scam...had we not questioned it...they would have made an extra $30.00 off us...for nothing.They obviously do this often for they didn't even question our us about the additional charges they just removed them. I'm very dissapointed in the Sheraton, I thought that name stood for QUALITY ....this one proved that wrong. We also wanted to grab some food and a drink and since the bar at our Bay tower was closed at 9pm on a Friday night, we had to drive over to the Main Sheraton ( kind of a pain) we went to the little lounge and ordered drinks which took over 35 mins to get from the time we ordered...seriously are they trying to drive business away on purpose? We had some friends with us that had children , which the lounge said it was acceptable for them to stay until 11pm. We ordered food (which was okay...not bad but not fabulous) we then sat there waiting and waiting for our check. Our server was nowhere in sight, we finally asked a different server if we could please get our check, all of a sudden our server appeared with the check and told us that we needed to get out of there because it was past 11pm, well we would have been out of there by 10:30 had she not dissapeared on us. That was very poor service and unprofessional on her part. So to sum it up...we woudn't not stay there again. There were way too many scams and things that kind of blind sighted us. Perhaps the rooms at the Main tower were nicer but that's a chance we're not willing to take.

The lobby looks like a palace and there are big pumps of delicious scented lotion in the lobby and huge candles that make the place smell gorgeous during the day - then they light them at night. There's a Starbucks right in the lobby. There is a place to log onto the Internet or connect your laptop for 45 minutes for free, and the computer speed when there were only a few people on-line was lightning quick. It felt very luxurious sitting there checking my e-mail with my Starbucks! Beautiful lanai out back, with rocking chairs, deck chairs, Adirondack chairs to look out over the marina , places to eat your lunch outdoors - plus fire pits at night. The pool is WONDERFUL and there's a jacuzzi pool too. Our room was on the 9th floor with a panoramic view towards the marina and the sunset . King-sized bed and pillows were very comfortable. I've read complaints about airplane noise, but once we slid the balcony door closed, we heard no airplane noise at all and slept like babies. Nice big tub. Very clean room. I loved the mandarin & mint shampoo and lotion! I would warn against opening the mini-bar; of course we knew the snacks were expensive, but didn't realize everything's computerized and motion-sensitive, so when our teenager jokingly picked up the mini-bottles of booze, the charges went right onto our bill. Although - the front desk staff removed the charges with a smile when we explained. You also are warned not to put any personal items into the fridge - again the motion dectectors will know you did it, and there's a $25 charge. Checkout was at 12:00, but our flight was not til 5:00pm, so we asked if we could stay a little longer. We were granted a 1:00pm checkout, plus after that, you can leave all your luggage and even your purse with the bellman, and go use the pool for as long as you like, without needing a room key. We took the dry cleaning bags for our wet suits to put in our suitcases later. There is a spa/fitness room where they'll give you all the swim towels you want and give you a place to change back into your dry clothes - and I have to mention: the \"restroom\" in the spa was amazing. Scented candles, and cupboards full of lotions, hair products, razors, deodorant, robes and slippers, the works! - for guests. There is also a steam room and of course a shower area and lockers. What a great way to wait for our flight! When you are poolside, there's a litlte cabana that rents big, fun floaties for $7/hr, and sells sunscreen, waterproof cameras, etc. . There is a fresh-water cooler for free, plus there are staff who walk around very courteously asking if you want to order drinks and/or lunch, which you can enjoy right there in the sun. A little cheaper place to eat: Just a 2-minute walk to the left side of the marina is a little sandwich/burger shop right on the dock that sells sundries and some groceries, probably for boaters who need to restock. They have great ice cream and are very polite and friendly. Places to sit inside and outside. This hotel could not have been more heavenly.

Our room, though not particularly large, was nicely decorated in a subtly nautical theme in warm wood tones, navy and cream. Of course, the little balcony and view of the pleasure boats moored below helped a lot! The spotless bathroom was well-lit, and had a granite countertop with a basket of toiletries and a curved shower rod, indicating it had been updated fairly recently.

My wife booked it as it was lots cheaper than whatever else she found. I'm not sure what it cost, but will keep that factored in for the review. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which is a good walk from the Marina Tower. The rooms were not too small (I heard they are bigger than in the Marina Tower), but not what you would call large, either. There was a very comfortable king bed, tv, table, sofa, dresser in the room. Ironing board, coffee maker (single serve packets - they had 3 each day for us), and in-room safe were the amenities. There was a small balcony that you could sit on. In our case, we had a beautiful view of the airport to enjoy. You coul definitely hear them taking off every few minutes if the door was open. If the balcony door was closed, it was very hard to hear the planes. Room service pricing was reasonable, food was average. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Bay Tower has a small gift shop, medium sized restaurant (seemed to be dinner only), and conference rooms. The lobby was not welcoming, and if you didn't order room serrvice, then you are a hungry person. You can hike over to the Marina Tower, which definitiely has a nicer lobby. On the way to the Marina Tower, you will pass a small coffee shop with sandwiches and muffins (if you need a quick bite and dont want to hike all the way to the other tower). The Marina Tower lobby has a restaurant, sports bar, gift shop, wireless area and lounge. This lobby is decently appointed (much better than the bay tower). You can rent boats and seadoos just outside the marina tower. Overall, this is a decent hotel if you are looking for a relaxing trip, and the room is just to sleep or hang out in. I would recommend the marina tower for the lobby and its facilities over the bay tower, although i hear the rooms are smaller in the marina tower. We drove from L.A., and that airport frontage road is a real bear to navigate through to the hotel from the freeway. Getting out from the hotel to downtown San Diego was a real time killer. On the other hand, getting to Sea World or the harbor was pretty easy. If you are going for a value-based weekend, then this hotel might be okay with you.

With that said, you can look at areas of the hotel and see 40 years, and then others are as new as what you would find from a new construction hotel. This is how I break it down: THE LOBBY AND EMPLOYEES The lobby was beautiful and spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a finer hotel. There was a bellman stand and staffed concierge. The employees are top in serving your needs. Good hires that work with sincerity. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby area that are both nice. ROOMS: This is a problem. There was a constant joke about the rooms being similar to a road side lodge. They are small. The bathrooms have been updated and were clean, as were the linens. The beds are comfortable and the room was satisfying overall, just nothing fancy or trendy. Be advised, not all rooms are interior corridors. You might need to be specific if you don\u2019t' like your door opening to the outside. Some colors and d\u00e9cor are showing age. EXERCISE ROOM: I have yet to find a hotel/resort exercise room than can accommodate everyone that is trying to exercise at 6 AM. It could have been larger. All the exercise equipment was tops, just limited. There was plenty to do to get a full workout. It is San Diego and the weather was beautiful. Many, including me, ran along the coast on concrete path. POOL: I believe there were three total. I saw two. Both of which were very nice and bigger than normal. There were plenty of chairs to satisfy anyone wanting to sit by the pool and bake. The pool was even depth all the way across. MEETING ROOMS: It was evident that when this resort made upgrades it was done to the meeting facilities. Really nice in every way. LOCATION: This was good and bad. If you are flying into San Diego, you could walk to and from this resort. Literally across the street. The resort sits on the water and there is a very nice running path that is next to the water. The Sheraton is to two separate buildings. I was in the main building but guess it is a good 10 minute walk to the other. There are a couple restaurants within walking distance, but it is a 10 minute cab ride to the Gas Lamp district. Overall I would stay here again. I am big on service and effort and this property exceeded my expectation on both. I guess it depends on what your plans are. This was my fourth trip to San Diego in the past 4 years. With that said, I have stayed in 4 different properties. The other three were in and around the convention center.

We were dupped when we first arived at the Marina tower parking our vehicle and entering the lobby to check in. We were impressed with the decor and it felt like a fine hotel but were told that our room was in the BAY tower and was a 1/4 mile away. OK? we thought as we repacked our car for the drive over. When we first arrived the service level dropped by 10 points and had to ask more than once for a bellman. Entering the lobby you can feel the difference in the two towers--Marina was grand and the Bay was bland! In fact the BAY tower felt as if it were a former lower budget hotel rebranded as a Sheraton. The room was not impressive as the decor was a blue and red natical theme---yuk. There were no robes and a small bathroom with a cracked toliet that leaked. The location of both towers are adjacent to the SD airport and isolated from downtown. You would have to use a taxi or your own vehicle to go anywhere. If you do stay at the Sheraton Marina make sure you get a room in the Marina tower; our friends did and were happier than we. If you want to experience SD you would be better off staying downtown were you can use the trolly to explore the city.

The parking fee at the hotel is quite high, about 20 dollars/day. It is also very noisy as the San Diego airport is nearby. You can hear them almost all the time.

The hotel will throw your stuff away and charge you 25 dollars each time for the rearrangement of the fridge. We pay 300 dollars/night and cannot use the fridge.

I always start with the positive things...some of the staff (Dinah at the front desk, the cleaning staff, and the staff in the Club Lounge breakfast and evening drink area are EXCELLENT!!!!) were just down right wonderful! After my past experience with miserable staff, I must admit these few folk should be given gold stars! They were extremely helpful and always friendly! Again, the view is great and the gym is excellent and their staff is so pleasant (you should move them to the front desk!!). Now the real reason for the negative review... FIRST, the parking here is horrible! There is one lot that is closest to the hotel which seemed to be closed for the whole 2 weeks! There are a couple of cars parked there and there is no construction. So you have to park out in a dirt lot and walk through a dimly lit parking lot to get to the hotel. It's worse that there was a huge conference going on, so you have even less parking! Half the lot is used by valet parking and is NEVER full! So if you are paying $20 a day to park, I don't really expect to have to walk at night across a dimly lit lot that seemed quite far away! SECOND, I had the same problem as one of the previous guests with the smoke smell. I came back to my room one night and there was a VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke in my room. I opened the balcony thinking maybe it was there, but it wasn't from outside. I called down and security came up and said that it was probably someone walking by a vent smoking and it came into my room. Isn't the hotel non-smoking??? And it didn't go away and they told me that if I could see a guest smoking that I can report it...so should I have gone knocking on all the doors hoping to catch someone in the act?? It never got better, so they moved me to another room....exactly what I wanted to do...pack up my things at 10pm and change rooms! THIRD, the rooms are very tired. For such an expensive room, you expect better than 2-star hotel quality. The sink backed up constantly and even worse when you could hear another room running water it would come up in our sink! FOURTH, there was a big party going on one Friday night down in the parking lot tent...no problem, but if I close my windows I shouldn't feel the whole room shaking on the 12th floor! I called down to see when it would stop and they said midnight! I went down to ask if they could maybe turn the bass down...no chance, but there were 2 employees at the desk. As I walked off, one said to the other in a short tone, \"What did she want? She's already called down once about that.\" Wouldn't you think that after a long week of work that you should be able to sleep before midnight? I think this will definitely be my last stay at this hotel. I am a Starwood fan, but this one does NOT fit the standards of even their lower star hotels!

There was a crack in the sink, the light fixture in the bathroom took two or three minutes to warm up enough to provide light, and one of the bedside lamps required a phone call to maintenance on our first night there. Some of the staff were nice enough, but several were downright surly.

However, none of the staff could figure out how to light the propane heaters during our meal so I had to go into the gift shop and buy a jacket for each of us for dinner. There is a charge for the internet in your room and for parking. Corporate America's mantra these days seems to be to hook you with the promise of cheap prices and then burn you once you commit.

It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They don\u2019t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the \"new\" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hord\u2019oeuvres and breakfast.

There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other.

Frankly I'm amazed at how high it rates on TripAdvisor. Either the staff is being paid to write trumped up reviews or the folks who visit this hotel just don't get out much. For reference, I was in the East (main) tower. On the positive, the restaurant and bar side of the house did a superb job. The food was great and the wine list was even better. That's where the positive comments end. First, the location. For someone visiting San Diego, you either want to be downtown where the action is, or far enough out that you can get free parking and drive to the local attractions. The Sheraton has neither. It's not walking distance to ANYTHING. Someone in the elevator who did have a car commented that the valet charge was $29/day. Further on location, forget having a quite night's sleep here. To the north is Lindberg Field. To the Southwest is North Island, a major US Navy air station. To the Southeast is the main Coast Guard station. Between the civil, military, and coastguard planes and helecopters there's almost no time of the day when there isn't a loud drone or roar occuring with great frequency. My room was small and old. The fixtures in the bathroom were at least 30 years old and one of the tiles in the floor was completely detatched - I could have dug it out with a pocket knife. Bathroom fan - forget it. The sliding door to my balcony fit so poorly that wind blew freely into the room. The noise from the aformentioned aircraft combined with the drone of the air condition units that my room overlooked made sleep an impossibility. One of the few redeeming features might have been the Starbucks. I went in one morning and ordered a Syrup Cream - a fairly standard menu item. The people working there didn't have a clue what I was talking about. When I pointed out that it was a standard Starbucks menu item, they pointed at their menu board and managed to get out enough broken english to tell me that they only knew how to make what was on that board - nothing else. As for process and procedure - the hotel was pittiful. Hotel guide book (binder) in my room was so incomplete it was all but useless. It gave menus for the main restaurant, but not the other two. There was no map of the complex so for the third restaurant that was in the west tower, I didn't even know what it was or where it was. It mentioned the pool, but didn't give the hours.

First off, this property is ooooold compared to other major hotels in the San Diego area, the rooms in the marina tower are tiny and the while the front desk tries their best to trick you into staying at the Bay Towers (about 1/2 mile away) where the rooms are supposed to be 30% bigger, those rooms are even OLDER (if you can believe it). It's like stepping into a run down 1980's movie set. And while the rooms are bigger, the furniture size didn't increase and the room is poorly laid out so that you have big blank spaces of wall and carpet where there really should have been something else. First floors in the Bay Towers where I got shunted too (after expressing obtaining a reservation for the Marina Towers) faced the parking lot so any crazy person could just cross from the parking lot into your room if you left the balconey door open. Surprisingly enough someone in the conference said that the hotel cleaning staff or room service had come in, unlocked the balconey door and not fully closed the front door - how scary is that??!!! Front desk was rude too - when I pointed out that I had PAID for a reservation for the Marina Towers she said - sorry they had given up my room and there was no choice. I wasn't late or anything for check in. I was shocked! Parking at the Marina Towers is a bit nuts if there is a conference in town, they are doing some sort of construction on the parking lot (what I'm not sure - since i never saw anyone actually doing anything) but it's basically a dusty dirt lot with very NARROW parking spaces. There is not enough parking in the self lot (again if conference in town which usually there is), so you see lots of cars just circling around stalking people. Also it's not a very close walk from the self parking lot to the Marina towers. The parking at Bay Towers is a lot better - but then you're away from all the action. There is no gift shop yet at the bay towers (they're building it) and I didn't remember seeing any business center either - remember everything is really headquartered at Marina Towers. The good news at both towers. 1) Noise - while you're pretty much right next to the airport the noise inside your room is pretty much not there 2) Parking - it's $20 but for in and out privileges so that's not too bad for hotel parking.

Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, \"all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee.\" We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads \"For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically.\" However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A \"Smart Office\" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet. An adjacent open lot charges $4.00 per hour and the charges just keep accruing. Check before you park so you won't be surprised. In conclusion, this is a pleasant place to stay, especially for the business traveller.

I was here for a conference at the hotel, so didn't have to worry about traveling away from the hotel. On the positive, the shuttle from the airport to the hotel went fine. It was only when I got to the hotel.... First, the guy who checked me in didn't ask what kind of room I needed and I ended up in a room with 2 small beds rather than 1 king. That's the least bothersome aspect of my experience, but still slightly annoying considering everything else. When I got to my room (which was in a great location overlooking the pool and marina) I searched high and low to find the information binder so I knew how late the restaurants and pool were open. I finally called the front desk to ask for one, and the one I got had whole sections missing! They must not pay attention to these things.... I also asked for my desk chair to be replaced because the chair was so gross I didn't want to sit on it. The seat and back were full of stains and other grime, and there was grime on the armrests. Gross. The housekeeping lady gave me a little hassle about the request, but ultimately got me a new chair, which was slightly less gross than the first one. I did find out how late the pool and hot tube were open, by the way. The hot tub was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the nasty smell of cigerette butts all over the ground around the tub took much away from the experience. The shower also wasn't great. The shower head was old and difficult to change the stream. The string that goes across the shower to hang wet clothes was completely missing. My final complaint: who hangs mirrors (or other glass) over the bed in an earthquake zone?????? I've only been living in an earthquake zone (San Francisco) for less than 2 years, but even I know better! Bottom line: The hotel is decent, and at first glance the room is nice.

The room was OK, but stains on the Carpet and the bathroom was not cleaned(not good). Went to the front desk, told them they said they would take care of it(they never did), The next day(evening) we came back to the room finding the lock on the floor, it feel off the door(it is the security lock that is swong over, not the main door handle lock. This was fixed in about 1 hour, they used platic inserts to fill the stripped screw holes and bigger screws. The bathroom had tiles missing and plaster on the floor. lighting is terrible!!!

It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller \"lanai\" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night. Ultimately I felt that the money we saved by booking through hotwire would have been better spent on a hotel closer to downtown. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it to travelers.

Quinns was excellent. The best martinis and the food was great. The room was perfect maid service perfect. The ladies at the Concierge Desk were the most polite people I think Ive ever met! They were such a great help! Overall, my girlfriend and I could not believe the outstanding service that we were experiencing for 6 DAYS IN A ROW. Everyone of the employees was so nice from the gyms guy giving me towels to the wait staff at Harbor Inn to the front desk. Even the security officers asked us if we were alright and needed anything.

I was able to book two rooms via Priceline for a good price. When we pulled into the front of the hotel, a valet had a list of all reservations & directed us to the West Tower. This was helpful, as the East Tower's self parking lot is a dirt lot located about a 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance and it would have been an inconvenience to take the kids & luggage out & back in. The West Tower was about a 3 minute drive and located in front of the Marina & Harbor in the back. The check in went smoothly. The staff was helpful and was able to accommodate our need for connecting rooms (one room w/ handicap access) & waived parking fees since we had a disabled car sign. We were given a newspaper every weekday morning and not charged. Both rooms were clean and decorated with the nautical theme. Although the West Tower is away from all the amenities, it had it's benefits...such as larger rooms for the kids to run around, less foot traffic then in the other Tower, further away from the airport , beautiful views & parking (on pavement not, dirt) located in front - never had trouble finding space. We took a look at the East Tower and were annoyed that we couldn't find a space and then, had to park in the dirt lot. It seemed the majority of their guests stayed there since there was a large influx of people going in & out. For us, we didn't plan on using the pool or eating at the nicer restaurants so the West Tower better meant our needs. My only complaint was there was no laundry facility at the West Tower. I would classify the hotel as a three star only because there were standard features missing. Both rooms secondary locks were not working as well as a peephole that had a paper rolled into it. One of the sliding closet doors was not secured at the bottom, which caused the door to swing. For some reason the message light kept blinking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and would return. Just a helpful hint for those looking with families looking for a quick meal, you may want to drive to Point Lomos neighborhood (around Nimitz Way & Rosencrans St) about a 10 minute drive to find McDonalds, KFC, Vons, Dennys,Walgreens & cheaper gas stations.

Not everything that went wrong was their fault, but they couldn't make anything right. I went there with a colleague to attend a conference. This is a large property and we were put in rooms at opposite ends of the complex. A walk from one end to the other took 17 minutes, mostly outdoors. This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes. The problem was that when we checked in, they couldn't find two rooms for us that were closer. The complex consists of several buildings. The East Tower is the most centrally located. There are Lanai rooms that are at one end, and then far away in the other direction is the West Tower. The rooms in the West Tower are bigger, away from everything else, and non-smoking. The conference center was closest to the East Tower. The rooms weren't particularly clean. My colleague's room had a nasty-looking stain on the bedspread. My room had a big stain on the carpet. The rooms that I saw didn't have safes or refrigerators but they did have coffee makers. There was noise from the nearby airport but I expected it to be worse than it was. The staff were uniformly friendly and smiling, but generally not helpful. As a second example, the person at the desk in the West Tower offered to make a dinner reservation for us at a restaurant in the Gaslamp district on a Friday night, but she told me that the restaurant was sold out. We drove down there anyway expecting to find another restaurant, but the restaurant that we wanted was happy to seat us right away. As with so many things, they might not have been responsible but it seemed like they had a hard time doing anything that was actually helpful. None of the doors which were supposed to automatically lock at night ever actually locked. Guests have an odd habit of defeating security measures and maybe that had something to do with it, but apparently the locks weren't working. In reality, we didn't suffer at the Sheraton. The food was good, the drinks and tapas at the bar were generous, and the staff was friendly.

That being said, you don't feel like you are anyplace special, because you basically have to go to another hotel to enjoy restaurants, bar, spa services, etc. What's the point of paying for them if you have to go somewhere else to enjoy them? The view was nice when we first checked into our room (harbor, Coronado bridge, a bit of the city) but we were moved around midnight thanks to a plumbing problem, and the new room looked out onto the marina and airport. Still decent, but not nearly as nice. The room was spacious and comfortable, decorated in a nautical theme, which was fitting, but the bathroom was tiny, the towels coarse, and the pillows old and lumpy (glad we brought our own). My beef with the hotel is this....while I appreciate that they moved us to another room after trying to repair the plumbing problem, I felt it would have been a nice touch for them to do more than continually turn our message light on at odd hours for us to call and let us know they were sorry. On both nights I was awakened by the blinking light, so I call only for them to say they were sorry. It was annoying to say the least and if you are going to keep calling, at least get it right and remove the charges for the internet (that we reserved in the first room) but were unable to use in the second room without me having to continually remind you.

I read the reviews before going (tagging along for a cheap vacation to San Diego) so I had my expectations set low on what appeared to be a place that gouges for everything. I wasn't disappointed. We rented a car for 2 days so we could get around for 2 days on our own. If you stay at this hotel, you either need a car or get taxis if you want to get away from the hotel. We valeted the car for literally 1 hour when we checked in. Then we went back out for dinner and then self-parked the car overnight. When we got the hotel bill at the end, they of course were charging us $24/night for the entire stay (i.e. valet price for 4 nights). My husband on checkout told them we only had a rental car for 2 days and valeted the car for an hour and self-parked overnight. The 'resolution' to this apparently was to charge us ONLY for 2 nights of self parking. It was my husband's company paying the bill so I stayed out of it, but if my money was paying for this, I would have argued more at the front desk. That was the only mistake on the bill we had. The room we got on checkin had double sized beds and we requested king size bed and had to pay an extra $50/night for that. That bumped us up to the Club level room and gave us a city view which was nice. We got free contential breakfast and evening horderves and free internet for that $50 as well. The breakfast was nice (but they normally charge $12/head for it which again was nuts when no hot food was included). The horderves was also normally charged $12/head and again, was not worth the price. It was nice, but we got there one night during the last 45 minutes of it and hardley anything was left and they didn't refill anything. I rented a bike one day (which was $7/hour) and it was nice (a way to get some exercise and away from the hotel). The pool was outside and kind of chilly to go into so didn't get to try it out. I would never stay here if I was paying with my own money. They overcharge for everything and its obvious they know most people staying here don't care cause an expense account is probably paying the bill.

I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer.

This hotel has two separate buildings, the east and west towers. When I checked in at the west tower, the clerk was uneducated in the hotel's computer system. As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an \"upgraded\" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened!

I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel. In addition to the gross room, and I swear to the big G on this, our toilet actually backed up. I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room.

The hotel is located on Harbour Island and comprised of 2 towers: the East Tower being the larger and original tower; the West Tower being the smaller but newer tower. After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars. Check in - I arrived at 11am on an early flight in and was expecting to have to stow my luggage in storage until the standard check-in time of 3pm. They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar. Location - very convenient...a 10 minutes ($15 USD) cab ride away to Horton Plaza in the downtown core. Beautiful views of the downtown skyline and marina. Overall, I would return to the Sheraton.

We rented a sailboat out of the Harbor very near the Sheraton. The plan was to go to dinner after sailing and spend a nice evening at the Sheraton. A friend of mine had worked there for years when it was called the Sheraton Grande. I attended her wedding there years ago and it was lovely. Apparently they hotel forgot to upgrade. We only spent one night, but believe me that was enough. It was difficult to book only one night, Saturday night. So when I got a rate of $259.00, I took it. The hotel is an older style and must be at least 45 years old. The ceilings are not very high and the lobby is modest for a Sheraton. Approaching the front entrance, loud pop music was playing. Almost like the hotel was going for a Las Vegas feeling. Our room was modest and it appeared all the rooms had a nautical theme, which was fine. The room had a magnificint view of The San Diego Bay. The trouble started when we found our room and noticed we were located closed to the elevator. The hotel being so old, every time the elevator went up or down, we heard it. When the elevator stopped on our floor, a bell rung. That was't a problem until we wanted to get some sleep. We went to bed about 11:30 p.m. but did not sleep. Apparently there were three or four funtions at the hotel. From around 12:00 until 2:15 a.m. the functions ended and throngs of people got in the elevator and went back to their rooms. When they stopped on our floor, the bell would ding and drunk loud guests would proceed to exit the elevator and yell and sing right at our door. I woke up at least ten times. At 2:00 am, we almost packed our bags and went home, since we live locally. The Hotel is so old, you can hear when anyone in the area flushed their toilet. The toilet sounded like an airplane toilet, does the job great but you'll know the habits of everyone in rooms around you. If you can avoid the hotel do it.

They take your bags to your room, you have no say in this. We were there four nights for the conference and the only complaints I can come up with are the food prices are outrageous for breakfast. If you are preparred to spend $20 for three little kids to have a bagel and share a juice, then no worries. Room service for kids for dinner is EXCELLENT. They have $5 - $6 choices ranging from burgers, quesadillas to chicken nuggets. It was great. The pool and landscaping is so beautiful. You will enjoy your surroundings. My only other complaint is the odd behavior of some staff. MANY times we had knockings on our door, only to have an employee quickly open our door (before time even allowed us to get to the door) and they would pop their head in to see if anyone was there. (Not good if you're in the shower) Always with a weird excuse too. One person was holding bottled water, seeing if we needed replenished. (at $4 a bottle, no thanks) And doesn't housekeeping note these things when they come through???? Another employee came in with a clipboard. When I asked what he wanted, he stated \"never mind\" and left. Another woman entered with two towels draped over her arm. (Again, doesn't housekeeping do this?) We were beginning to put it together that they knew there was a hotel full of conference attending folks who wouldn't be in their rooms and the employyees were going around swiping things. It's not the most positive conclusion, but it's the only one we came to. Over all, the hotel is beautiful, the pool clean and the empoyees we dealt with were friendly and helpful.

From that distance, to be honest, it looks like a big 1960-ish (not too attractive) building. So, I must say that I had low expectations of the hotel when I decided to stay there. I thought it would just be a cold airport hotel where people would stay only for the convenience of the airport - not as a destination hotel. I am happy to write, however, that the hotel is much, much nicer when you are in it than how it had seemed from a distance! The service was very good (the valet parkers, the registration, bell-hops) and the views from the windows on the seventh floor were really beautiful. From one side you see the skyline of San Diego and from the other side you see the boats in the harbor/marina. The food there was also very good. My only complaint was that the overnight parking fee is quite high. We didn't hear any airplane noise, even though we were just minutes away from the airport. We just had the basic room, so that's what we got. It seemed like it had recently been renovated and was very clean and nice. The square footage seemed a little sparse (the room was kind of narrow shaped). Had a nice little balcony from which we could see the boats too!

The hotel is very close to the airport and anybody wanting an early night or a long lie in might be disturbed by airplane noise or the noise from the swimming pool-which was quiet after 10.30pm. The hotel is on Harbor island - it's easy to go for a stroll from the hotel along San Diego Bay with lovely views of downtown. It's too far to walk downtown, but it's only a five minute drive away. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning- it's a fairly standard breakfast buffet and relatively expensive at $19 but was done well. Car parking is $14 a day. I called the hotel to request a crib the night before we arrived and was told that availability could not be guaranteed. However, on arrival a crib was available and there was no charge for this.

After reading some of the previous reviews, I had mixed feelings going into this trip. However, once I arrived at the hotel, all my concerns quickly disappeared and our stay was completely enjoyable. We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger \"main\" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The \"main\" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids. The walk from the West Tower to the East Tower was pleasant, with beautiful views of the harbor. There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream! Also, another poster stated there wasn't a game room/arcade as advertised but there is one, tucked away off the \"main\" pool, near the spa entrance. The one downfall I found at this property was the $16 to self-park your car (you really need one, the hotel's not downtown or walking distance to public transportation) in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel. But. there are no other parking options available so as a hotel guest, you are stuck with the fee.

As far as the conference goes - the hotel messed up continously, so I would not recommend hosting one there.

We stayed in the East Tower (the West tower looked nice, also). The hotel is situated on Harbor Island, where there is a marina with yachts, boats, and sailboats. We had two rooms, both were very clean and well-stocked with towels, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, coffee & creamer. It also had a hair dryer and an ironing board with iron. The beds were very comfortable. We had trouble figuring out how to set the alarm clocks, so we just dialed the automated \"wake-up\" call, which only took a few seconds. We also could not find any pens in the room to write postcards, but did find some next the the pay phones near the lobby. We also had some trouble with the air conditioning controls. The thermostat had a setting to run the fan low, medium, and high. We turned it on high, as we like the humming sound when we sleep. However, it would turn on for about 10 seconds, then shut back off. The room temperature was comfortable, but we couldn't get the fan to stay on. The hotel restaurants were somewhat pricey for us, considering we had children. They offered a breakfast buffet for $18.99 per person. Our children are too old to be offered the children's prices, but also not big enough to eat $18.99 worth of breakfast. Instead, we bought pastries and bagels from the cafe, and that ran about $20.00 total. There were only a few restaurants on Harbor Island, so bring a car or your walking shoes, because you may have to walk about 1 - 2 miles. Even though this hotel is very close to the airport, we didn't notice a lot of noise. Occassionally we would hear a plane flying by, but it wasn't very loud. It was actually a bonus, as we ate at a restaurant down the street late on evening, and the view of the planes flying over the bay was beautiful. The service we received at the check-in counter was average. We paid for our 2 rooms weeks before our trip (via check). However, their records didn't show our room as being prepaid, so they asked for our credit card. I was very concerned that they didn't show us paying $1400 and told them we had a cancelled check, but they didn't seem concerned or even try to help. They just wanted our credit card so they could check us in. After more discussions, I finally got the name and extension of a person in accounting to talk to. However, I could not get ahold of this person and left voice mail. The next day, I still had not heard anything, so I went to the check-in desk and found out it was taken care of. I think they could have at least called us and told us they fixed the accounting error, or apologized. But at that point I was happy that they agreed that we did indeed pay for our rooms already. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us plan a sightseeing tour. She had very much information and was very knowledgeable. Since there is no beach on Harbor Island, we went swimming the the hotel's pool. However, the evenings were cool, and we didn't realize until the last night of our stay that there is a whirlpool just a little ways down from the outdoor pool. Once we found that, we spent the evening in there. The hotel also says they have a game room. However, all we saw was a couple ping-pong tables, and couldn't find the paddles or balls.

We checked in at night and the view of the city lights was very nice. However, within a matter of minutes we were assaulted by the noise of airplanes taking off, seemingly directly over our room. The airplane noise decreased after 10 p.m. but during the night the air conditioning system made a loud metallic kicking noise when it turned on. The aiplanes returned at about 5 a.m. We could also hear a lot of motorcycle and other fast moving vehicle traffic from the street below. On our last night, we heard a child crying all night in the room next to ours. The self-parking is limited to those spaces farthest from the hotel; the spaces that are near the hotel are reserved for valet parking. The first night I had to hunt for about 10 minutes to find a parking space, and it was about 250 yards from the lobby. I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina. There were usually two waitresses, but their job is to clean up and keep the buffet stocked; they do not serve food. There are much better places to stay in San Diego. I have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, including the Sheraton's West Tower twice (it is better than the East Tower), and the Sheraton Suites (nice rooms but weird lobby and inconvenient loaction). If you want to be near the airport, in addition to the two Sheraton properties, there is also a Hilton (I have not stayed there). The convention center is not very far from the airport and there are many hotels near it. If you want to be able to walk to the beach, you need to choose a hotel in a different area of town. If you want to go to Sea World or the Zoo, there are also better places to stay. In sum, there really is no reason to stay at this Sheraton, it is noisy, the parking is bad, and it is not near anything other than the airport.", "Date": "April 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1762520", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diegofrom 3/25/04-3/31/04. We booked through a discount website and got an incredibly low rate ($94/night).After booking the trip, I read the reviews that had been posted and began to get very nervous about our choice. When we arrived, we went to the East tower, as it is the first one you come to. Before we even got out of the car the valet checked a list he had and told us that we were in the West tower, right around the corner. We were told at check-in that we had a limited-view room. We opted to upgrade for $20 a night to a room on the 9th floor with a gorgeous view of the bay and the navy base. (We really enjoyed watching the navy ships and cruise ships come and go.) The hotel was great. The room was clean and all of the employees were very pleasant during our stay. We had room service three of the nights and it was very good.We were told at check-in that they were having problems with the keycard access to the parking lot. They said just to take a ticket to enter the lot and then throw the ticket away. The card worked fine to exit the lot. We didn't find this at all inconvenient.While it was slightly annoying paying $16/night to park, when combined with our nightly rate, it was still much cheaper than published rates for this hotel.The only complaint we had was the airconditioning in the room. It would shut off during the night and the room would get too warm. This meant getting up and turning the unit back on. There is a small deli/store located at the marina between the East and West towers. We had breakfast there each morning. It was very good.The location of the hotel was very convenient to all locations. We will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1754805", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Resort from March 19-March 24 and were thrilled with our choice!!! We had booked at Sheraton.com and had a great rate! We were on vacation for the week and stayed on the 11th floor in the west tower. We coudn't have been happier with the view of the naval habor with the carriers and other boats going by. The staff was friendly, courteous and we never had a problem with parking, the taking of the ticket was quick and easy. Being located on Habor Island Drive was an easy access to everything we wanted to do, although if staying here a car is a must. We had a great deal with a convertible for 12 days with Budget with unlimited miles for $250!The rooms were large, spacious, well cleaned while we were there and the front desk employees were friendly and helpful. When we arrived we did go check out the east tower, which I thought had a nice lobby and outside area. We never had time to go to any of the pools although they looked very nice.When going back we will stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "March 30, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80562-Reviews-The_Sheraton_San_Diego_Hotel_Marina-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$144 - $503*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1380 Harbor Island Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515711", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/dc/8f/51/marina-tower.jpg"}}
