It was absolutely fantastic. ROOMS: Yes, the rooms are small but we expected that from a European hotel. Our room actually had a large balcony that we sat on almost daily to have coffee or wine and cheese and of course, baguette. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very fashionably decorated. It also had a sense of privacy which was great considering this was a romantic trip. We never heard noise from the hallway or from neighboring rooms. It was like we were in our own little world. Also, the curtains on the windows to our balcony blocked out all light when they were closed which made for a restful sleep. STAFF: We also never were too bothered by any staff or maids, etc. Sometimes we feel staff can be overbearing but here it was just right. The staff was very helpful when we did need them. They helped us book a semi-private tour to the wine country. They also helped us with dinner reservations. We asked them for a restaurant recommendation and they asked us what we were looking for and they called up and made us a reservation right on the spot. They gave us advice on which trains to take for where we were going. We are huge Disney fans and they also helped us buy tickets for Disneyland. All of the staff was very friendly and seemed to go out of their way to help us during our stay. BONUSES: It was a bit rainy when we went and the hotel has free umbrellas for you to take with you during the day. This was great as we didn't think to bring umbrellas! The hotel also provides free wi-fi which was great for checking airline reservations the day before we were leaving. There are free movie channels on the TV in multiple languages. I adored the shower head. It was one of those rainfall ones, very luxurious. The beds were super comfortable. We always woke feeling rested. One night, we stopped and bought some desert at a little bakery and when we got to our room we realized we needed plates and forks. We called and they sent them up in no time. Also, when the maids clean the rooms, they leave little cards with the next day's weather forecast and they also leave little chocolates on the pillows. :) FOOD: I agree with other reviewers that the breakfast was very pricey even for Paris...so guess what? We just skipped it (can I just say this is common sense? If you feel something is overpriced, why buy it? plus in our experience, hotel breakfasts aren't much to write home about anyway) If you walk literally to the next corner, there is a fantastic cafe (which was recommended by hotel staff!). We ate breakfast there every day. The service was superb and they got to know us over the two weeks we were there. The food was fantastic!! In your room as well or in the common area there is free coffee and tea which was nice. LOCATION: Good location, we never felt out of the loop. We walked to the Eiffel Tower on our first day so that we could see the sights as we walked. It was a bit of a long walk, but a very nice one. Once we got the hang of Paris, it was very easy to take the train everywhere. Overall, we would stay here again when we return to Paris. A lovely hotel, and definitely deserves the 5 stars.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT HOTEL AND SERVICE!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bconnery21", "ReviewID": "UR127382239", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from Paris today and I wanted to tell everyone about what a nice service I received at this hotel.

There was no rude staff to be said and they were very understanding and helpful in getting us in the right direction. What I can say is that this is Paris and it is to be expected that the french are proud of their language and culture. When in Paris just go and enjoy this hotel it is worth the money!

The hotel is located down a side road and what a hidden gem we thought we had found. All the staff that we met were attentive, polite and nothing was enough trouble. Our room was beautiful, we noticed that some rooms had balconies but were told that these rooms were smaller, I suppose it's what you prefer. We were impressed with the fact that many of the movies in the room were free, having recently stayed in the Savoy in London and being charged \u00a312 for a film we were pleased that this hotel did not exploit this service.On our first night we were recommended to a most wonderful restaurant, located in a square and within easy walking distance of the hotel. We are both big \"foodies\" and have eaten in many fine dining restaurants, our meal was one of the best we have ever had, the place had a relaxed rustic charm and the food was sensational!!! I must also mention Stephane and Chris who were both delightful and helpful throughout our stay. Sadly our wonderful stay was ruined upon our return home. I had left behind a pair of boots and trousers, the boots were returned to me but after numerous phone calls and emails the trousers have not been returned. The only conclusion I can come to is that a member of staff has taken them which is totally unacceptable for a small luxury hotel. I hasten to add that my trousers were very unusual and expensive and were my birthday present from my children. I find it appalling that someone can take something that does not belong to them and I hope that the person reads this review and realises the impact it has on the hotel. I feel sorry for all the other members of staff who are working so hard to maintain the high level of customer service, I unfortunately felt I could not give the hotel a high rating.

Usually one factor will override the others and you will be left feeling one factor is significantly lacking. Not so at Les Jardins de la Villa, it epitomises everything a small capital hotel should be: - Convenient, a few minutes from the AF buses that run frequently to CDG and Porte Maillot metro station. - Pricing, my room was 25% lower than other 4* hotels (Le Meridien Etoile, et al.) and when you\u2019re staying a for a few weeks the difference is massive. - Quality, absolutely 1st class. The interior of the hotel and rooms is some of the best I have seen outside of 5* hotels. He attention to detail is meticulous. The room was on the small side but beautifully designed and decorated, the lounge and bar area were excellent and the honesty bar had a good selection of drinks and snacks. The room was completely sound proof and excellent curtains completely shut out the spring sunshine when needed. - Staff, all great and happy to help. Alexander at the desk was especially helpful and one of the best hotel employees I have encountered. In summary I can highly recommend Les Jardins de la Villa. The small hotel feel only adds to the experience. The only negatives I would make are: - Breakfast was a little pricey (27 Euros) considering all I really wanted was a coffee and croissant. - Complimentary Internet access was slow and occasionally disconnected. I would have preferred a pay option for faster and stable speeds.

However, it was such a great stay for such a ridiculously good price. I owe Les Jardins de la Villa this review. I am usually not a fan of contemporary interiors (I prefer the outdated 18th century French look - haha), but Les Jardins de la Villa is adorable! The photos on the website are accurate representations of what the hotel itself looks like. There are a lot of seats and sofas in the lobby lounge, with a bar that opens until very late. You get free, unlimited coffee and tea! The tea comes in these cute pyramid-shaped bags. The concierge was so nice and left the bar open past midnight just to cater to my caffeine addiction. They also have books, newspapers, and two computers with internet available. Walk past the bar, and you will be led to the entrance of the small garden with seats where you can enjoy a little cigarette or drink. The rooms are definitely small - that is probably the only real complaint that I have. However, the interiors are beautiful and the beds are so comfortable (no excruciatingly soft mattresses like most hotels). The bathrooms are very photogenic, and towels are left on a heating rack for you. They leave you chocolate, the weather report, pillow spray, and other goodies for you every night! Other pros: -The wireless internet is free! However, the signal may be weaker in the rooms. -The service is impeccable and the staff are all very friendly! -The hotel is only a 10-15 minute walk away from the Arc de Triomphe (and Charles de Gaulle Etoil\u00e9 Station) Tips: -Breakfast is not worth it... 28euros with a small selection of food. You're better off running to the market right across the street and bringing some breakfast back, since the coffee here is free anyway. -Take advantage of their wonderful lobby lounge I don't think I could stay anywhere else in Paris.

The facilities and general attention to detail were second to none. The staff I found to be generally helpful. This is a stylish yet quaint hotel that is nice to come back to once you have spent the day sightseeing. My only complaint concerns the booking of the room itself through the hotels website. I have since simulated a booking to check that what I am telling you is accurate: I was initially seduced by the free breakfast special offer. When you use this link, be absolutely sure that you have the free breakfast included in your rate once the website takes you through the booking procedure. I booked a Deluxe Room over a weekend for 450EUR having navigated through the special offer screen. It wasn't obvious on the confirmation page that the special offer had been included. I therefore added additional comments pertaining to the breakfast offer when given the opportunity - these comments requested the hotel to confirm by email that the free breakfast was included. The comments were also added to my final confirmation printout. I forgot all about the booking until the weekend in question. When I arrived at the hotel I queried the offer with the evening staff who said they would check. We took breakfast on the saturday morning but not on the sunday as we were time constrained. When we came to check out - surprise surprise the breakfast was not included. The hotel weren't giving any concessions when I discussed this with them and I did not want an arguement - so paid. I will add that the breakfast is very expensive, so do confirm and perhaps make your booking by phone to ensure you are able to clarify at the time of deposit payment. There is a nice restaurant around the corner which is far cheaper and it would have been nice to have that option in mind. I will add that the crisps from the minibar are the most expensive on the planet at 8EUR a bag!

Not only the hotel is well located but you also have plenty of excellent restaurants nearby. The Main facade is nice and discreet (located in a narrow street you can easy miss it unless you know the address....but I guess this is also part of the charm of this superb \"boutique hotel\". With only 33 rooms, a small but super efficient and friendly front desk a waiting area (kind of fashion if not a bit too trendy), the lounge is spotless with an excellent selection of books and magazines (including the Hermes Scarf latest's book, and plenty of excellent books about Paris, luxury brands and craftsmanship...as well as a couple of computer, smooth music and some well design lightning....next you have the breakfast area, small but with a good layout, very functional and surprisingly very comfortable. You also have a nice outside gardens for smokes or fresh air at the back..... As for the room, again, been very fussy about even the smallest details I have to admit that it was above my expectations, on all level. First the doors, lock and all surface and finish including the lighting are just top notch! The room aren't too big but you really get an Homy feeling with the right things at the right place. Not to mention the Half bottle of Champagne eon Ice (Pierrier Jouet) with a couple of glasses and a large selection of superb \"macaron la duree\"....Ouah! The bathroom was also top of the range, with some superb Grohe Fixture, a massive, deep bath from Duravit, not too mention the French towel radiator from Acova! you even get the feeling of top quality on the Hotel sleepers, what can I say! It is also worth mentioning that the bathroom was very well decorated, with a fragrance Green tea floating in the air) The Bed was set up ready with a bottle of Lavender Spray for a good night sleep in the pillow (aromatherapy) and a couple of chocolates too. The Air con is good and you can open the windows in Full, the street is pretty quiet and the bed quite good (Not hard enough to my taste, but still excellent). The entire room is full of plugs and switch all from Legrand (the Celiane top of the range), though very nice I found it quite hard to get use to the multiple lighting combination.....I guess I should have stay a few more nights... Obviously you get free internet and a good Samsung TV....a large Minibar selection....and I almost forget a ready Professional Nespresso Machine in every room. I would only point out that depending on the room you might get a small wardrobe with only a few shelves (some rooms are equipped with a complete stand alone wardrobe with plenty of space (but those tend to have a walking shower instead of the bath). Finally The following morning I had a good breakfast, with again top of the range designer tems from the Tea pot to the salt and pepper from Alessi, not to mention the good music background from Classical to groovy ambiance from the complete Bose sound system....the cheese selection is superb, not to mention the excellent tea selection..though you may find that the overall selection is not as large in term of Fruits and other hot dishes (you do have the usual Bacon and Scramble eggs of course). And last but no least the service is discreet, efficient and still very friendly....just as it should be from the cleaning Dept to the Front Desk and Breakfast staff......a real treat! Finally, and to resume I still can't believe how they manage to have it just right with the decoration in every corners, using designers items, mixing style and fabrics it might looks kitsch but it is actually a very dicey exercise with great quality products...they nailed it!!! Creating a real home feeling and cosiness rarely achieve in an hotel those days. Clearly \"small is beautiful\" and they got it right! Superb. Good points: + Staff, service, attention to details. + No short cut in the quality of materials throughout the entire hotel without exception! + Value for money (especially if you have the upgrade as an SLH member). + The welcome \"champagne\" + The atmosphere, and very risky but successful decoration/theme exercise. Bad points (Hard to find but only minors). - The Bed is a bit on the \"soft side\". - Not enough shelves on the \"integrated\" wardrobes. - I could not find the Nespresso capsules. - The largest room can only accommodate up to 3 people (Sofa bed for the third). Well overall a reference for a great hotel in Paris, but hey for such a gem......\"please don't tell\".", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Time\u201d", "Author": "BroganT-P", "ReviewID": "UR124240231", "Content": "Boutique is absolutely the word to use.

Downsides: 1) courtyard room gives the ability to open the window onto a nice quiet pleasant spot - until the smokers (who are now expelled to the outside and seem to dominate outside tables etc etc in Paris more than any other city), gather on the ground floor and the delights of cigarette smoke and conversation permeate the room, so window shut. 2) breakfast appalling value for money - Euro 29 for a moderate and a very limited cooked breakfast. I had thought it was included and my fault for not checking properly but when you get a good 5 star hotel full buffet breakfast or al la carte in London for similar price, I was flabbergasted . One day we had appalling service from the staff member responsible for standard things not available.. We were basically told to get stuffed by the staff member. Took this up to management who did acknowledge the poor service, but for the quality of breakfast and lack of choice etc, a fair price would be around Euro12. The positive was finding out how expensive it was, so we went to the boulangerie for breakfast afterwards. Overall recommendation - if you smoke and have breakfast outside the hotel - great.

For a hotel short on space, the stiletto chair in the foyer makes no sense, no matter how couture. Our stay was relatively cheap (based on other comments) and some state its out of the way. To us, however, for the money its in a GREAT location. You either walk 10 minutes (direct shot) to the Arc / Champs Elysses or simply hop on the Metro at La Defense and you are in the midde of everything. The deskhelp all speak English and were relatively helpful. The wake-ups were done by people, not automated and all were on time. They called cabs when requested and even offered up a few \"free\" drinks when I was stuck in the elevator for 1/2 hour (which they stated was the first occurence ever - lucky me). Stay away from the breakfast - 27 Euros is steep and there are simply too many bakeshops around to warrant eating in. Most importantly - after long walks along the Seine and sightseeing some of the citys best, you want a restful nights sleep. We found the beds comfortable, but the best feature is the hotel is along a quiet sidestreet - it was absolutely peaceful. Get a beer down the street at the James Joyce irish pub then call its a night. This was our first stay in Paris, so I cannot compare to anything else, but overall we were pleased and while we will try someplace else shiould we return, I would recommend.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Palos Verdes, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cWorld Class boutique hotel...

So the feel is intimate and cozy. I stayed in a suite on the top floor. It was not a suite in the classic sense of the word--there was only one main room and I didn't have a couch or any other true living room furniture. But it was perfect for my needs, comfortable and beautifully decorated. Even the bathroom was a treat with a rain forest showerhead and a tub that was literally big enough for me to float in (and I'm 5'5\"). Everything is of excellent quality, with all the little touches that make a difference--a Nespresso machine in the room, chocolates every night and lavender scented spray for the pillows. The staff is so welcoming and kind, and really go out of their way to see to your needs. The location is terrific. I've seen some concern voiced that the hotel is off the beaten path. It may not be located on the Champs Elysees. But it's only a ten minute walk to the Arch de Triomphe and the metro is half a block away. You can be at the Louvre in 15 minutes. There are also several excellent bistros within a few minutes walk, and a fairly large mall under the Palais des Congres where you can find a Paul's, a market and other services. I loved the neighborhood. It was quiet enough that I slept with my windows open every night and had no trouble falling to sleep.

The hotel was ideally situated, close to a number of excellent restaurants and the Porte Maillot metro station which provides an extremely convenient route across the centre of Paris. Paris has always been very special to us and we have stayed in a variety of hotels over the years ranging from the Best Western Astra Opera to the Park Hyatt. As you would expect the Hyatt set an extremely high benchmark. I can honestly say that Les Jardins de la Villa exceeded the standard previously set by the Hyatt. Les Jardins de la Villa is rather unique in its ability to remain both elegant and beautiful whilst retaining a truly classy quirkiness. The entire hotel is outfitted in a boutique style with individual furniture and artwork. I would stress, however, that whilst this hotel feels truly unique, the decoration does not in any way feel forced or gimmicky. Each room feels like a creation and it was a joy experience. I had booked a deluxe room but on arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to one of the junior suites. The room was beautiful, the perfect blend of classic quality furniture with fashionable decoration and a pleasantly surprising plethora of technology. Both the bedroom and bathroom were immaculate and extremely spacious, I simply cannot find enough superlatives to describe it. In the room was a large (32\"?) flat screen TV which was connect to the hotel's own TV, movie and music service. The TV provided free access to a large database of very recent movie spanning a wide range of genres for on-demand viewing and whilst, no-one should travel to Paris to stay in their hotel room, the level of entertainment offered here is to my mind unrivalled. All of the above considered, our stay was made truly special by the staff. I had spoken briefly with Pierre-Luc, the concierge, prior to arriving who was extremely helpful and very patient with my very rusty french. Whilst I cannot remember the names of all of the staff who made our stay special, they were all extremely friendly and could not have done more to make us feel welcome. In particular I would like to say a huge thank you to St\u00e9phame who always extremely helpful and friendly but also incredibly patient and courteous, always allowing me to speak in french no matter how much I struggled.

As compensation they upgraded us for the remainder of the stay and gave us one day free breakfast. This is UNACCEPTABLE for a professionally run hotel, however they did make every effort to compensate for their mistake. If you are going to stay here we would recommend not staying in the superior room as it is really small. We stayed in rooms 34 (1 night), 55 (for about 2 hours) and 40 for 3 nights. Room 34: Was clean, has good style and the bed was comfortable, has a really cute balcony, lots of light and good ventilation. However the room was really really cramped and we struggled to fit our suitcases and ourselves in there. Room 55: We had been told the room would be ready for us in the morning, however when we discussed moving our luggage with them in the morning they informed us that it couldn't be done until 430pm that afternoon. Same cleanliness level as 34, however the TV volume did not work and the TV in the bathroom was also out of order. When my wife had a shower and half way through realised that the whole bathroom was flooded. The front desk staff quickly amended the situation and transferred us to room 40. Room 40: Again, the room was in good order, clean, good style etc. This is one of their junior suite rooms and is of a decent size (not huge, decent). There was still a leakage problem with the shower however it was minor compared to room 55. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, we liked the little touches like chocolates, umbrella's, Bose mp3 player etc. The air-conditioning worked really well and again it had plenty of light and ventilation. In general the front desk service was great, always helpful, especially Michael, who really bent over backwards to make sure our stay was memorable. This is why I struggle, it could have been a great stay, but little things like the first night and the leaking shower in 2 rooms let this hotel down immensely. My last little gripe is with the concierge who greeted us on the first day. He was very friendly until it came to tip time, as we had just gotten off the plane and had no change (nor was I going to tip 20 Euros) I couldn't tip more than the 1.50 or so Euro I had in my wallet. He was obviously displeased with this and acted so for the rest of our stay. He also seemed keen to see if my wife was Indian and kept hinting at it which drove her crazy as she is not.

Rooms are relatively neat, and the bathroom is partitioned by a sliding door. This was the only downside to the room - not much soundproofing between the bathoom and the bedroom. We had drinks one evening in the hotel's honesty bar. A wide choice of drinks were available, and although a bit pricey, the sitting/lounge area was very relaxing. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but ate each morning at small patesserie 20 yards to the right of the hotel. For 9 euros they do a great breakfast of croisants and toasted bread for one third of the price charged by the hotel - great if you are on a budget.

We had a lovely little balcony...perfect for an afternoon drink or a late night cuppa. Our room and bathroom were spotlessly cleaned every day. Toiletries are divine! Loved the little touches provided in the turn-down service (the beautiful lavendar pillow spray came in very handy on our flight back to Australia!) Our bed was soooo comfy and the rooms are really quiet. So quiet in fact that you forget you are in a hotel and in the middle of Paris! I looked forward to breakfast each and every day, the chocolate muesli is amazing! My husband doesn't drink tea or coffee and upon knowing this the breakfast waiter would prepare a hot chocolate for him each morning. Concierge were also wonderful - helping us to book restaurants. Our french isn't the best but we knew the restaurants we wanted to try so asked concierge to book them for us...nothing was a hassle for them at all. They were just fantastic.

The hotel is in a very good location and the shopping centre under the Palais des Congres is a definite plus, as far as my wife is concerned. In summary then, an all too short a stay in a beautiful hotel that can still find room for improvement, but one we enjoyed very much.

I wanted good service, comfort and a decent breakfast in the morning. This hotel was recommended to me by Amercian Express travel and, having read a few good reviews, I decided to book. Shortly before leaving for the airport, I decided to check exactly which tube station I needed to get off at and so had another look at the details of the hotel, which led me back to trip advisor. This time a read a few negative reviews - especially about the uninspiring and small breakfast offer! It was too late to choose anywhere else and, I suspected, these reviews were not quite true. When I arrived at the hotel, I was in a rush to check in as I was late for an appointment. Being behind 3 very fussy ladies who wouldn't agree to leave an imprint of their charge cards (to guarantee their payment but not to pay) did not help. Once I managed to talk to Michael, I explained that I was in a rush and, in a lightning fast speed I was checked in and up in my room where I left my bags. First impressions were that this is a small, friendly hotel with a most amazing attention to detail and cleanliness. True, the rooms are small but are beautifully decorated and have everything and anything in terms of facilities that you could wish for. You even get a levender spray for your pillow which helps whisk you off to sleep in a beautifully comfortable bed. The next morning was the real test - breakfast. Well, I arrived down to breakfast to find a basket full of croissants and pastries on my table, a wonderful assortment of tea and, on request, a lovely cup of coffee. I then went over to the seperate help yourself food area and poured a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice - beautiful! I then helped myself to a fruit salad, becond sausage and scrambled eggs and another glass of orange juice. I didn't take a fresh yoghurt or and toast, cereal or meusli but, as you can see, can not complain about anything relating to the breakfast! I cannot find any fault with this hotel whatsoever and, with the George V, Ritz and Shangri La's costing approx three times more there is simply no copmparison!

For what would be considered a boutique hotel in the US, the place is nicely designed with modern features. Room included free Wi-Fi and the bathroom was even normal-sized by US standards. Staff was both pleasant and helpful. The only downside on the place was the price. I understand midweek rates can be higher, but $300+ for a Wednesday night seemed pretty high to me. 21 Euro for breakfast is a bit much as well. I'll gladly stay here on future visits, but will check further in advance to catch a better rate.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liss, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stylish Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Max Ray", "ReviewID": "UR68944394", "Content": "Small and well-styled, Les Jardins de la Villa is the perfect business travellers' hotel. Located two minutes walk from Porte Maillot metro station, the hotel is convenient for those visiting the west of Paris and the Champs Elysee area. The purpose of my stay was for business purposes. I stayed only the one night but was very impressed with the quality of the hotel. The rooms are small, as is the hotel in general; I think there are only 4 rooms per floor over five floors. The first thing that strikes you in the modern, clean and stylish decor. From the \"busts\" in the hallways to the styling of the rooms and bathrooms, the attention to detail is worthy of note. I enjoyed a single room on the fifth floor. The room was petite, but was well-equipped with wide screen tv, mini bar and complimentary wi-fi internet access. Best of all, the room and bathroom appeared to be brand new. I made use of the honesty bar on the ground floor, but thought it was a little poorly stocked. Again, the design of the dining/living room was fantastic. I used the gym also. Again, it appeared brand new and almost unused, and despite its size, it was well equipped with a range of aerobic equipment. There was a small selection of light weights and there was a sauna and communal shower area also. Perfect for the average gym user and a business person, such as I, who is looking for a little early morning exercise. I did not take breakfast at the hotel, and due to its comparatively high cost (27 Euros!), I chose to dine at one of the many nearby Parisian coffee houses. All in all, I thought this hotel was great and I will chose to stay here again.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "European", "Title": "\u201cFeels like home\u201d", "Author": "Euro-Biz-Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR68105354", "Content": "I selected Les Jardins De La Villa for two reasons: It was recommended by business travellers on Tripadvisor, and I found the right price on Expedia.

Free internet and quality coffee (and tea) in the room. Some of the rooms are quite small, this is Paris after all, but others are roomy.

Lovely comfortable beds (the only critisim was the underblanket which was partly plastic and unfortunately made you perspire in the night. Lovely staff especially the indian gentleman in the breakfast room, nothing was too much trouble for him. Smallish roooms but this star of hotel in Paris always is, if you want larger rooms you will pay twice the amount.Around 20 minute walk to the Arc de triomphe, but you can take the metro which is just down the road to all locations or a taxi ride. Would recommend that you book a room at the rear of the hotel as the street noise during the night was bad, if you wanted the windows open for fresh air. It has airconditioning and double galzed windows so you can shut the windows and therefor the noise out if you want to.

Downstairs coffee and tea are also available 24 hours free of charge. Bar is self-serviced, which gives it really personal touch - you just take whatever drinks you want and report them after.
