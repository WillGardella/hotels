Bathroom too was ok, but we did not quite understand the purpose of a large window between the bedroom and the bathroom. Breakfast was included in our stay and had a good selection between hots and colds, and was of high quality.

The hotel was quite pricy - nearly \u00a3400 for two nights - but I thought surely justified by the prime location. Other reviewers have noted the small room size, so I opted for a Queen room. Unfortunately, the room was still rather small - there was close to no room on one side of the bed, the bathroom was near-cramped and the balcony could barely fit its small table and two chairs. I strongly recommend, unless you are literally only sleeping in your room, to choose a Queen room - the standard rooms must be tiny! The view is beautiful. The Eiffel tower could only be seen from the far right of our window/balcony, but the cityscape generally was very French. The room was spotlessly clean when we arrived and it was even nicer to stay somewhere which felt obviously new. All fittings are sparkling and all furniture is out-of-box bouncy. The bathroom was grimy in a couple of corners but this was probably due to some awkward designs e.g. It's impossible to stop water from splashing out of the sink. The room was cleaned very nicely while we were out. The safe provided was free and gave peace of mind. On one occasion after showering, a member of service staff knocked desperately on our door so he could come and examine our plumbing - the shower had been leaking and meant that a lot of water was dripping from the ceiling of the room beneath us. Not good. All of the staff were very friendly and were more than happy enough to give maps and tell us a little about the area. There is a Metro station very close. There are lots of lovely shops. Notre Dame cathedral is a five or ten minute walk away. It takes about twenty minutes to get to the Eiffel Tower.

The room price jumped for the second part of our stay, due to Valentine's - understandable but something to be aware of. The lobby bar is nice and comfortable - great for a nightcap, especially the cocktails. Paris can be pricey but the hotel prices are on par with the locality. Many of the bars in the locality have a happy hour (usually 5 to 8) at much reduced prices - popular with the locals and great to wind down after walking/shopping.

Walking out of the hotel you enter the picture book scene of Paris. Perfect for the Metro and train line RER B direct express train to and from the Airport CDG. It is a boutique hotel and at first I found the rooms too dark. At first I didn't like it but after 3 days we loved it and didn't want to leave. The staff were very friendly, the breakfast pretty good, the bed was very comfortable and the place was very clean. The bad things are that the room was very small (too small) and wi-fi was only available in the lobby for 5 euros a day. It is the first time I have been specifically warned (and had to sign a disclaimer to the Hotel) about the danger of my belongings being stolen from my room. But there is a free safe. We have a phrase in Britain \"fir coat but no knickers\" This describes this hotel. It all looks classy and smart but things don't quite function right. The light switches are modern multi switch things that took some getting used to. The shower had 3 taps and water squirts from every direction. The drain couldn't take the water fast enough in the shower so it overflowed; we reported this to reception on day 1 and on day 3 they fixed it. The sink in the bathroom looks really modern and fancy but it leaves no side surface to put your stuff. The bathroom door is a sliding frosted piece of glass - looks smart but not very practical as a bathroom door. The crockery in the dining room is really classy modern stuff - all fancy designer shaped but the cups are difficult to hold. Every classy type of tea to choose from and teabags made from silk like material but they were all in the same colour packet in one box and no simple breakfast tea. There's an elevator to all floors but to get there you have to go down three steps - it's a right hassle with the luggage and anyone in a wheelchair will be inconvenienced. OK there's a small 3 step lift at the far end of the lobby but it's hassle. The front entrance of the hotel is simply an automatic sliding glass window, next to several other identical sliding glass windows that don't open so I tried to walk through the wrong door on occasions. One American lady freaked out about the unisex bathrooms in the lobby - she made her husband stand outside - just in case ! At first the focus on style over functionality drove me crazy but when I got used to the strange things, I loved It.

This hotel was reasonably priced and is clean and new. We had an executive room on the first floor. Breakfast was lovely as were all the staff.

Once the sofa bed was made up there was almost no floor space at all. Certainly no space to open cases and the chair originally in front of the desk was left partially blocking the entrance, probably a bit of a fire hazard.

Very nice flat screen tv with huge channel selection. Ipod dock provided. Wonderful shower: I wish I had on of these. It was just big enough to turn around in, but had two banks of horizontal jets, a hand shower, and an overhead rain shower. Lots of hot water that did not vary in temperature while enjoying it too. Perfect location on a quiet short block of a street in the middle of everything: Rue Danton is very quiet, except at the street ends (one end is Metro Od\u00e9on the other is Metro Saint-Michel) there is only a small convenience store (handy next door,) a drug store, a book shop, and a post office. But a one block walk either puts you right at the Boulevard Saint-Germain and a less than one block walk the other direction puts you at Place Saint-Andr\u00e9 des Arts. I cannot imagine a better location for a Paris visit than here. There are hundreds of restaurants, bars, cafes within 5 minutes of the hotel. Notre-Dame, H\u00f4tel de Ville, \u00cele Saint-Louis, the Latin Quarter, The Sorbonne, and Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s are just right there! Now, the only thing is that the room we had was really ODD. None of this really bothered us much, but it needs to be mentioned. We did not find the room unpleasant, just strange. The room is about 1/5 the size of any Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at, and I am a Platinum member. There were strange angles and narrow bits impossible to describe but I will try. When you open the door, you slide in to one side and close it, as there is a tiny desk and chair in the entrance. The bathroom at first is no wider than the door, which is entirely frosted glass. The sink is just there. One could only watch the TV mounted on the wall when sitting in bed, it was impossible to see from the chair. There is a little chair next to the bed and a smaller one at the desk. The bed is up against the wall/window. The room is dark, even with all of the lights on and the shades pulled back. There is a lot of black in the room. This made it tricky looking for things in the miniature armoire and limited shelf space. I have posted pictures of the room. We would do it again. I hear that room 804 down the hall has a few less angles and a little more room; I might try that.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel I've stayed in (and I work in hotels!!)\u201d", "Author": "Span23", "ReviewID": "UR122618120", "Content": "This hotel is by far the best city centre hotel I have stayed in.

But things are nicely furnished, appointed and decorated, with excellent housekeeping and maintenance. We especially enjoyed the shower, with its three different functions. Be sure to take the elevator up to the rooftop deck for a great view of Paris. The lounge and courtyard are nice amenities. The 18 Euro breakfast buffet in the lower level is a bit pricey, but we didn't find it out of line with prices around the neighborhood or Paris, in general. We give some demerit points for the limited and expensive Internet service. Two Apple computers that constitute the Business Center charge 3 Euros minimum for the first 10 minutes and then 30 cents per minute thereafter. We were unable to hook up to any WiFi service from our room with an I-Pad. We find all of this rather tiresome, inconvenient and exploitive in this day and age.

Notre Dame and the Seine are walking distance from the hotel. Our room was small, but big enough.

The lobby had an outside courtyard, which was pleasant in Spring weather. Bar staff did not seem to mind if we sat for a couple of hours to use wifi. There were numerous options for breakfast in the area, but the hotel's buffet breakfast was by no means standard Holiday Inn fare, comprising fresh baguettes, cold meats, cheeses, fruits, pastries, juices plus cereals and some hot options. To top it off, the hotel has a rooftop terrace, accessible by lift, that provides spectacular views of Paris. At 228 Euro per night, including buffet breakfast for two, the Holiday Inn Paris - Notre Dame was not cheap, but undoubtably not too bad for Paris. But it was far cheaper than their posted rack rate when we arrived - 350 Euro per night! So contacting the hotel directly in advance to arrange a good rate paid off.

But the beds were incredibly comfortable, the room was ultra quiet. We were right next to the elevator and on the second floor and never once heard any noise from the elevator or the street. And no weird smells. Sometimes hotel rooms can smell stuffy or mildewiy, but this was smell-free. If all you do in a hotel room is sleep, and get ready to go out and sightsee,then this is a perfect hotel. The location was also very convenient. Quite close to the Ile de la cite and Notre Dame - easy walking distance, even for me. Also close to a metro stop, but not one with an escalator or elevator that I could see, at least.. Initially I was looking for a hotel close to a metro as we were coming in from Gare St. Lazare but with all our luggage, we ended up taking a taxi which would have been about 8 euro but since we are 4 people with a ton of luggage, it was almost double that. We didn't eat here so can't comment on food. There is a 9th floor with a terrace where I think you can see the Eiffel Tower at night but it closed at 11 and we got back too late to check it out. The front desk got us a shuttle bus direct to CDG the next day. It was direct to the airport, door to door, just us, no other stops. Quite expensive, 70 euro, but it was for four of us with a lot of heavy luggage and I just couldn't bear the idea of trudging through a metro with all of that and I'm not sure I would have saved all that much anyway. Additionally, there is internet for 5 euro and an elevator, a little patio off the bar in the lobby. Hint for sightseeing: After dropping off luggage in room, we headed out to grab a quick bite and had really, really, atrocious food at an insulting price at one of the cafes down the block. don't remember the name, but I can pretty confidently say most of them looked about the same. Went on to Notre Dame and the line to get in stretched forever, at least an hour+ wait. We decided to try again early the next morning before leaving for our flight, and at 9:00 we walked right in with no lines.

St Germain de Pres is also only a few minutes away, so there are lots of places to eat near at hand. The hotel itself is clean, modern and welcoming. No hotel in Paris is cheap, but this one was pretty good value, although not sure about it being a 4 star. Certainly a 3.5 star though! We didn't eat in the hotel, but we did enjoy the rooftop terrace. It is only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and is really great for just enjoying a drink and the views (although the bar was not open on our Thursday night). Rooms aren't massive, but are comfortable, and the bed was really comfortable. One strange thing though...a window between the bedroom and bathroom, complete with semi-transparent blind! Not for shy couples!! We did have problems with our initial booking. The Holiday Inn website refused my booking three times...only for us to discover it had charged our card for three rooms anyway! The hotel refunded the charges ok, although we are still trying to recover the difference that we lost out due to exchange rate changes. Also, there was no free internet / wi-fi available.

However, our experience was far less than ideal. Pros: Breakfast (downstairs/continental) SOME staff members (such as Giles, the breakfast room staff, and a couple of others) Location Two major cons: (1) The whole purpose of my trip to Paris was to celebrate the national holiday, La Fete de la Bastille, which happens to be my birthday, and something I've wanted to do since I was a little girl. However, on THE MORNING of the holiday when I casually asked if we'd get a good view of the fireworks from the rooftop, I was told that the rooftop was reserved for a private event that evening. Key words: I ASKED. There was absolutely NO notice that the rooftop, heavily advertised as a unique amenity, would not be available at such a highly inconvenient time - not fair, especially since we paid an inflated holiday rate that night. I could have found a less expensive hotel, but I chose to pay for the experience - and didn't get it. I've submitted a complaint via the HI website. I hope they'll address this appropriately. (2) Housekeeping is inconsistent. Most importantly, we noticed a few of days into the trip that there were stains on the linen on one of our beds - stains we KNOW we did not make. But they were tucked in against the wall where we couldn't see them, meaning the linen had not been changed on that bed, since the previous occupant. Yuck. The next day, it still was not changed. The next day, we pulled the linen back so the stains were visible, and only then was it changed. Otherwise, there were no issues with cleanliness - but this is pretty gross. Other: The bathroom... ? There is NO privacy. The \"door\" is a translucent sliding glass, and there's a large translucent window in the shower, allowing the person in the room to see the silhouette of the person showering. Also, the shower has no curtain or door, so water spills on the floor while you're showering.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cVery Good\u201d", "Author": "rchrisrj", "ReviewID": "UR115911099", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights at the hotel.

On our last evening when we returned to our room at 5:00pm after being out all day the room had not even been made up. We had to ask on more than one occasion to have this attended to and when it was it was a shabby job. So to sum up, location good, view lovely, service, what service and this was in low season!

The front desk staff all came across a bit cold and not overly friendly. On the other hand, the breakfast room and bar staff were all very professional and friendly. Greetings as you walked past the bar and attentive service in the breakfast room was appreciated. Breakfast was included on our room rate and consisted of a buffet including fresh croissants, baguettes, toast (with a variety of spreads), cereals, hot food (eggs, bacon etc), cheeses, cold meats and Nespresso Coffee, to name a few of the options. Our room was on the 8th level with a small balcony overlooking the city. The room was quite small, yet comfortable with closet space, a safe, mini bar and TV (with 2 English speaking channels - BBC and CNN). The bathroom was a little bit strange, with a frosted glass door leading into the bedroom which couldn't close fully and a window in the shower area that was only partially frosted (the bottom 1/2 was while the top 1/2 wasn't) - although the 8th floor was higher than any nearby buildings so there was little chance anyone could see you - and if they could, you'd have to be well over 6-foot tall and even then it would have been shoulders only. The shower was nice, with dual functions of an overhead shower, a separate movable shower-head and also sprayers that came on from the sides of the shower (in the walls) - something I've never seen before! I'd recommend this hotel for the location.

The location in the Latin Quarter is spectacular. The metro is convenient, restaurants are abundant, the area is lively, and it's incredibly close to the Seine River, Notre Dame, St Michel fountain. the Cluny Museum, a Monoprix, and Starbucks. There are also several Metro stations in the area and ATM access is convenient. The rooms are on the small side, which is probably the hardest thing for most Americans to get use to. We do love our space and unless you want to pay an exorbitant price for a room you just aren't going to get that in the more popular areas of Paris. I'm not sure of the camera lens they are using in the pictures on the website but they definitely make it look like you are getting more space than you get. I specifically chose a King Executive thinking that I was getting a larger room, I was sorely disappointed. The room was very narrow and cramped. I certainly wouldn't want to be stuck here on a stormy day. I discovered where the large rooms in the hotel really were when I went to the rooftop deck and checked out the floor plan on the top floor. Those were the types of rooms I thought I was booking when I chose an executive. When I inquired about the rooms I was told that they were suites and they could be booked on the website. I've tried several times using different dates and no they can not. If someone else figures out the secret to doing this let me know. If I stay in this hotel again that's the type of room I want. The rooms are very dark. A lot darker than they appear on the website. It's not that sun doesn't get into the rooms, it's just the colors they chose and the lighting is just atrocious. Mostly florescent lighting is used and it's quite annoying. Chocolate, tea, and coffee are complimentary in the room as well as an electric kettle. It was very much appreciated. There is also a minibar that can double as a very small fridge. It came in handy. The one amenity that should be provided in every room that isn't is an iron and ironing board. I really don't understand why this isn't automatically provided. You have to request one and iron all of your clothes that day because the front desk will call you and ask for it's return. The irons they do use are lightweight and cheap. The first one they sent up to me was a fire hazard. The biggest disappointment in my room was the bathroom. It was pretty enough, but not very functional. The toilet seat was too close to the opposite wall so if you have long legs beware. If you sit on the toilet your knees will probably be rubbing against the wall. The handle on the sink faucet was probably my biggest pet peeve. It's one of those kind that is almost flush with the rest of the fixture and you have to twist it to turn the water on. It's practically impossible to get a grip of the thing if you have wet, soapy hands. I didn't mind the window next to the bathtub because I was the only one in the room. Although I could never open the curtains while I was in the bathroom for fear of the apartment dwellers across the street being able to see in. I assume that the window was placed in the bathroom to conserve energy and allow natural light in. Another problem I noted was getting in and out of the bathtub/ shower. The bathtub ledge is rather high and there is no railing to grab on to. This was easy enough for me to deal with but I can't imagine it being easy for an older person or children. Getting out of a slippery tub with no railing to grab onto is an accident waiting to happen. In spite of my issues with the room, it is still a pretty decent hotel for Paris. The location can't be beat, it is attractive, and the staff was pleasant. I did not use the concierge service.

The bathroom is small, but the shower is one of the best I have seen in all the previous trips to Paris.

I was attending a conference in the hotel over a weekend on a B+B basis for two nights but the real let down was the actual size and layout of the room itself. Room 316 was situated behind a common entrance door leading to two separate bedrooms, these were located in the very corner of the building and given the odd shaped buildingsm in Paris this led to a very cramped room layout in 316. While I am a big fan of modern and mimimalist hotel rooms this one went a bit too far with light switches which had double actions, press the top of the switch for one set of lights and the bottom of the same switch for a different set of lights... if you can follow that! The air conditioning/heater controls were a trial in themselves and I had to reluctantly admit defeat and call the front desk to have someone come up and show me how to operate the controls, this was done almost instsntly and with good grace by a young man from reception. The layout of the room meant the bathrooom was shoehorned into whatever space was left, which wasn't much, the hand basin was wedged between the bathroomm door and the shower cubicle with not an inch/centrimetres to spare. There were no shelves to store the normal toiletries or a shaving bag, the complimentary shampoos/gels were perched on top of the handbasin which left no room for even a bar of soap. The chambermaid did store some of my esentials on top of the hairdryer along the bathroom wall, this space was also being shared incidentally be a hand tissue container. The wardrobe was crammed into the space leading into the cramped bathroom, all in all it would seem they crammed two standard bedrooms into a space perhaps best suited to a Suite or Executive Room. Now none of the above was life threatening or very serious just annoyances when you should have been able to get done what you needed to instead of being frustrated. The bed and pillows were ok for my tastes and I didn't use the mini bar or safe, the room cleaning was spot on and unobtrusive. One major plus was the provision of a British style three pin wall socket beside the work desk. The breakfast was the usual fare of hot and cold selections very well presented and kept refreshed constantly, as others have said there didn't appear to be a cafe/restaurant as such, perhaps with so many pavement eateries surrounding Paris there is no need. Supposedly all hotel rooms in Paris are small but this room was claustrophobic to the point of being off putting, for location, accessibility and public transport the hotel is excellent but when you can't turn around in the room without feeling you are enclosed it's just not comfortable. Overall if I had had to pay the quoted \u20ac190 per night for this room to my mind it was poor value, I am a long standing member of the Holiday Inn Priority Club and very seldom find any criticisms of the brand. Incidentally there is a terrific Irish Pub called Corcorans almost right beside this hotel, turn left out of the hotel and take the second left to find the Pub just up on your right hand side, for those who enjoy home comforts, like Irish food and drink, this place was the real deal with every possible sattelite channel to watch whatever sport you fancied. For all those culture vultures rolling their eyes up to heaven let me assure you I am no big fan of Irish Pubs abroad but if you were all sight seeing drained out and fancied a lazy couple of hours watching football with a few drinks and very reasonably priced food this was the place to be.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cThere is other choices\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveler13Usa", "ReviewID": "UR93094041", "Content": "Recently returned from a stay.

I was upgraded to an executive room with King Sized Bed and Sofa Bed. My booking was with points for a room with two twin beds. There was a large flat screen tv with many channels-mostly French but with news channels in English, French, and Arabic. There was one Spanish channel but no German channels. There was a work desk with outlets and plug in for internet cable, a lamp and chair, and a small round table between bed and desk. There was a minibar with items fairly priced for large city, but we only used it to keep some sandwiches and a soft drink. One had to put key in slot by door for electricity. The heat and a/c were individually controlled and both worked in January. We needed air since we couldn\u2019t open windows, and it was muggy. We didn\u2019t unfold sofa bed so no comments on its comfort. There was a small swiveling chair in corner by window. There were two bedside tables: one with phone and both with stereo speakers. All lights could be controlled from each bedside and from entry, but oddly enough, not from bathroom or desk even for those lights. There was a closet with hangers and decent sized safe. There was an area between bureau and refrigerator with several ledges, two of which had kettle and supplies for tea, coffee, and hot chocolate. Bathroom had toilet, sink, and shower. Shower had rain head plus side sprays and a shower cord. Pressure was low if using more than one. Sink had weird control that made it hard to determine if hot or cold. Water pressure varied with temperature, but the quality was good. Toilet flushed very well and was used often since both of us were sick from too much raw seafood and fish in Marseille-I think one must have to develop the stomach for the many sea creatures. For this reason, we never ate breakfast so can\u2019t comment except to say buffet was 19 euros and continental breakfast in bar was 9 euros. One major issue with bathroom was no shelving and no ledges. We had to use work desk for our toiletries and such. Sofa made room cramped. I guess if it had not been an executive room, then there would have been no sofa bed, no safe, and no minibar, but I think the only difference was those items in the same sized room thus too much furniture in room. Room was quiet for most part-we were on 2nd floor with traffic on Rue Denton outside, but there were double windows-one could be opened by firefighters in case of emergency, but no real view except street. The first morning, they tried to enter room to check mini bar even though sign on door to not enter! Since my notebook computer had no connection for internet cable, I was told I could purchase wifi for 5 euros/24 hour period but could only use in bar/lobby area. The cable at the lowest speed was the same as the wifi pricewise. Being the curious doubter than I am, I left my computer on and returned to my room after checking my email in the lobby, and it worked perfectly so I used the wifi in my room the rest of the time. I did have to get another password the second day. Hotel has observation deck which offers many great views of taller monuments in Paris such as Sacre Couer, the Eiffel Tower, Montparnasse, Notre Dame, etc. It was cloudy the night we went up but still beautiful. Staff made up mostly of young, handsome men who provided great service, spoke great English, but who always seemed to be on the phone so you had to wait 10-30 seconds each time. A wake\u2013up call was requested the last morning and personally received on time-no recording. There were plenty of towels including two large ones. Since we were both sick, we slept until noon and didn\u2019t leave the room until 2 pm the first day except I did make a quick jaunt to the post office 100m away from the hotel (right out the door of hotel) on Rue Danton towards Odeon. We left the Do Not Disturb sign on door until we left, but when we returned 2 \u00bd hours later, the room had not been cleaned. The young man at the front desk said our sign had been on the door until the past hour, but I said that it had been off since just before 2 pm. He said they would still clean our room, and I asked how late that could be done. He didn\u2019t provide specifics so I requested 7 pm since we had a dinner reservation just after then. He said no problem, we stopped by to reconfirm as we were leaving, and the room was cleaned with completely restocked supplies and towels on our return 2 \u00bd hours later. We received two bar coupons because of my Platinum status but did not use since we were sick most of the time. Check out was smooth and accurate. There was a young lady there then, and we conversed entirely in French. The young men almost always responded in English. The lobby was spacious and clean with the bar, but as I said, we didn\u2019t use our drink coupons. In summary, the location can\u2019t be beat! I am only giving it a 4 because the room was cramped, the lack of shelving in bathroom, the ignoring of the \u201cWe\u2019re sleeping\u201d sign, etc. I found the hotel to be priced higher than it deserved, although I used points and only had to pay 10 euros at checkout for the 2 days of internet usage, which should have been free to Platinum Priority Club member.

There was a nice feature in the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, it was a panoramic window which had a pull down blind which you could still see through!! On our second day there the room was spotlessly cleaned. The third day the tea cups had not been changed and there was still rubbish on the floor. I suppose it was New Year's day. The room was an Executive Room for three adults, myself, my wife, and our daughter. The wardrobe space was 8 hangers which faced forward and a shelf.

We arrived on a Sunday after a long flight from Vienna (don't ask). Upon check in we asked the indifferent desk attendant if they had a record of our voucher for the hotel. She ignored the question and just said that we had a special rate that she was not familiar with, and then assigned us to a room (#516). We are accustomed to small Paris hotel rooms as we have traveled there annually for 20 years, but this one took the cake. It was more like a closet than a hotel room. There were no drawers, and there was inadequate shelf and cupboard space. The closet itself had 8 hangers and a safe at the bottom of the closet, so the net effect was that anything longer than a blazer hung on top of the safe. If you are staying any longer than overnight, you will have a problem with storage. Then there was the bathroom. I know others have commented on this, but the entry way into the bathroom was 20 3/8 inches wide. Entry into the shower was 12 3/4 inches wide, and the sink area (which was wedged between the wall and shower) was 21 inches wide. So, even an average sized person would feel uncomfortable in this Lilliputian room. We had to go in and out of the shower sideways. I thought there might be an issue with the bill, so the day before check out I asked for a copy of our account to date. Just as expected, we were being charged for the room. Luckily the only hospitable and helpful person we had found at the desk was on duty. His name was Benoit and he was able (after 2 phone calls to the US) to sort out the situation for us and the charges were removed from the bill. Benoit was exceptional and I don't know what we would have done without him. Unfortunately his colleagues were not (perhaps it was the fact that their job is made more difficult by the horrible and uncomfortable design for the front desk where staff must stand for the entire time they are there). Finally, if you need Internet access and did not bring your own computer it costs 3 euro for 10 minutes of computer use. The computers were broken for the first 2-3 days of our 4 day stay and there was no sign to indicate that. The hotel is new, modern, beds are comfortable, location is good, and it is clean.

Hotel was very well located, rooms were clean and quiet, lovely rooftop deck. Now, the cons. Right from the beginning the hotel staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful. The room we were given smelled like a sewer - they obviously have some kind of problem with their bathroom drains as this seemed to be where the problem originated. Their solution was to come and pour some kind of \"perfume\" down the drain to mask the problem. Didn't work for more than a few hours before the nauseating smell returned. When we asked to change rooms, they begrudgingly switched us to a different room - even smaller than the first. I figure this was their way of 'punishing' us for complaining. As others have noted, the bathrooms are extremely small and inefficient. On three separate occasions the room key wouldn't work as it lost its magnetism. Hotel staff tried to blame it on our cell phone - which we didn't even have with us. The final straw was when I got locked out of my room in my pyjamas and had to go down the elevator, through the lobby to the front desk to get them to re-magnetize my key for the third time. Prancing through the lobby of a Parisian hotel in my pj's is certainly not a memory I was hoping to have! The breakfast was very expensive (19 euros) and the quality just wasn't there.

Can't comment on value for money as this was a couple of reward nights through Priority Club. Avoid the very touristy area near the hotel, turn right when leaving reception and head down that direction, much nicer.

The bedroom although quite small is well appointed, the bathroom something rather special with a great powerful shower (bath available too) and the largest shower head we have ever seen.

My husband and I traveled with our college age son and teenage daughter. Let's start with the positives: Very close to a Metro stop, many wonderful cafes, restaurants, bistros, etc in the area, walking distance to Notre Dame, the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay. The staff was very helpful in finding a nice restaurant for a celebration dinner and gave great directions via the Metro to travel to other sights not within walking distance. Our children had a room of their own - an Executive room which was 2 twin beds as I requested. Their room was on the second floor, very nice with a small love seat and table. They were provided with bathrobes, shaving kit, toothbrush kit, bathroom scale. They were very happy with their room and the time I spent in their room was very nice. Now onto our room. We were on the 4th floor. The first thing we noticed when we entered our room was the odor - like stagnant dirty water. At first i thought this was due to the air conditioning being off. This hotel is very eco-friendly, which we really appreciated. To turn on the lights and AC, you put one of your key cards into a slot just inside the door. Then, when you leave and remove your card, all of the lights and AC turn off. We left for a short time to get dinner and returned to a still stinky room. Then we discovered that the telephone did not work. We could get calls in but could not call other rooms or even the front desk. We were not provided with bathrobes, a scale, or either of the kits that the other room had. The next morning, on our way out to explore Paris, I mentioned both the phone and the odor to a staff member at the desk. She assured me a technician would fix both issues. We returned at 7PM. The staff member on at that time was very helpful in making a reservation for us at a wonderful restaurant to celebrate my birthday. We went to our room to find that neither issue had been resolved. On our way out to dinner, we again mentioned these to the same desk staff who made the reservation. He said he would check into it personally. When we returned after a delicious dinner he told us a technician would need to look into the phone but that it was too late at night for that, and he would have someone look into the odor in the morning. It was difficult to sleep because of the nauseating smell. And, the telephone issue could have been a serious safety problem as we could not call anyone in case of an emergency. The next morning, I spoke to the same woman as the day before who said she would have someone look into the issues. At this point, I requested a new room and was told I would need to check back later. I called the hotel mid afternoon and was told that the phone was repaired and housekeeping would do something about the odor. When we returned from our day of sightseeing and went to the room, it smelled like a hint of roses in addition to the other stench! We again requested a different room. At this point we were given a nice room with a small balcony and a wonderful view of the Eiffel tower and Notre Dame. On a funny note, the bathroom partition (they don't really have bathroom doors, just frosted glass partitions) didn't close at all! And, the bathroom sink leaked, dripping onto the floor. Those issues really didn't affect our night, but for a hotel that was just opened 8 months ago, they have serious problems. And, according to the Tripadvisor review of hotel amenities (done by Expedia), the beds in this hotel were supposedly Sleep Number beds. They were not. We have one of these beds at home and can set your own \"sleep number\" based on how soft/firm you like your mattress. The beds at this hotel were very comfortable, but definetly not Sleep Number. The hotel does offer wi-fi, but only in the lobby area and for a fee. We could have gotten a cable to use in the room, but that was more expensive. We did not have breakfast at the hotel because it was too expensive and there are lovely cafes right in the area.

Now the rooms are a little pricey but worth it for the location. Now to solve the issue which so many have said about the showers leaking onto the floor! The first shower I took spilled all over the floor, so I decided to investigate why. What they have done here is they have purposely almost blocked the shower trap with silicone and tape, resulting in the water draining very slowly and flooding the floor, in turn the guest will quickly turn off the shower and save the hotel on their water heating bill! Look, its a bit of cheap trick but that is the only little thing that I could say against the hotel.

In the so called bathroom there were no shelves on which one could put ones toilet bag nor indeed anything at all and there was no towel rail for the hand towels and the towel rails for the bath towels and the hand towels (as there was nowhere else to put the hand towels) was so small the towels barely fitted. Also the wash basin tap whilst again looking good was a pain to work especially with wet hands, which of course was when one was using it.

If you get to a station and the train has already left, another one isn't more than two minutes behind it. The staff are helpful with giving maps and circling directions where/ ever you need. All this being said, we thought it was interesting that it seemed like all the guests were American too! About the room...The hotel is brand spanking new with a quirky, modern look. For example, the motif of the entire hotel is magenta and black; the carpet in our room is even striped with those colors! We splurged for the executive room/king bed which basically means that we got a bigger bathroom because the bed is not a king at all by American standards, and the room barely fits our two large suitcases on the floor space. From what I understand, this is a good deal of room for paris compared to other hotels. The major plus about our room is the balcony! there are two large floor to ceiling windows that open up to a balcony with a table and chairs. We were told that we wouldn't be able to see the Eiffel Tower from our room, but we have th most amazing view of it. Just sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine in hand...a beatiful view. Also in the distance is the Arc de Triomphe but you have to strain a little to see it.

Cons - Hit of miss service, poor value ($200 a night for a tiny room), almost no space for clothing storage, low quality (and expensive) internet service. This hotel is located steps from Notre Dame so it's quite central. It's located near a slew of eateries and pubs, as well as a metro stop, so anything you may want is within walking distance or quick public transport connection. Everything is well designed in the hotel, and it's got a modern, clean feel to it. The rooms have some significant positive which I should mention like the powerful and responsive cooling system (which was amazing), and an amazing bathroom, which was top notch and full of flashy features. They also give you nice little extras like a kettle with coffee and tea, a good quality flat screen TV, and a decently stocked minibar. On the downside, in comparison to most other international locations, the rooms are tiny. They also feature very little in the way of clothing storage space (a bit of a problem for 2 people staying multiple days). But for Paris, as everyone is brainwashed into saying, it's a normal size. I kind of got the feeling the standard rooms here were designed to give you just enough space to make you not complain, but not an inch more. Regarding the service, we felt that it was quite spotty . First, we asked for an 8am wake up call on our first day. It unapologetically came at 830am. No reason except that they forget. The room service also messed up a few times as well; we didn't get replacements for our toilet paper, and the towels were simply fixed up and straightened rather than changed. They also forget to do random, seemingly simple things, like leaving a bath mat, and changing the spoons after we used the ones we got for coffee. I also have to mention that the hotel internet service is poor quality and a bit of a rip off. They offer you various data allotments that range in price from 5 euros to 20 euros. The data you buy is allocated to 24 hour time-blocks and does not roll over. So, if you don't use your data allotment for that period you are out of luck. Also, even if you pay for internet in the room, you still have to pay to use the wireless internet in the lobby. Not exactly fair. You would think at 200 euros a night for a small, standard room, they would add in complimentary internet access, at the very least in the lobby. No such luck. It's quite mind boggling that this is their policy, especially when so many hotels nowadays are making it a free perk for guests. One final thing regarding the rooms; the value is a bit on the poor side. Yes, you get the great location and the new, clean room. But you will also pay about $200 a night for something that really amounts to a 2, maybe 3 star hotel. In comparison, we got a 5 star hotel in Berlin for about $150. Yes, Paris isn't Berlin, I know. But knowing that your paying so much for such a tiny space makes it feel like a rip off. Paris is always a tough place to find a good room at a good price. So, in the end, I do recommend this property. I should say, I don't recommend it because it's one of the best in it's class in the world, but simply because it's somewhat better than other hotels I've stayed at in Paris.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cCan't Say Enough About Location\u201d", "Author": "bcrichter", "ReviewID": "UR69003092", "Content": "I have to agree with most of the previous reviews. The location of this hotel could not be any better. It is literally 150 feet from the entrance to the St. Michel Metro station which will provide access to almost any location in the city with a maximum of one transfer (also happens to be on the RER B line with direct service to the CDG Airport). In addition, you are seconds away from the bustling latin quarter, but you don't pay for it with noisy rooms at night. You could probably hit Notre Dame with a baseball throw from the roof of the hotel. To top it off, there's a convenience store next door that sells fresh fruit and all the essentials that you'll need in your room (i.e. toiletries, soda, beer, wine, snacks). Room: The room we had was great. All rooms in Paris hotels are small (with the exception of the super luxury hotels, but obviously you pay for that), so the size shouldn't surprise anyone. In the end it provides all the room necessary. The bed is very comfortable and unlike most hotels in paris, the bathrooms are quite modern and convenient. The only complaint we had about our room is that the door to the bathroom is sort of a restaurant kitchen sort of door opening in and out with no latch, detracting from privacy a bit. we opted to pay a bit extra for a room with a small balcony with views of the Eiffel Tour. The balcony was a great place to sit in the evening and have a drink before or after dinner. Service: I think it needs to be mentioned that while this hotel is incredibly comfortable and well equipped, people need to understand it is not a LUXURY hotel. The staff simply is not going to provide the same service as you might expect from the staff at a hotel of this price in the US or some other countries. Overall, we found the staff to be quite friendly. Having lived in Paris before, we didn't need much help in the way of restaurant advice, directions, etc., so I can't speak directly on this matter, but I did overhear the staff giving restaurant recommendations to other guests and they did not appear to take the time to inquire about the desires of those guests before recommending restaurants. They seemed to just provide recommendations of restaurants close to the hotel, which might not always have been best. So, take it for what its worth, but don't expect a dedicated concierge, because its not that type of hotel. Also, 20 euros for breakfast is highway robbery. Don't pay it as there are numerous options in walking distance with similar or better fare for far less. Amenities: The roof-top deck is really the highlight of the amenities. I can't imagine there are many other hotels at this price with similar decks. You have a panoramic view of the City highlighted by the Eiffel Tour, Notre Dame, the Pantheon and Sacre Coure. I highly recommend heading up there around midnight to see the Eiffel Tour sparkle at midnight. The hotel offers internet for a price and also has computer terminals in the lobby for a fee. There is also a full service bar. Summary: If you're looking for a comfortable, clean, modern hotel at a reasonable price and care more about location than status, this is your place. To be this close to all the great options on the Left Bank, Ille St. Louis and Ille de Cite' and not have a noisy bedroom is invaluable and they should be applauded for their work. We will definitely stay in this hotel again in the future and will recommend it to friends.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cHidden modern gem with AMAZING views of Paris\u201d", "Author": "catspat", "ReviewID": "UR67767027", "Content": "I stayed here with my partner and my parents (separate rooms) on their first trip to Europe.

The staff was excellent and extremely helpful as far as aiding us in making plans and navigating around the city. We were provided with a surprise upgrade to an executive suite which was HUGE by Paris standards - very contemporary decor, continually spotless, with a jacuzzi tub and very large balcony with a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. The rooftop garden was an added plus when relaxing after very long days sightseeing. Thanks to the entire staff who were awesome and made our stay the most wonderful week possible!

The hotel is brand new and the location is superb. Very close to the St. Michel metro station (which by the way has a very helpful staff for buying the right metro ticket for your stay). The front desk staff at the hotel still needs a little bit of work, but they do their job and were very helpful to us in accommodating two rooms on the same floor. The rooms have a good size. We had an Eiffel tower view room (#711) and a regular room overlooking the street (#702). Room 711 is located next to the elevator but you would never know it, absolutely no sound, however we could hear sounds coming from the room next door, but nothing to complain about. This particular room has a different layout that other rooms because it is in the very corner of the hotel. The bathroom is large and has 2 large windows overlooking the Eiffel tower. The room has windows from end to end also overlooking the same view and since the bathroom door is frosted glass, you will get the light in the room at night. If you are looking for a dark room for sleeping, this is not it. The bed is queen size and very comfortable. Slept like a baby. There is a veranda that you can go out to with a small table and two low chairs. Very nice to take pictures of the surrounding area and sit around for a while. The only odd thing about this room is that there is a column dividing the room in two and it sits right next to the bed, but they have placed the flat screen tv on a wall that is on an angle so we could watch tv fine, not that we had any time to watch tv. By the way, they only have two channels in English (CNN international and BBC news). Room 702 is a square room, facing the street but you would never know it either as it is very quiet. Unlike 711, room 702 has one large window so closing the curtains will give you complete darkness. It gets dark very late in Paris in the summer, something to think about if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I found this room to be more comfortable than 711 as far as space is concerned because there were no weird angles. The bathroom is also a bit smaller and also has a frosted glass door. One of the tub/shower walls is frosted glass to let light in from the room window so privacy may be an issue. Both rooms have safes and are easy to use. You will need to slide your key card into a slot near the door in order for the electricity of the room to work, which means that when you leave, the air conditioning will stop working. However, the ac units here work very well and cool down these rooms very fast. They also have a cool \"do not disturb\" system where all you do is press a button on your door that lights up a red light on the front of the door that blinks. The hotel charges 10 Euros for wifi but it never worked for us on our iphones, so we got a credit at the end of our stay. They do have two computers in the lobby that you can check your email if necessary. It was not that expensive to use, we only paid around 6 Euros to check two email accounts in two separate occasions. The hotel has a bar and an outdoor section with tables but we didn't have much time to experience the amenities of this property, however everything here looked very clean and new. We booked this hotel with breakfast included. It is buffet style and includes scrambled eggs, sausages (which I heard people raving about them), bacon and potatoes. It also included an assortment of bakery items, fruits, juices, coffee, etc. The dining room staff was very attentive and there was a lot of room here with enough tables. I've heard some contrasting comments about breakfast at this hotel. We thought it was convenient, quick and easy, that way we didn't have to worry about finding a place to get something to eat, but there are so many bakeries in this city, that you would never go without food if you need to eat something. The biggest positive of this hotel is its location and proximity to the metro and the Notre Dame Cathedral. The Cathedral is a literally a short walk. You may also find it close enough to the Louvre but we were too tired to walk that far. The metro is fairly easy to use in Paris so taking one to the museum gets you in the door. You'll also find that the St. Michel line takes you directly to the Eiffel Tower and other famous attractions. The best way to experience the metro is to purchase a day pass that lets you use it all day without having to buy anything else. You'll need the ticket to enter the metro and exit it as well in some instances. Tip: There is a small store right next to the hotel if you want to buy some water, soft drinks, fruits or something to snack in the room. Since the rooms have refrigerators, we were able to keep our drinks cool all the time. There is also a nice restaurant on the same block of the hotel as you walk toward the St. Michel station. The food was great and not expensive.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.
