The hotel offers breakfast which can be jam packed with people and kids, but it has better than average selections (hot and cold plates). The lobby is very recently updated, well done.

If your expecting a full service hotel in downtown, this hotel is a compromise. The area is a bit off to the side and can be noisy due to the proximity to I5 and the ramps to it.

MINUS: heat and cool control easy to find on wall, but with print on controls so tiny it is barely legible. A wall sign would help. System works well but is very slow to respond. Very centrally located; hourly shuttle and nearly public transportation makes moving about easy. Suggestion: tip the shuttle drivers; they can be very helpful. Avoid a car--and if you have guests, use inexpensive self-pay lot next door or street parking--street free after 6 and on weekends, as all over Seattle. Breakfast space becomes a kitchen for lunch and dinner, but there were so few customers that it can be difficult to get attention. Front desk interaction is necessary for small purchases and is always busy with counseling about how-to-get-where. Polite but can involve long, long waits. Help yourself when possible. APRIL 2009 PLUS: Breakfast buffet: hot eggs and meats, yogurts in two sizes and including low-carb, breads, muffins, make-own waffles, hard eggs, potatoes, hot oatmeal and toppings, cold cereals and juices; excellent coffee/tea in breakfast room and lobby (24 hours). Totally non-smoking, like all Marriotts. Open business center with two-computers and a printer for each, off lobby. Flawless free wired and wireless internet in rooms, wireless in lobby. Newspaper outside door on weekdays, in lobby on weekends. Inside pool and hot tub. Free access to huge 24-hour fitness across the street. Starbucks (closed weekends) across the street. Walk to midtown or downtown or Pike Market; hotel provides by-reservation shuttle on the hour with stops at Westlake Center, Space Needle, Convention Center. The giant, rally giant flagship REI and upscale shops (and BLIX, probably one of Seattle\u2019s best spa spaces) one block walk. Public transportation on Denny (#8 bus) runs between Cap Hill and Queen Anne, past Seattle Center. Valet parking only, with modest rates for short-term visitors, $20 overnight. Recent (fabulous) lobby, breakfast room and bar renovation. Exceptionally helpful and friendly employees. Quiet despite extreme proximity to freeway. Coin laundry with several machines for guests, 2nd floor; $1 each wash and dry when I was there. Priceline 2.5 or 3-star, South Lake Union, $65-72 in winter/spring (desk was quoting $109 to walk-ins one day of my stay); higher in summer/fall. Hotel is owned by a TX company but Marriott-branded; in most of these hotels, Marriott provides management training and staff is well-trained. MINUS: Constant traffic on Yale Avenue can make vehicle exit risky and difficult. At all costs avoid driving at commuter hours (morning or 3-6). Valet and front desk folks will make route suggestions. Starbucks closed on weekends. Unclear how to retrieve messages from room telephone. Breakfast room can be very crowded; to avoid this go early, and avoid late hours. Room refrigerator not easily set and was extremely cold; it froze fruit, water and flowers! Ample hot water but slow to run hot (3-4 minutes late at night; most hotels are instant-hot)", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I'd expected!\u201d", "Author": "Westm0", "ReviewID": "UR63426700", "Content": "Had a great few nights at the Marriott Springhill Suites. Was in town for some sightseeing with a friend who'd never been to Seattle before, and this hotel was a good \"home base\" despite it being a short walk away from the tourist core. Friendly and attentive staff, modern, trendy, aquatic look throughout the main floor, and the lounge/bar was well attended by people wining and dining. Taxis took forever to arrive each time we'd asked the front desk staff to call one for us. Later we realized it's because they have a contract with the orange cabs only! Call a yellow cab from your room, or insist the staff call them for you. I found they were faster to arrive than the orange company (maybe they have more cars?). Location was fine. We took Howell St (Olive turns into it if you're coming from downtown) to and from the hotel during the day and night. Never felt vulernable or nervous, the area is pretty quiet, just parkades and office buildings in the immediate neighbourhood. That being said, we found the nearby Habesha restaurant to be our favourite place of the trip! We'd never tried Eithiopian food before, and this place was fantastic. Classy, great staff, dim lighting, nice ambiance, and AMAZING FOOD. Highly recommend starting with the Selata (salad) and sharing the chicken and lamb entrees. The hotel's breakfast buffet significantly exceeded our expectations. I'd never been to a hotel where their waffles are any more than toaster eggos, frozen belgiums, or the like. Springhill Suites had a separate station set up with batter, hot waffle irons (with clear DIY instructions), strawberries (in syrup), cans of whipped cream, and syrup. The rest of the buffet was hot and standard, with cereals, scrambled eggs, sausages, home fries, condiments/hot sauces, oatmeal, baked goods (bagels, muffins, scones, cinnamon buns, bread, etc), fresh raw fruit (whole oranges and apples), individual yogurts, and juice. Lots of seating. The only place in seattle I've found that has free breakfast. Saved us a ton of money. What else...the room! We had a King Suite and found it fine. Nothing special, lots of space. We had a room right beside the freeway, request one away from here (if they have any?). No mirror in the bathroom/shower area. It's in the separate sink area. Good I guess if someone's having a shower, and someone else wants to get ready. Free internet was a plus! Follow the instructions on the desk. Overall, I'd stay here again.

The hotel was recently renovated, so the lobby, bar & restaurant areas were pleasing to the eye. The rooms were nice as well, but they were definitely basic/bare bones. The free continental breakfast was great, but the food at the restaurant for lunch, dinner and room service was just mediocre. Worth it to eat there at the bar for reduced price bar snacks/light bites during happy hour, but would not recommend eating there otherwise for the price. That being said, it's at least a 10 minute walk to any other decent restaurant, so you may feel forced to dine there for the convenience. You can tell that they have tried hard to make this hotel better. The decor in the common areas was very pleasant/modern, and the space did seem quite clean/well-maintained. However, I felt that the management missed the mark on several key issues. Most obviously, they had NO idea whatsoever that there was a marathon in the city that weekend, and offered no service to the hundreds of runners that were staying at the hotel. It seems insane that they would not have known such a major event was taking place. The hotel typically runs a \"convenience shuttle\" to other nearby areas of the city (basically designed to prevent you from walking around the less-than-desirable neighborhood where it's located), but refused to run the shuttle once earlier in the morning on race day to get runners (who had to head to the race area before daybreak) to the race area. This seemed like a very major miss, and a sign of bigger things that were lacking as far as the management of the establishment. Overall, I will say that they tried hard, were willing to work with the guests, and very pleasant.

First, the rate was cheap compared to other hotels that are \"downtown\" - technically this place is a good 15-20 minute walk into downtown. The Mariott has a Best Rate guarantee and I went from paying $150 for a King Suite to $89 for a King Suite (excluding taxes). I found the better rate on the Seattle Tourism Board website and Mariott quickly recognized and beat the cheaper deal....so we're off to a good start. Location: Hotel is beside the I-5. There's a lot of one-way streets so it was hard to find the right street to turn onto. Therefore, take the Stewart Exit and stay in the left hand lane. Yale Avenue is like the 2nd intersection. I strongly recommend requesting at check-in for a room furthest from the freeway and as high as you can. We stayed with our 9-month old daugther and she slept so well during the night and I attribute that to our room - 726. It definitely appears to be in an up and coming area - new condos being developed, great little shops towards the REI - but there was a shady patch near the bus depot along Stewart. I felt totally safe walking around during the day but I would prefer to take a taxi or use the Free Hotel Shuttle at night. Make sure you reserve the shuttle first. Parking: $20 per night for valet parking but you get in/out privileges. I would suggest calling 10 minutes ahead when you pick up your car. Once we called three times and even had to ask the front desk to check if anyone was there. Amenities: You do get a hot breakfast - sausages, egg, waffles, toast, muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, juice - but get there when it starts. It was already packed by the time we went down which was just 5 minutes past the opening time. We didn't try the pool but my husband and brother-in-law did use the 24 Hour Fitness pass (it's across the street beside a Starbucks) and really liked the facility. Room: Wow, a King Suite was great. Only downfall was you get a \"privacy wall\" which is just a short slab of drywall that just separates your face from the rest of the room while you sleep. We got a mini-fridge (freezer didn't really work, just kept things cool), a microwave, sink and even a dishcloth. It was spacious for 3 adults but once you unfold the sofa bed there's not much room for our buggy or even a crib. The decor is like any other hotel chain - clean with some patterns. You get free wireless or plug-in Internet and there's a flat screen tv. I felt the bed was too hard but my husband thought it was great, so go figure. Summary: For the price we paid, we had an excellent time. We were within walking distance to downtown where all the shops and restaurants are, Pike Place, and REI.

Nevertheless I was a little disappointed by the selection, which seemed to be limited somewhat. they ran out of waffle mix early on, and they couldn't bus the tables quickly enough. Also, I did 'catch' some of the staff exiting the kitchen actively chewing on something, which was very unprofessional. We had a late flight, meaning that we had to check-out whilst they secured our bags for the afternoon. On our return, we enquired about if there somewhere we could freshen up, and the staff recommended the Gym across the street, which hosts guests of the hotel free of charge. However, when we asked about towels, we were told the gym SOLD towels. There was no effort by the staff to get a couple of their towels for us to use, and it was only on our suggestion that there may be some in the hotel pool area, that they though it was a logical idea. Even so, they expected us to go and get them although i felt they should have tried to do all they could to aid us. As a Marriot Silver Elite member, I expected more from the staff servicewise and this was the most disappointing thing. Starbucks/Subway across the street shut on weekends.

It was my husband and I and our daughter. All rooms have only double beds unless you order a king room. Most hotel rooms I have stayed in offer two queen beds. Room was very stuffy and there was no way to create a more unstuffy environment, we even turned on the A/C and ran the fan. The toilet was not in very good working order and we had to call housekeeping on several occasions. On Thanksgiving day there was no room service until 5:00pm. We were visiting with family so we wanted some appetizers in the room. We had to go down to the bar and pick these up. Also, not much space in the room to eat. The breakfast is fair, but very boring with styrofoam plates and plastic silverware. My grandson did enjoy the indoor pool and sauna. That was very nice. Parking $18.00 - when our son and his family came to visit, his parking fee was $10.00.

I am a very light sleeper yet the room I had on the highway didn't bother me t all--the traffic flow is constant--no horns to bother you. The traffic sounds like a regualr window air conditioner--not a bother at all. Other people have written how then had 5 people in the room and were surprised at the lack of services--NO regualr hotel room can accomodate 5 people--these people shoul dhaave gotten two rooms, not one, so its not the hotel's fault that they were unhappy. The shuttle van is also a great value and an excellent service.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNice stay...

Myself and 5 others stayed in one room that had two queen beds and a pull out sofa bed. Surprisingly it wasn't as cramped as you may think! The beds were comfy, the room was somewhat spacious, the view was terrible, but the location was great. It seemed like it was going to be a long walk to the shoppping area but it wasn't bad at all, probably less then 8 blocks, it was myself and two other women at night, and we felt completely comfortable. The parking situation worked out well for us because it is valet and I'd rather just pay someone then to hassel with downtown parking. There is a Starbucks right across the street so that is also nice, the breakfast is excellent and the eating area as well. The lines are long so get down there early! The bathroom was huge. The only complaints I had about it, which one is kind of silly, is that our bathroom was handicap accesable (wheelchair), which is great except that none of us needed it, and water pretty much went everywhere becasue the shower had no enclosure just a curtain, so that wheelchairs to get in and out easily. And the second BIGGEST complaint was that the toilet would clog easily and it would not flush, so we had to go down to the lobby every time we had to use the restroom. I called the front desk, and physically went down to the front desk, but they never sent anyone to fix it. I can only hope that they fixed it after we checked out.

I noticed they had a computer area where you can check email which I think is a great amenity! Things I didn't like: At check-in the clerk did not give us any information at all, not even to tell us where our room was or when breakfast was or anything, so I had to call down to the front desk later when I had questions. No opening windows, so no fresh air! The bartender was a complete snob and very rude to not only us but other people in the lounge. He had a major attitude problem! I didn't hear any of the traffic noises that people have complained of, but there seemed to be a fan on in one of the rooms around us all night long and that kept me awake!

Every hotel employee we talked to seemed really friendly and eager to help with our questions. I was amazed in this day and age. The L-shaped hotel pool is tiny, but looked like fun for kids, and there is a hot-tub and exercise room as well. Breakfast was indeed abundant. We could make our own waffles, then add scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and fruit. Also available were bagels, muffins, oatmeal, yogurt--just about everything you could have wanted. One morning there was sort of a long line, waiting to make waffles, and then waiting for scrambled eggs. But that's being picky. Our room was really nice (we asked for one away from the freeway after reading reviews here earlier) and it was still a bit noisy, but hey, it's the city. It felt like a deluxe room, considering the reasonable price, with nice bedding and even art on the walls that we really liked. We could even see the Space Needle a bit from our window. The shuttle runs hourly, so it wasn't as though we could reserve it to go to a certain place at a certain time. But it worked out well for us, and when the shuttle missed us by just a minute when we needed to return from the Space Needle, they promptly paid our cab fare without my even having asked.

I thought I was saving my company money by staying here rather than one of the hotels closer to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, but in the end I spent the same amount of money it would have cost me to stay in a closer hotel. The biggest problem I had with this hotel is its location. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Convention Center due to the construction and the traffic lights. Try doing this in the rain a few times and you\u2019ll see how much of a problem it is. Going to the Public Market and other tourist sites will require an even further walk. Expect to be very tired at the end of the day, especially if you are traveling here from the East Coast like I was. Be careful with the valet parking. I woke up on the third day of the conference to drive my wife back to the airport. When I went to pick up my car, the valet came back and told me that my car had a flat tire. I am rather suspicious about how that could have happened. We did not run over anything during our drive from the rental car office to the hotel, and there were no apparent problems with the tires when we picked up the car. I have no way of proving if the valets caused the flat, but I am peeved that no one noticed the flat until I had to go pick up the car. Just imagine if I had discovered this on the day I was supposed to leave Seattle! As it was, I barely got any time to visit the Space Needle after waiting for roadside assistance to fix the flat. I also had to shell out an additional $30 to get my wife to the airport via taxi. The breakfasts aren\u2019t bad when you consider that they are included in the price of your room. I would be more disappointed with them if I had to pay an additional fee for them. The potatoes were usually lukewarm and the pancakes and french toast had that institutional taste. They also pre-measure waffle batter for the make-your-own waffle bar, but many days the amount of batter they gave you was not enough to make a complete waffle. I also had an issue with the housekeeping. I returned to my room at the end of the day, only to find that the glasses in the bathroom had not been cleaned. I know this because my wife\u2019s lipstick was still on one of the glasses! It was things like these that gave me an uneasy feeling about this hotel. All in all, I have to say that I was disappointed with this hotel. It was not a bad experience, but it wasn\u2019t up to the high quality I have come to expect from Marriott Hotels.", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cpost cruise stay\u201d", "Author": "dougandshelley", "ReviewID": "UR5802416", "Content": "We booked this hotel for a 3 night post Alaskan cruise stay in downtown Seattle. The hotel itself is located just west of I-5 but we had no issues with highway noise. While it's not the most convenient location, they do offer a free shuttle to the convention center, space needle and weslake mall. All are within the free zone for downtown busses which make getting around Seattle very easy. Unfortunately, they are not very effecient with their shuttle. It rarely left the hotel on time and, despite calling the hotel to arrange pick-up, we were forgotten twice. Once resulting in a 45 minute wait standing by the side of the road. We found it more convenient to walk the 6 blocks or so to the first bus stop in the free zone rather than ride the shuttle and walk the addtional 1 1/2 blocks to the first free zone bus stop. The rooms were very comfortable and large. The hotel advertises a restaurant but it really does not have much of one. It's more of a lounge that serves food on cocktail tables. The free breakfast was very good with more than the average selection for a hotel continental breakfast. The weight room had very little equipement but guest can use the 24 hour fitness center across the street. The hotel also has a small indoor pool and a hot tub. The indoor pool is not heated and was a little on the chilly side in my opinion. If many people want to use the pool at once, it will get very crowded very fast. While there are few restaurants close to the hotel, there are dozens within a short distance from the shuttle stops. A $4 to $6 cab ride over to Lake Union would get you to some very nice restaurants. We rented a car for only one day to drive out to Mt. Rainer. There are 3 or 4 car rental companies within a short walk from the hotel. We rented from Hertz which is in the convention center. I could have taken the free shuttle but was able to walk the distance in about 15 minute. Walking was easier and probably quicker than waiting for the hotels free shuttle. On check out I did have to remind them that we had booked the room for $129/night. They billed use $199/night. It was corrected quickly when I showed them my confirmation print out. Overall this was a very nice stay and the hotel was very affordable compared to many hotels that were only 4 or 5 blocks away.

The \"Continental Breakfast\" was included in the price, and though we didn't partake, as we only had one night's stay and we wanted something with a little more \"kitsch\", I did get to see the spread, and it looked a little bit better than the average continental. We went to a show at the Paramount Theatre, and walked back to the hotel late at night without any worries, though it is in kind of a quiet business district so there aren't many people around. We're not really the kind of people to spend a lot of time in a hotel room, so if you like a spectacular view or whatever, this might not be the hotel for you, but if you want a clean, reasonably priced hotel with great friendly staff and a good location, stay here.
