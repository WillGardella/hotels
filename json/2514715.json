The room is clean itself and new. My room had a double bed, a kitchenette and a desk. But the rooms are quite small. It was difficult to find a suitable place to keep your suitcases. I ended up putting mine in the closet. I would have expected a larger room for a 4 star hotel. I would have also expected the towels to be clean. One towel had a large yellow stain on it. Another towel was left on the floor by the cleaning staff. Thankfully, they were both different size towels so I did not need to worry about have a body and face towel as there were 2 in every room. The hotel is right beside the World Trade Center (WTC). There is construction going on. Many people complained about the noise. I was their on business so it did not seem to matter. I left early and came back late. I would recommend staying in the area if you look peace and quiet during the evening and night. During the day, I think it is packed with all of the tourists visiting the WTC. To summarize, I think the hotel is a good value 3 star hotel.

The main thing that really impressed me was how well laid out the room was. Although somewhat small, the room never felt that way as every inch was well though out and designed efficiently. The room was tastefully designed with modern furnishings and had all the requisites for a business traveler: free wi-fi, plenty of outlets for charging electronics, ample desk. One really nice touch was the espresso machine in the lobby's \"great room.\" If I had a longer stay I could see lounging in the great room as there was a lovely fireplace and lots of comfortable chairs. Instead after I checked in and got situated, I headed to the lobby lounge (in my socks!) and helped myself to a cappuccino. It was definitely a little treat that made my stay a little nicer. One other thing I thought was a good idea was the self check in/out. You just go up to a kiosk and check in and check out. Saves time waiting for a desk clerk especially for business travelers who invariably are either tired from a long trip or in a rush to head out of town or to a meeting (as I was the next morning when I checked out). The one small negative is the construction across the street on the new World Trade Center memorial. The construction noise started quite early which was not too bad for me since I had to get up early for my meeting but I can see how it would be terrible if one wanted to sleep in.

Was slightly hesitant based on some of the poor reviews. Overall, I am satisfied with my stay at this hotel but if I had paid more, I would have been less satisfied. Below is an overview: Location (all Pros) * Directly overlooks Freedom Tower, view from the restaurant is breathtakingly eerie * Using Airtrain, LIRR, and Line 1 to downtown on Subway, you can get here from JFK with under $20 in roughly one hour - perhaps less if you don't get as baffled by Penn Station, like I do - most people don't. Getting off at Rector St., you only have to walk about 3 small blocks to the hotel. * Neighborhood is quiet. Only drawback is most things close early since this is financial district. However, there is a small Italian restaurant/bar within walking distance with a low priced dinner menu - since not too many customers in the evening. Cleanliness * Pro: The hotel is clean and you can tell it's quite new. The rooms have that Ikea showroom feel and smell. * Con: The shower curtain had a few tiny hairs in it. Not pleasant, but this is common to anywhere. The room felt clean enough to take your shoes off in, but this was the only complaint I had about the cleanliness. Comfort * Pro: Had a desk and comfortable armchair for guests. Worth the price. IPod dock on nightstand - nice touch. * Con: Booked a room with a queen bed. Was traveling with a friend. It was definitely not a queen, slightly larger than a twin - luckily, we're good friends and both quite small. Service: Many of the reviewers warned about the service in this hotel. It seems to be hit or miss. 1) There are two entrances and seemingly not enough staff, which may have been part of the issue 2) Staff not always very helpful or clear: When I called to ask for an iron, the front desk gave a room number to retrieve the items from. After several attempts to enter the room number I was given, a staff member happened to walk by. I asked about an iron. The staff member reached over and opened A CLOSET directly across from the room I was trying to open. The closet was full of supplies, including irons and ironing boards. The incident was funny, but had someone been in the room I was trying to open, this could have been quite embarrassing. 3) Check-in: However, my friend checked us in before I arrived and stated that the man at the front desk was really rude to her. When I arrived, the person at the front was a woman who was very polite. Again, it seems to be hit or miss. 4) Restaurant: Don't bother. Went up for a few cocktails with friends later in the evening. The view was gorgeous, but there seemed to be one waiter on hand and he was wildly incompetent. He kept forgetting that we were there. Not rude, just seemed annoyingly inept. Overall review: * Don't pay over $150/night to stay here or you will be disappointed * Do stay here if it is only a few nights and you are traveling solo or only with one friend * Good for the bargain price, would stay here again solo", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood value, very close to subway, clean and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "salzanojl", "ReviewID": "UR125964931", "Content": "We stayed one night, booked at a discount site.

They are usually cramped rooms with very few amenities in the hotel, earning them the unofficial nickname \"Club Closet\". This one breaks the mold. The rooms are actually fairly large by NYC standards. The hotel is pretty new, so that's probably a big part of why it seems so nice. The lobby has a great lounge area, with cappuccino machine, newspapers, magazines, TV, internet stations and ample seating. On the roof they have an open and airy restaurant, which has a bar for the evening and breakfast buffet in the morning. There is also a rooftop patio to lounge in the warmer months, or just get a good view of the surrounding area. If you are planning to visit the 9/11 memorial, you can get much closer than this. In fact you can see the hotel in the pictures on the memorial website (http://www.911memorial.org/explore-memorial, it's the white building in the back left of the photo). Our room faced the memorial, which is lit up at night. I do strongly suggest visiting it, the tickets are free. If you are driving in, I suggest using the parking lot they are affiliated with, which is on Albany St a block away. If you \"self park\" it's $37/day, compared to the $50 or so at other garages. They will also bill the charge directly to your room. You can find the address for the garage on the directions page of the Club Quarters website. When you get there, it looks closed, but if you tell the guard you are staying at Club Quarters he will remove the various security measures and let you in. I probably shouldn't let out the secret, but unlike most NYC hotels, the room rate at the Club Quarters actually DROPS on the weekend. They get most of their business during the week from business travelers, and so the weekend is pretty dead. As part of their business model though your company needs to be a member in order to make a reservation here. But if you know someone whose company is a member, they can make a reservation for you.

Also great to see a microwave in the room in a New York hotel (I've stayed in a couple of NY hotel and I haven't seen this facility in the room) in a city hotel only in Florida hotel rooms. I found the staff friendly, I wasn't impressed of a 2min working microwave that I reported before going out for the evening just after landing, just to find out that on my return that the maintence man (took a look at it in my absence) but didn't swap it out for a working appliance.

After the second sleepless night, we spoke again to the front desk staff and they very rudely told us that 'once they start a project they don't like to stop until the job is done' and without even checking their computer, they said there was no other room that they could move us to. They then said that they could give us ear plugs if we needed them, but it was too late because we had already purchased our own! A staff member then proceeded to inform us while she was using her cellphone that 'they don't work on Sundays, so we can sleep in then' ... that pretty much sums up the (very poor) customer service that we received.

The location, while not in the thick of tourist activities, was convenient. Several subway lines are within 2-5 minutes walk. Despite what I'd read prior to my arrival, the area is not deserted at night. There definitely aren't crowds of people after dark, but there are several big hotels nearby, and enough bars and pizza/fast food places around that there were always cabs driving around and people walking about, even at 1:00 in the morning. The front desk staff were very helpful and professional. Housekeeping was similarly well-maintained, although the bathroom in my room did smell mildewy. I suspect this has more to do with the lack of ventilation and cheap shower curtain in the bathroom than lack of housekeeping. People who complained that their sheets weren't being changed must not have read the laminated card that was placed on the bed on arrival. If you want fresh sheets, you must put the card on your bed, otherwise they will simply make your bed with the existing sheets. This is clearly explained and certainly not unique to this hotel. Same thing applies for towels (leave them on the floor if you want fresh towels). We originally booked a standard room with queen bed, but upgraded to a much larger room with mini-fridge and microwave for an extra $20/night, and it was surprisingly roomy for Manhattan. The WTC construction really is 24/7, but we requested a room on a higher floor, on the opposite side away from the construction, and we couldn't hear it at all. We DID hear the elevators going all night long. Our room must have shared a wall with the elevator shaft and the walls are thin. I was also disappointed that there wasn't a safe in the room to lock up valuables. My only true complaint about the hotel, however, is with the restaurant. We went there once, for breakfast, and did not have a good experience. The food was fine, but I was not impressed with the service. The hostess did not crack a smile even once. She looked like she truly loathed her job. When we arrived, she offered us the worst table in the place. When I asked for a different table (one that wasn't in the middle of a nearly empty room, in the path of the main aisle used by the servers), she robotically brought us us to a better table and said, \"Here,\" before walking away. Thirty seconds later, a server came and told us not to sit at that table because we were only two people, and told us to \"sit there\", while pointing to a smaller table. We had the buffet, which was fine, however I was irritated to find that they tacked an automatic 18% gratuity on the bill, which I do not think is warranted for a buffet, ESPECIALLY since I had to flag someone down to get coffee and to get a menu, and since the bill was dropped on my table before we'd even finished our first plate. I took a small portion of eggs, not wanting to heap my plate with food and look like a slob, and intended to go back for some fruit, but I was so irritated when our \"server\" dropped the bill on the table when I was still eating (without asking if I wanted anything more), that I had to leave. The automatic gratuity was just icing on the cake. Aside from the restaurant, I'd return to this hotel in a heartbeat.

All of the \"hot tourist spots\" in NYC were easily accessible by subway from the hotel (or short cab rides), yet it was not in a bustling and crowded area, which made it a nice, quiet place to come back to and relax after a day of sightseeing. There were many restaurants and bars close by to choose from and they were all merely blocks away. There was also plenty of sightseeing to do in the Financial District area of the hotel (Wall Street, 9/11 site, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.), although the area around the hotel is a little dead on the weekends. Considering that it was a 4 star hotel, the rate we paid was such a steal. We didn't want to pay a lot of money to stay right in Times Square, and the cheap hotels were too far out in areas like Queens, Bronx, or Long Island, so this was a bargain considering how nice it was and the area. The room was very spacious. There was plenty of room for 3 of us girls to move about, with all our bags, suitcases, clothes strewn about, in addition to the 3 mirrors and overabundance of outlets, which was nice when we all got ready at the same time. We had a queen size bed and a pullout couch, both of which were very comfortable.

It was scorching in NYC the last weekend in July and since my husband likes to walk everywhere HE loved being able to take water with him every day as he was heading out into the heat . Front desk staff was very helpful andhe had no worries about leaving his luggage and purchases at the front desk when he checked out. This included a large Gucci bag with a pair of boots for me which really could have easily gone \" missing \" . His flight was not until 8pm and check out was at 11am . His luggage and parcels remained with them all day and obviously nothing was taken or even messed with . Lastly I wanted to make a comment re the World Trade Centre construction , many people have written that the noise was un bearable but my husband was not bothered by it at all , He said that yes you could hear them in the morning but he wanted to be up and out of the hotel by 9am anyway and as for the evening and nighttime to sleep , they stopped working so he was able to get as much rest as needed . Overall it was a great experience. Tip : NYC can get quite pricey to eat . My husband found a fantastic place to eat j, a cafe just around the corner from the hotel called Arome . He ate there every morning ....because for $3 , he got a made to order custome Egg White only , veggie omelette with 4 peices of Toast and coffee or tea ...THATS RIGHT I SAID $3 !!!

It is efficient, clean, new and ideally located close to Wall Street. I recommend it for those doing business in the area. My opinions and recollections below are based on a 2-weeknight stay for a business conference which was about a 10-minute walk away. Check-in and check-out are efficient as they can be done on a self-serve basis on the terminals provided. Upon check-in you swipe your VISA and out comes a receipt with your room number and rate information and with the help of the receptionist your room keycard is quickly setup and you are on your way. Elevators are right beside front desk and to the left of the elevators is a business centre. Keycard swipe is required for the elevator to function which is expected and appreciated from a security standpoint. In the main lobby of each floor is a unique feature, with that being a station where you can fill up provided sealable water bottles for future use at a machine that dispenses filtered water. I had a standard room. Decor is very much like an office building like other individuals mentioned. Very narrow but clean and new; furnishings look well put together and honestly the style seems as if it was determined via a joint venture between Ikea and Umbra. Amble closet space with a few hangers (including one for delicates) plus shelf space, washroom was basic - shower only, stainless steel sink with granite top; toilet comes with small/large flush; hand soap, body bar, shampoo and mouthwash all provided. Two towels, a hairdryer, and two glasses but no further amenities beyond these must-have items. Vanity mirror outside the washroom. The work station is convenient; glass countertop with wooden trim. Coffeemaker, dining menu, plus a few useful books (dictionary, Steven Covey's First Things First, The Book of Lists, Inside the Apple), phone, retractable desk lamp and flat-screen Philips TV. The neatest thing was the monitor cable which allows you to watch what's on your laptop on the screen. Only one free plug though beside the coffee maker. There is a sofa chair and lamp beside the bigger-than-King-size bed which turns out to be two twins put together, plus a huge wooden headboard with two night lights on each side. A large framed photo presents itself opposite to the bed, and to the right is the window. Room 427 doesn't have much of a view, but others do have a great view of WTC from what I understand. Noise from the construction outside was not an issue. I was beside the laundry room and could not hear it. You can hear the sound of people rolling away the laundry so if you're a light sleeper that might be a problem. But not for me. Can't comment on the fitness facilities but they are available and on the 6th floor. There is a dining room on the 20th floor as well. Didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment on that either. If I was here for business again I would definitely stay here. If I was here as a tourist and ran out of options in cooler areas of the city, i would not. However, given the location, Chinatown and the East Village are quite close and if you wanted to, the Statue of Liberty is also near by.

When we arrived after two hours of searching I was whining and when it said \"Suite Upgrade, $40.00\" on the counter my fiance asked for it and the girl (perhaps because of me) gave it to us for $15.00. We had a very large room for NY, with kitchenette and table, bed area, hall with bathroom and a sitting room overlooking the ground zero site (not the happiest of views, but historic). Kind of an awkward layout but comfortable. The room was clean and quiet and, unlike at the midtown location, there were people to help when we needed washcoths, Splenda, whatever. Decor is all light woods and translucent panels, easy on the eyes. The hotel also has a restaurant on the roof which overlooks the Hudson and downtown (and as they out it \"the rising Freedom Tower\") where they had a decent breakfast buffet on weekends (a la carte during the week). The restaurant has an indoor area, nicely elegant without being uber-chic, and an \"outdoor\" enclosed area. It was enjoyable. For the money paid this was a very good hotel experience.

I believe that will only last until the outdoor area is open. The place is ready and is really nice. For the money you cant beat it. Clean, modern and easy to check in/out.

But we managed to stay for $199 a night for 3 nights and thought we got a lot for our money - a clean room, clean bathroom, nice closet, free WiFi, free breakfast (even though it was probably only for a short time since they're under construction and they didn't even have tables!), etc. What I didn't particularly like was the fact that our room was facing out down a small hallway with a direct line to the elevator. Since the walls are pretty thin and / or the acoustics in the hall are a little scant, we would be woken up by people congregating in the hall waiting for the elevator. Anywhere else this wouldn't be a problem, but if I were to stay here again, I'd request to NOT be by the elevator. That really is the only complaint I have about the place. Even the construction and lack of breakfast tables didn't bother me! You might be far away from things in Midtown, but the subway is only about a block away off Rector. We had no problem taking the subway uptown to hit all of our touristy stops. We really did nothing downtown but walk around the WTC area. I recommend taking this hotel up on its low rates right now, because it's a high quality facility and rates will probably sky rocket once everything's done!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood for a short stay in NYC\u201d", "Author": "so3003", "ReviewID": "UR64047237", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at Club Quarters WTC for a few nights at the end of April, at the start of a holiday in the US. It's in a prime location right over the site of the planned Freedom Tower / 9-11 memorial in Downtown Manhattan. We booked a studio suite through Hotelclub, but when we checked in the first room we were given was a standard room, so they moved us to a studio room. To be honest, there was very little difference between the two room types, and if anything their website is a bit misleading when it infers the studios are much bigger rooms - have a look at my photos to see what I mean. Despite the above our room was fine, definitely spacious enough for two people, and in addition to the Queen bed there was a separate desk, microwave, fridge, flatscreen TV etc. The bathroom was a decent size, though the toilet-roll holder fell off the wall on the first day! Decor, furnishings etc were very clean and modern. As others have mentioned the hotel is still under construction, though really you're only aware of this if you 1) see the signs about this in the lobby or 2) meet the workmen in the hallways. We bumped into some one morning and it turned out the room next to us was being \"installed / built\", but we really weren't disturbed at all by the work. The construction work means there's no hotel restaurant, so the hotel provides a free buffet breakfast in one of their meeting rooms - very good selection of muffins, cereal, fruit juice, coffee etc, and the inclusion of breakfast was what made this a super good deal in New York. They didn't do room service, but instead offered a delivery service from local takeaways to your room. The club \"living room\" area of the hotel is very well appointed, and is a significant positive for this hotel. There are computers with colour printing, and a dedicated \"boarding pass\" computer/printer every morning to get your lastminute documents before heading for the airport. In terms of hotel location it's right in the heart of downtown, only a couple of minutes walk from Battery Park (and ferry to Statue of Liberty), not too far from the Subway, and being next to the WTC site makes it a good landmark for taxis, airport buses etc to aim at. I'd go back to this hotel, though next time I'd probably just book a standard room.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fantastic rooms, odd breakfast set-up\u201d", "Author": "Conomo", "ReviewID": "UR61211192", "Content": "Stayed here for one night and loved the downtown location & rooms. They have floor-ceiling windows, wonderful new amenities, very tech saavy and environmentally conscious. This hotel will probably sky-rocket in price once the construction ends. The only odd thing was breakfast - it was a fantastic, fresh continental selection, but there were no tables for eating. The hotel provided boxes to \"takeaway\" your meal. So, we toasted our bagel, scooped fresh fruit, poured good coffee and juice and then, returned to our room to dine. The hotel is still without a restaurant. Also, the parking deal $25/day with a local garage is fantastic for NYC.

While the hotel is under construction, they are offering a nice continenta; breakfast spread. There is also a managers reception/happy hour in the evenings offering beer wine and cheese. The value of the room at just over $200 was good for the area and I was very happy with the room. I got a corner room on the 15th floor which had a flat screen tv at the foot of the bed with cables to hook up a laptop or other video source via component cables. There was another tv at the end of the small workspace which could be viewed from the table or from the easy chair which could convert to single bed. There was also the added benefit of both a microwave and small fridge. There are filtered water machines in the halls with water bottles that you can fill up for your day of sightseeing. The fitness room was adequate with 3 treadmilIs, free weights, an adjustable bench, eliptical and 2 other machines? The first floor has a number of workstations which you can use to check email, surf the web, and they even have a color printer you can print to.

I arrived at 12pm and left my bags as check in was not until 3pm. When I came back to check in after dinner, I pleasantly found my bags had already been taken up to my room. I booked a standard room and was given a superior corner room on the 17th floor with amazing views of the Brooklyn Bridge, downtown Manhattan and the river from 3 corners. It really was breathtaking. The quality of furnishings was very high with thick cotton bedsheets, thick blackout curtains and nice towels. There is also unlimited bottled water in the hallway. There was no noise at all from outside, I had a view of the World Trade Center and could not hear the construction work going on. Service was excellent. The concierge were very happy to book tickets for you for theatre, Empire State etc and they charge a $2.50 admin fee or you can book yourself on the free computers they provide in reception. The printers really came in handy as I was able to print out maps for my walk abouts. The only downside I found was breakfast and the reason why I have marked it down by 1 star. It really was chaotic. Breakfast is served in a side room near reception and there are no tables so you have to eat from polystyrene plates off your lap. There is also not a lot of choice. They had cereal, muffins and bagels. The rest of the hotel made up for the poor breakfast. Sunday - Thursday they have beers, soft drinks, cheese & salami 5-7pm which was nice to come back for a small rest before dinner.
