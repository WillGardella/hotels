I have been to numerous thrid world countries and have never stayed in so terrrible of a hotel. There is 1 girl who spoke minimal English. The hotel had the audacity to up the price by over $200.00 American dollars and they actually got away with it. I will only feel compensated if I can make enough travelers realize what a mistake it is to stay there and have the hotel go out of business. The location is good, only if you want to walk any where, no taxi drivers know where the hotel is and it is a little bit of a distance to walk if you are getting to the subway. Also, the hotel itself is located in what looks like the slums. If it is raining outside then the bell hop will not flag a taxi down for you, you have to stand in the rain while they watch. The bathroom is crowded and in pitiful condition. There is nothing that seperates the shower from the toilet, and the toilet clogs daily. The breakfast was a sick joke, literally each time we ate there, we got sick. There is no such thing as room service due to the fact that they don't speak English and even though they have a set menu, almost every thing that I tried to order, they did not have. The bed was the absolute worst! Take a towel outside and lay it down on concrete, then lay on top of your towel, there you go. That is about how comfortable the bed is. There is only one small closet and no drawers, so if you are planning a semi long trip, you will be living in your suitcase. The hotel laundry service sent one of my shirts back unwashed and the front desk couldn't understand me so they charged me anyway.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885489244", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Jewel22"}, {"Content": "Pure Garbage My family and I stayed at this hotel during the Olympic Games and this hotel failed to deliver in a big way.

Beds were hard and carpets were dirty, but I had hot water and clean sheets. Had cool air and electric. Not bad for a Chinese Hotel at less than $30 US a night. Restaurant was okay, but many good restaurants in area. Right next door is a neat little hotpot restaurant where you can get a good meal for under $4 US. For another dollar you can have a Chinese Yanjing Beer - it's good. If you turn left out of the hotel - walk a block and turn left again, you will find a neat little market street. There are several restaurants, some with English menu. If you walk all the way to the end of that street you will find the Alley Cafe. They have American food (coke, burger and fries for $4US )free internet, and can help with setting up trips to the Great Wall and other places. As you are walking down this street about half way down to the left is an alley way that has a Chinese food store. It,s a good place to pick up snacks. This is where the locals shop. The best thing about this hotel is the location. You can walk to the Forbidden City, Tian'an Men Square, Jing Shan Park, Bei Hai Park, Wangfujing Street - all less than 25 Minutes. I even waked to the Lama Temple which took 45 Minutes, but there were several cool hutongs on the way. Somewhere between the hotel and the Lama Temple I found a neat little place - The Pass By Bar - good Mutton and Cheese Pizza. WORST THING about this hotel is that taxi drivers do not know where it is, but I just had them drop me off at Jing Shan Park and walked the 5 mintues to the hotel. Overall, I was pleased with this place. If you want to travel in style, then don't stay here - However, if you like a little adventure and a good Chinese experience then this place is it. Oh yeah - take a good street map with you - you will not find a good one in Beijing - you will need it.

The pictures looked okay, so we said that it was fine. When we got to Beijing, no one knew where the hotel was so we walked around for an hour before finding someone who took us there. We saw the hotel and immediately it looked different than the pictures on the internet. We thought, okay, so what? Then we got to our room and saw how tiny it was. The bathroom is barely big enough for one person and the beds are the hardest thing I have ever slept on in my entire life. It literally felt like sleeping on concrete or plywood. The breakfast buffet in the mornings is not bad at all but the drink seletion is terrible. Also one thing that is pretty bothersome is the fact that so little people that work at this hotel speak good english. In fact we only found one. The other people who speak english cannot really understand any questions you ask. The tours that you book at the hotel are pretty good. They take you to a lot of places but everything is pretty business oriented. They pretty much want you to buy stuff on the tours and if you don't the travel guides tend to get annoyed. I think they make a commission. One really good thing about the hotel that I can say is this, it is in a great location. It's a ten minute walk to the forbidden city and it is located next to this great little miimart where everything is dirt cheap and the people who work there are very sweet.

However we were very disappointed in the Red Wall hotel, where we had rented two rooms for four nights. As we have lived in Asia for 6 years, we are used to different standards, so it is with some knowledge of what is available that this review is given. We expected hard beds, but what we didn't expect was poorly cleaned rooms, no air, and lighting so dim it was hard to see by. We attemped to turn on the air conditioners, but only the circulating fan would turn on, and that didn't change the temperature enough to sleep comfortably. When we complained, we were told that the management didn't allow air conditioning until after May 5th, no matter what the temperature. We were promised fans, but only one was provided. The most upsetting thing was the poor service. After a day of sightseeing, we returned to our hot rooms, only to find no water furnished, and instead of washing cups the maids had just put them on the shelf dirty, and it had obviously not been vaccuumed. We would have changed hotels, but here you pay in cash, in advance to the travel agency. One other thing is that the hotel advertises coffee in the room, but what they don't say is that it is a tiny expresso maker and you are charged if used!

I don't think the functioning of the shower had been touched as it seemed to have a mind of its own. Good enough though -it was clean, just a little worn round the edges. Breakfast was ok - a strange mix of Chinese and European. Nice little cafe round the corner -compass cafe - where you get get juices etc(not much of a food selection) and you can use the internet for free. Also they arrange tours to the Great Wall, acrobats etc which seem to be a lot cheaper than the usual hotel packages -plus you don't get dragged into factories en route. The hotel didn't have our reservation from Expedia when we got there but they sorted out a room for us anyway. By the time we checked out, 2 days later, the booking confirmation had come through. You will still need 500 yuan for a deposit, even though payment has been made. You can see the Forbidden City from the window in the bedroom and it is only a short walk away from Wangfujing street, Tianamen Square, Bai Hai Park and the Forbidden City. It's about 12 Yuan in a taxi to the restaurants by Hou Hai. Taxi to the airport -the hotel will arrange one for you BUT it will be double the price it usually is and you need to check whether it included the road toll charge. We had little choice as we had to be at the airport at 4.30am and didn't want to take the risk of flagging one down on the street. If you are going to the airport at a normal time, taxis pass by the hotel all the time, so probably better to get one that way.

Before going to Beijing, I read the other reviews and was really rooting for this hotel to be a gem in the rough, but in the end would almost give this hotel a '1' rating, but I'm taking into consideration that this was a Chinese style hotel, not a Western brand name hotel. We had paid extra for a suite, and I had even sent a fax IN CHINESE to make sure that all was in order. The suite we were originally put in was abysmal, even by mainland Chinese standards; dingy, tiny, little light, no ventilation, NO cupboard, closet, or drawers even! The furniture must've have come straight from a dorm room with a bed inadequate for two people (maybe this room was used for staff to crash in?). We had prepaid for the hotel, but they still insisted on a deposit of 1000 RMB (over 100$US) for key deposit (an aging plastic card which they charged us for at checkout because it had cracked) and a mini-bar deposit (yet there was none in the room...there wasn't even a fridge!!) It took an entire day of our trip and two subsequent moves to finally get it straightened out. And we ended up only marginally better than what we had started with: a room whose windows opened into a storage closet full of construction debris, again with no ventilation (they said they couldn't turn on the air in the room). I will say that the assistant manager was most accomodating; even she was appalled at the room we had been given originally, and gave us one night in the presidential suite, but were told to move the next afternoon (after being kept waiting for 4 hours) the 3d and final suite we were assigned was as described above. My partner cashed some Amex travelers cheques and we had a go round with deskstaff who wanted *US* to go to the Bank of China for *THEM* to turn the already countersigned cheques in (they didn't believe his signature matched, even though he had passport, drivers license and other cheques to support it)--that hassle was also resolved finally, but ate up a good several hours, and left me secretly angry and shaken at having been bullied by a gang of 5 hotel staff members. The only reason that I am giving this hotel a 2 is it's location: It really was phenomenal; right at the Forbidden City, and where 15 different bus routes converged that made getting around very easy (if you can read Chinese bus info).

At first, everything looked alright. It was quite a good location, although many taxi drivers do not know this hotel so we had to explain all the time, luckily we could speak Chinese. But the horror started when we checked out. There was a patch of brown stain on the bedsheets. It was there when we checked in. We did not bother about it as it was at the bottom of the sheet (which was our huge mistake). On the early morning checkout, they wanted to charge us, insisting that we dirtied the sheets, gave us a dirty look and refuse to believe us. We could retort in chinese, luckily again. They called the manager and kept asking how much they should charge us, right in front of us. In the end, they wasted half hour of our time and we nearly missed our flight (due to the jam too). To me, whatever the case is, how can they be so 100% sure that we did it? It could be their cleaners who didn't do a good job. They should believe their customers, nor matter what. It is not like we broke the TV or something.Our cab driver told us, this was not the first time. Many customers from this hotel got the same problem, they were charged for nothing.

To me, service is very important, exceeding the location.", "Date": "Feb 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR857664156", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SGGirl"}, {"Content": "thanks red wall We would like to take this opportunity to compliment all staff at the red wall hotel for the excellent service we exprienced during our stay in november 2006. always helpful at all levels and most had a very good grasp of english. the food was well prepared and plentiful and the hotel very clean. our room was quite adequate. beds jolly hard but clean. bathrooms in need of some TLC but overall no complaints and yes we would stay there again.Overall we found the chinese people very friendly and always smiling.great value for moneyThank you Red WallJoyce and cliff Taitnew zealand", "Date": "Jan 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR645082623", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cliff.tait"}, {"Content": "Stay, only if you like warmed up curry for Breakfast? The best thing about this hotel is the location, you cannot knock it. Just a stone's throw from the Forbidden City and Tiannamen Square, two of the major tourist spots in Beijing. The staff are generally very polite and try to be helpful and most can speak a basic level of English. But despite being within walking distance of the Forbidden City none of the city's taxi drivers seem to know where the hotel is or are prepared to drive there. Be prepared for taxi drivers to refuse to drive you and laugh in your face!The hotel also insists on debiting your credit card by about \u62e2200 for use of the mini bar! This is quite a large deposit (even for four of us) when you realise that the mini bar only consists of water and coke. Is it possible to drink \u62e2200 of soft drinks in one week!Whilst the hotel restaurant has no natural light and more staff than tables the food is not bad. The breakfasts, however, consist of warmed up meals from the night before and unless you are partial to warmed up curry, fried chicken or pak choy for breakfast it is not really for the western palate. Toast, is about the the only option, with luke warm coffee!The rooms are kept well, but could do with a good clean around the edges. The shower does have a mind of its own and if (like me) you try to move the shower head (so it doesn't spray the ceiling and opposite wall) it comes away from the wall! There is also a lack of any decent lighting in the rooms and unless you are very short (or 5 years old) you will not be able to hang anything in the wardarobes, which are about the size of a kitchen cupboard!Expect random telephone calls asking if you want a massage but don't expect to be able to go to the Entertainment Centre on floor B1. For some reason, any time we tried to get out of the lift at that level we were hurridly put back in the lift and sent back upstairs. (If anyone ever makes it over the threshold and discovers what is on level B1 we would be interested to know!)I suppose the only other thing to mention is to make sure you don't ask the hotel to take messages for you. The only message we received (about moving the time of our trip to the Summer Palace from an afternoon trip to a morning one (quite important if you are suppose to get up)) was left in a draw with the Beijing yellow pages. Not exactly an obvious place, and hence why we were not ready up when our tour guide arrived!", "Date": "Nov 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR430981053", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RMPP"}, {"Content": "Great Location   showReview(6035813, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR146707867", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Heidi1979"}, {"Content": "Dire Hotel, Dishonest staff, what more can I say.   showReview(6013697, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR468620034", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ordinary_adventurer"}, {"Content": "Noisy and not clean - you can do better       Tiny, dirty bathroom", "Date": "Aug 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR460253732", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "popstar"}, {"Content": "Good location but average hotel   showReview(5707902, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR538398464", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "joWien"}, {"Content": "A decent room at a decent price with a fabulous location   showReview(5594577, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR621964592", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Chinahand"}, {"Content": "Do Not Stay Here", "Date": "Jun 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR649416893", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "reviewit24u"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed our stay at the Red Wall Hotel   showReview(5292008, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR694774658", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Sundawg"}, {"Content": "you have got to have some luck here..   showReview(4498009, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR815392072", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "4 stars?
