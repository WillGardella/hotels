The room was clean and the bedding had all been changed and so we didn't feel the need to complain right away and we were on a schedule so we had to hurry out and there was no one on the desk when we went out.

One thing I didn't like is the fact that there was no guest only access to the rooms. I didn't feel unsafe but I feel that needs addressing. One thing that is good about the hotel is that there is a petrol station right next to it so you can get snacks, drinks and even breakfast from there and there is also a fairly large food outlet right opposite with burger king, pizza hut, nandos ect. The nearest tue station is park royal which is a 5-15 minute walk, depending how fast you walk, which is serviced by the piccadilly line which goes direct to Leicester square and should take approx 30-40 minutes in off peak hours.

That concept is you get what you pay for. Travelodge is a BUDGET hotel chain, meaning you pay a budget price for a simple, no frills accommodation, NOT you pay a budget price for luxury, 5 star accommodation. The quicker people grasp this perfectly simple concept the better. Our stay was for 5 nights, the purpose being a sightseeing trip to London and our party had two rooms, one at the front and one at the back. There is noise at the front due to the A40 traffic and noise at the back from tube trains. For us this was not a problem, but if noise bothers you then stay elsewhere. The staff we encountered were all helpful and friendly. Parking is \u00a35 for 24 hours which is clearly stated on the website and is great value for London. You can pay either via the parking machine on site or over the phone using your credit/debit card. Other hotels we looked at had no parking facilities at all or had rip off NCP car parking nearby which charge on average \u00a35 an hour, so the fact that this hotel had parking and was a LOT cheaper than NCP was a factor in our decision to book. There is a garage next door selling a range of food and drinks which is handy. Leave the hotel and turn right, walk for about 3/4 minutes and you will come to an underpass. Go under the underpass for Park Royal tube station and catch a tube into central London. There is also a bus stop at the entrance to the underpass. Next to the tube station is a retail park which has a muliplex cinema, ten pin bowling and a variety of eateries including Burger King, Nandos, Chiquitos, Pizza Hut, KFC and a Chinese restaurant. We used the underpass daily with no problems. The rooms themselves were typical of a budget hotel. You get a plain room with a bed, a desk area, a TV, a bathroom with bath, shower and toilet and a kettle with tea/coffee/milk sachets, that is all, no frills. If you want frills and 5 star you have to pay for it in a non budget hotel, simple really. The rooms were clean and tidy, we got exactly what we expected to get for the cheap price we paid. The thing that let this hotel down was the graffiti scratched into the lift walls. The management really need to paint over this. In summary, if you are looking for budget accommodation with parking (small extra cost), within easy reach of central London by tube and are not too bothered by noise from roads/trains then this will do.

Stayed here for the NFL game in Wembley, convenient for central London via the Park Royal underground station (a 5 minute walk from the hotel) which will take you into the centre within 25 minutes. You get to the underground via a subway which I would not recommend doing on your own at night, frankly that would just be common sense to most people. Restaurants across the road (10 minute walk via subway), mainly chains, but ok if you want something quick on a Sunday night. Was in a room at the front, slight noise from the A40, but nothing major and the internal and external double glazing brought the noise down to a very dull rumble which did not disturb our sleep. As for the Heathrow flight path, we were on the top floor (4) and didn't hear a single plane. Don't know about the back rooms, facing the train lines but can't imagine they're any worse then HGV's going past the front. Parking does cost \u00a35 per 24 hours, payment is made in coins (or by mobile) so have change ready. The room (like all Travelodges) was basic but clean. The towels were clean but well used so felt a bit rough. Had no problems with the shower or anything else in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable, the sheets clean. Only one cup for coffee, which was a bit odd for a double room, but we made do all the same. There were no problems with the electrics (I checked each plug). TV's were old but I didn't come to London to watch the X Factor. The lift is a bit dodgy, avoided it after the first time as it took ages for the door to open when you got to your floor (thought I was stuck for a bit) we all used the stairs. The stairs were in the worst condition, very bad damp problem on the walls but as you will only be there a few minutes, nothing to really gripe about. Staff were friendly, although like many minimum wage jobs in this industry, attract people who do not have English as their first language. We didn't fancy the breakfast in a bag, we went out for everything. BP garage next door has most things you should need and is open 24/7. Not a bad budget sleep, If you are looking for a room that costs less then \u00a360 per room, per night in London when a major event is taking place on the weekend, your options are limited.

I paid an extra \u00a310.00 for an early check in (normal check in is 3.00pm).

Price was a reasonable \u00a35.00 per 24 hours (payable at a machine). I stayed in a room on the third floor overlooking the back of the hotel. There is a train that runs past fairly slowly about every 10 - 20 minutes. I didn't find this a problem as although I could hear it, it was preferable to the traffic noise on the front. I also didn't spend too much time in the room as we were out sight seeing and shopping. But not too bad as room double glazed. The trains are less frequent during the late evening and stop altogether at about midnight. Starting again probably about 6.30 but I never heard them in the morning as I was asleep. But overall really not a problem in my opinion. The room was clean and basic. Coffee and tea making facilities in the room. Iron, hair dryer or extra pillows available 24/7 on request. The desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Bathroom towel rail was missing as in other reviews however it appeared to me that it might have been removed. Perhaps it got broken as the bathroom door clattered into it. Either way not a problem for me.

It proved to be OK. 30 minutes from central London by tube & then a 5 min. walk from the station. The hotel was fairly standard:- basic, soul less, but clean & all the staff we met were friendly & helpful. On the positive side, the \"mini mart \" in the garage next door stocks most things foodwise & also has an area where they serve breakfasts. \"Across the road\" ( a 10 min. walk via the tube station subway) is the Royale Leisure Park:- a mulitiplex cinema, 10 pin bowling (with a noisy bar area attached) a McDonalds (also in the bowling complex) a BurgerKing (breakfasts served) a Pizzahut, KFC. & 3 very busy restaurants. If you turn left out of the tube station, instead of right towards the subway,you will quickly find 2 convenience stores, a bar & 2 more restaurants (Italian & Indian) A 5 minute walk further on (past a pub!) brings you to Hanger Lane(+ tube) & more shops,restaurants etc. I'm detailing all this,as at first glance the hotel appears to be stuck in the middle of nowhere,which is'nt so..... On the negative side (& its a huge one!) the hotels location is horrendous!:- the A40 into London runs at the front & the traffic noise is a constant 24 hours....at least the tube line at the rear only runs between 6.30 am. & midnight!...oh yes, I forgot to mention the Heathrow flightpath!

We arrived at Park Royal at approximately 2.15pm from Manchester, on a sweltering hot 13th of May, tired, hot and bothered, looking forward to a shower and a relax before hitting the city lights. The place is conveniently situated five minutes walk form the Park Royal connection to the London Underground although via a subway. We arrived at the hotel to be told that we had missed our check in as they had the booking as the 12th. Luckily we booked on line, and had the paperwork stating the 13th. Eventually, after it was established that the morning staff had alleviated their boredom by rearranging computer bookings the matter was sorted. The receptionist humbly apologised for the mix up and told us that although check in was not until 3pm, she would let us go up thirty minutes early....for a fee of \u00a320! We declined and spent the following 30 minutes cluttering up the tiny lobby, whilst checking out the empty soda machine, the unplugged coffee machine and the silent and unproductive air conditioning unit. After sitting for 15 minutes we asked if we could use the toilets...the reply ensued thus: Receptionist: No sorry, I can\u2019t allow you to because you haven\u2019t checked in. Us: Checked in? You mean because we haven\u2019t paid the fee you wanted. Receptionist: That\u2019s right. If you are not checked in then they are for staff use only. Us: But its only fifteen minutes to go. Receptionist: You are not insured to use our toilet because you are not checked in. Us: I see. So I pay you \u00a320 for an extra fifteen minutes usage of the room, then I become insured to use the toilet? Receptionist: You could use the ones at the petrol station across the forecourt; they will let you use theirs. Us: Am I insured to use theirs? Receptionist: I don\u2019t know. You had to be there\u2026 Ok the rooms. Furnished in typical Travel Lodge style, basic with a few added extras, (one miniature soap, two disposable cups and a Durex wrapper) we found the bed fresh and clean, although we were provided with two wafer thin pillows and a hand and bath towel in a double room. We did ask for extras, and waited in reception whilst they rummaged around in the back room for more. But, the bathrail had been ripped off and the ceiling and grout were mouldy, all little things that were not down to bad housekeeping but to poor building maintenance. The staff were pleasant enough, except for the lady we had spoken to on our arrival, who peered silently at us over the desk every time we entered the foyer. In the early hours of the first night we suffered a domestic between lovers (oh yes we knew what they were up to\u2026) filtering down the corridors, and on the second we were entertained by the loud comings and goings of a large party further down the corridor. It would have been even more entertaining had the heated and riotous behaviour been in English, but you cant win everytime. Overall it was a place to rest a head, but disappointing and derelict.

We were fortunate to get a cheap deal - \u00a329.00 for the Friday night and \u00a349.00 for the Saturday night. However I still expected the hotel to be cleaned to a good standard. When we arrived the barrier of the car park was broken (something that a guest in February 2007 also pointed out). We arrived very early in the day to be told that rooms were available but we would have to pay \u00a310.00 extra to have the room early - this was strange as at other travelodges we have stayed at, we have been able to check in early without any additional costs. As we were unable to leave the luggage at the hotel we left it in our car which was parked on the hotel car park. When we arrived back at the hotel we had the last two available rooms one on the first floor and one on the second floor. When we opened the door to our room (room 116) we struggled against the gale blowing through, the windows had been left wide open and it was only the following day we discovered why - the room stank of stale cigarette smoke, the lamp shades were so badly stained from nicotine it was shocking. Surely after introducing the no smoking policy the hotel should have had the rooms thoroughly cleaned. The other room (209) had a stain on the childrens mattress, only one set of additional bedding even through we had checked in with two children for the room and there was a horrible lump of something on the shower curtain. The next morning we went to make a cup of tea but there were no tea bags (I note that a previous guest said they had run out of tea bags on their stay). Good points - close to the tube station on the Piccadilly line, cheap rooms, cheap parking, easy access to M40. Bad points - broken glass by the barriers in the car park, rooms smelt, bad stains, general lack of maintenance carried out at the hotel (hotel is in desperate need to TLC).

We were originally given a room on the first floor. It reeked of cigarette smoke, as did the entire first floor hallway. I was ready to go sleep on a chair at the airport. The guy at reception kindly gave us a third floor room instead. That room smelled fine. Just as I was starting to relax, a loud train passed by the window. It was like something out of My Cousin Vinny. Luckily, the train does not run at night and I got up early, so it wasn't a problem. There is no hair dryer in the room, but the guy at reception had one to lend out. Bring your own shampoo, conditioner and soap (they give you soap, but it smells medicinal). The room got kind of humid after the shower had been used. It is hard to find a room in London that sleeps more than two people. The rooms here do have a pull out couch, so it seems possible to cram a family of four into one room. It would not be my preference, but it apparently can be done. As other reviewers have said, the Park Royal tube station is a short walk away. We couldn't find any place decent to eat in walking distance, though. We had dinner at some kind of Slavic pub called The Ring that was absolutely bizarre. In retrospect, I would have been better off with a Snickers bar and a bottle of Coke from the Travelodge vending machines. I saw one restaurant that looked promising, but it was closed dispite the fact that it was dinner time on a Saturday night. It's a Travelodge. It's about what you'd expect (as long as you're not on the first floor). I think I would have been uncomfortable staying for more than one night. I would not stay here in order to vacation in Central London.
