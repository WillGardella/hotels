We just needed a decent room in a good location. That's exactly what we got at the Surf Motel. Sure there were no frills and yes it's on a noisy street, but it's the big city.... I imagine very few inexpensive motels are quiet. Who goes to the city for quietness anyway? The free parking was a huge bonus and just one block away is Chestnut Street, a safe and trendy neigborhood with good ethnic restaurants, shops, several bars, and even a movie theatre. There was plenty to do within walking distance and the motel could not have been easier to get to. The room was basic but clean and had everything we needed. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will probably stay there again. The Surf Motel is a great launching pad (for those on a budget) from which to enjoy the wonderful city of San Francisco.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708299194", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "barginhunter_8"}, {"Content": "Okay, Good Value We've actually stayed here twice... the first time was a great experience. We paid $90/night and had a good room, set way back in the corner away from the road. The room was small, but comfortable and clean. The location as so good that when we went back to the city a few months later we went back. The second experience was awful. Our room was practically on the street, so we heard street noise (including screaming drunk people) all night. The room we were in this time was even smaller, and dirty. The parking this time was awful-- they ran out of parking spaces so we had to park awkwardly, so that when we pulled out we almost got creamed on Lombard. I would recommend this motel for people who want a good value and just need a place to crash-- not people with families who want a nice place to stay in the city.", "Date": "May 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR356977999", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "citygirltravels"}, {"Content": "NOISY!! The only good thing about this place was the parking. It's located right on Lombard Street, a main thoroughfare, which is noisy 24 hours a day. Room was very small and cramped.

Didn't really compare prices on too many places, but it seemed like good value to us. Got a room on the first floor and slightly back from the road so there wasn't any noticeable noice either.

We called and booked a room for 1 night. On arrival the place looked rundown and not in the slightest bit welcoming. At this point I was reluctant to even get out of the car and venture in. However as we had booked it and the guide book recommended it we thought we'd give it a go. In the reception we were eventually met by a pretty grumpy motel owner. I explained that I would be grateful if I could have a look at the room first before taking it. He eventually agreed but insisted that we leave our passports at the reception whilst we had a look!(what did he think we were going to do?) The room was apparently non-smoking but smelt of stale smoke, the decor was tired and very dated. But worst of all was the uneasy atmosphere outside in the motel courtyard. I'm a policeman in the UK and I have a pretty good idea when people are up to 'no good' . There were various groups of people hanging around outside rooms and I'm pretty confident that they weren't tourists. It made us feel pretty uneasy and there was no chance that we were willing to stay there overnight. I told the man behind reception that we would not be staying and quickly left. Worst thing is we were still charged $70 as we had paid when booking over the phone. Avoid at all costs, given the massive amount of accommodation available in SF, there is no need to stay here!

My sisters just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before they were flying back to Europe. I tried to call them 3 times and this is what happened:1. As I asked to transfer me to their room the person at the front desk told me that they asked to call back after midnight which they did not as he never called their room(he put the phone down for about 10 seconds only). 2. I called again about 20 minutes later and the person said that there is no answer from the room(after he put the phone down again for about 5 seconds) , although I sent my sisters a text message to make sure they were there.As I told him that he hung up on me.3. I called again the next day and the person at the front desk tells me: I don't feel like connecting right now and hangs up on me again.I finally called them via cell phone to make sure they are ok and they confirmed whatever the other people wrote in reports before on this page.

It all started with them trying to scam us into a King room. THey told us we had reserved smoking and the only non-smoking they had left were larger. We fell for it and paid the extra . Afterwards we checked our reservation and it was for non-smoking. They were clearly scamming us. Aside from that, the beds only come with two small pillows, making it uncomfortable to sit in bed and watch TV. It is located on a busy street and the walls offer zero insulation from the noise. There was an ironing board but no iron. And the toilet made a weird noise like a sick cow when you flush it.

I decided to stay here for one night after I decided to extend by trip by one night. The other place I was staying at was a little pricey for a Friday night and Surf offered $79. So I took it to save about $40. I should have just sucked it up and paid the extra money. The outside is okay, like any other motel you see, but the rooms are pretty small, bathroom is average size, and parking is free. First of all, to enter room you had to insert card, hold and lift door nob a certain way to open door because nob was broken, which I never did figure out, but luckily my girlfriend did, room had bad odor, shower had obvious fungus and shower nozel fell off. Bed was okay, when opening sheets, my girlfriend found a public hair, disgusting! Coffee maker was broken and room didn't even have cream and sugar if it did work. Continental breakfast is free, but don't bother, it is a box of old muffinfs in the office with someone sitting their watching what you take. No offense to this place, but don't wast your time and money, there are plenty of other choices in San Franicisco and especially on Lombard Street to choose from. I am all for saving some money, but c'mon, some places should just be left alone so they can be torn down, and this is one of those places.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR332900083", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Angelfan"}, {"Content": "Mixed Bag Our family of 2 adults and 2 teenage kids stayed 6 nights at the Surf.
