It costs $45 (flat rate + tolls etc) from JFK airport to Manhattan but expect the final amount to be an odd number so the taxi driver gets a tip (our final cost was $52.30). Some guide books say that a return trip to JFK is on the meter but the taxis clearly advertise a fixed rate in both directions - and the return to the airport cost us $45 + tolls. Alternatively take the JFK airport bus to Central Station and take a taxi from there for a slightly cheaper rate (or walk ten blocks with bags from 42nd street where the bus stops). The hotel lobby area is dark but check in was quick and efficient and staff were friendly throughout our stay. Be advised that there are not enough lifts in the hotel and waiting times can sometimes be quite long. Most mornings we waited for nearly five to ten minutes for a lift - and stairs are not an option. Our room was a decent size but tired with a giant old-fashioned TV; there are no tea/coffee facilities and no mini bar but to be fair there are plenty of coffee places nearby. Starbucks is across the road (opening from 05:30 in the week and 07:00 on Sundays) and the hotel does have free coffee in the lobby area at certain times of day. Breakfast was good, even if the expected tip is probably unreasonable given that everything is self-service (unless you order a hot option). Breakfast consisted of orange juice, tea and coffee, bagels, cream cheese, butter, pastries and a good fruit salad. Hot food is available for an extra price or you can try a good American diner around the corner from the hotel. Another warning: the breakfast area is too small for the number of guests at the hotel which meant a lot of people queueing for a table. A good time to get a table is probably between 07:30 and 08:30. One negative aspect to the hotel is the lack of free wifi - most other hotels in Manhattan offer it. Most people rely on access to wifi nowadays and luckily Starbucks across the road offers it for free for the price of a hot drink (select AT&T as the provider, accept the terms and conditions and it should log you in). Otherwise the hotel has a business centre offering internet stations but this gets busy. The hotel has probably got a four star rating because of the gym but we would rate it at high end three star. All in all a good hotel within walking distance of the main midtown areas and close to the subway.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "devon", "Title": "\u201cIdeal position\u201d", "Author": "familyswim", "ReviewID": "UR127145113", "Content": "My daughter and I saved up for this once in a lifetime trip and chose to stay here because it seemed good value and was central for first time visitors. Our welcome was disappointing to say the least. The man on reception was very unfriendly and the room we were given was already occupied. We went back down to reception and were given a key to another room and this time we had to take our own bags - this was due to the man who took our bags the first time having some sort of argument with the man on reception. The bath in this room was full of black stuff, almost like soil, and it was unusable. By this time my daughter was in tears, 17 years old and very tired, and wanted to go home. We were given another key by a lady this time who was a little more sympathetic. We had been travelling since early morning and should not have had to keep heaving suitcases from one room to another in a four star hotel. This room was ok if a little worn in places. There was plenty of space to spread out and a decent bathroom. The housekeepers were lovely and really friendly and put the reception staff to shame. The sheets were changed daily and the room thoroughly cleaned each day. The complimentary breakfast was good, fresh fruit salad and pastries, good orange juice and hot drinks. I really didn't mind leaving a tip although it takes time to get used to being constantly asked to leave them.The location of this hotel is perfect, we were able to walk to Time Square, Central Park, Empire State building etc. etc. We did have a fantastic time in the city despite the shaky start.

Although the amount shows zero, the staff circle tip for you as well as leaving a message for you advising international guests to leave customary tip. I feel this is unnecessary as the breakfast staff stand around at the bar area and chat while we serve ourselves. If they want a tip they should be offering tea and coffee and show some interaction.

When we arrived, our room was very clean and so big for Manhattan standards!! We had a lovely corner room on the 18th floor, and the view was great. We requested information on dining several times from the conscierge, and he did not steer us wrong once! He knows fine dining, and that made it so great for us. For the most part, the staff was gracious and kind. They greeted us each morning as we left, and were happy to see us when we returned at the end of each day. Our maid service was fantastic - and somehow she knew exactly when we would be coming and going (even mid day) and kept our bed made and our linens fresh. I read poor reviews on the bed - and am happy to report that I did not have any issues with that. I have had three surgeries on my spine, and am very sensitive to bad mattresses. I didn't have any problems at the Flatotel - and was so glad that the bed was better than the reviews. WE only had breakfast on one day, and we were given fresh fruit, pastries and juice. There are signs that ask for gratuity, but we didn't take offense to that. We hope to go back and stay again. It was a great experience and a charming hotel.

It was our second stay in 6 years (both times because we got it through Priceline). I did not see too many changes. I guess we were lucky and stayed in a refurbished room, since nothing looked bad. The room is really big by New York standard; I wish they added an extra chair in the loungy area of the room - otherwise only one person can sit there (unless you roll over the bulky office chair). I would say that it is a perfect location/room for a business person with one drawback: for a hotel of that level not to have a coffee maker in the room is totally unacceptable. They do serve coffee in the lobby but I don\u2019t see it as an ideal solution. The elevator was really slow in the day time; many times we had to walk downstairs (luckily we were on 11th Fl). And my personal pet peeve: for a hotel that calls itself \"a sophisticated retreat\" (from their website), it should not be a norm not to provide proper glasses. Only paper cups are provided. Would be nice to have a corkscrew as well, but I guess it is asking too much. To have New York Times delivered to your door was a nice touch (and the fact that you can pick up your own free copy in the lobby on Sundays, is awesome). The workout room on the 46th Fl is great (for a hotel); plus the view alone worth the trip upstairs. The walls are not too think so if you have noisy neighbors (as we had 6 years ago), you will hear it. This time we were lucky and had a quiet weekend.

I got the room through one of the discount sites, don't know if the staff knows and treats us accordingly, I'll come back to that. Room included continental breakfast, it was excellent - fresh pastries, good orange juice and coffee, fruit salad, bagels. You could also pay for \"a la carte\" if you wanted a hot breakfast. There was also free coffee early in the morning. I used the business office every day, good internet access, free printing, that was nice. We had a room with a king bed, there was 3 of us, so I asked for a rollaway bed, $35/ night. Much more expensive than anywhere else I have been in the States, but perhaps that's the going price in New York. What I considered a ripoff however was the $13/ day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day. They say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player 3 different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the 3rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face. And finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are.

I would recommend that the hotel change the shower heads though they use in the bathrooms, not only was it complicated to turn on, but it also sprayed water all over the bathroom.

This is not our first visit to New York and we have stayed in Manhattan before. We booked the room on Hotwire, that is blindly, so we got a great rate and the hotel seemed to get good reviews on Trip Advisor. Upon arriving at our room, the first thing we notice was that there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke. We had booked a non-smoking room, so I contacted the front desk and was told very curtly that the room and floor were in fact non-smoking. The person at the front desk seemed to be unaffected by the fact that the room smelled strongly of smoke and offered no solutions to the problem. Following this the sink in the bathroom broke and we found that the in room safe was locked. Now each of these problems were resolved by hotel staff in relatively short periods of time but on top of the smoke smell it left a very bad first impression. The hotel room itself was basic but functional. The bathroom was a little run down and small. The bathtub/shower combination only had a piece of class that covered half of the tub\u2019s length, the result of which was that water would splash onto the floor every time you showered. This was inconvenient and annoying. The living area of the room was reasonably large but the arrangement of the furniture caused roughly a quarter of the room not to be useable. The mattress on the bed was older and also smelt of smoke. Overall the room worked fine to come home and sleep but offered no charm or draw. One thing that Flatotel does have going for it is its location. It is just south of Central Park meaning it is in walking distance of most of the midtown sights. The hotel staff were very friendly and were able to fix most of the problems that came up very easily. For the price that we paid Flatotel offered a clean room with a good location.

Got a fabulous rate of $135 for a small, double bed room. Lots of good points to this hotel. Staff was friendly, lobby/entrance well appointed and location is exceptionally convenient. But lots of bad points too. Elevators were dead slow and stopped at floors where no people were there. The room itself was tiny, tiny, tiny. I was glad my colleague had to cancel at the last minute as it was way too small for two people. I liked the in-room fridge and the bathroom had all the necessities. Overall, the room and bath were a little grubby but acceptable. My main problem was that someone nearby was smoking (10 floors away from the nearest smoking floor) and it was venting INTO my bathroom. After a couple of days, I finally convinced someone to duct tape a piece of cardboard over the bathroom vent and that seemed to solve the problem. Breakfast had a great fruit salad and selection of okay pastries and bagels. There is no in-room coffee supplies and coffee is not available in the lobby until 7am weekdays and 7:30 weekdays. This was frustrating when I had to be at 8am meetings (no time to eat). I don't see why coffee can't be put out in the lobby at 6 or 6:30 when staff was clearly walking around with cups of coffee themselves. I also found the signs 'begging' for tips at breakfast rather offensive. Either pay your staff appropriately or do not have a maitre'd and server for a self-serve buffet. Why should I tip to be seated and to receive a bill that says \"0.00\"? Seems totally unnecessary. Overall, this was good value for NYC.

The price seemed reasonable ($250 a night) especially since the hotel was right near Time Square. When we arrived there was a $50 fee to park in one of the parking garages near the hotel. When checking in one of the associates at the front desk suggested to use the parking garage around the block which charges only $30 for an over night. Could not find it.. We checked a few parking garages near the hotel and they seemed to be the same price - around $50. Eventually we arrived to our room. A little bit of a disappointment. Not all the channels on the television worked (came in static) and the television was very old. The bath tub was dirty. The apartment was very dreary. For the amount of money was expecting the hotel to be more \"up to date.\" Later that evening the two of us sat at the bar. We order 2 shots of Jamerson, a glass of Sangria, and a glass of Sam Adams. The bill came out to $42 not including tip. I completely understand that any bar in NYC will be a little higher in price in a drink compared to somewhere else, but I would think if someone was a guest at the hotel they would get a little bit of a discount. The bartender who helped seemed to be nice, not very social compared to another bartender that helped us earlier that evening (at Joe G's). The hotel also offered a free continental breakfast between 7am to 10am. A big disappointment. There was table of hard crusted bagels, stale muffins, fruit, orange juice, condiments, and another sweet breakfast item (not quite sure what it was). There was another table with a pot of coffee and tea. There was another option to order breakfast such as eggs, but there was a charge. My boyfriend and I were seated by one of the associates. We were not given a menu. There was just a sign on the table stating the free continental breakfast and then a few breakfast items at a rediculous amount to purchase. Fifteen to twenty minutes into eating breakfast one of the waiters walked over to the table put down what seemed to be a bill it just stated that we had the free continental breakfast and then two arrows one pointing to the word tip and one pointing to signature. I found that a little rude since the waiters didn't do anything for us. They did not remove the dirty plates from our table. They didn't ask us if we wanted or needed anything.

The room looked exactly like the photos - I could swear ours was the one featured on their website. It was huge! It was quiet! We were in the back of the building, so no street noise. The only downside was that there wasn't much of a view other than watching office workers doing their job in the office buildings across the way. But, as I said before, we were not in our room that much to even be distracted by the view. Overall a very good experience. Great if you're not into the big, glitzy lobbies and pretension. It's just a nice, competitively-priced hotel tucked away on a side street that is very convenient to mid-town Manhattan.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Buttersflower", "ReviewID": "UR122930660", "Content": "We stayed in the flatotel from 27th dec - 3rd jan 2012 for birthday and new year.

Even on new years eve!! The big problem I had with the hotel was the member of staff that insisted of helping us with bags into taxi on last day - we told him we had no change for a tip and we could get our own taxi, but he did it anyway then took $5 off the taxi man for a tip and told us to pay the taxi man back using our credit card!!!!!! I was fuming. I quickly explained to the taxi man that we literally only had $50 for the taxi ($45 for the fare to JFK and $5 for tip) as long as he knew... Got to JFK and taxi man kicked off because we couldn't give him a tip!

Staying in NYC is not like staying in any other city in the world. Standards are ENTIRELY different in a city that hosts over 48 million tourists a year on a 22 square mile landmass. If you've never stayed here before I understand the disappointment, but it truly is a great value for this city. I challenge you to go anywhere else and find better location, service and room size for this price. That being said I have stayed in VERY modest accommodations with barely enough room to do a sit-up at the foot of the bed (not that you'd even want to lay on the nasty floor) and paid a pretty penny for even that. I've also stayed at $250+ per night hotels in NYC and I honestly rate the Flatotel in-line with the standards and service I've received at these locations. The Flatotel is a WONDERFUL place to stay when visiting the City for pleasure. I haven't stayed there as a business traveler so can't speak about the wireless or business amenities, but the room size is unparalleled anywhere on the island for the price. Huge with nice, large windows. The staff was not overly knowledgeable about City options, but par for most NYC hotels. Gregory, the chef concierge however, makes up for it! He is a wealth of knowledge, service and hospitality. Ask him and it shall be done. Anything to make your stay more enjoyable - call ahead and he will help you plan your trip. The continental breakfast isn't anything special, but it's WHAT IT IS --- a CONTINENTAL breakfast. If you expect more than that in this city for this price you'll be disappointed most other places throughout your trip aswell. There's enough to get you going for the day and free fruit to stash in your pocket for a daily snack. It is one of the most convenient locations to anything you want to do - Times Square, 5th Ave, Central Park, Hell's Kitchen, Rockafellar Center --- you really don't even have to get on the Subway unless you want to go way down or uptown which saves you money. The shower is kinda weirdly designed, but it's a design thing, not a sub-par shower. Elevator can take a little while, but again, welcome to NYC high-rise buildings - EVERY hotel no matter what star-rating (except perhaps the Marquis) has this challenge.

The booking name was made on my friends name who had prepaid with her credit card, so he didnt let me check in because the booking was on my friend's name. \u00a0Even though the booking said 3 adults, it was pre-paid and we were staying in an apartment and I had the printed email as evidence.

There is no hotel guide in the room to list guest services such as gym, room service etc. Elevators are very slow. Although they advertise free continental breakfast, they charged $4.75 for a small coffee to go. No premium channels on the tv and no system for ordering additional programming.

My husband has stayed here a few times on business trips and often complains about it. However he\u2019s, in my opinion, sometimes overly picky about hotels so I was fully prepared to think differently than he. Boy was I wrong\u2026 Let\u2019s start with the night we arrived. We pulled up in our rental car and waited for the valet to come pick it up. And waited\u2026.and waited\u2026. We finally had to go inside to the hotel (where, by the way, the valet stand had a clear view of the outside of the hotel) and ask the valet to park our car. Okay, one hurdle down. Next we checked in uneventfully and were given our room keys. The d\u00e9cor in the lobby was attractive, even if it did look like it was trying a little too hard to be trendy. We went to the elevator bank and waited for the somewhat slow elevators to our room. As we were walking down the hall to our room I noticed that the door to the room across from us looked broken into. I\u2019m not exaggerating, I even took a picture of it. It looked like someone had taken a crowbar and attempted to wedge the door open. That didn\u2019t exactly make me feel comfortable and safe. As an aside, during our stay we had to go to the front desk twice to get new keys because the keys they gave us just stopped working for no apparent reason. When we walked into our room we were greeted by a room that, on first glance, was just OK, if somewhat dated. There was no flat screen TV (it was one of those old boxy ones) and the lampshade had what looked like water damage on it. The cover to the air conditioning unit was broken and fell off as soon as my husband opened it to adjust the room temperature. The bed was on this wooden platform which had the wood sticking out about 5-6 inches from the side of the bed on the side I was on (it only stuck out about 3 inches on the other side). The wood actually looked pretty but I must have nailed my knee on that damn thing about 6 times during our 3 night stay. The bed itself was pretty uncomfortable. I actually prefer firmer beds, like this one, but I woke up with back pain for the first time in a long time after sleeping in that bed. There was no shower curtain in the bathroom (just a half glass partition) which would have been okay except the water sprayed directly on the bathroom door when showering which over time had apparently created unattractive warping around the edges. On the plus side, the shower head had fantastic water pressure. The next morning we got up early enough to enjoy their continental breakfast in the dining room off the lobby. The offerings were some cold pastries, bagels, coffee, tea and a mixed fruit cocktail like thing. The pastries were dry and boring and, primarily tasteless. The coffee was pretty darn bad as well. I didn\u2019t finish my breakfast and upon leaving the breakfast area noticed that their dining room had a \u2018B\u2019 posted on the door. For those of you that don\u2019t know, the health department in New York provides letter based ratings (A, B, C, etc) to restaurants based on their sanitation and health practices. Apparently, this restaurant was not good enough to get an \u2018A\u2019. The McDonald\u2019s a few blocks away has an \u2018A\u2019 for pete\u2019s sake!! How hard could it be?? Had I seen it before we went in, I wouldn\u2019t have gone in. Interestingly enough, the last day of our stay, I went to take a picture of the sign and noticed that the health department sign had been removed. On the second evening of our stay, I was smacked on the head by a falling item. Yes, really. My husband and I were waiting for the slow elevators with another guest when a staff member came out and got in the service elevator. Seeing us waiting, he asked if we were going up and motioned us to join him. We all got in with him. In retrospect, perhaps we should have waited for the non-service elevator but given that the staff member was encouraging us to get in, it seemed okay. I was in the elevator for about 2 minutes when I looked up to see one of the plastic ceiling panels falling toward me. My husband tried to deflect it unsuccessfully and it landed smack dab on my head. Now luckily, it was made of thin plastic and I wasn\u2019t injured but what the heck???? Okay, my last gripe about this hotel is the internet access situation. They only have wired internet access available in the guestrooms and it\u2019s very slow. Wireless is available in the lobby but it\u2019s a bit of a pain to go down there for faster service. This hotel has a fantastic location near Times Square\u2026.and that\u2019s about it.

First the positives: as everyone else has mentioned, the location can't be beat. It's right at the upper edge of Times Square and within a block from the subway. We arrived very early and were able to check into our room at 11am! This was fantastic! The concierge is great-he's very knowledgeable and kind. Our room was also large for NYC standards. We had a corner, non smoking room. It had everything we needed with great toiletries, too. And the garden tub was a plus! The location was also very quiet for being so close to Times Square. The hotel is on a quiet street. Also we had a refrigerator in our room, which was great! Now, for the things that need work: the furnace! We never really got the heat right. It was either full blast heat or cold air. The maintenance came and reset it twice, but that didn't really fix the problem. The bed was hard as a rock. For that reason alone I would not return. I just didn't sleep well b/c it was so uncomfortable. If you are young and don't care, then no problem. In my 20s I wouldn't have cared. Now, in my mid-30s-I care! Finally, as so many others have said, the breakfast staff needs to go. They are rude and they hover around waiting for a tip for nothing. They did nothing for me-did not take a drink order or anything. It's a \"help yourself breakfast\". They are just doing their jobs putting the food out. That doesn't deserve a tip. Maybe that's just the food industry in NYC b/c most everywhere we ate the staff was rude and abrupt. But this hotel needs to cut out the guilt-trip tip scam.

Two negatives - \"Free\" continental breakfast - bit of a waste of time the fresh fruit was good but the pastries and dry (toasted) bagels were pretty poor. Unlimited tea and coffee is a bonus however not available in the afternoons and this coupled with a closed bar leaves you a little dry! The big arrow pointing to the tip section on breakfast slip when it was all self service was a bit unnecessary too. Reception team are a bit hit and miss, we were told that Macy's opened at 7am on the Monday morning it actually opened at 10am so quite a bit of time to kill and I was paying both bills on my card at checkout I handed over my card but they had already charged the cards we presented on check in, bit of a pain, they appear to do what they want rather than what you ask for.

I think you will find that I am is paying for this??! I appreciate a tip is necessary, however it is solely self service coffee etc nothing is brought to the table.. so very rude when a waiter opens it sees there is no tip and places it back on your table in dismay! to encourage you! very unprofessional!! Also when checking out you have to tip the bell boy for putting your cases away and again for taking them out!! Be ready for a very disappointed look if it is not a minimum of $1 a bag even for a handbag.. Upon asking is there any chance you could put this in the trash (old luggage labels, baring in mind this is after tipping them twice he simply points across the room!!) Excellent service thanks.. and its ok I will haul the 5 bags to the trunk of the car!!

We we went up to 9th floor and the room was totally disgusting. It smelled like a hundred people had been in there chain smoking and doing who knows what else. we went back downstairs and told them I booked a no smoking room, they said that's the only double bed room available, that they could give us a king size bed and a roll away until the next day and then we could move again. We stayed in the king size bed room and it didn't smell as bad but the bed frame was made for a california king or something, there was a wood platform sticking out on both sides of the bed, I hit my leg on it I don't know how many times, I still have a bruise from 2 1/2 weeks ago. The bathroom looks like it is from a eastern european prison (from movies I've seen) the tile and workmanship put into to laying the tile was subpar and they must have gotten a closeout special on the ugliest tile in the world, the tile isn't sealed so whenever a drop of water falls on any surface it looks like a gray stain until it dries and then it's still awful. I was afraid to walk on the carpeting without shoes on, the elevator is slow and rickety, the free breakfast is a joke. they have little unidentifiable bakery goods that taste as good as they look. Hotel guests look like they crawl out of bed and go down there to eat, probably how they do it in hostels in eastern eruope.

The last experience with this hotel was checking out and finding a charge from the restaurant that was charged to my room for a significant amount.

We were looking for all the comforts of a luxury hotel, but without the hefty price tag that comes with many of the top NYC hotels. And that's exactly what we got. From the moment we stepped through the door it was easy to forget that this is only a 3* hotel. The decor is classy and the lighting remincsent of a chic evening bar. The welcome was warm and the information full. The rooms were well sized and the bed uber-comfy. The romms and communal areas were well air-conditioned, which was hugely weelcomed considering the May heat outside! The bathroom was large, and the little extras were far more than you'd get in a hotel of simialar rating in the UK. I was particularly impressed with the his & hers bathrobes and slippers, and also the little bottles of conditioner (I expect shower gel, body lotion and shampoo as standard, but girls will understand that complimentary hotel shampoos often leave your hair feeling like straw so the little bottles of conditioner were a great touch!) The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast, which was a lovely surprise because it was advertised as room-only in our hotel brochure. Alright, it wasn't out-of-this-world but considering it was free it was pretty good. A range of bagels, pastries, muffins, donuts, plus tea and fresh orange juice. And if you fancied something more, there was a menu of cooked options for reasonable prices. The hotel also caters at lunch and evening, although it always looked pretty empty, and there are so many places to eat in New York that we never got round to sampling it. The bar area is lovely, but the prices are typically hotel (it cost us $21 plus tip for a beer and a Jack & coke). It was nice for a quick drink after a long night, but you can get two or three rounds for the same price elsewhere. If there was one thing that lets the hotel down a litttle it's the lifts/elevators. There are only two lifts (plus the service lift) and it just isn't enough for 46 floors. You could spend five minutes just waiting for the lift to arrive, and when it did it was jam packed. Locationally Flatotel is PERFECT. It's ten blocks (about five minutes) from the middle of Times Square and has the advantage of being just off the main street so is fairly quiet for a good night's sleep. Central park is five minutes away, as are Fifth Avenue for shopping and the Rockerfeller Centre.

We came to stay here after booking through Expedia without knowing what property or the location. The location, as it turned out, was exactly where we wanted it, and the price was good. The catch was that Flatotel (or somebody else?) claimed 4-star status for themselves, and I don't think that's accurate. So here are the property's pros and cons. The reception/checkout staff were excellent, providing quick and early check-in and help with luggage. The lobby is small for the number of units at the property - it functions well, but could use updates in lighting and furnishings. The three elevators were adequate but not speedy - they carry a heavy load considering the 40+ floors served. Some background: the building was residential apartments until it was converted to a hotel in about 2000. Our room was HUGE, a one-bedroom apartment, complete with 1.5 baths, kitchen, living room and BR. The basics - bedroom and bath - were just fine and quite satisfactory. Many of the furnishings detracted - in the living room, furniture was dated, lamps were sort of lopsided and ungainly, the coffee table had a stain. Shades throughout were difficult to raise and lower. There were many things that fell short of 4-star, yet overall, given the rate we paid, we enjoyed our stay and felt we got good value. Things to like - solid construction, no noise from neighbors, good views, nice TVs (2 of them), a bathtub with jacuzzi jets, a good bed, an extra 1/2 bath, LOTS of space. Things to not like - tired furnishings, no signage to indicate how to turn on the jacuzzi jets (the switch - discovered long after the bath - was 10 ft from the bathtub). Especially nice was the continental breakfast - good food, pleasant surroundings and service, although the space could get crowded at peak times.

There were 4 of us, myself, my wife and two kids aged 15 & 7. We really wanted some space to relax in at the end of a busy day sightseeing in New York which is why the prospect of the suite accommodation appealed to us. We booked for 5 nights and after some negotiation agreed a rate of $700 per night + taxes for a 5 night stay. If you look at the website for the Flatotel it boasts 'fully equipped kitchens'. We found this not to be the case. We were told on arrival we had been upgraded and were shown an enormous 2bed suite with en-suite bathrooms, large living area and a seperate dining area as well as a kitchen. It was on the 43 rd floor and offered great views. We were tired after a long flight and went straight to bed but the next morning as we began to explore our room things were not quite what we'd hoped for. I began to compile a list of what I thought was wrong with the room which included - 1) Almost no kitchen equipment insufficient plates, utensils, no kettle, coffee maker etc. 2) TV not working in master bedroom. 3) Slow draining sink and bath in master en-suite 4) Bed frame broken in master en-suite (resulting in sagging) I presented this to reception the next morning and told them I was going out and wanted these items fixing or an alternative room when I got back. They fixed the sink and put some bits in the kitchen and to be fair showed me the room I'd booked (which seemed OK) but given the size of the 'upgraded suite' decided to stick with it and endure the faults. On balance I guess my expectations were a little high and I was disappointed when I got there. On the whole it's a great location and offers spacious accommodation albeit a little tired now. If they did this place up it would be fantastic. I think someones just not doing their job properly as the kitchen equipment we were left was really not up to it and the other faults could have easily been detected i.e. the maid should have seen the slow draining sink and bath when washing them down.

For example, we came in very early Saturday morning, and I knew we could not check in, but was relatively sure we could get valet parking and have our luggage stored. I approached the front desk, and explained I knew check in was at 4:00PM and could we store our luggage and get valet parking, a very short reply like \"over there\" pointing his finger. I inquired about check in (didn't know if we needed to take care of paperwork then or later) and was told nothing guarenteed until after 4:00PM, so I said \"stop back after 4:00PM? and he said \"Stop back anytime you like, but it won't be ready until after 4:00PM\". In the morning another exchange about where to eat breakfast, there was a continental included with the stay, the tables when we arrived were littered with plates, and no service person available for more than 5 minutes as we stood there. We decided to go out. I appoached the front desk, with a smile and asked him (same guy) where we might get some breakfast, instead of speaking, he pointed to the breakfast room. I stated the above situation, he said \"we're not affiliated with them\" and I agaain stated we thought we would go out, (still with a smile on my face) and he said \"I don't know where you would like to go\"..... Rooms were clean, if Spartan, beds comfortable, no washcloths in the room, a robe to use. Very good location, and price, but for $50.00 more I think you might be able to do better in the same location.

The toilet looks like it's straight out of the 1980s but it does the job :) My only complaint: the hair dryer put out cold air. Lots of fast, cold air. I called down and requested another hair dryer, and I got it! But sadly, it also put out cold air. Oh well!

We didnt eat or drink in the bar but it did seem quite popular. Reading some of the reviews I wasnt sure what to expect. But it seems people are just to picky !!!! We had no problem with the lifts ( the hotel did seem a little buisy ) yes some of the bathroom cupboard doors and kitchen doors are a little chipped , but so what. It was very clean and well layed out. Check in staff were pleasent and helpful. This hotel is in a excellent location , a few blocks from time square, Rock a fella centre , central park etc. We went ice skating in Central Park on Wolman Lake. Carnegies around the block is a great for breakfast a definate must. We had planned to eat at Lombardys, but the place was closed due to the oven bing cleaned, so we asked in a local bar in Little Italy where they could reccomend they suggested L'asso which was around the block from Lombardys. I t was one of the best pizzas me and my wife have ever had !!!!! Also the Burger Joint located in the foyer of the Le Park Meridian is a must , trust me it is in there. Best Burger ever. Statten Island free ferry is a good way to see the New York Skyline and the Staue of Liberty !!! The Top of The Roc sunset and sunrise ticket is the best view of New York , lift ride is pretty good too !! $32 each , but worth it .

I had such a wonderful time and everything was just perfect! Well, almost everything....everything except FLATOTEL! While staying at Flatotel, I was electrocuted while trying to plug my mobile phone charger into the outlet. I filed a 'report' and a mainenance guy came to the room to check the plug and nothing happened to him so his response was that it was fine. I said well it may be for you right now, but I could not let go of the plug while getting volts sent through my entire body. Another gentleman came upstairs to see me about 10 hours later to ask if I needed a doctor. The next day my lap top, my lap top bag and a bunch of French resources (I am a French teacher), my friend's lap top cord and international plug converter were stolen from our hotel room when we left for NYE celebrations. I didn't feel that either of these situations were handled well by the hotel. Reports were made internally and I was told repeatedly that they were going to take care of everything for me and that they took these matters very seriously, but then once I left Manhattan, I never heard from them again. I left all of my contact information (with 2 different people in person and one other on the phone when I returned home) and whenever I called I got passed around to 2 or more people and never got straight answers. Once I finally got in touch with the director of security he told me I needed to file a report. This should have been told to me at the hotel when it happened not 2-3 weeks after the fact. The hotel said they were taking care of everything for me, so I assumed that everything....actually meant everything... Once in contact with this 'gentleman' I was made to feel like the robbery was my fault and that I must have left my door open. I was getting NO help from him so went ahead and called about 6 different numbers until I found the right one to make a robbery report with the NYPD. I was just extremely let down by this hotel.

Pros: Good location, about a block away from Radio City Music Hall and within walking distance to Rockefeller Center. Room was large - was put in what was basically a small apartment with one bedroom, small kitchen & dining area, and main area with a fold out couch. Cons: Everything else. Every time I asked the staff for something it took multiple calls to get resolved. Made reservations for 4 people. Called and confirmed that we were a party of FOUR. Arrived & checked in at 3:30pm to discover only two towels in the bathroom so called down to the Front Desk right away reminding them we had FOUR people and needed provisions for FOUR, including the sofa to be tuned into a bed with linens & pillows along with adequate towels. It took three more calls and two trips to the Front Desk before that night at ** 11pm ** someone finally came up to make up the sofa bed. And even then I had to call back to get towels and pillows. Who makes up a bed but doesn't bring pillows? And why on earth was this so hard? Every time we needed something we waited and waited for hours, and then called again. and waited.... Half the time no one answered the phone both at the Front Desk or at Room Service. The room was really musty and stale, like it had been sitting closed up with no ventilation for a very long time. The AC wasn't on so it was also very warm, and took about 45mins -1 hour to get the smell out and the place cooled off. They have a flier about how they are \"green\" and ask you to turn off everything including the air when you are not in the room - I appreciate wanting to save energy but I also need to be comfortable. Some ventilation on a regular basis is seriously required here. The room is shabby and in dire need of a thorough clean-up. The paint and wallpaper is peeling, the furniture is scuffed and scratched, the bathroom has rusty fixtures, the carpet is disgustingly ancient, half the blinds for the windows were broken and could not be opened.... and the bed frame was just nasty - old, raw wood that looked like someone had picked up off the street. The mattress was new, and I checked and found no signs of bedbugs on the mattress but jeez, that platform the mattress was on needed to be thrown away or at least covered up. The room didn't seem dirty - the couches and bed linens were clean and in good condition, everything else just seemed really old and tired. Yes, the bathroom is big with a whirlpool tub, but it took about an hour to drain completely after a shower, and that fancy whirlpool didn't work. And again, the tub was scuffed up and gouged. Used Hard and Put Away Wet. Room Service delivered breakfast one morning and dropped the tray, knocking off two tall glasses of orange juice shattering them so the carpet was covered in juice and glass. An accident, it wasn't her fault, she was horrified and apologized profusely. She called Housekeeping from the room to tell them we needed broken glass cleaned up right away and then went to replace the food items for me. Took 30 minutes for new glasses of juice to arrive. (Juice. 30 minutes. For Juice) and still no sign of housekeeping. Finally a woman did show up, came in to look at the mess, responded that this was a big mess and when were we checking out as she'd come back and clean it after we were gone. To which I replied I need the broken glass cleaned up right away, even though it was on carpet and not an easy clean up it was in a large area and I didn't want anyone stepping on glass. And I thought that would be their attitude as well. ** She left without doing anything**. About 45 minutes later a maintenance man shows up with a straw broom and a dustpan. He picks up glass pieces by hand and sweeps up what he can - from CARPET - and then takes a roll of paper towel that he gets wet in the sink and starts rubbing the floor. Proclaims it clean and leaves. Just another example of the lack of attention to detail. A vacuum cleaner was required AT LEAST, and perhaps it would have been nice to have had breakfast comped for the inconvenience of having to sit around all morning while they tried to figure out what to do about the broken glass - nope! TV reception was really bad - the living room area had a flat screen but it had a defective screen so the bottom half was much darker than the top, and the old console TV in the bedroom had lots of static and a poor picture quality. We didn't watch a whole lot of TV when in the room, too much hassle. Room Service food - give it a D. Ordered breakfast twice (kids really get a kick out of the whole Room Service indulgence) and it was only okay, certainly not worth the crazy prices - including a delivery fee, the 18% gratuity, the taxes....and then asking for an additional tip on top of this. Breakfast for 3 (eggs, bacon, toast, nothing fancy) with juice & coffee = $115 dollars after all the additional fees. That's crazy. Esp since it was mediocre food. The one time the kids ordered dinner they left most of it - the pizza seemed like it was frozen and the hamburgers was obviously premade store bought discs. If kids won't eat it you know its got to be bad. Overall this hotel sufficed for what were my two biggest needs which were space and location, but we'd not stay here again nor recommend it to anyone. It was not worth the high room prices at all. Disappointing. When we checking out the woman at the Front Desk said \"Sign here\" when she handed me the bill and nothing else. No \"How was your stay?\" or \"Was everything alright\". Nothing. I was prepared to list my issues with our stay if they asked but they never did.

When we arrived at 7PM the next day (2 hours later, plenty of time for the room to be ready), it was almost as if we were completely unexpected. It took the front desk clerk - a harried and clearly beleaguered fellow - about 25 minutes to figure out where we would be staying. He repeatedly and frantically radioed for \"Maria\" to radio back and confirm that the suite was ready, I never heard her call back... not a good sign. Poor Maria. Forty-six floors and she seemed to be the only member of the cleaning staff on duty that evening. -- After lounging in the dark and rather odd lobby for nearly half an hour, we were finally given the key to our 1BR suite. We waited ~10 minutes for an elevator (they have TWO serving forty-six stories) and finally, with great anticipation, set foot in our luxury suite. It was anything but. The carpet was old and dingy, the kitchen was dilapidated (but, admittedly, functional), and the furnishings were odd and worn. The bathrooms were quite nice -- clearly renovated more recently -- but the main living area and kitchen were a throwback to ~1985. We asked whether someone could *please* come vacuum the carpets (they looked like they hadn't been touched in weeks) and were assured that someone would be right up -- but no one ever appeared. Basically, we were given an old 1BR apartment that was about halfway through the renovation process. And the part that wasn't renovated was far, far below par given the \"luxury\" standing advertised in all of the hotel's marketing. -- After 30 minutes in the suite, we decided to head out for dinner, and I took the opportunity to speak with the front desk staff again on the way out. I requested another room but was told that it was unlikely that they could do anything - they said they would look into it and let me know more when we returned from dinner. Having booked the suite through American Express Travel, I called their Platinum desk and explained the situation. They called and spoke with the manager, and eventually negotiated a renovated King bed room for the second night of our two night stay. I would have preferred to move immediately, but took what I could get. -- After moving to the King room (*NOT* a fully renovated suite, by the way) things got better. The room appeared to be much cleaner, and was on a floor of the hotel that generally appeared to be in much better condition - new carpeting, better lighting, etc. Given that we were moved to a smaller (and less expensive) room, versus the original 1BR suite, I would have expected an offer of at least a partial refund. None was forthcoming, and frankly I was just too tired to argue about it. Bottom line is that I simply would not stay at the Flatotel again, nor would I recommend it. It is a very odd place, one that is clearly still making the transition from apartment building to hotel. The staff and management appear to be hit and miss in their attitude and general professionalism (or lack thereof). When I'm paying ~$1,000 for two nights, I expect more.

When they fixed the heater, they changed the vents which looked like they hadn't been touched since 1910, and the repair guy was a bit repulsed.

When I read the reviews for this hotel, I had a lot of trepidation staying there, but I had no choice. My company had already booked my room. But I did call ahead of time to request a corner room on a higher floor (middle of 44 floors), having no problems going from a king bed to a queen. And I'm glad I did. It was a HUGE room, with plenty of drawers for storage and appealing modern decor, including a chaise sofa and oversize full-length mirror. Also at the front desk, ask for a cord to connect to the free internet (which was fast enough, definitely not as slow as some reviewers have noted). Overall, I think someone at the hotel must have read these reviews, because it seemed like they corrected nearly everything they could! I enjoyed the 3 nights I stayed there and the location, if you're from out of town or if you have meetings near Times Square, is hard to beat. I read about noise issues: no problems with that. Big room in the corner shielded from any disruptive sounds. I walked into a mini-foyer that had a recessed nook for a desk, comfortable (and adjustable) work chair, fridge (set too cold so my water froze, so adjust that before you put anything in!), mini-microwave and electric tea kettle/hotpot. I read about service issues: no problems with that either. My air conditioning was not working properly, so I called for service and they handled it promptly. And soon, it was working well. I also found the staff very professional and friendly. I read about dingy windows: pretty clear views from what I saw, and quite a panoramic view, though most of it are buildings since we are in New York, and in mid-town. I read about the half-shower door, and yes, that's correct, but if you adjust that wonderful shower head, it won't splatter everywhere. I don't know why they use this design - I hear it's not uncommon in European hotels - but it is annoying. It keeps the water from splashing onto the toilet, but again you have to stand pretty close to the wall to keep the water from getting all over the bathroom. There's a big jacuzzi tub in there, so plenty of space, but I wasn't too keen on taking a bath. Didn't have total confidence in the thoroughness of its cleaning. I just didn't get that sense of spotlessness you might get from other higher end hotels. There was also no moisturizer among the bath items, which is a first for me. But the bathroom did have some perks: great little built-in shelves in the bathroom mirror to get your toiletries out of the way and a comfy robe and slippers were hanging on that glass half-shower door. There were some things the hotel could not do much about: only 2 elevators (be prepared for waits) and furniture and walls that have seen better days. I'd advise keeping the lights on low.

They had a room for me at the Courtyard Marriott in Harlem (I was there for work - and our offices are in midtown, so the Flatotel was walking distance.) It was almost too late to be enraged, but I went to the other hotel - they paid for cab fare there and back, and told me that for the next night, i would have an upgraded room. I shudder to think what the regular room looks like, because the upgraded room was bare-bones basic and gross. I spent very little time at the hotel, as I was busy for work, but when I checked out after my first (what would have been second) night stay, I asked the door man to hail me a cab (mind you, I had my luggage with me that no one helped me with) and he told me that I'm better off going to 6th Ave. to find one. WTF?!? All in all, my experience was not great, and when they sent an email for an online survey to be filled out and I clicked the link, it sent me to the wrong web site.

When we entered the lobby area of the hotel I was surprised by how small it was as on previous trips to Manhattan I have been used to more grand lobbys. It was nicely decorated though, very modern but still comfortable. The hotel has a small bar within this area which seemed fairly busy most nights. We got checked in very quick and easily and made our way to the lifts. I was concerned after reading previous reviews that we would be facing long waits during our stay for the lifts, however there was one waiting for us and we found that on most occasions throughout the week we really didn't wait long at all for one to arrive at our floor! Our room was on the 9th floor at the front of the hotel which ment we really had no view at all, unless you like office block windows! I wasn't in New York for the view from a hotel room though so that wasn't an issue to me at all! The room itself was fantastic! We had two huge beds which at the end of a long day were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and I loved the crisp white bed linen! It was well equipped with a large fridge, microwave and tea/coffee facilities, desk and wi-fi if you need it. The bathroom had a small tub and a powerfull shower which seemed to have hot water all day, or certainly at the different times of day we used it. The decor made the room fresh and I was so impressed with the maid service and cleanliness of the bedroom and bathroom. There was a electronic safe in the closet and the closet itself had more than enough room for all our clothes and we stored our cases and purchases in here!! I can't comment too much on the staff as we really didn't need their help much apart from at check in/out. I did require a new hairdryer brought to the room one day and it was with me within 10 minutes of my call to reception. The best thing about the hotel has to be it's superb location! Literally around the corner from Radio City and Magnolia bakeries, which bake the yummiest of cakes in the world ever and I have tasted a few!! There is a diner one block away called Lindys which have a very good menu. We ate here on a couple of occasions however it is slightly more expensive. I think this is because they play on having New York's finest cheesecake! Look out for Cosmic Diner though on 52nd @ 8th, it is well worth every penny of its well priced menu! We had our best meals here, the breakfast's are to die for ooohh and the blueberry pie is fabulous!! We booked to see Wicked at the Gershwin whilst planning our trip and luckily Flatotel is only a few blocks away! If you are going to see a show however and are not fussed about what you see I would reccommend you hold off and go to one of the tkts booths on Times Square or at Battery Park. We picked up tickets for Guys and Dolls and Chicago there for less than half the price we would have payed online!! If you are walking around Times Square and are approached by someone selling comedy club tickets, stop and have a listen, seriously! We bought some tickets off a tout for \"Comic Strip Live\" It's where Chris Rock was discovered and tonnes of other comics and it was one of our best nights on our trip! Well worth the money, I think we paid around $25 each, maybe less and for that we really got to see some amazingly funny acts! The hosts in between the main acts were also hillarious!! Drinks here were a little more expensive and there is a two drink minimum limit per person but you get a show which blows any comedy club in the UK out the water! I would also suggest using the Gray Line hop on hop off tour. You will come across many people as you walk around Manhattan trying to sell you bus tickets, We purchased an all loops tour from the people in the red jackets. I can't remember how much for but included in the cost was the ferry to Liberty and Ellis Island and either the Empire State Building or Top of The Rock admission, as well as a guided bus tour through Uptown, Downtown, Harlem, Brooklyn and a nightime tour also. The tours stop at specific tourist attractions across the island and have local guides who really know there stuff!! Great photo opportunities aswell!! This hotel was by far the best I have stayed in in New York and at the time, was the most reasonably priced. There really are no negative points I can make about Flathotel or the staff.

I was definitely surprised with the large layout. My brother had a basic Queen room. About 1/2 the size of ours, but still cozy. Pretty much just the Queen bed, desk/chair, restroom... A few weird things i encountered. The walls are paper thin. Walking to our room, we could hear our neighbors' (3 rooms down) tv, and their conversation. Also, didn't seem to be AC in the Hallways. Everytime we walked out of the Elevator, it was really hot/stale. I couldn't wait to run in our room and turn the AC on. Another, there was only 1/2 a shower door. I wish I would have taken a pic...Imagine a normal bathtub with 3 walls, and where the door/shower curtain should be, there is a 2 foot plastic swinging door, that only covers the front half of the tub (where the shower head/faucet is). Water splashed all over the floor everytime we showered, and created a small flood under the sink each time. When room was cleaned, the housekeeper would refill our tissue box, with what seemed to be the leftovers from another almost empty box. I knew because the first few I pulled out were peach, and the rest in the box were white. That kinda grossed me out. Also, we stayed 4 days 3 nights, and didn't get washcloths until day 2. Toiletries aren't fancy...bring your own!! Shampoo, conditioner, body wash gel, and lotion all smelled like pinesol. Seriously, i TRIED to use a few of them, but they all looked like the same product (white cream) that were labeled differently...PINESOL!

Upon arrival, check-in was a breeze, even though we weren't the only ones arriving at that moment. Within 10 minutes, we had a key and were on our way up to the 23rd floor. One of the reasons I chose Flatotel was because they have a room with 2 double beds. The elevator was a bit slow, but nothing unreasonable. We got to our room, and were delighted. The beds looked comfy. The room was plenty large enough for 2 female friends to share without bumping into each other. The fridge and microwave were nice to have. The window opened, which we liked. Bathroom large and clean. We were directly across from the elevator, which concerned me at first. However, we were never bothered by the dinging of the bell. We heard our neighbor briefly the first night, but no more after that. Front desk staff were extremely helpful whenever we had a question. We had a 5:30 a.m. wakeup call on marathon morning, which came on time. We requested extended checkout, which they easily obliged. Gregory, the concierge, recommended a fantastic day spa for a massage after the marathon (NY Nails & Spa--ask for Tim!). We were able to use the business center to do online checkin for our flights, no fee. Complimentary bagels and coffee each morning--very adequate. The location is probably to best reason to stay there. It's on a quiet street, but only blocks from the lights of Times Square, Broadway shows, restaurants, subway stations, Rockefeller Center, Central Park. Oh my gosh, too much to name. Any cons with our stay? Of course, nothing is perfect. What's with the 1/2 glass door in the shower? It made a terrific mess with the water. However, the shower itself--awesome! No soap dish, as mentioned in another review, and really no soap for hand washing. That glycerine soap is more facial. No guide for television channels. Maid service entered our room while we were showering/dressing on our last morning? When we're due to check out, shouldn't our room be near the end for cleaning?

We are a mid-thirties couple with a child who prefers smaller boutique hotels over your big brands but this time I would have preferred the Marriott PROS...location is excellent in the midst of midtown and steps to Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Central Park. Only other pro is size of rooms...very big and they do have a modern decor (a little too much \"less is more\" though...there is almost nothing that it appeared to be let go, not cool). CONS...run down over the years, somewhat dirty (they were spraying Lysol everywhere when we arrived and it reaked and rooms/elevators just felt fine nothing specially attended to), no amenities (restaurant and room service are closed for some reason and we were never made aware), customer service (no one greeted us and the reception area was dark and unlit, reception had no clue of a room change, they just seemed to do their job), manager tried bait & switch (see below) So we requested early check in and was so \"graciously\" given it because they were able to give us a different room that was immediately open and because obviously no one else would have wanted it. Being pregnant and with a 4 year old we were very happy...until we got there. The room they so graciously gave us was, yes, huge BUT it looked like an old efficiency apartment with a new bed thrown in it. It was unkept, reaked of lysol, dirty stained rug, had an old disgusting kitchen, outdated bathroom, and the hallways to get to it looked like rent by the hour rooms. If I had never been to the hotel before and not known what the newer floors looked like I would have demanded my money back and went elsewhere. We were switched back to our original room and the room was fine but our overall experience left a lot to be desired. We got a low rate so I can't complain but would never pay full price or really even go back. Oh and on a Sunday morning when all 40something floors are trying to leave there were two small working elevators and you had to wait at least 10-15 minutes if you could even get in an elevator. My husband ended up walking down 9 flights with our suitcase because he had waited 20 minutes and still couldn't hitch an elevator ride. All the people who had gone to the lobby to get their \"complimentary\" breakfast were stuck waiting forever with coffee and bagels in hand trying to get back to their rooms.

Wanting to be near shopping, Rockefeller Center and Times Square on New Year's, we also had the challenge of finding a bigger space for a family of four. After some research, Flatotel arrived at the top of our list for location and that they had a larger suite with a kitchen that could accomodate us. We booked our trip, eventhough the price seemed rather high-but hoped it'd be worth it. Let me say that the lobby is great, although small...however the elevators seem to have trouble accomodating the number of people that use them. The room was fair in appearance and cleanliness, but there were several days that we requested maid service more than once, and never got it. On one particular occasion, we had not left the room as of about 11 am, my daughter was still alseep and I was in the bathroom getting dressed, when there was a knock at the bathroom door. I assumed it was my daughter waking up and opened it only to find the maid staring at me. I must've looked rather shocked by her appearance in our room as she insisted that I tell her when I would be out so she could clean! I was infuriated! I didn't know maids can enter a room and see people there, only to knock on the door when they're in the bathroom getting dressed! There was another incident with another one of the staff that I will not go into detail, but they actually threw a pen when they got upset with our conversation. Not professional, to say the least. While I will say it is centally located, and the larger room with a kitchen is not easy to find, unless we were desperate, we would not return to this hotel.

Booked a Deluxe King on Quick Book for an embarrassingly low rate for mid-town NYC. Arrived at the hotel at 8AM from a red eye flight from Seattle. (Jet Blue great as always..new terminal is fantastic.)Room was ready when we arrived and the front desk was extremely professional and friendly. Likewise with the bellman, very helpful and courteous. There is no grand lobby, just a small reception and concierge area in a space that flows into the hotel bar. There is an office center on the 2nd floor where we printed our return boarding passes for free. Room was roughly 400 sq. ft. Furnishings are stark and modern which is our style. Nothing overstuffed or cluttered. Heat worked fine which was great as it was 06 degrees out and the windows opened if it got too warm. The wired internet was very fast and we had no connection problems for the week with the notebook. The wireless worked fine on our iPhones. The bathroom was huge and spotless. (Note to person who couldn't find a bathroom outlet for a hairdryer. It is inside the built-in shelf in the mirror wall where the complimentary toiletries are stored.Very convenient.) We were close to the elevators so there was a some noise, but nothing unexpected as it is a hotel. Entire stay was great and the service was consistently top notch. The small fridge in the room was very handy. Shopped at the local liquor store for supplies. Several times we ordered ice (no ice machines) and cocktail/wine glasses from room service and they were delivered promptly at no charge and with a smile. Houskeeping somehow managed to clean our room within an hour of the time we hung the tag on the door requesting service yet we never actually saw a housekeeper. Each time we went out and returned the bellmen greeted us like friends and were very efficient the few times we needed a taxi to go to SOHO or the West Village. When we checked out the bellman picked up our bags and stored them quickly and with a smile. I don't recall if there was a charge so if there was it was minimal. The hotel is the perfect location for seeing NYC in any season. Times Square and the theaters and Restaurant Row are just a few blocks to the right. Carnegie Hall is a couple blocks North. Radio City and Rockefeller Center are two blocks East and MOMA just another block of so East. There is a 24hr gourmet cafeteria with an overwhelming selection of quality prepared and cooked to order food on 51st. one block away and reachable though the passageway in the building across the street by Bobby Flay's Bar Americain. Excellent for a quick bite in the morning or a snack to take back to the room late night. We were fortunate enough to be in the city during Restaurant Week which goes for two weeks each winter and summer. Awesome and expensive spots for $25 lunch and $35 dinners. Some favorites were B. Smith (huge portions and fantastic Southern-inspired food and the best service ever), Vong, Asiate, and Murals on 54th. in the Warwick Hotel. Our best tourist experience was the Radio City Music Hall Tour. It was fascinating to see all of the massive Art Deco work up close and behind the scenes. And you meet a costumed Rockette for a chat! The bottom line is The Flatoel deserves at least 3 stars for the quality, location and value.

We both liked the decor, which is pretty minilimist but wouldn't suit all; the shower above the bath was powerful. The bed was huge and very comfortable. There was a flat screen TV, small fridge, microwave, tea / coffee and iron / board so not much amiss there. The only grumbles are you can hear the adjoining rooms more than what you would expect, the lack of sockets near mirrors for hairdriers which Caroline picked up on (females take note!) and the lighting in the room is a bit poor. There are signs of a need for an update but overall no real issues. The hotel let itself down slightly when I rang the day before, explained we were on our honeymoon and asked for a room on a high floor. We were given one on the 19th (out of 48 I think it is) so not great (could have been worse I suppose!) but then my mum rang and left a message at reception for us to say enjoy ourselves etc and it was never passed on which was disappointing.

The upside is hard to ignore, but so is the downside. If you are paying more than $200 per night (even in New York City), then can probably stay in a nicer room with a similar location.

Perhaps not rude, but certainly not friendly. The girl in the shop, the porters, the reception desk. Not one hello or good morning which I think is really bad. The location was ideal.

Flatotel's location couldn't be better, the heart of midtown Manhatten. 2 blocks from 5th avenue shopping, Radio City, Rockefeller Plaza. Less than 10 blocks from Time Square. This hotel is all abotu location. Central Park, Bryant Park, Broadway theatres, it's all within 5 minutes walk. The hotel itself is nice. Not blow you away RItz Carlton or Bellagio nice, but nice. I was stuck with room service for the trip because fo the way my company was dealign with the trip expenses. This was inconvenient for me, but not through any fault of the hotel. The room service overall is terrific. The menu is very good, response time is fantastic, I don't think I waited over 30 minutes the entire trip. It was of course pricey, but it's room service right? The Bathroom is on the small side but clean. Decorative tilework and all the supplies you need are provided. The room was cleaned and tidied up each day. No complaints about the cleaning staff. The room itself provides a fridge, microwave, coffee pot, tv, internet access, closet etc. All the essentials are there and it's a decent sized space. From what I hear it's huge for NYC, I can't speak to that. The front desk could be a little more professional, they aren't as polished as you'd expect for a $400 a night hotel. They met any requests I had but they didn't have that exceptional customer service attitude you recieve at top tier hotels. More than once I was witness to them custoem rbashing, either on the phone or behind a customers back. No one wants to see that kind of thing. Overall the hotel is rated pretty fairly on the site, 3.5-4* is right on.

The Flatotel is elegant and sleekly decorated in a modern way that wouldn\u2019t be exactly my style at home, but thought it looked cool in their hotel. The room was huge by NY standards (easily twice the size of my prior room at the Algonquin). Included was a king-size bed, nice furniture, comfortable bed with good linens, Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, refrigerator, microwave and electric kettle. The staff were very professional and helpful, even the waiters in the restaurant! (we had some surly servers around town). We asked for a room on the non-street side of the building, so had no view at all but it was absolutely silent. I loved that they served delicious free morning coffee in the lobby and that they actually had half & half for it unlike every other place I went to in NYC. Milk in my coffee makes me grumpy. We had breakfast in the restaurant (Moda) one morning and it was by far the best breakfast we had during our trip. Would have liked to try other meals there but never managed it. My only complaints are regarding the lack of free wireless internet, and some issues with housekeeping (couldn\u2019t get a TV remote that worked, bath towels were torn and the bathrobe we were given was \u201csoiled\u201d.

You can't exactly see through it, but you definitely make out outlines and colors.

Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised by the GREAT location, well decorated lobby, and courteous front desk agent. The room was spacious although seriously lacking artwork. The bathroom was also a good size, however, the layout underutilized the space. What was rather shocking was the shower curtain or should I say half shower glass door. I have never been in a hotel bathroom that you could not close a shower curtain or shower door to prevent water from spilling all over the floor. Very unusual. What ruined this stay for me, was the rude concierge and a serious issue with false advertisement and the lack of concern expressed by the management. Now I must admit, I do hold hotel personnel to a very high standard, as I am an Assistant General Manager of a four diamond property with a staff that is continuously praised for their customer service efforts, but I never expected to be ignored or to be treated as if asking a concierge a question was an annoyance. On our last evening my husband and I ordered a bottle of wine, the wine special of the month was advertised in the room with a picture of a white wine bottle with short description and a red wine bottle with a short description. Under the description was listed $9 plus an offering of complimentary tastings on Wednesday Nights. Well we ordered the special, 45 minutes later, and after 4 phone calls to inform us they could not find the bottle, wasn't sure what bottle we were talking about, and what the price was, a server knocks with the bottle. We questioned the $9 price on the advertisement and were quickly told, I don't know and handed the bill, which was for $90.12. Because it was almost 2:30 in the morning, we thought we would figure it out at check out. Upon check out, I questioned the cost, showing the agent the advertisement and asking for an adjustment. After about 4, obviously not sincere, apologies she approached the manager to inquire about the bottle. When she returned I was told, \"Well that's the way it is, its $9 per glass.\" Even though the advertisement didn't state that. So I want to know, how do you get 10 glasses of wine out of a bottle to equal a $90 charge? Needless to say, no adjustment was made (except for our extra $10 tip we had added) and we left. As a manager, I find this type of attitude appalling and simply shocking. It was an obvious mistake in printing that they should have adjusted.

I'm not discounting that review, nor the reviewer's experience of the hotel - this is just mine. Firstly my other half and I stayed in a renovated double room on the 16th floor which was the biggest room that we have ever stayed in (and especially large for New York, I hear). It was very tidy and had a very clean bathroom with large oval shaped bath. The cleaning staff were very good at keeping it tidy (especially as we generally like to 'spread out' the contents of our suit cases when we arrive anywhere). The hotel staff were polite and courteous with a special nod going to the two concierges who were very knowledgeable and gave us some great tips of how to work New York to our benefit. There was a speedy free internet connection in the business centre that came in very useful for us too. We also ate in the restaurant on Christmas Day which was delicious and plentiful - if not a tad expensive. The only bad points I can really make about the hotel are, firstly, the lifts - it takes ages for one to arrive that is not full! Secondly, there is not much natural light in the room we had. There was adequate lighting in the rooms but no central switchboard so we had to turn on/off seven different lights at a time. Oh, and the reception on the TV was a bit ropey on some channels. I really do consider these three things to be negligible however. The best part about staying at this hotel? Besides the generous space in the rooms, it is the location. You are three blocks north of Times Square and 7 blocks south of Central Park. Plus, there is a subway station about 100 metres away on 53rd st.

This year was midtown, and the Flatotel is ideally situated for theater, museums, and the park. That's the nicest thing I can think to say about my stay. Here's the rest: 1. When we arrived, the room was not yet ready so we wandered the city, but not before noticing the other four sets of travelers who were in stranded in the lobby waiting for their not-yet-ready rooms. Eventually, the room was readied (two hours after check-in time), but we were so happy to be in NYC, it was no big deal. 2. I pre-paid for a 5-night stay in a queen non-smoking room. As soon as the elevator doors opened on our floor, we were hit with a solid wall of smoke and I knew that we had been given a smoking room. This was further confirmed when we walked into the room and saw the big ashtray on the desk. Duh. I called downstairs and asked to be moved to a non-smoking room (I had a copy of the receipt specifying non-smoking) and was told that there were no non-smoking rooms available for the duration of my stay. I told the employee I would really like them to figure something out and to their credit they called back and offered to move us to an \"unrenovated\" non-smoking room on a higher floor. They also did kindly let us see the room before we decided whether to move. The new room was as big as an apartment, and did not smell like smoke. We took it. 3. Turns out that the reason the new room did not smell like smoke was that it smelled like cheese. Funky, funky cheese. The smell of fontina cheese was charging up from the kitchen through the elevator shaft. As we rode down elevator from the 32nd floor, we realized that each floor smelled either like smoke or like cheese. Glad we chose cheese. 4. Next day, card key does not work. Go down 32 floors to have it reprogrammed, go back up 32 floors to try again. Card key does not work. Go back down 32 flights, they had programmed it for the old room. Back up. . . etc. 5. Slow elevators. 6. Bizarrely hard bed. Really, really hard. Actually woke up during the night because my arms had fallen asleep at the shoulders. Sore, sore, sore. 7. Weird housekeeping service. They made the bed, but no vacuuming or cleaning the sink, no replacing shampoo, soap, or conditioner. Since two of us were staying there for 5 nights, we ran out. I left a note on day 3 for replacements. 8. Next day, card key does not work. (No, I wasn't keeping it next to my phone or other cards). Go downstairs to have it reprogrammed, am told that the \"subway demagnetizes the cardkeys\" Okay. Never happened to me in any of my other trips to NYC, but whatever. 9. Next day, card key does not work. Have to remind the desk clerk to program it for more than just that day. Card key works for the duration of the trip, despite many, many trips on subway. 10. The last night at the Flatotel: the mirror that is affixed to the ancient, rotting bathroom door with mini screws from the 1960's finally gives up and crashes onto the bathroom floor, shattering into a billion pieces. Front desk is apologetic and concerned for everyone's well-being, maintenence does a great job with the shop vac of getting everything vacuumed up, manager drops by and offers to move us to a different room (and trade cheese for smoke? no thanks!). 11. Finally make it out of Flatotel. So disastrous that it's comical. Bright spot: some of the staff try really, really hard, especially the young men who deal with the bags. Problem is, they're always trying to play catch-up. Management needs to be more proactive. Great midtown location and new bedspreads may get them in the door, but lack of attention to detail and letting problems slide by won't get anyone to come back. p.s. Whoever did this hotel's website should get some kind of award for special effects or maybe lighting. What's the equivalent of an Academy Award for websites? The Webby? This guy should get one.

For everyone who scores it a 4 or higher, there is going to be someone who complains about the bathroom scales not working and scores it a 1. So we chose Flatotel because it currently gets a 3 (which is fine by us) and had a great location at a decent price for the heart of the city. We were not disappointed. On arrival from our Virgin Upper Class flight from UK and a taxi ride from JFK, we were greeted by attentive staff and had room on the 10th floor. It was large for a mid-city room, clean, and had nice furnishings, a fridge, microwave and kettle. The bed was advertised as queen size but actually felt more like a king and we also had a CD player and TV which we didn't watch much of, but it worked fine. The bathroom was spacious and clean, and the shower was great. Maid service was perfect. Absolutely above average in all aspects. During the stay (7 nights) we had no problems with the hotel and used the gym every day (great view on 46th floor) and on one occasion when the heavens opened we paid the $20 each to use the wonderful health club across the street. Some have complained that it was too noisy but we had no problems with that either, so we must have been lucky. The main reason for us to come to New York was not to stay in our room, and the location of Flatotel could not be any better, a few blocks south from Central Park, between 6th and 7th. Walking distance to some great restaurants (including Gordon Ramsay, which is at the London, one block north). After an exhausting but fantastic trip to New York, I would recommend Flatotel for great value, good rooms and location. We didn't see the apartment rooms but I hear they are great for families. To put Flatotel into perspective, think of your average room in a Holiday Inn next to an airport (clean, functional). It's a lot better than that. Then think of 5 star luxury of the Connaught or Claridges in London. Flatotel is not quite as nice.

Travelocity has it rated as a 4 star, but its nowhere close to that, and I think that gives alot of false impressions that this might be something of a hidden gem - a nice, comfortable boutique hotel in upper Midtown. That's just wrong. A standard queen bed room here is just above something you might find in a youth hostel. The hotel is in a good location, and the room was a decent size for NYC, with some closet space and even a few drawers, and there were no bed bugs, but the positives end there. First, the room was non smoking but still wreaked of cigarette smoke, which came in through the vent in the bathroom, along with other assorted noises. It was noisy - we could hear everything in the hallway, including normal conversations. The room's door was metallic and didn't shut very well, it rattled every time someone else opened or closed their door. There was a huge gap between the bottom of the door and the floor. The dark, dingy industrial carpet didn't help deaden any sound either. The platform bed/headboard furniture piece was something straight out of the early 80s. The mattress sat directly on top of a large wooden platform, no box spring. At first, I thought the wooden platform might make the mattress feel too firm, but after lying in it for an hour or so, it felt just like a hammock, no support whatsoever. We had very sore backs the next morning. Although the room was a decent size, the huge, old CRT TV took up about 1/4 of the space, and there's no Video On-Demand system. Instead, they have a VCR hooked up to the TV, just in case you brought some video tapes with you I guess. They do have satellite though. Finally, the bathroom was ok, but dark with noise and cigarette odors coming in through the vent. Its easy to disregard the peeling caulk and mold in the corners of a hotel bathroom, but the cigarette stench was hard to get past since the towels stank. But at least it was roomy with hot water. In my opinion, its not worth the $200/night or so they ask for a room, and certainly not a 4-star quality hotel.

This hotel has had the designer touch. It looks good in all the promotional material but lacks soul or any sense of excitement. All drab greys and browns. As others have mentioned clearly rooms recently refurbished but treatment is very superficially they haven\u2019t bothered to upgrade or move electrical sockets. So wires for the TV were trailed across the wall. The only way of switching the lights was at the light fitting there was no wall switch this became annoying after a while. The reading light over the bed where too high. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and could only just reach it when sitting in bed. The quality of finish to the refurbished decorations was very poor (Paint splattered where it shouldn\u2019t be, tiles poorly grouted and hinges packed out with clearly visible blocks of plywood and wardrobe doors which were difficult to close). A framed picture or two on the walls would have improved the feel of the room which while adequately sized did no feel particular cosy. There was a couch but it was hard and uncomfortable and you would not have bean able to sit on it and see the TV. Worst of all however was the bed. A rock hard mattress on an unsprung bed base, which despite days of hard core sight seeing to tire us out and the odd relaxing cocktail of the evening still manage to interrupt the sleep of both me and my wife during our stay. We found the lifts slow. Three lifts did not appear adequate for a building of this size I have not reason to fault the service the hotel offered. When we asked for more coat hangers these where promptly provided but we tend to keep out selves to our selves and not demand much of the hotels facilities other than the room. We would however commend the doorman who went to great efforts to find us a cab to JFK during Friday rush hour. Had we not booked the hotel through Expedia and got a good price and the 6th day for free we would have been much more disappointed that we were.

We arrived Saturday morning, June 9th and planned on leaving our luggage with the front desk until we could check in later in the day, however the person at the front desk said he would check and see if a room was available for us to check in early. We were pleasantly surprised that an early check-in would be accommodated and we went straight to our room. Late Saturday afternoon we arrived in our room after walking around the city to get ready for dinner that evening. There was a letter addressed to a different guest with a box of cookies from Moda. We assumed that since we checked in early the paperwork wasn't checked and we just received another guest's letter and cookies and left it on the table. We went to dinner for the evening and returned around 12:45am. As we approached our room we thought it was strange that we could hear such loud voices that seemed to be coming from our room, but we assumed that maybe the walls were thin and that we were hearing our neighbors. We tried to open the door, but it was latched shut. Strange since neither myself or my friend were in the room. Someone inside our room opened the door and we asked why were they in our room. There were six people in our room sitting on our beds, eating the box of cookies the hotel had left as well as our snacks. They said they thought they were in their room; that they had forgotten their room keys and that the security guard had let them into the room. And they said, \"Isn't this room xxx?\" and we replied, \"No, this is room xxy.\" They quickly left our room and apologized. I believe it was an honest error on their part, but I don't understand why the security guard who let them in the room didn't check the guest names before letting them into our hotel room. Sunday morning I reported the incident to the front desk and asked the gentleman at the front desk to check that room service or phone calls weren't made since we were not in the room.

There were 4 adults and 2 young children in a 2 bedroom suite. As promised (via many phone calls to confirm) I booked, and received a \"renovated\" 2 bedroom suite in the Flatotel. As I understand, about half of the hotel's suites are renovated, and the other half are what I assume to be the original suites which, if you read all the reviews on this site, are allegedly terrible! Whew! Check in went very smoothly, although they expect FULL payment upon checking in. This was something that I found extremely odd and was a bit apprehensive about, but paid anyway. The initial impression of our suite was not very dramatic. HOWEVER, upon further exploration, it is a great unit. You have to remind yourself that you are in Manhattan. If you want a luxurious, large, flawless suite with a full kitchen--be prepared to pay thousands per night elsewhere. Our suite was a corner unit, facing southwest. The views were great, especially for the kids. The windows were extremely large and run along each wall. The coolest thing about this hotel, was that it was CLEARLY a condominium building that was converted to a hotel/suite hotel. Our suite still had a doorbell! (fun for our toddler). The suite had 1 and a half baths, which was fantastic. The bathrooms are in terrific condition and were very clean. The living room was a bit small, and the furniture was a bit uncomfortable. There was, however, a large flat screen TV on the wall as promised. The beds were great and clean, although it is true that they are modern platform beds which have a base that is bigger than the mattress, so lookout to save your ankles! One of the bedrooms had all glass walls, but, could be completely covered with heavy dark drapes to make the room very private. The kitchen was fully stocked, even with cooking utensils, and came in extremely handy! We ate dinner in our suite each night. I recommend using the Ernst Klein market about 1 block north on 6th ave for food. The rumors about the elevators are true. Sometimes you need to wait a bit for an elevator, but, as someone who lived in a highrise for years, if you pretend you're simply waiting for your elevator in an apartment building it's not bad at all. The hotel is in a FABULOUS location. Very close to Times Square, ten minute walk to Toys R Us and Build A Bear. 5-10 min walk to Central Park and enormous playground. The location and price for a suite was what drew me to the hotel. It's a Manhattan hotel that serves it's purpose with cost for a full suite, service, and location. Don't stay here if you expect or want your hotel to be a central focal point of your vacation (ex: Loews, Hilton Times Square). It provides a peaceful retreat from the city (as if you are returning to your own condo in NY) at the end of the day, and the staff is efficient and curteous but stays out of your way. I will end this lengthy (but I hope helpful review) by saying that the concierge, Gregory, is absolutely wonderful! He made our stay so terrific. Anything you need to know, want, etc, Gregory knows the answer, or knows where to get it.

From the time we arrived and repeatedly checked back, we were told that they \"would put a rush on our room\" ....some rush...the excuse they had is that the deluxe king rooms are few in number and that the people who are in the rooms already can pay to check out late. Well, it seems they paid to keep our room an extra night. Or (more likely) the rooms were double booked. When I complained, because it was our honeymoon, they offered to stick us in a smoking room. Having severe asthma, this wouldn't have made for a great scenerio. So we got a room that we didn't want, with a small bed and an dreadful view of the delapitated building next door. Also, we could hear everything in the room next to us...and I mean everything. The supposed trendiness or hipness of the hotel left as soon as you got on the evelators, which are very small . The hotel is generally very dark and the hallways are very narrow. The rooms are supposedly bigger than the average NY hotel, but the reservation system is so horrible the larger rooms don't make up for the stress of getting there.

I assume they were attempting a spa look and feel with the open concept showers, but they are a bit aged and entire room looks more like something out of the YMCA. There is no tub so the water goes everywhere which is dangerous. The staff are nothing but rude...and not just to us....we heard them tell one person who was complaining about their room \"This is New York, haven't you ever stayed in New York before.\" The next day they moved our bags in the afternoon without telling us to the room we reserved. Nice, but we were soured by then and the staff were still incredibly rude. They gave no explanation for this. It appears that everyone has to check out by early morning, they clean the rooms, then those who are already checked in get moved aroung to the rooms you had originally reserved, and then at 4pm the newly arrived guest fight over rooms.

Well with 3 kids we could not take that chance and of course want to be in same room or connecting, we were willing to spend $$$ but still no luck.

I had booked Doubletree in Times Square, thank goodness we switched, it was a mob scene in that area.The room was huge!!! With 3 boys, we needed the space to spread out, even tho we were not there alot since we did all of the tourist attractions.First we arrived on Saturday and the place was dead...got into room and ac didnt work, called down to front desk, within 5 minutes someone came up and adjusted..then it was fine for that night. Following 2 nights air didnt seem as cool but hard to tell since weather was 100 degrees out. Yes furniture and curtains etc were outdated, we knew that in advance, but the place was clean...altho no carpet, it had been torn up and had \"parquet\" floors which made funny sound when walking on it, but it was clean and better for middle son with allergies Our queen size bed was not very comfortable as we are used to staying at a strwood hotel that uses veryyy comfy down featherbeds and pillows..Requested more towels and pillows...all no problem...didnt use room service or restaurant so can not say how that was, altho restaurant never was busy. Area was ok..nothing much around but easy to walk places...On the weekend the bellhops or doorpeople didnt really say much to us, place seems to cater to mon-fri travelers since we were greeted and asked how our stay was on mon and tues. But that kind of thing was really not too important to us...our 2 younger boys kept going into restaurant to grab a couple candies, so one nice lady there got a cup FULL for them to take...that was a very nice touch for the kids. other than that I dont think anyone ever spoke to them, definitely caters more towards business or foreign travelers from what I could see. We did go up to workout \"space\"...nice view but way too hot in there, at least during that heatwave. All in all it was a good experience, could not get a bigger space in NYC!

The location is the absolute best part of the Flatotel. Situated between Times Square and Rockefeller, you can't find a better spot. Great bars and restaraunts on the same street. This hotel is very modern, very cold and not quite the 'homey' feel. The reservation clerks were helpful but borderline rude at the same time. Like our party was 'putting them out' to ask a question or suggestion. I did not feel like an appreciated customer at any time. After leaving the Four Seasons the night before, man, what a difference their staff makes. We had four rooms at the Flatotel. Our room was a two bedroom suite with a balcony. Probably the best part of this trip. The balcony, only one of about 3 in the hotel, was a great touch. The beds in each room were stone hard, linens were comfy. Our living area had two of the most uncomfortable chairs, no sofa. For two families, this was painfully inconvenient. The bathrooms were nice and plenty of closet space. The other room was a one BR suite and had much more sofas in a huge great room and accommadted two adults and three kids nicely. The third room we had was in the unrenovated part and was so bad, they had to switch rooms to be more like the fourth room, a deluxe BR which accomodated one adult and two kids. Point is, renovated rooms are the only way to go. I had read on here about the elevators being slow, we didn't experience any too terribly long waits for these. The bar is great, bartenders are pretty friendly and knowlegable, fun to have some drinks before dinner. We all decided that if we go back to NYC, we would definitely consider staying at the flatotel again.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA.", "Title": "\u201cVery Cozy!\u201d", "Author": "GordonPrincess", "ReviewID": "UR4254379", "Content": "I loved this hotel- we checked in hours early and were given a room. We asked to check out later and did so without penalty. The staff were all very nice and it was blocks from Times Square. We had a large room with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We used the frigde because it was so hot! There was a free paper outside out door some days which was nice and the front desk was quite accomodating for movie theatre request locations etc. I woul dstay there again- also, we took the limo liner from Boston and it dropped us off a street over and we were able to walk to the hotel. The fitness room is small but enough for a couple people to get a workout in with a great view. The only strange thing was in the shower: it was a half plate of glass 9see pic) you could not only see through completely, but water sprayed out of when you took a shower.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver Canada", "Title": "\u201cvery classy hotel\u201d", "Author": "fltcrew", "ReviewID": "UR4005672", "Content": "I stayed at the Flatotel with 2 other ladies ( one room) Oct 2-6 2005. From the moment we arrived, we knew this was going to be a classy hotel. The lobby is quiet and tastefully decorated and the front desk staff were always welcoming, helpful and polite. The room was a remodelled double on the 24 floor. We had two full size very comfy beds with cozy duvets and pillows. The bathroom was very large, modern and immaculate. There was ample drawer and closet space for 3 ladies. Our room had all the amenities required such as a kettle with coffee and tea, microwave, fridge, hairdryer, and safe. The location on 52 St between 6th and 7th avenues was wonderfully central and within walking distance of many major attractions. It was far enough away from Times Square that you felt away from all the hubub. There is a Starbucks across the street which was great to get a good coffee in the morning. If you want to take in a great view of the city, you can take the elevator to the 46th floor health club and gaze away . There are large windows on three sides. This hotel was originally an apartment block turned into a hotel thus the name:\"flat\"otel. I booked it through skyauction and got it for $US 220 per night incl all taxes. You pay a premium in New York Sep-Dec so you could get it cheaper in the summer or after Christmas. A room with a king bed is a bit cheaper as well. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world as I travel for a living. This was extremely comfortable, very classy and uncrowded. Not a touristy hotel at all. I'd go back to skyauction to book again as it could cost as much as $350/night in high season to book directly with the hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cgood stay, but....\u201d", "Author": "RY18", "ReviewID": "UR3984839", "Content": "We visit NYC 4-6 times a year, and generally stay at different hotels depending on what our plans are, and price. The Flatotel is well located for most mid-town activities, and my wife and I enjoyed our stay, for the most part. We were on the 18th floor across from the elevators, and were pleased with how quiet our room was. Other reviewers have mentioned noise, but it wasn't a problem for us, even though there was plenty of activity going on on 52nd Street. The room was nicely sized and comfortable. There was plenty of drawer space, something not always the case in many hotels. The bathroom could have had more hooks, particularly near the shower, but was quite large and well fixtured. Our room contained a microwave oven, a fridge that we could have used, and a nice desk area. We missed not having a coffee brewer in the room, although a hot water heater and single serve coffee bags were provided. Fresh coffee is available in the downstairs lobby. Why does a 40+ floor hotel only have two elevators available for guests? A few times we had to wait over five minutes for one to arrive, and they were packed on more than one occasion. We were fortunate to have very fine weather during our stay, but I can certainly understand how not having air conditioning in the hallways, bathroom and elevators would be unacceptable during the hot and humid season.", "Date": "October 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Flatotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93440-Reviews-Flatotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$214 - $599*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">135 West 52nd Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514361", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f5/07/f507aa5a4e2223d4cfbb04213b9452176large.jpg"}}
