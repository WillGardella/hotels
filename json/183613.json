After one night at Hotel Park Avenue, several red, itchy bumps began to appear on my skin, getting more and more swollen throughout the day. I had never had bed bugs before, and my partner showed no reaction, so it took us a whole day to realize what was going on... Once we realized the problem, however, we felt like idiots for not having caught the signs sooner. The place reeked of some sort of strong cleaning agent (pesticides, perhaps?), and the mattress in our room already had a plastic bug-proof cover over it (we opened it up and found several dead bed bugs inside). The receptionist and room cleaners acted totally shocked and surprised when I told them about the problem, but there is no way they didn't know about this before. We got our money back, but this was little compensation for the amount of time and funds we had to put into having all of our things cleaned and/or replaced. We even had to stay in Montreal for a few extra days to ensure that we had cleaned everything properly. It did not appear the the hotel was doing much to solve this problem.

What happened is we received a downgrade to one full sized bed and a cot, they knocked $5 off the price. However, if we had booked the same room in advance, it would have been $20 cheaper. We were a little irked, but we were still willing to give the hotel a go. So, we get up to the room, which is fairly dirty but not any real horror, drop our stuff there and go out for the night. It's a bit of a walk to downtown Montreal, but it wasn't that bad. Come that night, me and my friend took off our clothes to put on pajamas and left our clothes in the bathroom. When we woke up the next morning, all our clothes were soaked. We don't know if the toilet ran or there was a leak or what, but it was disgusting.

From the moment I entered the hotel room, I knew my stay was not going to be easy. Upon first inspection, I noticed that the carpet was not vacuumed and the futon was covered in crumbs. Further inspection revealed a lampshade with blood on it, hair on the bedsheets, and a ceiling fan that wobbled so much that leaving it on would be a safety hazard. In the bathroom there wasn't any soap, and the toilet paper roll was almost empty. Also, when the shower was turned on, it would spray all over the bathroom. One of my roommates asked the front desk for more sheets, but they didn't have any. The only sheet she had to sleep on had a huge mysterious black stain on it. Also, there is no parking at this hotel, which is a huge hassle if you are unfamiliar with the city (and don't understand very much French). Needless to say, stay somewhere else.

Unfortunately I booked the university residences too late but was offered this hotel by \"La Maison Internationale de Montreal\" who deal in accommodation mainly for students. Anyway, to cut to the chase... I found this hotel ideal - especially considering that I only paid about $30 CAD a night! The rooms were a decent size complete with a small refigerator and dish-washing type sink with overhead cupboards, a Combi Cable TV/Radio (bizarre I know!), a lounge type chair, a desk chair and desk and Air Conditioning. The bathroom was basic but clean, towels and face cloths were provided and changed every day. Downstairs on the same floor as reception there is a small but useful kitchen (no pans provided although there were cooking implements), ice machine and outdoor deck. Because of my long stay and because I booked through LAMIMO I had the use of the clothes washing facilities in the basement free of charge, all I had to do was bring my own powder and softner - Laundry could only be done in the evenings though because housekeeping used them during the day for the hotel linen. My only real problem was with the (obviously) antique A/C system - mine leaked all over the floor for some reason despite the temperature being set above the \"danger\" level for the AC system. I was then moved to another room.... with another AC that proceeded to do the same but not too bad thankfully! Right next to the hotel there is a Dairy Queen and McDonalds, over the road there is a service station with chips and the like but also an A&W. 5 minutes down Mont-Royal one will find a Provigo supermarch\u00c3\u00a9, various caf\u00c3\u00a9s, an SAQ (Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 des Alcools de Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec, the chain of government owned liquor stores) 15 minutes away one will find the Mont-Royal Metro, however frequent buses for downtown leave from right outside the hotel.
