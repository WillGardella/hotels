Our room was on the 12th floor and had a great view of Union Square. The room was on the larger side with plenty of room for two suitcases. The bathroom is also quite large and has recently been updated. The room was clean, however, I did find a hair on one pillow. The location is perfect for the shopping and dining options in Union Square. The doorman/bellman (the morning shift) was the best employee we encountered at this hotel. He was conversational without being annoying and got everyone on their way quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, that's the end of the good points about this hotel. The front office staff were rude on our checkout. We asked for some further information about their conference facilities and we instructed to look it up ourselves online. What, you can't give the slightest bit of information verbally? The room service was not up to scratch. The first night they forgot the OJ (but still charged me) and the second night they forgot the cheese on the burger! The wifi (that you have to pay for) is very slow. I could only pick up two bars in my room and it would constantly drop out. Not very good for a business hotel. Lastly, they charged my credit card without my authorization a day before I checked out. I wanted to discuss the Internet charges considering I couldn't get a signal half the time and shouldn't have to pay but I didn't get the chance since they already charged me.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located very centrally. Shopping / Dining / Transit ...everything very close. We had great views from our room on the 30th floor. Only some rooms will have the view of the Golden gate bridge (we did not). However, many rooms on the higher floors will definitely have amazing views! We ate breakfast at Grandviews restaurant every day of our stay. We totally enjoyed the banana pancakes!! More than the pancakes...was the view from the restaurant....literally 360 degree view of the entire area!! We got great pictures!! On our departure day, we had a small misunderstanding about breakfast. But, the front desk staff went above and beyond and made sure we got our breakfast (since we had an early flight). The restaurant manager was already organized with what we wanted to eat. There was just a little miscommunication. We were happy it was sorted out quickly. We noticed a lot of families with kids (all ages) staying in this hotel. Also, we had one night where there was a noise problem from the next door room. This was solved by hotel security within ten minutes after calling the front desk. OVerall ..highly recommend this hotel if it is in your budget! I suggest getting the breakfast package.

Stay 2 nights and get one free with daily breakfast for two. It's a deal that can't be beat and i know! (i booked on expedia for a different property only to cancel for the Hyatt through Hotel Planner only to cancel AGAIN for a better deal direct through the Hyatt website) Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. My boyfriend and I arrived at OAK and took the BART to the Powell Street station. The walk to the Grand Hyatt was a bit confusing for a SF first-timer due to the construction on the roads & Powell St station. Once we arrived, check-in was a breeze. The construction in the lobby area was unnoticeable. We were able to check-in early at around 2pm and were given a room on the 14th floor. The view wasn't great..but a room is a room and we were only there to sleep. Room Pros: - decor is lovely - modern, bright spacious room - sun blocking blinds - hdmi capabilities on the TV - reading lights that were adjustable on both sides of the beds in addition to the normal bedside table lamps - real fridge (instead of the mini bar ones that keep things cool but not cold) for our leftovers & drinks - magnifying mirror (i packed my own but this one was great!) i was tempted to ask where i could get one for home! - massive sink (i mean 3x the size of a standard bathroom) - glass table top in the bathroom (perfect for placing your hot hair tools without wrecking the counters) -4+ elevators (the wait was never long) Room Cons: - lack of drawer space in the closet (3 tiny tiny drawers) - not enough places to put your towels, there were a couple of hooks for your bath towels but no where to put your face/hand towels Breakfast was held daily in their restaurant on the 36th floor. The view is to die for! Picturesque view of Coit Tower and the city. Try to go for breakfast early to guarantee one of the window views! I really enjoyed the options for breakfast: Full Breakfast Buffet or order off the menu (Most hotels only offer a breakfast buffet). The buffet had a wide variety of options and you were also able to order hot pancakes or waffles if you wanted them. Service was professional and friendly. One thing i have to comment on is that there were always staff readily available to assist you. You never had to look around for help. And thank you to the Concierge that stayed open a little longer than normal to arrange our shuttle service to the airport. The hotel also offers complimentary boarding pass print outs through the computers in the front desk area. Thanks for the wonderful stay!

Overall the hotel was great. The staff were friendly and attentive, the rooms were good and the beds comfortable. There were a number of things that could have been done better, which I have described below but, if you don't have time to read the rest, our overall summary is that this is a good hotel in a great location. Having booked online a month in advance, with a confirmed reservation for rooms on the 20th floor or above, we didn't get off to a very good start on arrival. We were told that the only interconnecting rooms were on the 4th floor. In the rooms we found ourselves staring at the windows of the building opposite and decided to complain. The staff then 'discovered' they had interconnecting rooms on the 19th floor, not quite what we had booked, but a great view of Union Square. There are extensive overnight roadworks going on in Union Square at present, and the thin glazing on the windows allowed this work, and the traffic noise, to become quite intrusive, although we soon adjusted. The rooms are newly refurbished, and although the furniture and decorations are not lavish, they are smart, neat and largely functional. Little things could be improved, like the fact that the room is provided with an ice bucket, ice tongs, a bottle opener, but no glasses! The kids were upset that their tastes were not catered for in the choice of TV channels delievered free to the room but again, these are minor complaints. If you have a car, use the assisted parking at the garage across the street to save yourself valet charges. The restaurant on the 36th floor has fantastic views, the food is very good, and the waiting staff are friendly and helpful. We had a small problem with an undercooked dish, but were given a complimentary desert, which was very generous. We would stay at this hotel again and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cI left my heart in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "SanDiegoTravelingman", "ReviewID": "UR128892880", "Content": "If you want to experience everything that this city has to offer, there is no better hotel to stay at.

My only complaint is same as a couple others - the lobby is currently under construction and it is NOISY! I was only on the 7th floor - may get better as you go up. But the construction started early and went on pretty late. Also, I am guessing due to construction there weren't any real quiet places to meet and talk with co-workers which would have been nice.

The plus points: convenient location off Union Square, rooms had nice decor, beds very comfortable, top floor restaurant has fabulous views and food was fine. The negatives: lobby is dull and front desk check-in experience was disappointing - served by a gentleman (rather unfriendly)... I asked if we could have a higher floor with a view if possible - he replied yes, nice room and good view.

Woken at 4am each morning to some form of lorries unloading which we assumed took place underneath the industrial roof we could see below us - this only lasted about 30 mins each morning. Whilst in-room cleaning was fine with friendly, pleasant maids, glasses/trays were left outside various rooms on the 12th floor and we were astonished to see a couple of particular trays left for 3 days whilst we stayed which had food on! Very poor for this type of establishment. Grand view restaurant where we had the breakfast buffet each morning had beautiful views - staff were generally very pleasant and accommodating. Food was generally of a good standard, albeit, the hot buffet items did tend to be on the \"lukewarm\" side, so by the time back to your table, items often cold.

That may aggravate some people but I check that kind of stuff all the time so I love it that you don't get penalized for making changes. Anyway, we went from $229 a night, down to $170 a night, then to a special where it was $209 a night but if you stayed 3 nights you got the third night free, plus breakfast for 2 each morning. So in the end we felt like we got a great deal. The hotel is right at Union Square, easy walk to trolley and BART. Nice location for shopping and dining. The rooms are accurately represented in posted photos. Not super huge but very chic and inviting. The bed was very comfy, there was a small fridge, coffee maker, bathroom well appointed and modern. No complaints at all. Maid service was very prompt in the mornings, we ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant every morning and it was wonderful. Servers and everyone we encountered were very friendly and helpful. In general San Francisco is a VERY NOISY place and I was woke up several times by trolley bells ringing but I didn't feel that was something the hotel could control.

The location is great. One block off of Union Square, and a 10 minute walk from the Moscone center. The rooms are spacious and modern, with beautiful views. Bedding was very comfortable. Good bathrooms. Tub with shower had decent water pressure. I had a room on the 20th floor. Room was right off of the corridor from the elevators, and I never heard a peep from the hallway. Occasionally heard the people in the adjacent room, but nothing out of the ordinary. Fitness center on 35th floor was spacious, with ellipticals, treadmills, stationary bikes, freeweights, plenty of machines, and a separate space for floorwork.

HDMI and audio ports for easy connection of laptops or ipods to the tv. Alarm clock with ipod and 3.5 mm connectors. I paid for the premium internet service for the week. Had both wifi and ethernet connections in room, and a passcode to connect a mobile device. Speeds were good for browsing and email, but a bit slow for VPN connections. The reason I will be coming back to this hotel is because of the personal service. Reception staff was friendly and efficient. I checked in early (~1:30 pm, before the check-in time) on a Saturday afternoon, along with about 10 other people, and the staff moved us through. The bell staff has a great presence, always available to answer questions. The crown jewel of this place is the doorman, Michael. It rained the entire week that I was there, so he was the busiest man in San Francisco. Everyone who would normally be walking to the Moscone center was trying to catch a taxi, and he and his staff took care of each and every one of us, while also taking exquisite care of arriving guests, and people checking out.

Still had a strange \"refurbed rather than new\" feel to it, maybe that's because it's such an eyesore from the outside which is a trait it shares with most Downtown Hotels in San Francisco, unfortunately. I personally didn't like the design of the room at all but that's a matter of taste. They went for a strange 70ies vintage style decor with lots of orange and stuff like it which reminds me of my parents' taste when I was a very young kid. Not my thing really and makes you wonder how people will feel about this in 5 or 10 years time... Worst grief for me was the staff, the check in area hasn't been renovated yet so you are greeted in one of those dimly lit, dark wooded lobbies from the 60ies. Right went I arrived, there were about 5 huge Latin families with their badly behaved screaming kids all over which was a nightmare but unfortunately, my check in lady also was not very friendly, disengaged and rather quick to get you out and done with. Room itself, as said, was quite nice depending on whether you like 70ies vintage or not. They had those strange snake-like reading lamps sticking out of the wall besides the bed which you used to have in old business class airplane seats-I hate those things, feels like some creepy alien coming out of your bed head but maybe that's meant to be part f the vintage style, who knows. Very vintage but absolutely not acceptable were the shower curtains. Shower curtains in a freshly renovated hotel- need I say more? Cummon, Hyatt, you can do better- they are yuck! Speaking about vintage... Obviously their wifi has also not made it to 2012 yet. The website claims high-speed Wifi and when you log in to accept the 10 Dollar charge a day (!!!), they tell you some blurb about extra bandwidth and so on. But the reality is: It is s-l-o-w. So slow that it drops out all the time and you need ten minutes alone to log onto your emails. I was close to throwing my IPad against the wall in anger, so bad and frustrating it was! Now, after all that, luckily my lady at check out made up for a lot of the negatives: Very unlike the check in lady, she wad friendly, helpful and pleasant. Took the Wifi charges off my bill instantly and was very apologetic. Apparently, people complain about this all the time and the hotel is investigating their options. We had a long chat about it and she told me that the Wifi antennas are located in the elevator shafts only (which explains why you get the best reception on the elevators) which she already knew was not ideal. Without her, the experience would have been really bad (for example, during my entire two-day stay, not a sinlge time one of the people at the door or any other staff would great me or, more even, open the door or something like they do at many other properties of this class)- like this, I would say it was mediocre.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chino, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Erik S", "ReviewID": "UR126419705", "Content": "My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt for our 5th anniversary.

The room also has individual reading lamps with adjustable goosenecks. The furniture is modern and sleek --with an electronic window shade that you can operate from your bedside. Modern and clean and very comfortable bed. We went on a AAA package which included breakfast. The wait staff was harried and the food was okay...you can dine on better fare elsewhere. But really, what you're there for is the gorgeous view. And on a day like we had, it re-emphasized why San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It can get expensive so always be on the look-out for specials or packages. If you want to try something touristy but different, go to Mason and O'Farrell and try the GoCar tours. Guided by a GPS you ride in a 2-person car, powered by an engine with controls akin to a motorcycle. if you follow the tour route, especially the one that takes you beneath the Golden Gate bridge, you're treated to wonderful sites with an accompanying narrative. You can't go over 30 miles per hour and you have to crank up the volume to hear the tour over the sound of the motor -- but it is fun nonetheless.

According to other reviewers, there are other, cheaper alternatives in the Union Square area. - There is no sundries shop at this property. Go out the main entrance, left turn, left turn, then a half a block straight ahead to the CVS. Say hi to the Drake hotel as you pass by. - Apparently the Hyatt reservations system has a problem when a customer reserves two rooms, then changes the name of the second room to a second party with a second credit card. The 2nd room retains the mailng address of the first customer. It gets even more complexicated when the 2nd customer has a Hyatt Gold Passport number. When the Hyatt Passport number is assigned, then, the orignial reservation reverts to the address of the Gold Passport holder. (Kind of like a Lucy episode, isn't it?) - The room was an outstanding contemporary design, very Euro. Of all of the hotels I've stayed at that have used energy saving lighting, this one was the brightest by far, probably because they use a combination of high-output and LED lights. The Baby Boomers and Generation X thank you. - I struggled with operation of the electric shades, mostly because there were no instructions; I almost ripped them off the top of the mount thinking they were roller shades. Country comes to town, I guess - The bathroom was well-lit, appointed with nice towels and tolietries. The sink was PERFECT for bathing a baby; the other guy I was traveling with found it so funny he e-mailed a pic back to his wife! The unecessairly large baby bath made for a cluttered sink area--no room to put my own shaving kit down over the tolietries and glasses. - The shower was good until the adjustable head came apart in my hand. Engineering was quickly dispatched, but the man making the repair struggled with the spring loaded thing-a-ma-bob that held tension on the main pole. I had to go to the hotel bar to go to the bathroom. Good call. . . - The bar was superb. Generous pour. SUPER view of SF and the Bay. Got to see the fog roll in over a bourbon. - Hotel is in the middle of the Union Square scene--you can't beat it's location or the pick of restaurants within a block--get out of the hotel and find yourself a great place to eat--it isn't hard. - The bed was excellent--not a lick of noise, and the blackout shade I almost trashed worked great. -If you plan a trip to the San Francisco area and want to be in the middle of the action, this property should be on your short list--especially if you're traveling with a significant other and no little ones--looks like it would make a nice getaway hotel.

I selected the Grand Hyatt as our Hotel after some extensive research. I phoned the Hotel and was offered a suitable booking with a package which offered \u201ctwo-breakfasts-for-the-price-of-one\u201d. Total cost \u2026 a not unreasonable $1,700. When the email confirmation arrived there was only one breakfast shown. I then exchanged about five emails with the Hotel to try to have them honour their original offer. They responded each time in a most curmudgeonly way - offering alternatives that were all less attractive than the original offer. After a month of emails I decided they were simply not going to give this particular potential customer a taste of their \u201cexpect nothing less than spectacular\u201d slogan. I finally cancelled the booking and booked an alternative hotel in San Francisco. The purpose of this review is to give people a flavour of the Hyatt Hotel policy towards guests. I don\u2019t know if the original offer was a mistake or not. No one in Hyatt referred to it in any of the exchanges. However, once made, the Hilton Staff should have set about making a potential customer happy. For the marginal cost of a breakfast they lost at least $1700 worth of business and released a dissatisfied customer into the travel world, without even having stayed at their Hotel.

CHECK-IN: Smooth, uncomplicated and recognized as rewards program members. Only shortfall, would have beneficial for agent to ask about whether I was parking, as I called ahead and apparently given incorrect parking information. F&B: Ah...Only had a chance to enjoy breakfast buffet, but what a setting. Gorgeous views of the bay, fair value for upscale hotels and overall a really nice assortment of offerings. Not sure if there were other dining options at the hotel besides main restaurant, but plenty to choose from outside the front doors. AMENITIES: Gym was modern and set atop one of the higher floors, so once again fantastic views. I was pretty much alone, but could see it getting pretty packed at peak period. Great equipment though. LOCATION: Excellent, heart of the city on the corner of Union Square...convenient access to the Trolley, BART, public bus, and city parking. Upscale and most popular stores/shops and Chinatown are are stone's throw. Couldn't be better. ACCOMMODATIONS: Recently Renovated and gorgeous. Warm brown/orange tones, great linens and mattress. Flawless technology and electrically controlled shades. Bath was clean and super modern; nice toiletries...and the first vessel sink I actually liked...large enough to bathe a baby in. One caveat, water pressure in the shower was a little soft, so room for improvement there. Nice clean/fresh scent. SHORTFALLS: Water Pressure in the shower. Small lobby that is under renovation and can get annoyingly congested at peak check-in/check/out times. Rates encroach into luxury territory. RECOMMENDATION: One of the best upscale hotels in down San Francisco. Weekend rates were about $400 that weekend, so not cheap and at the price, you were really paying a premium, but not there was a NFL playoff game in town that weekend. Would love to stay here again, but ask for either Union Square or Bay View (Premium Rate). Also if parking, make sure to pull up to valet first and if you want to self park, they will provide you directions and a ticket.

The hotel is also a block away from the Canal streetcar, which is worth the ride if you've never done it before. The stay itself was very pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and modern, the staff are friendly, and the hotel is cleaner than most in its category. The room is a bit smaller than average, but there was plenty of storage and closet space to make up for it. One recommendation: If you're facing east or west, you will want to put the sunscreen down either in the am or pm, depending on when you get sun. I found that during the afternoon (we were facing west) the sun really heated up the room. Overall, I would definitely return to the hotel.

I did use the in-room coffee machine as I didn't have time to run to Starbucks in the morning, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the coffee. The hotel does not provide any complimentary bottles of water, which I found unusual for such a class of hotel such as this one.

I may suggest to request the highest floor rooms possible to have a quiet night of sleep. PLEASE NOTE : The staff at the Grand Hyatt are all very warm, friendly, and prompt.

There is a dock/ recharger for ipods built into the clock radio. The minibar was thankfully empty, which meant you could use it without being charged for moving anything. There is a Walgreens nearby for loading up on drinks and snacks inexpensively. That Walgreens even stocks salads and fresh fruit. The bathroom was modern and there was a dressing table area, which was nice. The only thing was that there were eye pencil shavings from the previous guest left underneath it, on the floor, which remained there for my multi day stay, so one is left to wonder how thorough the cleaning is. There were also dried makeup smudges on the makeup mirror on the dressing table which was also not cleaned during my stay. The check-in was fast and courteous; however, I realized afterwards that the rate was different than what I had confirmed online. When I went down to ask why, I was told that I had received some of the paid-for upgrades they now offer online. Okay the extra few $ for a higher floor room; however, I was also charged a hefty upgrade fee for a Club Room, which I didn't receive. I also didn't receive access to the Club Lounge or notification from the check-in person that I had been upgraded. After about 15 minutes, the front desk attendant agreed to remove the upgrade fee for the Club Room. If I hadn't been alert, I would not only have been charged, but also never received either the Club Room or Lounge access. The concierge was very polite and responsive to a recommendation for a good sushi restaurant. When I went there, though, I thought that the sushi was just mediocre. I will trust Tripadvisor and Zagat reviews next time. The location is terrific for pedestrians and a nightmare for cars. It is next to Union Square and shopping and restaurants. It is close enough that you can make multiple trips to the big department stores and back to the hotel to drop off purchases.

Right next to plenty of shopping, Chinatown or a Cable car or Street Car. I did read some reviews about street noise but i guess that would be common in a \"City\" type of atmosphere with tall buildings echoing sounds. I don't have any complaints about the hotel. The rooms were very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. I didn't realize there was a small fridge or coffee maker in the room until the day we checked out but oh well.

I had Hyatt points to spend, so I booked three nights for my family of 2 adults and 2 kids (8 and 10) in a Club room. I had thought (mistakenly) that the rooms with two beds were king/king - so on arrival I was very surprised to find that the rooms were actually double/double and in fact - tiny. We had an adjoining King room for other family members and the King, same size as the double, really seemed a lot roomier. To the hotel's credit my husband spoke with a member of staff who showed him a number of different rooms and allocated us a Bay view room for our 2nd and 3rd nights, with a complementary bottle of wine for the inconvenience, but the room was still the same small size. Bathrooms are also small but well fitted, big sink, modern fittings - but the shower is over the bath, even on the Club rooms. The hotel has no real lobby to speak of but the decor around the hotel is updated, modern and very clean. The Club dining room has a fabulous view of San Francisco and the Bay - and the staff in the evening were incredibly polite and helpful. Wine is self-service on an 'honor' system for $3 per glass and staff ordered a very reasonable bottle of bubbly for us on the first night. The food in the Club was ok, but compared to other Hyatt Clubs (or the Ritz Clubs) was only really average. Breakfast was mostly pastries and fruits and a different dried up egg dish each day. In the evening two appetizers were served with a block of cheese (that was not renewed). Soft drinks and coffee/teas were amply supplied. The location of the hotel is great, just a short walk from the BART station, a cable car stop and within a stone's throw of major shopping, restaurants and Union Square. All-in-all great staff, great view - still tiny room!", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel-Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "travelsavant", "ReviewID": "UR120757762", "Content": "Stayed here late Oct 2011, for sister's weekend birthday celebration.

The rooms are very comfortable, with modern decor and lots of great practical elements like a big desk, lots of easy to reach outlets and internet connections (and not just at the desk, but next to the bed as well), and a very nice bathroom with one of the best lit mirrors I've seen (great for makeup application). The view from my room was great- mostly city, with peeks of the bay behind the buildings. I would highly recommend you try to get a bay-view room on as high a floor as possible for the best view. The only issue I ran into during my stay was the lack of sound insulation in my room. There was a connecting door with the adjacent room, which was closed the entire time, but which let a surprising amount of noise from the other room into mine (and vice versa I imagine). I could hear conversations from the other room clearly from mine, and I did feel a bit self conscious that everything that I was saying could be heard by my neighbor as well. It didn't bother me enough to switch rooms, but if you're a light sleeper or are bothered by this, I would request a room without a connecting door. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay.

We arrived on Wednesday at 1pm. Room was ready. We had our choice between 2 doubles or a king. Check-in was friendly and fast. Room was clean. Not huge, but certainly big enough for our needs. Small dresser in the closet and two drawers in the nightstand; that was all for storing clothes. A nice flat-screen TV. A small desk and chair. Plugs for all your electronic gadgets. We had a bathtub. No adjoining door. We were close to the elevators and never heard any noise. We were on the 21st floor and did hear some dumpsters in the early morning but noise doesn't bother us. The window shade came in handy because all of the buildings around Union Square give off quite a bit of light. The beds were very comfy---a bit on the soft side, but that's what we like. We did not use the restaurant or room service. We did have some drinks in the lounge. Fabulous view, prices what I came to expect in San Fran. Friendly staff. Housekeeping did an excellent job. We were out of the room by 9 each morning and never saw them---they came after we left. All staff was friendly and had a smile. The concierge services were outstanding. They helped with anything, always quick with an answer or suggestion. Never made us feel like we were being a bother, and they had excellent information. The lobby is small, but that doesn't matter to us. LOCATION is key for this hotel. Right at Union Square, so all of the shopping and hustle and bustle. Straight, easy walk to/from the BART station so we paid the $8.10 each way for the airport train. Also straight, easy walk to catch the F streetcar to get to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, etc. I suggest getting a 3-day pass (or 7 if you're there that long). You just flash it to the driver and can ride any bus, cable car, or streetcar. Very handy. I also suggest doing some free San Fran city guide tours. Google them. We did one of China Town (close to hotel) and it was very interesting and well worth the time. I felt safe around the hotel, but there are a ton of homeless people and con artists. Also some street musicians. You can choose to ignore them or you can give them some change. No one got up in our face. We walked to the BART station at 5:45am to catch a train to the airport on Monday, and encountered no issues whatsoever. If you are going to a 49ers game, it is SUPER EASY and the concierge can tell you which bus to catch (1.5 blocks from the hotel). Starbucks is across the street from the entrance. Another around the corner, so we used the free itnernet there. (the hotel charges TOO MUCH) A liquor store close by, and also a Walgreens, so easy to grab some refreshments for the mini fridge in the room. We did not check out the exercise room. We did not have a car to park.

I had stayed here years ago and must say that the renovations are amazing. The hotel interior is stunning. If you are into the ultra modern style - this is the place for you. Our room was on the 32nd floor club level and was gorgeous. It was not huge, but we had laminate floors and a view of the bay. The bathroom lacked a tub which I always wish for, but I think space is limited in these tower like hotel structures in the city. The bathroom was ultra modern with the raised sink and plentiful Portico toiletries. The bed was very comfortable. The flat panel TV and all amenities were perfect, including the electric sun shade on the ceiling to floor windows, and modern bed lamps attached to the bed posts. They delivered a DVD player for our son at no charge. The problems: Oh Boy! We picked a terrible time to go there since they had an employee strike every day that we were there. The employees were shouting (no screaming) on the street level - and we could hear it from our room on the 32nd floor up until 10pm!!!! It was terrible! They actually even ran into my husband on two separate occasions when we exited the hotel! They shouted at us not to check in on the 1st day too. They kept crossing the line that was drawn out for them on the pavement. It was very rude and unruly!The DVD Player took 2 hours to arrive at our room. The front desk lied to us - (as admitted by their own engineer who said he told them he could not find a DVD player and was looking for one). They told us he would be there in 10 minutes. Well try explaining the lies to a 4 year old 2 hours later as we are stuck waiting in the room! The room service was not the greatest either. This was obviously an exception since we have never had this kind of problem in the past - and they were seriously low on staff with everyone picketing outside. They should have just been honest about things. We also got our room 2 hours after we arrived with the manager's apologies. The club lounge was wonderful. It had private areas to get work done, have a private meeting or just relax. It is beautifully designed. The breakfasts were delicious, as well as the evening snacks and drinks. We also had dinner at the GrandViews Restaurant. They have a breathtaking view, and the service was wonderful. They were extremely accomodating in finding us a perfect table. We had invited another family to have dinner with us. The food was extremely disappointing though. I am not a picky eater, but the pasta was like simple boiled pasta with canned tomato stew on top, and the fish dishes were embarrassing! If you read my other reviews you will see that I can eat at the Four Seasons or McDonalds - again I am not picky, BUT the food we were served was truly pathetic. We were in a great location with good friends and good service, so I never complained. The location of the hotel is PERFECT! We were close to everything. The friendly concierge helped us with all reservations including the open top blue bus tour for 2 days which enabled us to see and tour everywhere..

The floor to ceiling windows gave us a wonderful view of the park where the marathon stuff was going on and the view of the city at night was breathtaking. Our room was cleaned every day promptly and nothing was stolen or \"misplaced\". The hotel restaurant has good food and a killer view of the bay. The service is excellent but as you suspect a little pricey, but most things are in San Francisco! Worth going up for cocktails at night their bar area is hopping with the best views of the city, and they make killer drinks!

It seemed that this was the only way to access the balcony. Since I just wanted to snap a photo I declined. I think the balconies are from the 80s or something and the railings appear to be kind of low so it seemed like a safety issue.

We went for the \"Regency Club\" rooms, so that I would have a place to go for breakfast in the mornings, and they had a cocktail setup there in the evenings. I recommend paying a little more for this - a nice lounge, great breakfast buffet, and appetizers/desserts in the evening. Our first night at the hotel, we had the misfortune of having a crying baby in the next room on the other side of a connecting door! Admittedly, not the hotel's fault, but at my request, they did move us to another room on the same floor the next day. It had a connecting door, too, but that was to a suite that was not in use, so it was blissfully quiet and looked down on Union Square and out at Mount Sutro with a sliver of a Bay view. My biggest complaint about this hotel is their elevators. Usually, buildings that are as many floors have two banks of elevators - one for the lower floors and one for the upper floors. The Hyatt has 8 or 10 elevators, and they all go to the 30-something floors. Also, don't bring a car and valet park. It was something we had to do with plans ahead of and behind our stay here, but we paid for it. The first night, we did valet, and after that, it was put at the self-park option. The staff at the hotel was unfailingly wonderful, from the front desk people, to the servers upstairs, the concierge, and the room attendants --- all top notch and all noticeably happy to be working there. Kudos to John, the concierge and the front desk person from Peru (was his name Roberto -no, but it was something like that-sorry for forgetting) for giving that little extra bit of service that made us feel special! The young man from Peru even took me back into my old room to search for a missing item, which I later found tucked into something I had packed.

The breakfast buffet is $22.50, but if you don't feel like splurging there is a Starbucks across the street, a bagel store down the block and Lori's Diner a few blocks away. The gym is clean but small so get there early if you want to secure a treadmill or elliptical. There are a few free weights and weight machines as well. The hotel is in a perfect location. It is within walking distance to a major shopping area, and the trolley. The staff at the front desk was so helpful. They printed walking directions for us to a Chinese restaurant, Fang, which wasn't so great. Also, Santorini, which is within walking distance wasn't good at all either. For a fun tour of the city check out Mr.Toad's Tours. A boat ride to Alcatraz can also be combined with the tour. Don't miss Ghiradelli Square or Fisherman's Wharf. While at the Square have lunch at McCormick & Kulleto's. The restaurant is in a great location and although a bit pricey, very good. At Fisherman's Wharf you can dine at In n' Out Burger, Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump Shrimp and many other options. Also, make sure you make the drive to Muir Woods. Absolutely breathtaking.

We loved our stay and were really looking forward to the same kind of experience in San Francisco. First impressions were good, the hotel is in a brilliant location and the staff were wonderful. The room was as expected for a 4* hotel; really comfy beds, flat screen TV and a great view. However, after getting unpacked a few things became clear... Firstly, the owner of this particular hotel is clearly intent on squeezing every last cent out of his guests. During our trip we had stayed in much cheaper hotels and motels, and had saved the best for last, or so we thought. We had enjoyed free Internet access and a huge variety of TV channels on our road trip, so imagine our disappointment when we learned that we would be charged $10 per day for Wifi. This was a joke, and how any right-minded person can think it's acceptable to charge for something that is nowadays a basic necessity is quite beyond me. We had to go across the road to Starbucks to use their free Wifi, and it's fair to say that their coffee was a lot cheaper than our hotel room. My girls and I like to stay in our room at night and watch TV, but once again we were hugely disappointed to discover that there were only a very small number of free TV channels available. This is penny-pinching at its very worst, and is definitely not what I would expect from such an esteemed chain of hotels. The safe in the room was not functioning, and the famed American power shower was a feeble dribble. The room had been recently renovated and I have no idea why a room on the 18th floor cannot get decent water pressure, especially when every fitting is brand new. They did send up an engineer to look at the shower, but even after he'd tinkered the shower was still feeble. I made my disappointment known to the hotel management and the lady in charge of guest services was a delight. She was most apologetic but it was clear that the owner of this particular Hyatt does not think it necessary to offer guests the same standard of amenities that other hotels in the chain enjoy. In conclusion, I would like to commend the hotel's staff as they were faultless, but would also like to voice my sadness that what should have been a memorable stay in a luxury hotel was spoiled by the miserly attitude of the owners. This stay has put me off staying at a Hyatt hotel in future, which is really sad.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - Great hotel\u201d", "Author": "lasgr", "ReviewID": "UR117025845", "Content": "Beds were great..... so comfortable.

The stay at the Grand Hyatt was part of a pacy business trip covering a lot of the west coast of the US, and we had only a single night's stay booked there. We expected to be arriving there late in the day from LA, staying overnight and then moving on to Seattle on the following night. Given the activity during this trip a good night's sleep was essential so we didn't scrimp on hotel costs. We arrived at the Hyatt shortly before 11pm and were told that the hotel had no rooms left. We pointed out that we had booked - and had confirmations for - three rooms. The staff apologised for \"a mix up\" when it was very clear that they had decided we were going to be no-shows and thus sold our rooms on again. As you can imagine this was far from ideal given the time of night and the need for us to be away again the following day. After a fair amount of heated discussion we were found three rooms, all much less than we'd paid for, and all with sofa beds rather than actual beds. We were in no real position to turn these down and while the Hyatt promised to refund our credit cards with the difference in price, the fact is that this is a pretty shoddy business practise all round.

My co-worker and I had just arrived and was trying to pay our taxi driver, get our stuff out of the car and figure out how much time we had before our first meeting. I assume that the bellman was trying to be helpful and set expectations but he didn't allow us to get out of the cab good before he began bombarding us with the drawbacks of the taxi situation in San Francisco. We were guests of the hotel when a pretty major union was picketing. Though I support the picketers, I do have to commend the hotel lobby and bellman staff for how they tried to make the hotel guests feel safe, secure and avoid the picket as much as possible. On the day of the picket, they were all organized, in large numbers and escorted guests from the curb to the elevators.

When we arrived, we were able to quickly check in. (favorite part of the front desk was the salt water taffy mints that i reguarly helped myself to!!!!) We had a lovely freshly rennovated king sized room on the 16th floor. Amazing bed! The only thing I didnt like in the hotel room was the smell of the hand soap, shampoo, and conditioner, but i had some of my own, so if you are particular, bring your own supplies! The concerge staff was 100% amazing in helping us make our plans.... one was nicer than the next in helping us with whatever questions we had. The other great thing about this hotel is the location..... steps away from wonerful shopping stores, the MUNI (bus and underground) and cable cars. A few blocks away and you stumble into Chinatown. i felt very safe here in the Union Square area...... can't say that about other \"districts\" or neighborhoods we visited. There was nothing lavish about this hotel, but it just meet all of my needs of being in a great loaction, being super clean, and having insanely nice people helping me. But beware, dont bother to ask for an upgrade if you book your stay through any site other than their own. My husband emailed someone before we left (trying to make our trip a little more special) and was, in my opinion, rather rudely denied because we booked through Travelocity. It just kinda made me feel \"second-class\". I almost would have prefered being lied to that no rooms were available. So then when we did check in, i felt like there was a big mark by our name that said \"discount-website trash checking in\" Alright, I dramatize a little. I just needed to get that off my chest. I would still stay here again, and truely suggest you do to, because again: it's in the perfect location, the place is immaculately clean, and the concerge staff were amazing. A few quick thoughts on San Fran in general..... it's cold! I guess especially in July/August.... so bring a jacket and pants! The sun is brutal and will burn you instantaneusly, so wear your sunscreen and wear a hat! The city is a bunch of wicked steep hills, so bring and wear the most comfortably shoes you have---- fashion be damned, those hills are evil! Food is super expensive and really not that good. Public transportation is cheaper in San Fran than Chicago- even taxi's! Bus fare is 2 bucks and it's good for 2 hours! Cable cars are a rip off 6 bucks for one ride, but most of the time they never ask you for money! I highly reccomend a hop on hop off bus tour when you first get there to get your bearings. Again, beware: when you cross over the Golden Gate Bridge, IT WILL BE COLD! And finally, if you are looking for a tour of Sonoma and the Wine country, please take the GREEN DREAMS TOUR with Ellie, it's the best. Sorry this is so long, and I really hope this helps someone.

A bit of a negative was how thin the walls seemed to be ... the people in the next room sounded like they were actually in our room ... not what you'd expect from a high-end hotel. I was very impressed by the conceirge service! We hadn't been to San Francisco for many years and needed some direction with local restaurants and sights. Joanna Husk (Concierge and Member of Les Clefs d'Or USA Ltd.) was possibly the best conceirge I've ever dealt with. She took the time to understand what we were interested in and provided us with maps, site-seeing suggestions, and an extensive list of restaurants within walking distance ... then she gave us specific recommendations to meet our interests. It's this type of service that makes you want to come back to a hotel! As far as location, it was ideal. Easy to walk just about anywhere, as long as you have the time and stamina, up and down the hills! We walked to Nob Hill, Telegraph Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, and Ghiradelli Square. A beautiful city!!

Although it wasn't cheep, it was very convenient and much less than valet. We spent a day over in Golden Gate Park, and then over to the Golden Gate Bridge (which are too far to walk) and it was great to have the car accessable.

The location is amazing! We took BART in from the airport and the hotel was an easy two-block walk from the Powell Station. It\u2019s right on Union Square, making it close to all of the shopping in that area. It\u2019s one block from the cable car and just a five minute walk from Chinatown. It\u2019s a very short cab ride from the restaurants in North Beach or the sights in Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The sidewalks around the hotel were draped in scaffolding, which was a bit of a drag. They must\u2019ve been doing some sort of renovations or other work to the exterior. The lobby is a bit dark and drab. Nothing special and certainly not inviting. The front desk agents, while extremely friendly and helpful, were slow. We frequently noticed long lines waiting for service, even with several agents working. But the room was quite comfortable and provided a great place to stay. The hotel is currently undergoing interior renovations. From what we were told by the front desk staff and what we saw, the lower floors have already been renovated. Since we requested a view, we were on an upper floor which had not yet been renovated. So for now, you can choose between a great view or a renovated room, but it appears that you can\u2019t have both. When the elevator stopped on the renovated floors, they appear to have been completely overhauled \u2013 new flooring, wall coverings, furnishings, lighting, etc. If the hallway is any indication, the newly renovated rooms must be amazing. Though our room had not yet been renovated, it was still very comfortable. They furniture and some of the fixtures are a bit tired, but Hyatt\u2019s Grand Bed provides for a great night\u2019s sleep. And ultimately\u2026 that\u2019s really all we needed out of the hotel. We had a city view \u2013 our room looked right across into the financial district. In fact, we even slept with the curtains open, lulled to sleep by the soft lights of the city\u2019s skyline. That skyline also provided the perfect backdrop for the lounge on the upper floor. The workout facility was awesome \u2013 again, taking advantage of that amazing view. Though it didn\u2019t have showers, or a steam room/sauna/Jacuzzi, it was the most well stocked hotel gym I\u2019ve ever seen. Every piece of cardio equipment you could imagine, along with weight machines, free weights, benches, exercise balls, TVs, towels, etc. Very easy to get in a complete workout, no matter what your routine. As platinum members, we enjoyed free WiFi in our room. I didn\u2019t notice what the normal charge is, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s exorbitant. The connection was a bit slow, but it worked for what we needed. Had I been trying to work with that connection, it could\u2019ve been somewhat frustrating. We never ate at the hotel, nor did we park there, so I can\u2019t speak to those aspects. There didn\u2019t appear to be anywhere to get coffee in the lobby. And it was excruciatingly slow and very difficult to get a cab for dinner on a Friday night. That\u2019s certainly not the fault of the hotel, but something worth noting if you\u2019re seeking a cab. All things considered, the Grand Hyatt was certainly not the nicest place we\u2019ve ever stayed, but it was comfortable, safe and you can\u2019t beat the location.

I have stayed at at least 10 different Grand Hyatts around the world, without counting the Park Hyatt stays, so it's safe to say that I know what the Grand Hyatt standards should be. As a Hyatt GPP Diamond member, I have always been guaranteed room upgrade to the next room category with welcome fruit baskets and wine and a personal note from the GM of the hotel already in the room before I check in almost every time I visit a Hyatt property. I might have been spoiled, but when I do spend so much time and money in their hotels I definitely expect more than average service and treatment. I wasn't quite impressed with the room assignment at check-in already. I was assigned a very small room that is not on the Club floor at first and didn't even get Club Lounge access. Front desk staff didn't seem to have any clue about my membership status until I inquired about it. I would expect that they should have been able to pull out this information from their system. Rooms are old and definitely require remodeling which I understand is underway. I have taken a look at both the renovated and non-renovated rooms and eventually picked the old room for the better view as the renovated room looked out to the back of the adjacent building. Room amenities were next to nonexistent. I had to call housekeeping to request for very basic amenities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, slippers and bathrobes, which are normally complimentary in a Grand Hyatt elsewhere. Housekeeping was sloppy. The ironing board was left in the bathroom throughout the entire duration of our stay after we used it on the first day. The iron was left next to the sink in the bathroom and was not put away after our use. The half-empty takeout coffee from the Club Lounge was left on the top of the cabinet in my room for days until I disposed it myself. One day I left the \"Private\" sign on the door before I headed out and when I came back to the room that evening my room was cleaned up nonetheless. If I requested for privacy, I would expect the housekeeping staff to first confirm with me whether the sign was left there intentionally before breaking into my room while I wasn't there. The walls were paper thin. I could hear conversations going on in my neighbours' rooms and every morning I was woken up at 6am when the guests next door got up. I stayed at the St Regis during my last visit to SF a few months ago and I didn't have any of the problems I mentioned above, granted I'm also Platinum SPG member. Most importantly, I felt that I was treated like a valued guest while I was staying at the St Regis which is what every hotel should strive to achieve. My overall experience at Grand Hyatt SF was more like that of a no frills hotel, except I paid a lot more than what I would have had to pay for Motel 6. The top management of this hotel seems to have little appreciation of what managing a Grand Hyatt property should mean to the guests. Understand the hotel is undergoing a major upgrade on the hardware but I would suggest management also consider improving on their software so that the service and overall experience would be on par with the rest of the Grand Hyatt properties.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, Wonderful Service, Beautiful View\u201d", "Author": "CAFunMom", "ReviewID": "UR94203808", "Content": "I took my daughter and her four friends to San Francisco for her 18th birthday.

What we got was lucky to be even a 3 Star experience that made a Motel 6 so much more appealing! First off, the hotel rooms are small and, as many have said, very outdated. This we could understand, San Francisco has limited space and obviously they can't expand outwards. So it was already expected for the size. BUT... what wasn't expected was the quality of the building and bed. We never thought we'd say this, but can't they afford to buy a new mattress? At an average of $200 a night for a room, you'd figure on sleeping on a comfortable mattress and not something that looks like it's been there since they opened the hotel 40 years ago. The king-size mattress had giant pits (I'd like to say dips, but they were way too deep) on both sides of the bed where people lay each evening. Only by placing one of the extra pillows into each crevice could the bed be made level to sleep on. This was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a hotel of this quality!! Come on, the mattress could have been replaced for the cost of a single night's stay. Not worthy of a so-called \"4 Star\" hotel. And the building... sure, it's a high-rise 36 story building and is bound to sway in the wind. But we were kept awake by the constant creeking, snapping and popping sounds that it made as it swayed in the breeze. We were waiting for the final loud pop before it collapsed on us. Other guests in the bar also complained of the same loud noises. Perhaps a building inspector should take a look before something bad happens? Then there was the refrigerator and mini-bar. If you're going to stay in the room expecting to use the refrigerator, think again. It was packed top to bottom with beer, soda and wines that if moved at all, you're IMMEDIATELY charged for. That's one high tech refrigerator.. but they can't even put in a flat screen tv? We called the front desk and they were very nice and said to go ahead and remove bottles to make the room we needed and they'd remove them off our bill. They did, no problem (at least not yet, we have not seen our credit card statement). The mini-bar lady came by before checkout to review the contents and noticed one bottle missing in the door of the refrigerator. We figured it was the only place they left for someone to put a drink, but apparently it wasn't fully stocked and was missing a bottle of wine. Good thing we found out, it was also removed from our bill. Note to those wanting a drink.. it's $9.00 for a can of beer. The shelves on the dresser/TV unit were also dedicated to fast grab snacks, so don't expect to use it for storing your clothes. They had mouse-trap like devices with candy bars in them. We'd hate to see the prices for those!! Everyone from the staff was very nice, unlike some comments we read on here. Staff made it feel like a 4-5 Star hotel, but the room was maybe a 2 Star, bar was okay and fitness gym was up to date. Now for parking... we didn't pay the $50+ parking fee for the hotel parking. Instead, we parked across the street at the Sutter-Stockton garage and paid a fraction the price the hotel wanted to charge. We arrived around 1 p.m. on Saturday and left at noon on Sunday. Paid only $28 parking. We highly recommend the Sutter-Stockton public parking garage.

Unfortunately, it's in San Francisco. I travel frequently to San Francisco, and have stayed frequently at other hotels; however, needing a one-night stay I decided to try out the Grand Hyatt. I should admit that there was nothing particularly wrong with my stay -- I had a perfectly adequate room on a high floor, with a nice view. However, as a Hyatt Diamond, I wasn't particularly impressed with the room -- based on the room map, it appears to have been one of the smallest in the hotel, and though high up, it wasn't on the same floor as the Grand Club. Furnishings were high quality, but a bit tired, with a worn counter in the bath. The bed was comfortable, and the room was very quiet. I didn't get a chance to check out the Grand Club, but it's not on the top floor of the hotel, which costs it a few points in my book. The cocktail lounge, which is on the top floor, has a nice northerly view of Coit Tower and the Transamerica, but it's kind of tight, and noisy, and the music from the private event next door kept intruding. Staff everywhere was pleasant, but not exceptional. All in all, I'd be perfectly happy with this property if there weren't so many other good options in the area. However, the Hyatt Regency is nicer for Hyatt loyalists, and the Westin is a better hotel in Union Square if you're a Starwood elite. And at the northeast corner of Union Square, it's a bit of a hike to transit compared to other nearby properties. So at the end of the day -- stay here if you get a deal, and you'll be perfectly happy, but don't pay a premium for the Grand Hyatt name.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidstone, England", "Title": "\u201cBay or City view??\u201d", "Author": "BuffaloBill5463", "ReviewID": "UR87043660", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel and found it surrounded by scaffolding but it did not put us off at all.

The Grand Hyatt is not THE BEST, but does the job = convenient, comfortable, service. There are some good and some sorta bad ... please read on: The Goods: Service. During one stay, I requested a high floor, got it, and the views were very nice. We wanted a non-connecting room, and requested a change ... and Sebastian/Night Manager was terrific in helping move us to a different room, even upgrading us. Thank you Sebastian! The new view cleared all the surrounding buildings, and had a nice Northern view of SF Bay & Coit Tower. Comfort: The room was comfortable, as expected ... clean, with a very comfortable bed, and very quiet. Convenient: Union Square shopping and Chinatown, along with all sorts of transportation options were right outside the hotel. The 'bads': The hotel is clearly primarily a business/convention hotel. If you're looking for an intimate, warm, elegant, trendy or boutique/small hotel ... forget it! The staff was however, generally nice, and greeted us always. Make no mistake though ... this is the classic large, downtown business hotel (approx 36 floors), with a 'ga-jillion' rooms along with a semi-large gym/fitness center (no pool), as well as ballrooms/conference rooms, etc.. The rooms do need some updating: flat-screen TV needed, desk/table worn, aging tub, worn cabinets. It sounds worse than reality, so don't let this deter you (as many of the areas hotels have similar issues), but it's time for some updating. Overall: We didn't spend huge amounts of time in the room. We wanted to enjoy SF and surrounding areas. So, if all you need is a fairly comfortable, convenient hotel with enough amenities to make the stay enjoyable, you should be fine here. Get past the size, semi-warm staff, and basic-decorated rooms, you'll be fine. We recommend it for general use, but not necessarily for a romantic stay.

I thought the hotel was very clean and well decorated. The rooms are decent, wicked soft beds, the TV was horrific, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious. My only comment about the view is you get what you pay for... what I mean is that if you book on priceline, expedia, orbitz, etc.... they give you the base ho-hum room, but you have the option to PAY for a better view either on hyatt.com or at check-in and to have a view of the bay its like $30-50 more per night which I think is highway robbery, but if they make money on that than so be it. The parking is incredibly easy, there is a 24-hr valet garage less than half a block away on Sutter they charged me $32 a night which for the location in SF that is dirt cheap. However charging $10 internet is a hose job. You get a $15 voucher for breakfast at the rooftop restaurant which is nice. The breakfast is excellent and the view is even better. However, make sure you know the hours of breakfast service because I got hosed on Mother's day because they stopped serving an hour earlier then the guest book says and as I checked out a little later that morning I noticed on the desk the flyers saying something about a mother day brunch thing... regardless I had no clue of the hour changes because I checked in 4 nights ago and complained to the desk person and he took off the $40 (4 day) internet charge for my trouble. I was more upset about not being able to eat there because the food is so good and the view is wonderful. Another issue I had was loud and rowdy people in the hall at 1AM. A quick call to the front desk eliminated the noise problem within minutes. I heard the elevator chime within 30 seconds of the call hang up. Its nice that security is fast and prompt here.

You could not ask for a more centrally located hotel to go shopping, dining, chilling out in union square over a coffee and of course the cable car terminal. After a very long trip from UK to San Fran, we were greeted at the front desk by `Wayne`, who was very pleasant, courteous and exactly the right person to greet you after a long haul. Checking in was a breeze and after chatting about our trip we were given a room higher up on the 29th floor overlooking Union Square. Wow!! What a view. Thanks again Wayne. The rooms are very clean, tidy and the beds are comfortable. Our room had a mini-bar, TV, Alarm clock with i-pod docking and the usual iron, hair dryer and coffee making facilities. There is a room safe for your valueables, but if you want you can also get a box at reception. There is a good gym on the 35th floor with the usual runners/cycles and x-trainers as well as weight machines. The kit all looks modern and you can plug your i-pod into them or watch TV on the individual screen. It does get busy around 0700. The staff and concierge are very polite and accomodating. They sell tour tickets on the open top bus at a discounted rate, the bus is definitely worth doing to get your bearings and introduce you to all the districts, plus it stops outside the Grand Hyatt and goes over the Golden Gate bridge. A definite must is to go to the 36th floor for a drink or just to look out the panoramic window for a view of the bay and coit tower. We were fortunate to have great clear weather and had a fantastic view. Absolotely Wonderful. We decided to eat in the restaurant, the service is very good and the duty manager made sure everything was to the customers satisfaction. The starters were great, but I felt the main didn`t match up to the 1st course and I have to say I have eaten better for less $$, although those times are few and far between. However, it is definitely worth the experience of looking out onto San Fran enjoying a meal and cool glass of wine, watching the sun set over the horizon, a definite tick in the box thing to do. If you don`t want a big meal, they also do bar food in the bar area and a to-go service.

As far as location goes I don\u2019t have any complaints. We pull up in front of the hotel and stop in the valet parking area. Kindly the valet attendant notified us of the daily parking rate and also a secondary parking location with a cheaper daily rate (not ran by the hotel). The secondary parking structure was around the corner. I didn\u2019t feel like driving anymore so I stayed with the original hotel valet and paid the extra $15 bucks a day. Checking in was seamless..Only a few people in line with plenty of staff to help out. The grand lobby area was not so impressive; maybe I\u2019m becoming a snob because my last hotel stay was in the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Anyways, nothing really impressive about the entry way, but nonetheless we were on our way up to the room quickly. We booked one of the \"club level\" rooms with a view of the bay. Well, the room was very, very small for a semi suite. Yes, I do understand that San Francisco typically has small rooms, but that's way I paid the extra money to enjoy a little more room with some relaxing views. The bathroom was small and pretty standard, nothing to brag about. The television was probably a 27-inch tube style. The least you could do is pull out these old style TV\u2019s...donate them while they're still working and spend a couple hundred bucks for some nice flat screens. At least they should do that for the suites. The furniture seemed a little outdated...come to think of it the whole interior of the hotel seemed a little outdated. The view...yes we did see the bay, but it was hindered by the view of the roof tops on the nearby buildings. Not quite the enjoyable view I imagined, besides there wasn't any room to sit down and take it all in. After a quick relaxation on the bed we decided to go upstairs and enjoy some hors d\u2019oeuvres (not sure if I spelled that correctly) in the lounge specifically for \"club level\" guest. Again, nothing to really brag about here...the food was typical and nothing exciting. Only 1 television tucked away in the corner where only 2 tables could view it. At least the TV here was a decent size maybe a 40-inch LCD. I was able to catch some highlights of the NBA playoffs. The bar was an \"honor\" bar; basically you make your own drinks, fill out a card specifying how many and have it charged to your room. Not a bad choice of drinks...there was enough options to satisfy your thirst, also the soft drinks, water and coffee was free. After, leaving the lounge we decided to relax a little more before trying the hotel restaurant boasting of beautiful views. The bed was a little stiff and the sheets were standard, maybe a 200 thread count. After a little cat nap we started getting dressed and to my surprise, I can\u2019t seem to find a power outlet. The power outlets were all behind the night stand, the bed or the table. The table was easiest to get to but had several items plugged into it (coffee maker, telephone, lamp, TV). After crawling under the table to plug in the iron I noticed that there was an available outlet on the base of the lamp. That was the only outlet available in the whole entire room (besides the bathroom). Although, this was a leisure trip, I still work on my laptop; charge my cell, etc. etc. With this set-up I was only able to do one at a time. One plus was the iron itself...I'd have to say it was a great iron. A kinda funny giving prop to an iron, but it was worth mentioning. Ah the restaurants...nothing spectacular, not even the views. The food was sub-par but the drinks were poured nicely. Service was decent and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The views of the city lights were ok, but nothing to brag about. The price of the food was a little steep, but that was kind of expected. Walking out of the restaurant we passed a piano lounge/bar. It was very crowded, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. We decided to hit the streets of SF instead. The fitness center was pretty much what you need in a fitness center. Had all the basics\u2026treadmills, stationary bikes, dumbbells, resistance machines and televisions. I used the treadmill for awhile and the resistance machines without incident. Towels and water was readily available. Check out was just as seamless as check in. We paid our additional expenses and in our vehicle within 5 minutes.

I noticed that the door and bellmen kept a close but discrete watch of people entering the lobby area, which I really appreciated and took as a sign of additional security for the hotel guests. We checked out early but asked the hotel to hold our luggage until it was time to go out to the airport. I liked that they placed our bags in a secured area off the lobby and asked us to go in with them to point out our luggage, insuring everything we stored came out. We enjoyed our short stay here and are pleased with the level of accommodations, location and service we received.

As far as the room, the beds were comofortable and I had a very good night's sleep. The room was very clean and did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Like any upscale hotel, they overcharge with the items in the mini-bar. Peoples main complaint is the parking, which is $50 per night, valet only. Unfortunately, parking is expensive for ALL hotels in SF not just the Hyatt. If you want to save money, I suggest parking down the street at a parking garage for about $25 per night.

Otherwise, the room was rather small and uninspired. The bathroom could use a remodel. The clock radio did not work, which was annoying to us both because we wanted to hear music and because we wanted the alarm. The hotel lacked charm and glamour. At this price point you might not be able to do too much better, but if you can spend a little more you can get more elsewhere. Be warned that parking here may set you back as almost much as the room itself. It cost me $50 to park each night and after factoring in taxes my $120 room became a $200 room and that was without room service. For $200 I would stay elsewhere, but if you are a tourist without a car it's not a bad deal. We walked over to the Four Seasons for breakfast just to see what that was like and we weren't impressed, but I'm sure it was better than Hyatt's overpriced offerings.

There is much to like about this hotel: A great central location; Walgreen's is next door; 24-Hour Fitness is three blocks east; Good department stores are close by; This is a high rise building so the views from the restaurant, club level and rooms on the upper floors are equally incredible from all directions; The hotel staff is courteous and well trained; The Grand Club concierges are extremely accommodating; The Hyatt Grand Bed is very comfortable; and The showers have good water pressure. Although some other bloggers have commented about the hotel being \u201cdated,\u201d the Grand Hyatt still felt a bit more upscale than the Hilton. The Hilton guest rooms felt like a Vegas hotel at the bad end of the strip. A few small things I didn\u2019t like: Old fashion TVs; Bathrooms with dated and claustrophobic standard tub/shower combo (A curved shower rod would be a relatively inexpensive fix); The $25 breakfast buffet with no omelet station... nope, can\u2019t even special order an omelet from the kitchen... particularly vexing since the Hyatt Fisherman\u2019s Wharf (20 blocks to the north) has a breakfast buffet complete with omelet station for $18. What\u2019s up with that? Be warned, the valet is very, very slow. At $55 per day for valet parking, this was unacceptable! Also, prepare to take a cab ride for good food. Dining choices near the hotel are limited and unremarkable. Other tips: Request upper floors to get away from street noise and upgrade to the club level if possible. If you want to a break from the $30 to $50 per person dinner checks typical in SF, Tommy\u2019s Joint is a great \u201cdownscale\u201d option for good food.

We visited Chinatown, which was walking distance from the hotel and which is intriquing to see. My reason for not desiring to see San Francisco again is that people seemed rushed there, which is not a comfortable environment to walk into when you are travelling.. I did hear though that if we had time that we should have seen the surrounding San Francisco area, the bay area and the wine country. The hotel was a nice retreat to return to vs. the rushed environment outside of the hotel.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cGrand Hyatt San Francisco Nice and Easy on Union Square\u201d", "Author": "duckparty", "ReviewID": "UR47880898", "Content": "We went to a confrence as I had not visited San Francisco for about 10 years.

The decor in the lobby and rooms was nice, but nothing that was great or fabulosity personified. I found the Housekeeping staff to be a bit pushy about wanting to push me out of my room by calling me and knocking on my door repeatedly (and then giving me the evil eye while they stood around in a group right outside my door when I did finally leave my room after the first day), but the Room Service staff were highly proficient and thorough in completing tasks. When I arrived the lobby was filled with throngs of people milling about in different groups and employees going about their duties and I got discouraged thinking that it would take forever to be noticed, as I was traveling by myself, and get checked into my room. To my surprise, I was noticed by a wonderful woman named Isabella who beckoned me over and greeted me with a smile and kindness with no hint of stress or strain in her demeanor or voice and she deftly checked me in. When she told me that I was in a nonsmoking room and I asked if a smoking was available she told me that none were for that day, but that there was starting on the next day of my stay and she made all the arrangements to have my reservation moved to the new room on the next day and all I had to do was leave my packed bags in my room when I left for the day and the staff would move my belongings for me and she even upgraded me from the 4th floor to the 19th floor (truly as other reviews have stated, the views on the upper floors are to die for and would be worth paying extra for if necessary). Needless to say, I was grateful and extremely pleased with the service I received. When it came time for my original check out date, I decided that I was having too much fun in San Francisco (how can you not in that great city?!?) and that I wanted to stay for another day, so I went down to the Front Desk and inquired about doing so and the staff member who helped me was happy to accommodate my request and did so with a smile. On the day that I was leaving, I was running late and left in a harried rush and was obviously noticed by the Doorman who asked my destination and I informed him that I intended on taking a cab to the airport, and he told me that he could see I was rushing and offered a Lincoln Towncar from the hotel fleet for the same price as the cab. Of course I accepted the offer, if for no other reason than the extra comfort of the leather seats and better suspension on the vehicle, and then I heard the Doorman tell the driver that I seemed to be running late and to \"step on it\". I was impressed that I never once told him how really late that I was, yet he observed my demeanor and took the initiative of his own accord to let the driver know my situation to see if it would help get me to the airport on time....which it did. I barely made my flight, but I made it. Overall, the accommodations at this hotel were pleasant and somewhat appropriate for the price point, my interactions with the Housekeeping staff left something to be desired, but the negative of those brief interactions was far overshadowed by the excellent above par service that I received from the Front Desk staff and Door staff.

Or train the bell staff to help out? Otherwise, the stay was great. I concur with the comments below that the rooms are comfortable and great views but the bathrooms need to be updated.

Lobby - Dark and dingy Lifts - extremely slow. So slow that my husband and I walked down from the 9th floor as it was quicker and easier. Room - We had a double queen. The room itself was dark and quite depressing. The colors, brown and rust along with the dark wood furniture made the room feel smaller. We were four staying and we all felt as though we were on top of each other. Beds were very comfortable and quite large for queen beds Breakfast - recommendable if only for the fantastic view over San Francisco!! Although we did use the Starbucks which is directly opposite. A couple of mornings we were a bit slow off the blocks (maybe 9ish) and had the maid constantly barging in asking when we will be leaving so she could clean! Bathroom - Brightly lit and clean. Shower was powerful and good. Towel's a plenty, large, very white and fluffy. Best thing is the location. Chinatown a very short walk away as was the tram and public transport to all the major tourist areas. Macy's and other large shops are within throwing distance. We hired the hotel car to take us to the airport which was very reasonably priced, quick and convenient. This hotel was at best average. I would say it needs a make over to brighten it up and make it more appealing.

I chose this hotel because of its access and proximity to some of the important places in San Francisco. On the first night itself we started to hear knocking sounds on the door of the room and some people talking loudly. We had a disturbed night and my son whose bed was closer to the door was particularly disturbed. The next night again, the loud knocking from the door started and would happen after every half-hour to one hour. Unable to sleep, I called the reception at 5 a.m. in the morning and narrated these problems. I was told that the noise was perhaps because of the high winds and the fact that minor earthquakes keep occurring in San Francisco. I specifically asked if anybody else had reported similar problems that night as the problems with high winds could not be only for me and not for the others. I was told that nobody else had reported similar problems that might. However, I was promised an upgrade of room the next day. The next day I narrated my tale of woes in writing and give it to the reception. I was promised that by the evening my room would be changed and that I would be upgraded as compensation for the disturbance that I had to bear for two consecutive nights. However, in the evening I was told that there were no better rooms available and that I would have to shift to a room on the lower floor. I reluctantly agreed as I had no choice in the matter. I expressed my serious reservations at the manner to the hotel authorities who were attending to me. Late in the evening I received a call from the reception who stated that complementary the breakfast coupons were being sent to me and the same could be used the next day. The next day the three of us had breakfast which needless to add was very ordinary. We handed over the coupons to the attendant. We checked out to another hotel the next day and were expressly told at the reception that there were no dues outstanding against us. On receipt of my credit card statement after about 15 days I was surprised to find that USD 106 had been charged from me. I promptly called the accounts department of the hotel and asked them for the details of USD 106 charged from me. I was shocked to learn that they had charged me for the complimentary breakfast. I narrated that incident to the person who expressed her surprise that no such complaint etc was recorded in the computers of the hotel. I told her to look into this matter as there was something very wrong going on in the hotel. I haven\u2019t heard from the Hotel since then. I have never experienced such a casual and lackadaisical approach from the staff of a hotel in my life. It is as if they are not bothered about customer relations and their prime motive is to make money whichever way, out of whoever comes to the hotel. Needless to add that till date despite written complaints I do not have any form of apology from the hotel.

The beds are wonderful and the rooms surprisingly quiet for a city location. Unlike some high-rise hotels I've stayed at I've been impressed by the ability to easily get an elevator whenever I've stayed here - I've never had to wait more than a minute or two. I also highly recommend the Grandviews lounge atop the hotel. An excellent view at night, but the view is completely jaw-dropping during the day. The exercise room is also now open 24/7, a nice plus after a long day of meetings. The location on Union Square also can't be beat - the fact that it's set back a bit from the square keeps it a bit quieter than many other nearby properties. The TVs in the room are older CRT models, but with Union Square right outside the door, except in the morning who has time to watch TV?

Not only did they price us double the price we orginally got but also did understand the connection of having already booked a room for the next two nights. So instead I called priceline and booked a room for a much lower price. I have to admit I rather deal with priceline than direct service with Hyatt.

This debt card was not used to hold the rooms nor were they given to the front desk. We called to ask about the charges and they say they could not help us. Only the accounting department could help. We asked them how was it possible not to be able to tell us what the charges were for. The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days!

The tub/shower combo was old and grubby and the cold-war era shower head and faucet literally dribbled water.

Instead they had toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, bar soaps, and lotion. The fluorescent bathroom light hummed annoyingly. Another bad thing--coffeemaker in the bathroom does not come with coffee.

You can't fault the location of the hotel. Smack in the heart of Union Square, all the shops and convenience stores are right on your doorstep, out throught the foyer to the end of the block, take a left and forward two blocks and there's Walmart, out of the foyer and to the right and you have Macy's, Virgin Megstore, Louis Vitton ... the list goes on. It's between $7 and $15 to Fisherman's Wharf (depending on the time of day) for Pier 39 and Alcatraz cruise boarding, and I would recommend that if you're in a rush to get somewhere in the evening you try to get a taxi a good half hour before you need to be there as they become hard to come by the later the night gets. I would recommend that you research your stay, we sayed the same time as 'Team in Training', and to say that they took over the hotel is an understatement.

It was my first time to San Francisco and I was travelling alone. I had sat on tripadvisor for weeks beforehand as I just didn\u2019t know which hotel I should book. I kept reading review after review and in the end I just took a chance and booked the Grand Hyatt, despite some of the bad reviews. I arrived at San Francisco airport and got a taxi to the hotel. Tip \u2013 Only get in yellow meter cabs, which will be waiting outside baggage claim. Do not go with the drivers that stand and offer their services for a fixed price. They will rip you off and often don\u2019t have taxi licenses. When we pulled up at the hotel I paid the driver what was on the meter. He then said there was an extra $2 airport fee. I wasn\u2019t really thinking at the time and I just paid it. When I got out of the cab I asked the receptionist if this was right and they said no. You only need to pay what\u2019s on the meter. So please please please do not fool for this like I did! Also, the driver was very surprised when I only tipped him a dollar and muttered something rude in Spanish. I don\u2019t really see the need to tip a taxi driver anyway unless they have provided an exemplary service. That goes for everything in America and as an English person I think it is quite frankly a disgrace the way a lot of Americans behave with the tipping system. I couldn\u2019t give a monkeys that service is not included. People should only be tipped if they have really earned it. Anyway now on to the hotel! I had booked a Regency Club King which is a high floor room with a king bed, \u2018luxury\u2019 bath amenities and access to the Regency Club Lounge. Oh and lets not forget you are on a private floor so you have to use your key card in the elevator to access it \u2013 This is really just for insecure people who like to look important when they are in an elevator. The receptionist was friendly and I was escorted by the bellboy to my room. When I got to the room, there were two queen beds in it and like I said I had booked a Regency Club King. I went back downstairs and asked what this nonsense was all about. I was told that unfortunately they did not have any regency club rooms with king beds and that it was the only thing they could offer me. She tried to make out that a king bed is not guaranteed to which I replied \u2013 Why are you advertising something you can\u2019t produce? I.e. False advertising. Well I\u2019m not a mug so I asked to see the manager. She tried it on as well until I was about to leave and check-in to the Westin St. Francis instead \u2013 at which point she was able to find me a king bed on a high floor with a view of the financial district which is what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t however on the regency club floor which meant I wouldn\u2019t get to use my key card in the elevator. Big loss! I did however make sure that the robes and \u2018luxury\u2019 bathroom amenities were sent to the room as I was still paying for a Regency Club Room. By the way in case you are wondering, all rooms in this hotel are exactly the same. You just get a few extra luxuries in a regency club room and access to the lounge. I entered the room and I was pretty happy overall. The room itself was a pretty standard Hyatt room. You would think they would have flatscreen TVs for the price you are paying and the day and age we live in but no obviously not. Again, this didn\u2019t really bother me. It was only a place to stay but the room was very presentable and well decorated I thought. There was an ipod port on the bedside table which was a nice touch and there was plenty of drawer and cupboard space. The bathroom is what I am always most concerned about in a hotel room but it was very clean and welcoming. The shower pressure was good and I didn\u2019t encounter the problem of lukewarm water, which is often reported on here. If I wanted boiling hot water, that\u2019s what I got. This was a relief as the frequent comments about this had worried me a little. One of the reasons why I also booked this hotel, was because it had windows that opened onto a small balcony and I can\u2019t stand hotel rooms with windows that don\u2019t open. I stayed in a skyscraper hyatt once with no windows and you just don\u2019t get any oxygen in the room. It\u2019s awful if you are spraying deodorant and hairspray or aftershave. How are you supposed to air the room? The air conditioning?! Do me a favour. Anyway I called the hotel before I booked it to make sure that the windows do open. I was told by the front desk that they open to about 4 inches, and if you want them open fully you need to sign a release form as they have had a couple of suicides in the past apparently. This sounded good except when I arrived I was told that this is not the case anymore and hasn\u2019t been for the last year and you are only allowed to have the windows opened to the 4 inch mark. This wasn\u2019t great to be honest and I was pretty annoyed as I was told something completely different. It also seemed ridiculous to have a balcony you can\u2019t even use. You may think I\u2019m a very picky person but when you are paying this sort of money, you have every right to be picky. I had a view of the skyscrapers of the financial district and the view really was spectacular, especially at night with all the buildings lit up. It really was wonderful and one of the great things about this hotel is the views you get from all the rooms, especially on a high floor. I had paid to have breakfast each morning in the Grandviews restaurant on the 36th floor. This really was spectacular to eat breakfast and look out over the whole of San Francisco. Probably one of the highlights of the hotel. The breakfast itself was very good. It is a small buffet but not too small. Plenty of choice. The \u2018fresh,\u2019 orange juice they offer you is clearly from a carton and I would expect freshly squeezed in a Hyatt and for the price I was paying. They also bring you a complimentary small glass of a strawberry smoothie each morning, which for the record, is also from a carton. The breakfast staff are very nice. Can be a little too talkative at times when you want to eat your breakfast in peace but I guess I should just lighten up a little. The staff overall in this hotel are absolutely superb. I was extremely impressed with all the staff here. Everyone will greet you with a smile on their face, and all the staff are extremely courteous and helpful. This was very nice to see. The concierge are fabulous at this hotel and they really cannot do enough for you. Probably the best concierge I have ever come across and I travel a lot. This was very refreshing and extremely impressive. The Regency Club Lounge is really nothing special. It is a small room on the 32nd floor and although the views are great, it\u2019s not a very impressive room. They do a continental breakfast each morning which is ideal if you haven\u2019t paid for the breakfast in the Grandviews restaurant. The hors d\u2019oeuvres they serve in the evening are pretty poor. Just a small buffet area of poorly presented crudit\u00e9s, brocolli thrown in a bowl, dumplings and a few other random bits. It all just looks like left overs from dinner and I\u2019m pretty sure it is. There is also a bar area but you do have to pay for alcoholic drinks. All soft drinks are free which was handy for me as I could get a bottle of water whenever I wanted. I did not sleep well at all in this hotel. At about 8 o\u2019clock every morning there was a clicking noise that came from something in the room. It was extremely annoying and there was no way I could sleep with that noise. It sounded as though it was the air conditioning unit cooling down but I didn\u2019t ever even use the air conditioning unit. Luckily I needed to get up around that time anyway so I didn\u2019t bother complaining. The beds themselves are not bad at all. They are not the most comfortable I have ever slept in but they are definitely comfortable enough. Be very careful when checking out of this hotel and read through the bill very carefully! They will try and charge you for the minibar even if you haven\u2019t used it. I guess they do this just to cover themselves. They were very relaxed about taking it off the bill so it was pretty obvious they do it all the time. I would probably stay somewhere else next time just to try something different. My experience here was good overall. It has its good points and bad points but I cannot justify the money I paid for it. I think I will try the Fairmont next time as it really did look spectacular and there is not much difference in the price. In terms of restaurants, I wouldn\u2019t bother with the Grandviews restaurant for dinner. The food does not get great write-ups and the prices are absolutely insane. You are just paying for the view. If you want to see the view then pay for breakfast in there. Wouldn\u2019t you rather say you went to a famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant for dinner than saying you went to the Hyatt for dinner? Trust me it\u2019s the same price. Avoid the local Daily Grill restaurant down the street. The hotel recommends this but my steak in there was absolutely appalling even though it is a steak restaurant. I went to the Cardonian Room restaurant which is at the top of the Bank of America building (2nd tallest building in San Francisco). The views are stunning and the food is ok \u2013 very small portions. I like nouveau cuisine but this was too small. Do go on the Movie Tour if you get a chance. It\u2019s a lot of fun. You\u2019ll be sick of the voice of the tour guide after 3 hours and hearing about what films they have been extras in etc, but it is all good fun. Some great films have been filmed in San Francisco. Obviously do Alcatraz. You\u2019d be stupid to go there and not to it. Was extremely fascinating. Get on the boat and go across to Sausalito. Very pretty town and nice to go there for lunch. The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen and if you like walking, do walk across it as the views are stunning. I would recommend taking the hop on hop off city tour on your first day to get your bearings and see a few of the sites. You needn\u2019t waste money getting taxis around this city. Everything is close-by and it\u2019s very easy to jump on a tram which will only cost you just over a dollar.

We chose the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. The welcome at the hotel was very friendly and extremely informative. The lady on reception (apologies for not remembering her name) was very helpful with informing us with what was on in the city during our stay. The hotel room was basic but very clean and comfortable. It was noticeably catered for the business traveller. The location of the hotel is perfect for those who like to be in the middle of everything and like to shop and eat out. It is also ideally located for getting around the city as the trams system junction is 2 mins walk through the Square. You can get a tram to anywhere throughout the city from here. There is also a rail link to the airport minutes walk from the hotel. It takes on average 20 - 30 mins to walk from the Grand Hyatt down to Fisherman's Wharf, we did this every evening, which did make us think that we had made the wrong choice in hotel. However, the Hyatt at the wharf is only 3 stories high, so you are likely to be kept awake with noise from the street (if you are light sleeper like me) There is lots to see and do down at the Wharf - We also \"biked the bridge\" this was definitely the best part of our stay in San Francisco, the cycle up to Tiburon via Sausalito was great!.. both places are great places to stop for a great meal and a refreshing drink enjoying the scenery across the bay to the city. I highly recommend doing this on your visit. Alcatraz was a great as expected, very cold tho, even mid summer, so wrap up warm.

The accomodations were clean and comfortable. There was individual air/heat control in the room-not one of those awful noisy wall units. The concierges were amazing. They knew the best ways to get around. They recommended a wonderful Hop-on/Hop-off tour of the city with the tickets good for two days at a very reasonable price. They recommended a fabulous little Italian restaurant \"Fino\" about 2 blocks walk away and made the reservations for us. They had an appropriate solution to any question or challenge we presented them. They went above and beyond the call of duty in all things. The staff in the breakfast area were very accomodating also and made sure our needs were met in a timely manner.

The location is fantastic; it appears to be in the middle of everything. Getting there from the BART station is a snap. Check in was very quick, and I got a bay view room on the 30th floor. For a 312-sq ft room, it did seem spacious, and it was very clean. It was a windy weekend but there was very little noticeable creaking noise. The bed was very comfortable, but I really don\u2019t need 6 pillows and 3 cushions. Thermostat was so simple, even my mother could use it [not an insult, she just hates gadgets], and room safe was a decent size. Great water pressure in sink and shower, with kind of a shallow bathtub. I knocked some items around when checking out the refreshment center, which triggered a charge to my room, but a call to the front desk took care of that of with no hassle. Finally, the food at Grandviews was veeerrrrry good, as was the service. What impressed me most were the personnel of the Grand Hyatt. This hotel actually had one of the friendliest, maybe the friendliest, staffs I have ever encountered at a hotel. I especially commend the front desk and concierge teams who were both very helpful and pleasant, and really made the stay more enjoyable. Side note: I had requested a refrigerator a few weeks earlier through E-Concierge, but there was no fridge in the room. I didn\u2019t pursue it with the staff because I seem to have refrigerator issues with Hyatt properties, and I didn\u2019t want to be bothered. However, I did mention it in follow-up correspondence to hotel management, so we\u2019ll see what they say about that. And now for some indirect stuff: I wondered why many reviewers seem to go ape over the Macy\u2019s a couple of blocks away, but now I see why\u2026it\u2019s actually two stores, the 8-story main store and the 5\u2013story men\u2019s store across the street. That\u2019s 13 stories of Macy\u2019s goodness, topped by a Cheesecake Factory at the main store. Also the 24-hour Walgreen\u2019s around the block which is very convenient, and I\u2019m not a coffee drinker, but there are two very nearby Starbucks for those who are into that sort of thing. I don\u2019t know if anyone has mentioned the Mrs. Fields cookie shop across from the back entrance. And as others have noted, Sears Fine Food is also around the corner, along with a Morton\u2019s Steakhouse a little farther away, and a great selection of eating choices, especially if you are willing to walk up hilly Powell Street a little bit.

I ate lunch and dinner at Wolfgang Puck's takeaway which had great quality food freshly cooked at reasonable prices - it was located in the basement of Macy's department store across from the hotel.

This simple request was a major issue - apparently they only have one pair of scales in the entire hotel. I suggest that the hotel management cross the road to Macy's and buy 5 more weighing scales as many travellers need to weigh their luggage.

The next morning (Saturday) at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot. This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day. Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map. You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window. Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro. We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride. We had a nice room on the 25th floor. The room was 4-star, but the lack of services (e.g. pool, gift shop) make the entire property a 3.5 star. Still, it was a great value and the location can't be beat. Everything is close. We shopped at Macy's and went to Walgreens for our snacks. Both are a block away. The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent!! Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods (near Walgreens) for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge (atop the Drake Hotel) for drinks and dancing. Both places are highly recommended. The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf. Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.

Speaking of the bar upstairs, you have to enjoy the view from the 36th floor even if just for a couple of drinks. The drinks were good and very reasonable so were the desserts (try the carrot cake) however it is all about the view when you are 36 stories up. We truly appreciated housekeeping as we made one call on our first evening in town and advised that we needed extra towels since there were 4 women in one room and they made sure, each night we were there, to leave plenty of extra towls. Also upon check in our bell hop asked what we would be doing and offered to bring us a refrig so that we could store any edibles free of charge. He was the sweetest and it really helped our stay as we stashed our wine bottles after the tour and plenty of bottled water and snacks in the fridge.

Three places within blocks of the hotel that you MUST try...House of Nanking at 919 Kearney, the absolute best Chinese ever!! If you arrive after 7pm almost any day you will probably have to wait outside, it is small but INCREDIBLE and definately worth the wait. Sears Fine Foods at 439 Powell is wonderful for breakfast there is also a little spa next door to Sears where we all expierenced great service as we got facials, massage, and pedi/mani, very resonable prices too.

Furniture crammed into every nook & cranny. Could hear noise from other rooms periodically. TV in bathroom was a joke as it barely got any reception. Furnishings were a bit beat up. This would be a lousy hotel for business as the room did not have an actual desk to work at. -- Elevators were perhaps the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel (or any building). I would have assumed that 6 elevators for 36 floors would be more than sufficient - not so. When an elevator would finally show up (usually after 5 minutes or more) it was usually already packed. We ended up taking the service stairs more than once. Very, very frustrating! -- Location is great if you are looking to be in the center of the action. Tons of shopping right outside. Chinatown just a few blocks away. Cable Cars & BART closeby as well. -- Concierge let us down as he told us that BART did not go to the Oracle Arena (Warriors game) when it actually does, so we ended up blowing money on a cab.

I was somewhat apprehensive after reading some of the mixed reviews on this site, but my apprehensions were completely unfounded. This was my third stay in SF; having previously stayed at the nearby Sir Francis Drake and also the Hotel Boheme. The Grand Hyatt stands head and shoulders above either of these two. Let me now respond to some of the issues previously raised, in no particular order. 1. Room size. If our room was anything to go by, the rooms are quite simply palatial. Anyone who considers these rooms small has never stayed in a hotel in New York or indeed any of the so called \"boutique\" hotels around SF. 2. \"Tired\" decor. This is perhaps a fair criticism, but everything is relative here and the so-called \"tiredness\" would only be an issue if your baseline is 6 star Asian opulence. Perhaps \"dated\" would be a better word, as there is none of the shabbiness that the word 'tired' implies. And again, if you really want to see tired and dated, just go to anywhere that markets itself as boutique. 3. The lobby. Yes, this is a shambles - the layout being dictated by the central core of elevators. But really, who cares. 4. The staff - without exception were extremely polite, efficient, and helpful. Special mention must go to the concierges who we used shamelessly on at least a daily basis - nothing was too difficult for them and they were a goldmine of local knowledge. Most other hotel concierges simply hand you pamphlets. I can't praise them highly enough. And it must also be said that the location is excellent, the bed one of the most comfortable I have experienced and the hotel has a very good fitness centre. In terms of value for money - I can never score the rock-bottom rates like those offered on priceline; instead paying $239 a night.

Parking in SF should be an Olympic sport; an EXPENSIVE Olympic sport performed only by those highly trained in the craft.

The room was not as nice as I had expected. The good part was it was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The bad part was after check in (exhausted and wanting a hot shower) I discovered hairs in the tub. The was also mildew on the soap holder. One phone call did not correct the problem promptly. A second phone call to the operator did bring a housekeeper to my room within 10 minutes to repeat the cleaning of the bathtub. The towels provided were nothing special. The bathroom was clearly in need of renovation but the water pressure was decent. Another good thing about the hotel is the exercise room - top of the line equipment, in good quantity and complimentary access. Another poor point for the hotel was the SLOW elevators. I don't know if some elevators were not working, if the hotel was full to capacity, just older and slower elevators - every time I had to wait more than usual for an elevator to arrive. I didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them. Overall a decent stay and great location.

This is the perfect location - close to every mode of transportation, coffe shops, quaint bar a block away, awesome shopping all around. Tip: Buy the 3 day muni pass which is good for any muni bus, train or trolley. It will save you tons of money. Don't waste time on a cab.

FIRST ROOM - on the 24th floor facing the Financial District - nice king bed and clean - can't really say much since we asked for another room with better view SECOND ROOM - on the 25th floor with full view of Coit Tower, TransAm Building, the Bay, Angel Island, etc. (see pics) - two full beds with 4 pillow EACH .. VERY comfy .. loved it! - was a bit dirty as the past guest left a bit of garbage in one of the drawers and his jeans in the back of the closet (okay ..) - loved the scent of the soap (citrusy!) We used our AAA card and was able to get a free upgrade and upgraded once again at the front desk (for $20 more) .. it's worth it! RESTAURANT Again, with the AAA card, we received a free breakfast at the Grandview Restaurant - you can choose either the buffet or one entree from the menu. We opted for the buffet and had coffee/juice/smoothie served to us automatically. The buffet consisted of eggs, sausage, bacon, French toast, oatmeal, fruits, and cereal. All hit the spot after a late night of toursiy activities in the City! I just have to reiterate that the service was fantastic (esp Danny and Wendy)!

While I had a fantastic time touring this amazing city, the hotel experience was AWFUL. First, I'm not one of those picky travelers who complains about anything and everything. I travel frequently, US, Europe, Africa, Carribbean but I've NEVER had this bad of an experience and rarely ever felt the need to get online to write a bad review. But this, I had to let people know. First, just as the reviewer below me said - I also arrived late, and the hotel was dead. I had to wait a few minutes to see one front desk person show up finally. No bell person, nothing. So I figured ok, it's late, doesnt matter. She gave me my room info and I head up, with no offer of assistance or anything. As a single traveler, it definitely was the least welcoming hotel I've been to. I head up, and get into the room, it was just very plain and very dated. A little depressing frankly, but I figured I wouldn't stay in my room all day anyway. I decided to lock the door but in doing so, first I tried to open it and it wouldn't open at all!! I was locked in from the inside!!! I couldn't believe it. I tried and tried, nothing. So I called the desk, they sent a bell guy up and I had to SLIDE the card through the door for him to open door!! I'll make it short, because it really was incredulous. So they gave me another room: Change 1. The next days, I changed rooms THREE times. The shower wasn't working properly in the room I was moved in: the water was lukewarm atbest. The engineer couldn't fix it, so they sent me to another room. Change 2. I couldn't believe it. When I got to that room, I started taking a shower : and to my shock, same issue!!!! only this time, it was COLD - no hot water at all. The front desk guy apologized and said He guessed the engineer didn't check before moving me. I'm thinking, it's YOUR job to check, not his!!! So the guy says he has a great room with a better view of Union Square for me, and that the next morning, I should go up and get complimentary breakfast and ask for the manager, because he (the front desk guy) arranged for it personally. I just couldn't believe that all they offered me was lame breakfast!!!! for making me move three times in 2 days!!!! UNBELIEVABLE. So, left with NO choice I moved AGAIN. The next morning, I decided to collect on my \"complimentary breakfast\". I was impressed with the views from the restaurant and waited for the manager. She came, and after I told her the story, she had NO CLUE what I was on about!!!!! She said, do you remember the name fo the front desk person who told you you could have free breakfast?? I couldn't believe it. She had to make calls - and still no one at the front desk that morning knew what I was on about. No complaint note on my room, NOTHING. So she says taht she's sorry, but she will have to put the breakfast on my tab until she can clear the story. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said. I was so humiliated and furious!!! The breakfast, btw was awful (found a hair on the french toast and pointed it out to the manager, she didnt even apologize or offer me anythign in exchange) and I got billed $30 for the buffet. I headed back downstairs and told front desk to find the guy who said I could have the free breakfast, and that this was really just absurd. They said they would, looking at me like I was crazy instead of apologizing for putting me through that. I came back very late (because frankly I never wanted to even stay in my room, the rooms are SO dated and dreary). I went back to the front desk, and the actual assistant manager who had handled my complaint was there, and told another front desk guy to delete the charge from breakfast from my bill. BUT AT NO POINT did he even identify himself (I recognized him from the name tag), or apologize for NOT having told the breakfast manager, or ANYTHING. Just gave me such a snobby go-away look. And then they have the gall to ask if I wanted additional breakfast coupons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm going to end here. But suffice it to say, I will never ever ever stay at this hotel, or any other Grand Hyatt ever again. I am sure that if I were older and probably of another color, I would have received better treatment and definitely more than a free bkfast. At the very least, I should've been credited one night off my stay, for making me change rooms THREE times in 2 days and making me pay for a breakfast until they could figure out whether I had \"lied\" about it. And this is a four star hotel???? I had to CHASE them down to take the bfast off my bil!!!! The only positive was the location, but as the other reviewer said, there were MANY hotels with that convenience. I had a fantastic time in the bay area, but the hotel DID put a damper on my stay - truly cold staff and cold dated rooms.

The Grand Hyatt is currently rated 70 on here & would say thats about accurate, the one thing going for it as everyone agrees is location, although we did see many other hotels in & around Union Sq so it does have competition on that front, but after seeing Fishermans Wharf the more up market Union Sq area is in our opinion where you need to be stopping. First impressions of hotel on arrival is that the entrance is on the road & for a big hotel does not have a great frontage. We checked in late so reception was quiet & quick but cosidering these two points we where not asked if we needed any assistance with our two large cases & ended up taking them to our rooms ourselves. We decided to pre book a Regency Club room, as we thought a better room & extra touches would be nice however this turned out to be dissapointing although we cant comment on a standard room we are sure there could be little difference between the two, we found our club room average at best .The bathroom was very dated & room drab in decor,just looks like it needed a makeover best thing about it was the bed, big & very comfortable! The club lounge also seemed pointless the only thing we gained for our extra $50 each a night was continental breakfast & a few complimentary soft drinks no personal concierge infact all the staff except one chap were pretty impersonal you were also expected to pay for alcoholic beverages between 5 & 7 pm which we were initially led to believe from Expedia were going to be free! Best thing about the club lounge is the elevated view which is awesome this is what we think you are may be paying for so be warned,unless you want a stunning view of the city while having breakfast dont bother with Regency Club. We think that if we had gone for the standard room option it would have been reasonable value for an ageing hotel but we did expect a bit more from Hyatt & when returning we will be checking out some other hotels as San Francisco has plenty.", "Date": "March 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay at Grand Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "demandingdivatexas", "ReviewID": "UR7163244", "Content": "Booked the Grand Hyatt on Priceline for a great price and was put in a suite with an incredible view of the Bay and San Franciso.

I asked for a Regency Blun room but none were available so I asked for Regency club access and received that for an extra $25 a day (BTW I ended up not getting charged for this perk); I feel it is well worth it. The Regency Club is on the 32nd floor and is open till 9pm at night. The RC provides a nice continental breakfast spread (cereal, fruit, toast, yougurt, oatmeal granola) + a nice happy hour spread (hot snacks mix fruit); you can get water, coffee, tea, hot choc, sodas all day; happy hour drinks cost $4 for beer, wine etc. I got up early every morning; took my newspaper and had coffee and enjoyed the wonderful view of the bay. This is a nice option that people should be aware of; if you wanted to take items back to your room no problem, the staff even provided trays The room was on the 14th floor and was very basic; lacking in bathroom amenties that I would expect from the Hyatt (no qtips, cotton balls etc). The coffee for the in-room coffeemaker was in the hospitality fridge; which you can not use for personal items you must request a fridge from housekeeping. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. I do want to address the Frebeze smell; I did smell a perfumey smell when I got off the evalator on each floor; the smell did go away once I entered my room or the RC. It is there for those that are sensitive to such scent. I recommend parking on the corner garage Stockton/Sutter Street; as valet is $40 + tax a day. The lobby is quite grand with an oriental feel since the hotel is so close to Chinatown. The lobby window; had a cute Christmas village lit up.

However, I have never used Priceline until this past visit and what a bummer that I only tried it now!!! I paid litle more than what one would pay for a one or two star hotel in San Francisco! Anyway, on to the review of this hotel. I had stayed here many years ago and had enjoyed it very much. But it seems as though prices had crept up over the years and I found myself staying more and more at the Argonaut which is an incredible hotel for the price and location. We arrived in the morning and weren't sure if the Hyatt would be able to check us in early but asked anyway. They told us the rooms were being cleaned and to come back in about an hour (this was 8am). No problem, went around the corner to Sears Coffee Shop and came back. No problem, got ourselves a room! The room was not large but had more than enough room for my family of three. I admit that the view was non existant but I wasn't going to argue with the price I was paying. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very nice. The most pleasant surprise during our stay was the housecleaning staff. Each and every one of them was pleasant and would acknowledge you everytime you saw them. By this I don't mean just a \"hello\" and then go away but a real conversaion. Maybe not a long one but, \"how are you today? Is everything alright?\". They made us feel like they really cared about our well being. They were more than happy to provide us with anything we needed. The location of this hotel can't be beat, you're basically just steps away from Union Square and I mean steps! You can walk to nearly everything and the Cable Car stop is just a block away. If you plan on using the cable car for transportation get yourself a city pass.

The Hyatt did, to their credit, ended up putting us up in another hotel for the evening, but wanted us to return to the Hyatt for the second night of our stay! Paying for the first night of our stay does not excuse the fact that a guarantee for late arrival reservation for two rooms was given away. Travelers do not always arrive at the convenience of a hotel, therefore, the guranteed for late arrival is to be their assurance of a room. I feel this kind of treatment shows poorly for the BIG Hyatt corporation. Also, there were charges put onto my charge for the orginal 4 days that were for services we did not use. Hyatt has lost a long standing Passport member and never again will I recommend to anyone to stay at a Hyatt. We have been treated poorly, in the past, with Hyatt Hotels and have always given them another chance.

I'm happy to report that the Grand Hyatt at Union Square provided a comfortable and welcoming \"home base\" for my partner and I during this year's stop (Nov 2006) in the city by bay. Full disclosure: I accompanied a travel industry professsional who obtained a terrific rate by booking our room months in advance and talking directly with the hotel. Still, our room rate was right in line with other excellent rates easily obtainable via Priceline and Hotwire for this same property. Our request for an upper level floor was happily accomodated by the friendly and professional young lady at the reservation counter at check in. We wound up with a west-facing room on the 30th floor that not only towered over all nearby buildings, but also offered a terrific side view of the newly-lit Christmas Tree on Union Square...and more than one gorgeous sunset The guestroom and bathroom were fairly standard in decor and size. Furnishings were reasonably tasteful and comfortable, too. The only headscratcher was one floorlamp's wobbly, uneven lampshade. Such an obvious candidate for replacement, it wrongfully lent the room a slightly shabby first impression -- one that fortunately did not last. At the opposite end of the spectrum (in a good way) was the room's absolutely outstanding bed: snowy white, pillow-topped perfection, arranged with a mountain of pillows and an attracitve contemporary-patterned throw. This room's king-sized model appeared to be very new and it was as good if not better than any of the \"heavenly\" beds touted by some of the Hyatt's 4 and 5 star competitors; Slept great! The public areas in the hotel may not be opulent, but they are tasteful. And given the Hyatt's close promimity to so very many San Francisco downtown attractions, its unlikely that you'll be lingering much at the hotel anyway. A nod to the staff: Everyone that we encountered -- from housekeepers in the hall, to the kindly desk help, to the courteous doormen and porters -- was warm, genuine and helpful during our numerous comings and goings to see the city. In all, a very positive experience. If you're looking for a prime hotel location near Union Square with the potential of an outstanding view, the certainty of a comfortable bed, and a friendly staff to welcome you - look no further.

There was virtually no noise from the rooms on either side of us; however, the elevators sounded like someone was rolling large carts on the floor above us (we did quickly get used to the low rumbling). The problem I had was the street noise. We were on the 14th floor on the Stockton Street side and had loud street noise, and very loud construction noise, all night long on all three nights (yes, construction all night!)! I do not know how long the construction will last, or if it the sound is any better in other rooms (It might be a good question when checking in). On the last night, I found that it helped cut down on the street noise by pushing one of the chairs firmly against the center frame of the sliding glass doors. This tightened the seal and, although the construction noise was still pretty loud, the general street noise was less. The bathroom was fine. The only annoyance was that the water temperature in the shower was very difficult to regulate. It constantly went from hot to warm to cool.

I was happy to see that the rooms were indeed like the photos on the Hyatt site and the view was very nice (see photos). Each room has a tiny balcony (which you are not supposed to go out onto for safety reasons) with a sliding glass door. Beds were tall and super comfortable with plenty of pillows and a nice fluffy duvet. Bathroom was average with good counter space for all your hair and face products, ladies. They were a bit skimpy on the amenities, but if you need something other than shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion, just ask housekeeping and they can provide you with what you need. Coffee machine (with complimentary coffee), hair dryer, makeup mirror and small television (which I suppose you can watch while sitting on the john!) also located in the bathroom. Water pressure was decent (a sticky point for me at many hotels). I've read some reports of noise and thin walls, but didn't really experience any problems. However, I DO travel with earplugs, which I highly recommend no matter where you're staying. The hotel is designed so that the central elevator bank is super close to all rooms, so while I could hear a bit of noise from the elevators, it wasn't exactly a ruckus and didn't disturb me in the least. I did find it a bit amusing that I could (faintly) hear the alarm go off in the room next door on my last morning, but that might have been because my neighbor turned it up super super loud. I hadn't heard a peep out of him the entire time up till that point. I can't recommend the restaurants as I didn't eat in any of them or try the room service. Why bother? It's all overpriced anyway, and for half the bill you can just walk a few blocks and find someplace else to eat that'll be much more affordable and enable you to experience San Francisco a bit more. There are also Walgreens, Rite Aids and 7 Elevens everywhere for midnight munchies and bottled water (who wants to pay $3 for a snickers in the minibar?!). Save your cash for other fun things. All in all I had a very pleasant stay and recommend the Hyatt if location was important (shopaholics!) and a good deal could be found. Don't pay rack rate...it's a nice hotel but not THAT nice. :)", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "libbyk", "ReviewID": "UR5226424", "Content": "I had gone to SF a month before this trip and noticed the great location of the Grand Hyatt. Only one block shy of Union Square and the Powell Street cable cars, I planned on booking with the Grand Hyatt for this weekend trip. The staff was very friendly (especially the doormen) and cheery. Although the room was a good size and the bathroom well-stocked, there were a few gliches. First of all, when we arrived, apparently the clean-up staff forgot to check the mini bar, as there were two Chinese food takeout containers in the drawers (obviously left over from the previous guest)...also there was a very distinct odor in the room which was a mix of the Chinese food and very strong body odor. I went to the front desk to complain and ask to get some air freshner and was assured it would be taken care of...I'd love to say is was, but most of the smell was masked by me opening the windows and spritzing my own perfume around when I returned hours later. The final glitch was the noise. We were placed on the 8th floor as the trip needed to be as economical as possible. Until about 1am, I was kept awake by the loud whistles used by the doormen in order to hail cabs. I'm sure had I been higher up this would not have been a problem, but it was a little annoying. Besides that, the Grand Hyatt was great. The beds were very comfortable and the soaps and shower products provided were lovely. However, nothing tops the excellent location of this hotel. It is central to all great parts of the city. Just keep in mind that knowing the areas surrounding are important as only a few blocks away is the Tenderloin district which most travelers should avoid.

This was a very pricey hotel, but given the location and the city, I imagine that's just the way it is. We found no real problems with the room: good size, nice king bed, (but pillows too fat) great view of the city. Pros: great location! 1 block from the shopping and many restaurants. Friendly porters and very nice concierge. Nice fitness equipment. Cons: Don't stay in any room that ends with \"07\". We had 1107 which was at the very end of the hall...and I do mean the END. Walk down the hall, and walk smack dab into the our door...Doesn't sound so bad except that the room doors to the rooms on either side of us were right next to our door. If we had all been trying to get into our rooms, we would have had to draw numbers to see who got to go first! Needless to say, when people came in late and shut their doors, it was very loud. I see since we have returned home, that the website has changed. When we made our reservations, the website said there was a complimentary continental breakfast. Not so. There was a little place on the mezzanine that sold Starbucks coffee. So we went there on the first day. Paid 6.00 for 2 cups of coffee. Everyday after that, I went directly across the street to Starbucks and paid 6.51 for 2 cups of coffee and two breakfast rolls. The rest of the hotel was there too, I might add. There was no spa, no gift shop and the restaurant upstairs was extremely pricey as well, so we didn't eat there. There was a tee tiny coffee pot in the bathroom, but the coffee supplies were in the minibar..and there were no cups suitable for coffee anyway...just water glasses. Even the cheap hotels give travelers a continental breakfast and have complimentary coffee in the rooms. Also, I greatly appreciate the effort that many hotels are now making by asking travelers to use their towels more than one day. But for the price we paid for that room for 6 nights, I want my clean towels daily. Other GOOD things: Cable/Trolley cars only about a block away. Lots of shopping, even if it's just window shopping. Good restaurants. Lori's Diner: 1 block : 50's theme. We ate there twice. Great burgers and breakfast. Mel's Diner: not for sure on the location as our friend took us there the first night, But it had a \"Happy Day's\" type atmostphere and great burger/fries. Max's: 1 block: I had a huge BLT there...and BLT's are always good! They had a varied menu. You shouldn't have any trouble finding something tasty there. Ruth's Chris Steak House: Save your money if you want to eat there! Everything a la carte...but excellent! One of the best steaks I've ever eaten.

It's right in the middle of some great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay with a few little hiccups along the way. The minor issues: 1. The hair dryer in the room was fried and we called the front desk to get a replacement. It never came. We had to call a second time before we got a replacement. The good thing is that at least on the second call we got a response within 15 minutes. 2. We cancelled a wake-up call but they called anyway - twice. My husband was there on a conference and I chose to sleep late one morning but the wake-up call he cancelled came anyway and woke me up at 4:30am. The major issue: My husband was in the room taking a break from his conference and I was in the shower. We had the privacy sign out on the door and the privacy lock engaged. The mini-bar attendant (a man) took the sign off the door and wedged it on the wall behind our room number. He knocked briefly and then tried to come right on in. The lock prevented the door from opening more than 4 inches. Initially I was upset because if the privacy sign is out it generally means you don't want to be disturbed. The second reason I was upset was that if my husband wasn't in the room at the time and I had forgotten to engage the privacy lock, ... fill in the blanks. Since the shower is right next to the hotel door you can clearly hear it outside in the hall. My only assumption is that either the employee was trying to walk in on something or he simply disregards people's privacy. In my opinion I think this is a serious security concern. When we discussed it with a member of management, she seemed concerned and said she'd speak to the staff and security about the incident. What's interesting is that between the first phone call to the manager and the time I left the room an hour later, it happened a second time. I happened to be at the door about to go out and saw him through the peep hole. He removed the privacy sign from the door and wedged it on the wall again and then knocked. At least this time he didn't try to enter our room. Just be aware of this when thinking of booking your room there. The main lesson to learn is to always put the privacy sign out and to engage the privacy lock when you don't want anyone barging in. This could have happened at any hotel room in the world so take this lesson with you anywhere you choose to stay. Now for the fun stuff: Grand Views lounge on the 36th floor is worth the view but you'll get sticker shock when ordering any drinks. A plain martini is $12 and it had too much vermouth in it. I couldn't finish it because it was horrible but you won't go wrong with wine or beer. This is a great place to go for a quick cup of coffee to enjoy the view but there are better places to get a drink. Perry's Downtown: This place makes a great burger and is a good place to go for drinks or a good burger and a beer. It's about 2 1/2 blocks away from the Hyatt. It's a good lunch place and a good casual dinner place and is reasonable on the wallet. Steps of Rome Trattoria: North Beach This is the best Italian food!! I had the Gnocchi alla Serentia and it was fantastic! The place doesn't look like much but the people are friendly and the food is wonderful! Pizza Chicago: Ghiradelli Square Great pizza joint in a casual atmosphere. Reasonable and worth every penny! La Suite: On Brannan near the Bay Bridge Amazing french food!!! It's in a higher price range but the food is awesome! The bar is trendy, the drinks very generous and the staff is friendly. Hawthorn Lane: I'm not sure where it's located but the food and atmosphere were amazing. This is among the highest priced restaurants in the city but if you love good food and excellent service this is the place for you. I had the lobster - mmm mmm! Alcatraz evening tour: Ok, so I'm not into cheezy tourist stuff but I enjoyed this tour. If for nothing else, go for the views of the city. It's a neat piece of history to check out and has incredible views of the city, the Golden Gate, Angel Island and the Bay Bridge. Bring the tripod though, and turn off the flash if you're using a small tourist digital camera for a great shot. Getting around: We only used taxi services to get to and from SFO and to go out to nicer restaurants. The rest of the time we relied on Muni buses and Cable Cars. Make sure you get a good map of the routes and stops first and you'll be prepared to get anywhere. You'll find more tourists on the cable cars and locals on the buses. You'll also find that peak times (especially weekends) will mean full cable cars and longer waits to get on. Presidio and the Golden Gate: You can either drive or take the bus to the Presidio up to the Golden Gate. There are several photo spots to get some great photos so explore further than just the initial upper level and you'll find some really pretty areas. Palace of Fine Arts: The rotunda is really pretty as was the area surrounding it. The marina district was cool but we didn't explore that much.

I gave in b/c we were staying there for the views but was a little upset they didn't have anything for my original room rate. The check in person told me that all floors above the 25th have unobstructed views. Our room overlooked the Coit tower and we could see a little bit of the ocean-breathtaking! Room itself was worn with mirrors in odd places, nice-sized closet and tiny bathroom. TV in bathroom and basic toiletries. You can connect to internet via modem for a charge, but my friend's laptop seemed to detect the wireless for free. Even though our room was next to the vending/ice machine, it was quiet and we got a good night's sleep. We had breakfast upstairs at the Grandviews Restaurant and found out that their continental breakfast is horrible- coffee, orange juice, and choice of 1 bread (bagel, toast, English muffin, danish)- that's it!!! We should've taken up our waiter's offer of using each breakfast certificate toward their buffet ($21) or other made-to-order dishes on the menu ($11 and up). He would've deducted $20 from our order if we didn't go with the continental. Views from the restaurant are amazing. In the end, the location can't be beat: we parked at the Sutter-Stockton garage across the street and paid $14 for parking between 6:30PM and 10:30AM.

Hotel staff, from valets to front desk, were helpful and polite. Especialy impressed with the concierges', who steered us to some great restaurants around downtown. Room was clean and comfortable but small for a four star hotel, and the decor was woefully dated (brown/blue carpet, pink walls, etc.) Bathroom was average in size and lacked amenities. Our sink gurgled up some grainy sand like substance one night. Called the front desk about it and engineering fixed it promptly. The hotel does have several deawbacks, however. First is the valet parking fees. $43.00 per night! having lived in San Francisco I know parking is at a premium but WOW! Our total bill for parking ($300 for the week) was roughly half what it cost to stay the six nights. Outrageous! Problem is there aren't many options nearby. There are two garages within a block of the hotel but their rates vary and you have limited in and out privilages. If it's at all possible, don't bring your car to this hotel. Take advantage of the excellent public transportation. Careful if you book here. Do not pay rack rate or anything near it. This is a very expensive hotel for what you get. Through Priceline we got a $75.00 a night rate and felt with the valet parking fees it was just barely worth the cost. They'll quote $209.00 to above $300.00 per night (plus parking) and this hotel is just not worth it. A few other things, your room will probably \"squeak\", especially in the afternoons. When you check in you are given a small piece of paper with your room keys informing you that because of wind the building sways, resulting in squeaking walls. Believe it! It's particularly annoying in the afternoon. It sounds like you're on an old ship. Avoid Grandviews. The view is extraordinary but the food is blah (and very expensive for what you get) and the service is terrible. They have a nice bar next to the restaurant but the service is just as bad there. We waited 25 minutes for two black and tans and a dirty martini. Business center is sub-par. Staff was very nice and very accomodating but it has a total of one fax machine, one copier and two computers. You get ten minutes free but after that it's $30.00 per hour to use their facilities. Not worth it. There is a Kinko's a few blocks away. One last thing. Several hotels in the downtown area are subject to very loud protests on weekend nights. There is an ongoing labor dispute between the hotels and their service staff, resulting in orderly but noisy demostrations in the afternoons. The police and hotel staff handle themsleves and the situation well, but beware of protestors shoving fliers in your face as you come and go in the evenings. From the 14th floor they are very audible but usually they clear out after dark. Overall a clean, convienent, safe but noisy and expensive stay.

We heard parking is $45 (with tax) and decided to leave our car at friends in Berkeley and take the train in and out of the city. You might want to find a residential neighborhood in the city and leave your car there, and take a taxi to the hotel. The front desk was able to give us a room high in the hotel (it was a handicap-accessible room), so we had awesome views facing Union Square below and the bay in the distance. The location is great although, as someone else pointed out, it's a little challenging to find (it's not quite on Union Square). One incredibly annoying thing was that when our complimentary newspaper was delivered outside our hotel room each morning between 5 and 6 a.m., the person threw it down with a \"WHAP!\", instead of placing it quietly on the ground -- thoroughly startling us and awakening us for the morning. Not good. Also, we could hear people from up and down the hallway, opening and closing doors, engaging in conversation -- don't expect peace and quiet.
