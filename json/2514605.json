We had a very late check-in and had no problems with this process although, my mom had sent me birthday balloons and gifts that were supposed to be in the room when we arrived (the hotel staff assured her they would be delivered to my room) but instead, they were given to me at the front desk. This hotel is located in Korea Town and is very close to Macys, the Empire State Building, and within walking distance to Times Square/Broadway. There are plenty of coffee shops, late-night eateries, souvenir shops, a couple drug stores, and several subway stops around this area. The hotel is located on a very lively street and I felt safe going out at night. For the reasonable price we paid, I was satisfied with the size of our room and the comfort of the memory foam mattress and down feather pillows! The Ipod dock was a nice bonus too. The complimentary breakfast was complete with bagels, toast, pastries, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, and juice. At times, there were not enough tables and seats available and you cannot take food to your room. What I did not like the noisy ice machine right outside our door and I really DID NOT like the slamming doors around us - the hotel management should invest in door levers that allow the doors to close slowly and quietly. Another downside was that we had to wait over 5 minutes a few times for the elevator. The Wi-Fi signal was very weak in our room. I highly recommend the 24 hour Korean BBQ restaurant next door, Wonjo, and the Martinique Cafe around the corner on Broadway. There is a fabulous Cuban restaurant a few blocks north called Havana NYC - great steaks and mojitos!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, DE", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for the $!

My booking was relatively last minute which meant i paid over $220 for one night in what seemed to be a busy week in New York (although the room was booked by my assistant). The main reason for booking it was the location in midtown close to a conference I was attending. When I checked in, I pointed out that I had paid quite a lot for the room as the receptionist said most people pay about $120 per night. I was hoping this might get me a better room but I was wrong. Despite paying a high price they literally put me in the smallest room on the floor (I could see that from the emergency exit map). The room was tiny with you falling on the bed the minute you enter the room. The bathroom had a sliding door as there was not enough room for a swinging door. The bathroom was very outdated and dirty. THe air con was in the window and was way to loud to leave on while sleeping. Overall this is a run down budget hotel with a bunch of completely different sized rooms so you essentially are signing up for a lottery in terms of whether you get an ok sized room or a closet like i got. It is also worth saying that the elevators are also ridiculously slow. The rooms look like they begin on the 10th or 11th floor but the waiting time to go up or down was seriously long. The only redeeming factor for this hotel is the location. Otherwise there are much better hotels in New York if you are paying $200. This is definitely a $100 a night hotel.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cManhattan LaQuinta 32nd St (Awesome Value) Madisen Sq\u201d", "Author": "MarriedMom", "ReviewID": "UR126802353", "Content": "We don't enjoy LQ in many places and were a little apprehensive but this location was fun, and the best deal for the value and Spring break-ish travel dates.

Linens smelled fresh - looked great and were more comfortable than most LQ's. Customer Service: This staff went over board for us and so did management, we LOVED the fact that they kept our bags in a storage room prior to our check in and the afternoon of our check out.

Roof-top view/bar: We aren't into the lounge scene but this was a nice little place to relax and the scene of the Empire State Building was a great photo op and a fun picture to remember the hotel! 32nd Street: Yes, this is right at the beginning of Korean Way but honestly we found it fantastic and safe with most of the community quieting down early and staying peaceful.

Before we chose this hotel we read the reviews. We decided to take a chance on this hotel since most of the reviews were positive. We had a wonderful stay. When we first arrived in the morning our room was not ready. It was very convenient to leave our bags with the concierge for the day. We did the same on the day of checkout. The location of the hotel is two blocks away from Penn station which was very convenient for us. The subway station is also just at the corner. I liked the location of the hotel, I found it easy to get to anywhere we wanted to go. When we arrived back at the hotel to check in I retrieved our bags while my husband got our keys. He announced to me that we were on the eleventh floor. I said to him, oh no I think you should ask for a lower floor, the reviews said how slow the elevators were. Well we kept our room and had no issues with the elevator at all. We had a room in the front of the hotel on the scaffolding side. So yes we had no view but going up to the 14th floor bar to see the view of the Empire State building at night made up for it. Except for the garbage truck that passes every night at around 11:30PM, there really was little noise. We had a room with two queen size beds. I really have no complaints about the room. The truth is we hardly spent anytime in the room so as long as it was clean, we were happy. This was our first time staying in the city. Just being able to come back to our room at some point during the day was a pleasure. The only small complaint I have is that there was no hot water in the evenings to shower. But we learnt the trick of letting the water in the shower and the tap run for a few minutes and then we had hot water. The breakfast in the hotel was very nice and there was quite an assortment to chose from. We ate one night at the Korean restaurant next door, Won Jo. We enjoyed the experience of the Korean BBQ.

The location is excellent in the middle of the garment district. It is so beautiful around Herald Square. If you're interested in shopping, this is where to go.

The negatives: elevators are super-slow for a hotel this size, they need major rennovation there! The rooms facing the street are noisy (wish i listened to the reviews here) especially during the night; at least that's when we were in the room. We were staying on the third floor so there was no view worthwhile and we only saw the bars from the construction work anyway.

We were two couples travelling, we made our booking through booking.com online. The first couple arrived on the 23rd and the reservation was ok.

I slept with 32db ear plugs and no apparent effect on the excessive and constant noise. They should not have been able to rent this room. In the event you find yourself stuck with no other options, switch to a room which does not face the street, or if they are full(my case), move to another hotel(which I did the next day). Additionally, one of the two elevators was not working, which lead to excessive wait times to get to your room or the lobby, typically 3-7 minutes. The internet access did not work, which required calling a third party tech support company, waiting on the phone for 10 minutes to speak to a technician and an additional ten minutes before being able to connect to the internet. The fact that there are no other hotels located on this street should have been the first clue this location was wrong.

This LQ in Manhattan does not meet that standard. Granted, most hotels in NYC are extremely overpriced \u2013 so already the value for what you get versus what you were forced to pay is poor. And granted, many hotels in NYC are in old buildings that have some restrictions in size and quality based on the constraints of the building they are in. However, this hotel still falls very short on the comfort and cleanliness scale, and is definitely not worth the prices they charge. The hotel is listed as a 3-star hotel, but I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s more like a 2-star. The halls of the hotel smelled bad, and were very hot (there was only air conditioning in the lobby, and in the rooms themselves \u2013 but not the hallways of the upper floors or the elevators). The walls of the hallways were painted a sort of 1970\u2019s mint green, which you may or may not like \u2013 I personally thought it made the hotel look old and outdated. The room that I had was extremely small, which I\u2019d say is acceptable in the old buildings of NYC. However, the room felt unclean, and I just felt uncomfortable in it. The carpet seemed old, and strangely, the bathroom door didn\u2019t even have a handle on it. You just had to push it open \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t stay open. I was spring-loaded to close again automatically. Weird, and not to my liking. The shower took literally 4-5 minutes for hot water to come through, and when it finally did, it alternated between freezing cold and scalding hot. Not a pleasant shower experience, obviously. The only channels I could get on the TV were in Korean (this hotel is in Korea town), but if my TV remote would have been working properly, I might have seen other channels in English. Although I appreciated the complimentary internet that was provided throughout the hotel, I had difficulty staying connected to the WiFi signal (this may or may not have been due to my device, I\u2019m unsure), and there was no work desk in my miniature room \u2013 so I had nowhere to actually work, other than sitting on the bed. The bed itself was too squishy, and the bedspread just seemed icky, so that wasn\u2019t a great option for working, either. There were also not enough power outlets. I could only find one that was usable in the bedroom, otherwise, I had to use the one in the bathroom to charge my devices. Again, very odd. Overall, it was not a room I wanted to linger in at all. The complimentary breakfast buffet was mediocre, at best. Not the usual La Quinta fare. I only saw some bagels and yogurt, some bread for toast, some cheap donuts, some cold cereal, and of course coffee, juice and milk. The breakfast room was way too crowded, even at 930am (30 minutes before \u201cclosing\u201d time), and there was no place for overflow. It was an unpleasant eating experience with so many people standing, waiting, and crowded around. On the positive side \u2013 all of the employees I encountered were very nice and pleasant, even the housekeeping staff said hello in the hallways, and the person stocking the breakfast buffet told almost everyone good morning. Also, we had difficulty checking in (the system that electronically renders the card keys for the doors was down). So a maintenance employee had to let us in to each of our rooms individually, and we had to return to the front desk later to get our keys. The front desk staff gave us each a voucher for $13.01 (and odd amount) to be used next door at the Korean restaurant. I\u2019m not sure if this is normal, or if they did this because of the inconvenience we experienced at check-in, but the effort was appreciated. One good thing, which may or may not be related to the hotel itself, is that there is a rooftop bar in this building. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s owned by the La Quinta or if it\u2019s independent, but if you take the elevators to the 14th floor, there is a nice outdoor bar with lovely views of the Empire State Building. Prices were a bit expensive, but it is NYC, after all. Overall, although the location of this hotel is decent (in Mid-town Manhattan, near Times Square), the hotel itself was not to my liking and the value for price paid was too poor, therefore I will not be staying here again.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorktown, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great service\u201d", "Author": "peckli", "ReviewID": "UR114646269", "Content": "My husband & I just came back from NYC.

A couple of months after I made the online reservation my credit card company contacted me to say they were reissuing my credit card as there had been potential fraudulant activity at one of the hotels booked for our trip! I contacted all of the hotels we had reserved and for the La Quinta I had emailed via the website to advise the situation and to ask if I needed to provide the new card number and had an email response which stated no payment was taken at the time of booking so this was not necessary. We had no problems at any of the other 10 accomodations we stayed at in USA. Upon arriving to New York on Tuesday 7th June at 3pm we were told by the man at the desk (Zac - with much sighing and face pulling) that our room reservation had been cancelled because the bank declined my card. He advised that I had been emailed the day before to advise me and to ask for a new credit card. I asked why no one had called me as it was such an urgent matter and he said it was policy to email when the contact given was an international number! The man was rude (as with other posts, wonder if its the same idiot!!) I insisted he called the manager and he made a call infront of me in another language and was pulling faces and laughing during the call... how rude! The manager came and I Insisted he called other hotels to help find a room for us. The manager was inititally fairly unhelpful stating 'it isnt my responsibility to manage your credit cards properly' and when I asked why no one had phoned me he re-iterated that policy is to email when an international number is given. I have never been spoken to in such an unprofessional or unhelpful manner. The reason we cancelled the credit card was because of the lack of card security in USA and someone at one of the hotels we booked had tried to use our card number fraudulantly..... hardly a case of me 'not managing my credirt card'. I explained to the manager that I had contacted La Quinta regarding the card and showed the email response. He stated that it was a generic response and not relevant because La Quinta was just a franchise so whatever reply I got from the website would not apply to all hotels. After me unfortunately losing my temper the manager agreed to find us rooms elsewhere but after a wait we were told that there was in fact one room still available at La Quinta and that one couple would have to stay at a nearby hotel for the first night and that a room was available at La Quinta for the other 2 nights. I initially refused the offer as I did not want to pay a cent to this hotel however, after a quick run around it was apparent we wouldn't get in anywhere else so we accepted. We left my parents at La Quinta and the manager told the doorman to get us a taxi to the other hotel and left. As soon as the manager had the left the doorman told us we should walk as he would not be able to get us a taxi at that time. So... we trecked for about a mile with our cases through Manhattan in a heatwave - charming!! Plus we had the additional cost of a cab the next day back to La Quinta!!! The mystery email which 'Zac' said he had sent the day before actually arrived when I connected to the wifi, in reality it had been sent at 10.30 that morning requesting a new credit card number .... I was on the flight to NYC at that time!! If email had been sent day before I would have been able to pick it up in time to avoid situation!! When we eventually checked in at La Quinta the next day a room was available early for us which was aprreciated. I have visited Manhatten several times so am aware that rooms are expensive/small. The room was indeed small and next to the lift and linen cupboard so quite noisy. Toilet was blocked but this was repaired quickly following complaint. Breakfast offering was poor (vile coffee, watered down orange) and the breakfast room is too small for the amount of guests resulting in a crowded waiting room atmosphere with people eating in lobby & lifts even!!

As everyone says, great location! Walking distance to Penn Station, Times Square, and The Empire State Building (which is literally right behind the hotel). We took buses and trains uptown and caught them about one block away. It's easy to flag a taxi going uptown or downtown on 5th or 6th Avenues. Plentiful ethnic (mostly Korean/other Asian) restaurants, even a well-stocked Korean grocery two doors down, great-looking deli on the corner and CVS, Chase Bank, Macy's all within a block or two. We had a non-smoking room with 2 queen beds. It was $225/night plus taxes, but with a 10% AARP discount the base price was $202.49 per night (plus $33.37 in taxes). Tip: the AARP discount is 10% while the AAA or senior citizen discount is just 5%. We got there before noon and the room wasn't ready (check-in is 3 PM) but they kindly gave us a room immediately when I told them my elderly mother would be resting in the lobby until it was ready. The room wasn't big but it wasn't tiny either. There was room for 2 chairs and a desk; Nice big flat screen TV with lots of channels; A room safe that locks and unlocks just by swiping a credit card. Seems like people either love or hate the foam Tempurpedic mattress the hotel uses. You sink into the foam and that makes it a little hard to move around or roll over, etc. While my mother didn't like it at all, I slept well and happy to wake up without a back-ache. No bedbugs! The room was very clean, and every day it was made up impeccably. On the 8th floor it was quiet. But we had no view except the windows of the next-door building's offices around a central \"well\". I could just barely see a sliver of sky. Maybe that's why it was quiet - we didn't face the street. The breakfast is really good! I don't understand the complaints on TripAdvisor about mediocre carb-fests and fast-food fare - which is what I was expecting from the reviews. If you want you can have a quite healthful breakfast: oatmeal, real orange juice, bananas, apples and pears, non-sugared cereal, whole-wheat toast, hot hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, low fat milk, tea and coffee. There's also an assortment of (Noah's?) bagels & cream cheese. There's cinnamon buns, donuts, Frosted Flakes, etc. if you like a sweeter breakfast. You can really have a substantial and good breakfast - and it's free! The staff tending to the breakfast area was fantastic - working continuously to refill items so nothing ever ran out. They were constantly cleaning up, keeping the area running smoothly - just excellent, hardworking staff. I was impressed when I saw the guy remove a bowl of bananas which had begun to speckle (just a tad too ripe) and replaced them with perfect yellow bananas. The apples were crisp and juicy. We luckily never had to wait for a table but you may have to wait a few minutes on occasion, especially on the weekend. Loved the free internet and printer access - there were 3 computers. There's also an exercise room with a flat-screen TV. A few things could be improved: - The water in the shower and sink never got really hot. We had to let the water run a very long time before it got warm. If we waited long enough, we finally got hot-ish water. - The air-conditioner cooled the room down but not as cool as I like. Also the vent faced straight up, not out into the room and the air got caught behind the curtain which billowed out. I had to rig the curtain so it wouldn't trap the cool air behind it. - The room is a bit dark because of lack of sunlight. La Quinta offers shuttle service to JFK, La Guardia and Newark airports through a third-party at the concierge office in the lobby. We booked the shuttle ($63 for 3 people to Newark). Very convenient and quick but I cannot recommend them because the van was not safe. My mom's seatbelt was missing but luckily our hotel was the first stop so she could move to the back row where she found one. The unfortunate people we picked up at other hotels had to go without. Also the shock absorbers were terrible. The driver was friendly and a safe and sane driver - in contrast to some crazy taxi drivers! When I expressed surprise that the company (Apple Commuter) would send out a van with missing seatbelts, he said \"Yeah, the van is junk.\" It would be nice if La Quinta associated with a better quality shuttle service.

It's one block from the Empire State Building in the Koreatown section of Manhattan. Macy's is about 3 blocks away. Even though it's not a main thoroughfare, taxis pass by very often. The rooms are small, as expected in Manhattan. Very quiet. The bed... foam. I HATED it. Personal preference, but I don't know why anyone would like sleeping on a foam bed. I don't like soft beds and this was 10x worse. The shower - took FOREVER to heat up. This was at 3am, so it wasn't a matter of sharing water with anyone else. Once it did heat up, the temperature range was good. Pressure not too bad, either. They have flat screen TV's and even better, the alarm clocks are iPod docks. Cordless phones - 2 in the room which seemed kind of pointless, considering the size of the room. It's an older building, so the elevators are fairly slow. With 14 floors, expect a longer than usual wait for the elevators. I found it easier to walk down 8 flights of stairs rather than wait for the elevator. Free wireless internet - a definite bonus, especially in Manhattan I'm guessing. There is a 24 hour CVS less than a half-block away, so if you forget anything, you are covered. The benefits outweigh the crummy bed, so I would recommend this hotel.

Finally someone other than the management at La Quinta Manhattan will read this. Nobody there cares enough to even respond. The answer? Never. Neither should you... In fact, with no apology or compensation for the events of last week, I will make it my mission to go out of my way to warn others that the management at this location needs to go. We have never been treated in such a dishonest fashion, and been met with such arrogance as from the La Quinta Manhattan's manager. The rest of the staff are very nice. And they quite obviously detest this man as well. The hotel was emailed ahead of our arrival to inform them that packages that would be arriving at the hotel prior to our arrival; packages that were clearly explained to be of an urgent nature, as they were needed for a tradeshow setup at the Javits Center on the morning of our arrival. This has never been a problem in the past at this hotel. We had stayed here many times. In fact, it has never been a problem at any hotel that we have ever stayed in. After clearly indicating via email that this was against their new policy, but that they would make an exception in this case of not accepting packages until the guest is checked into the hotel, the hotel manager went ahead and refused our deliveries from UPS regardless. I would be pleased to show you their emails in order to prove these statements to you. Instead of an apology and/or some effort to compensate for the fact that they had done this after promising not to...... they made a pathetic attempt to use my email response, which thanked them and advised that I would ask my shipper to TRY for a Wednesday delivery, (the day of arrival) as their excuse for refusing my packages, when they arrived the day before. Our tradeshow materials arrived back at my Chicago office the night before the trip to NEW YORK, forcing us to take them onto the airplane as excess baggage, at an extra cost to us of $200. Our tables could not be re-delivered in time, forcing us to waste half of the day of our arrival shopping for new ones, while we were supposed to be setting up our booth. new tables; another $66.00. Add in the UPS $100 in shipping costs after LaQuinta Manhattan's refusal to accept them. Not UPS's fault at all! But here's the kicker. Nobody at Apple Core Hotels has seen fit to even respond to our complaint. I spend an average of 100 nights per year in hotels, and this would be the first complaint that I have ever lodged...

I have noticed improvements in the breakfast. During my most recent stay, the usual La Quinta fare of bagels and cereal was supplemented by fresh pastries. The breakfast room was spotless and well cared for. While other hotels have more elaborate breakfasts, the price of this one, namely free, can't be beat. My room this time was a \"queen\" on the 10th floor. It was small but adequate for 1 person (or two compatible people) and was spotless. It was also quiet-no noise from the street of from adjacent rooms. The heater was a bit noisy when it came on but this did not bother me. The hallways were generally clean and well lit, although I did find a cigarette butt on the floor in the morning.

Our requirements were 2-beds, in a location that was close to all the major areas of NY for under $250. We were only staying for a night, so we really only needed a place to lay our heads. This was our first trip to NY, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews at Tripadvisor and Yelp were really helpful, so I felt like I should contribute as well...thanks to all! First off, let me address the other reviews that complained about the \"stink\"...EVERY block in downtown NY stinks. It has nothing to do with this location being K-Town. There are strange smells emanating from every subway vent, alley and vagrant in all of downtown Manhattan...K-Town is no different. These people probably never even set foot in the subway. If you're worried about the smell, don't visit NY. The stench you find in the countryside when the farmers are spreading manure is waaaay more horrible and it's a constant barrage on your nose for weeks. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION...The location itself - very convenient. There is a subway station right on the block. You're within walking distance of several attractions and anywhere else, you can take the subway. There is a parking garage on the same block that La Quinta validates for...$26 per day. Pro Tip: If you're a newbie to NY subways like us, take along a NY map that includes the subway and educate yourself. It's a bit complex, but once you figured it out, you can take the subway anywhere and get there in no time. K-Town, where the hotel is located was safe enough for us. Most of the people that frequent this area are college age Korean kids and are much more well behaved than anything I've seen in any college town. There are police EVERYWHERE here, so atleast you can have some comfort in that. NY is still, NY, so take the proper precautions. The rooms are clean. I've stayed in some nicer hotels (business related travel) and I'd rate the rooms up there with them. We had a 2 Queen room and it's HUGE compared to the King room that my brother stayed in. The price is the same, so if you want a little more space, get a 2 Queen room. The beds were really comfy...with \"memory foam\" mattresses. I really want one of these beds now that I've actually slept in one. I mentioned that the area was \"safe\", but we did have some strange activity in the hotel. There were several undercover cops (supposedly) searching the hotel for someone. We have no idea why. An officer knocked on my brother's door (which was open) and told him to keep it closed. Also, in the afternoon I smelled something nasty coming from the stairwells...I thought maybe someone went to the bathroom and the smell was coming out of their room. However, later on that night my brother and I walked up to the 14th to go to the bar and we find a HUGE pile of feces at the top of the steps on the 11th or 12th floor. It was pretty disturbing...even more disturbing is that it had been there for several hours. Either no one reported or no one bothered to clean it up. Ok ok, I didn't report it either, but it was late and I wanted to check out the bar scene...and mind you, this pile of crap had been laying there since sometime in the afternoon and it was after 10p when we discovered it. Someone HAD to have reported it by then...especially the people who stayed near that stairwell (I smelled it from 2 floors down!) and if not why isn't their any hotel personnel checking the hallways? For some people, this is all it would take to get a horrible score, but I'm pretty laid back so, it was only a minor blemish. It made for a good story to tell my friends when we got home though. The 14th floor bar is both a pro and a con. It's a nice little rooftop bar that has a cool view of the Empire state building (pro). It's a pretty popular place, but what struck me as strange is that I was expecting a bunch of koreans here and instead, I felt like I was in an Irish pub at State College. However, since it's so popular, you get a crap load of traffic coming in and out of the hotel. Which means that the elevators...small and slow moving elevators...are always packed (con)...reviews about the elevators are spot on. Also, like I said earlier, there doesn't appear to be any security in the building, so someone gets plastered and decides to poop on the floor, it'll probably go unchecked (con). I never felt that I was ever in any danger, but just be wary. The front desk clerks were pretty indifferent. They answered my questions that I had and reactivated room a key that went dead. So they did their job. If you're coming here expecting them to be bubbly and giddy to see you, you're not going to get that. This is true for most of NYC in general...people just aren't as friendly as they are in say, Lancaster, PA. Which is fine by me. By the way, the one asian (korean?) girl that works in the little shop there is a cutey! At about $250 (after taxes), you're not going to get much better than this hotel in Manhattan. It's still expensive...but comparable to staying in any major city or beach hotel.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad for the price\u201d", "Author": "Rachel85_10", "ReviewID": "UR73774969", "Content": "Your day starts with B,fast.On the website they have boiled eggs,cappaccino,hot cereal.pastries,waffle-Nothing of this kind was there.B,fast attendant with a headgear & Big smile did help to keep my cool.I came back after B,fast hours but was still allowed a cup of coffee and a banana.

However when I checked the LQ.com site at the behest of my wife the same room was available for $129 which is a screaming buy in my opinion. I was very disappointed to learn though that the only rooms available were smoking rooms (I didn't know those still existed) and that the only thing the hotel could do was spray it. The spray lasted about 30 minutes then it smelled like smoke again. My wife bought a can of Febreeze which she used liberally in an effort t fend off the stink. Despite knowing that I wanted a non-smoking room the hotel did nothing to help find a non-smoking room the next day.

I have been telling all of our friends about our great find-from the excellent, convenient location to the surprising large size of our room, to the comfort of a great mattress and feather pillows, to the graciousness and helffullness of the staff to the greatest surprise of a rooftop inside/outside bar with an outstanding view of the city at night-it was the best. We have nothing but praise for this hotel-the affordability is simply a plus. You are compromising nothing and simply adding to your New York experience by staying at this hotel.

I picked this hotel because it was close to Penn Station and from the reviews I read on this site. I was a little nervous about the neighborhood, but the location won me over. The hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and updated. We saved a lot of money on breakfast because of their ample free breakfast. I read that the elevator was slow, but we didn't have any problems with it. The only complaint was that the bar on the roof was always closed when we got back to the hotel. We stayed out late, and would have liked to see the view from up there, but never made it. We never felt in any danger from the neighborhood, but the smells can be a little overpowering at times, but once in the hotel, it was okay. We requested the back of the hotel and were told we could have a room in the back, but they gave us one on the 8th floor in the front, and we could hear police cars, garbage trucks etc. in the morning and at night, but we were usually so exhausted, we didn't hear anything once we were asleep. There was a subway down the street from the hotel which was convenient. I would reccomend this hotel to everyone and I would definitely stay there again. One other thing I would like to mention, is that they have a bag check for guests, which really helped. We checked out on a Thursday morning, but our train didn't leave till 3 a.m. The hotel let us check our bags (9 bags) until midnight and then called a cab for us and helped us load them into the cab.

Everyone, I mean everyone, was friendly and down right fun to see. I didn't get to meet Victor (manager), and I will correct that shortcoming the next time. I have only one sad point, and it is *not* a La Quinta issue. Due to other factors, I did not bring a laptop. I used the business center computers (Windows XP). Yes, I checked and they use a managed security system. No, it didn't help. I was busy the entire trip, on my departure, I checked my paypal account. Before I could get to JFK, PayPal suspended my account due to unusual behavior. Within 1 hour of using the business center, the cyber-mafia attempted to drain my PayPal, and everything was locked down by PayPal (Thank you PayPal). Again, I CANNOT blame La Quinta. This is more a reflection and alert of the level of cyber-crime. I foolishly thought the 3rd party security would protect me. Clearly the computer has a keystroke logger installed. Since this can happen by anyone visiting a website these days, how can you blame the property? This is only a warning about using unknown computers. Most La Quinta's are well run.

The second room 1012 was larger than the first which was 1114. In the first room you could not pull the chair out from under the desk as there just was no room between the desk and bed. The second room had plenty of space. Both had a window to the street - but not much of a view - just looking at the building across the way. Next time I'll ask for a room at the back of the hotel - as other travelers mentioned the street is loud all night. Everyone honks and you can hear all the trucks.

Hot water did take longer in the second room than the first. Towels are on the thin side. Overall very clean bathroom. My room did have a closet and also has iron and ironing board. Flat screen TV. Coffeemaker in room. (friends staying in the New Yorker did NOT get coffee maker in their room) Breakfast was great, staff is there making sure everything stays stocked as it was very busy. Apples and banannas, yogurt in a fridge, cereal, bagels and donuts. The staff was very good. I was able to check in at 10:30 AM even though check in time is not until 3 pm.

The check out was also efficient and without any surprises in terms of delays or added costs. The room, while a bit on the small size was clean and quite ample for 1 person (or perhaps 2 compatible individuals). There was a nice flat screen TV in the room. The bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, with no noise from either the street or other rooms. so I slept well. The internet, while a bit slow, was free and basically worked well. There was a very cozy bar on the top floor with reasonably priced drinks (for New York), a nice outdoor patio (covered with snow when I was there, but still accessible) and a friendly staff clientele. Saying this, you would not confuse this hotel with the Ritz. The wallpaper and carpets had seen better days, and the water in the shower did not get past lukewarm.

I found the hotel itself to be adequate in fact quite good, however the front desk clerk with whom I originally checked in with is absolutely the worst person in the hospitality business that I have ever come across. I have traveled extensively both for business and pleasure and have never met such a rude, unhelpful and uncooperative person that works in the \"hospitality\" business. After originally departing from Oregon, our flight was delayed for 2 hours in Denver due to weather at which time I called the LaQuinta Manhattan directly to let them know that we were going to be checking in very late, possibly early in the morning. Once we finally got on the aircraft we had another 2 hour delay while sitting on the tarmac due to mechanical problems, so again I called LaQuinta (while on the plane) to let them know we would be delayed even further. Both times I called I was assured by the front desk clerk that it would be no problem and that they would hold our reservation (which was guaranteed with a credit card) and then I was further transferred to the reservation desk so that they could make a note of it. My daughter and I were originally supposed to arrive at the hotel about 11 pm, however with the airline delays, we didn't arrive until 5 am. To my horror, when I got to the reservation desk, \"R\" said she had no reservation under my name! I even provided my paperwork for my online reservation and she insisted that my reservation was cancelled due to a \"no show.\" However, she stated that she could still provide me with a room, but it would be at a much higher rate!! Then, even though I told her that I called twice and was told that it would be held, she would not budge and was extremely rude. I then insisted that she call the reservation number to verify my reservation since I had been assured that my reservation would be held. However instead of handling the problem herself, she told me to call the Applecore reservation line myself using the house phone. I did so and reached Debbie, a customer service rep. who thankfully ended up being an advocate. She apologized for the mix-up and said that she still showed a reservation for me and did not understand why \"R\" would not have the same reservation. She asked to speak with \"R\" who proceeded to argue with Debbie over the phone, and would not check us into our room until Debbie actually faxed over a copy of our reservation!!!!! Almost 45 minutes later (close to 6 am) we were finally checked into our room!! This was our first visit to New York and we had heard that New Yorkers could be rude, however I think it's pretty sad if the worst experience of our stay was with the front desk clerk of the hotel whom we stayed with for 8 nights, and by someone who is supposed to in the hospitality business!!! PS. Like in a previous review, I also wondered how the complimentary breakfast was monitored since anyone could basically walk in off the street into the breakfast room. It was usually packed and I wondered if everyone was actually a guest at the hotel. I think they should require room cards for entry into the breakfast room and the business center. A time limit for computer use in the business center would also be good. On the night that I wanted to print my boarding pass, a couple of teenagers were on \"myspace\" for hours... I finally had to ask to use a computer.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Great NYC Value!\u201d", "Author": "sneilen", "ReviewID": "UR32685748", "Content": "My 10 year old daughter and I spent 3 nights at the La Quinta Manhattan and were pleasantly surprised with the experience.

When I returned check-in was fast and friendly, with the clerk saving me another ten percent by inquiring if I have an Auto Club membership. So remember to show your card and save a few more dollars. My 6th floor room, even though it was across from the ice machine, was very quiet. The queen-sized bed was incredibly comfortable - my next mattress will definitely be memory foam. Everything was spotless. The AC worked well on a hot day, the water pressure was amazing, and the bathroom was a nice size for NYC. One complaint, though, was the placement of the toilet right next to the sink. While it was great to find a bathroom sink in NYC that actually had a counter top (most are pedastal sinks, with no room to place your toiletries), someone didn't do their measuring, because the end of the countertop jabs you in the ribs while you're trying to do your business. I am not an overly large female, so I can't imagine how a large man or any overweight person would fare. Other than that, I was pleased with the room. Didn't partake in the continental breakfast, so I can't comment on that, but we did check out the rooftop bar, which was very busy on a Saturday night. The view of the Empire State Building is indeed great, but if you don't like cigarette smoke this might not be the place for you, since smoking was allowed and, at least that night, was very heavy.

As former NYC-ers, we were familiar with the city and just needed a place for the night that was inexpensive (by NYC hotel standards!) and within walking distance to the theatre district. Although the neighborhood this hotel is located in is not one I'd spend much time in (no character), it's close enough to the theatre district that it didn't matter. Rather than book online after seeing the nice reviews here on tripadvisor, I called the hotel to inquire about a non-smoking room w/ 2 queens. They gave me the room at the same price as the single NS queen room. The beds were VERY comfortable! And the room was surprisingly spacious for NYC. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We easily stored our luggage so we could walk about the city. My only criticism of my stay would be the \"complimentary\" breakfast (they can call it complimentary but it's always figured into the price you pay). The breakfast area was overcrowded (possibly due to the holiday weekend). The location of items made it difficult to reach certain things. For example, the coffee and juice located in the corner - everyone crowded around those two items making it almost impossible to reach any other item located on either side. I would suggest locating drinks at the end or in another area altogether. Also, many items ran out at about 9AM and were not replenished (i.e. bananas). Having only one coffee spigot meant that it was hard to get one cup of coffee let alone a refill. And the quality could barely be considered \"coffee\" it was soooooo weak!

This is our 4th year in a row staying in this hotel. As a group of girls on a weekend shopping trip it fits the bill perfectly. We have stayed in many different rooms over the years and each time have found them sufficient for our needs. Having stayed in two other hotels locally the rooms in manhattan for this price are generally small but the rooms at La Quinta are well equiped and clean. The staff at reception are always polite and helpful and on one occassion when my mobile phone charger didnt work they searched until they found me one that was compatible to my phone for me to use for the duration of my stay. This year on our annual visit when we arrived the room we were given only had one bed and was very small. When we returned to reception to explain that we had booked a room with two beds we were told that there had been a problem with the online booking system but it was since sorted. We had booked the room through a website rather than with the hotel directly which we normally do, so perhaps this was partly the problem. The manager on duty that dealt with us was called Victor and was most pleasant and professional. He told that there was no other room available that night but they could offer us another room and promptly took us to the 14th floor. The room we were given was what they called the penthouse! Although it still had just one bed they promptly offered to set up another bed for us. The room in New York standards was huge. It had a very large bed with ample space for a second twin bed and a sofa/table and chairs. The bathroom had a large double walk in shower, jacuzzi and double washand basins, although the room is quiet outdated and the drawer units had the knobs missed on two drawers it was perfect for girls who have a lot of suitcases! The downside of this room is that it is located right next door to the bar, which is open till 1am. However as we never planned on being in bed before that hour it didnt effect us in any way. One night we were in the room before the bar closed and it was very noisy so I doubt that you would get any sleep before the 1am closing time, but if you come all the way to New York they why would you want to be in bed early in a city that never sleeps?! Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is again totally acceptable. Throughout our stay Victor enquired as to how we were enjoying our trip and if the room was satisfactory. We were never charged anything extra for the upgrade which was greatly appreciated. We have recommended this hotel to many people who have also stayed and all commented on its cleanliness and location. It is only a short stroll from Penn Station and most importantly Macys! There are also some lovely places to eat nearby to suit all tastes. While the rooms are generally on the small size they are no smaller than other hotels in this location and represent good value for money. The hotel also offer a shuttle bus to and from the airport which is a lot cheaper than getting a taxi.

The reason I'm giving this a terrible review is the fact that they screwed up our room not once, but four times when we arrived. That alone is unacceptable. The guy at the front desk didn't do anything to accommodate us, neither did the manager. Here's what happened. My friend and I arrived just after midnight Saturday morning. We were guaranteed a late check in so we figured we'd have no problem upon arrival. Haha that's funny. We arrive and they tell us there's a problem with our room so they upgraded us to a bigger room...what they didn't tell us that it had one bed (we clearly said we wanted two beds) and it was next to the bar. Um...first of all, my friend was sick, second of all, we actually wanted to sleep. So we go back downstairs and request another room. The guy up front says no problem. We get to this room and we unlock the door only to find LUGGAGE AND PEOPLE in it already. The TV was blaring and everything. Luckily, there weren't people in there doing things half naked or something that could've been embarrassing. So we go downstairs with our luggage again. The guy tries to fix the situation but this time he puts us in a smoking room that was so tiny, a rollaway couldn't fit in there! This time, we're pretty annoyed, tired, cranky and pissed off. So we go downstairs again in the slow as molasses elevator and explain to the guy we want a comp room because a) they screwed it up so many times b) we didn't technically stay for \"Friday\" and c) they never really fixed the situation because it was almost two o'clock in the morning by the time we got a decent room. All we got was the runaround from the moment we checked in. We have the guy call his manager because there wasn't one on duty, he tried to find us another room at one of their other Apple Core Hotels because that's what good management does. They usually offer to pay the fee for the night and put you up somewhere else. Not this place. We had the option of a) having them WALK US to another hotel at 2 effin' AM in NYC and taking a small fee off our bill b) finding us another room giving us our regular AAA discount plus $50. We settled for another room with a roll away with the plan b arrangement. They finally got us to our room, but it still wasn't worth the trouble. I'm definitely sending a letter to the CEO to at least get a comp room for that first night. It made the start of our trip lousy...At least we finally got the room we requested for the rest of our stay because they really would've heard from us again. And trust me, it takes a lot to piss us off. The continental breakfast is OK but nothing special and neither are the rooms.

There I had the most wonderful stay. I told a friend about it and because of that he stayed at the La Quinta in Santa Rosa New Mexico and had a very pleasant stay as well. Those experiences moved the La Quinta chain clearly up on our lists of hotel-preferences. That's also why I booked the La Quinta again in Manhattan. Accessibility. The hotel is very close to a number of subway stations, which makes it very accessible. Room: I had a room with a queen-size bed. The room was about 5 x 5 meters, which I consider the minimum. I come from Europe where hotel-rooms are often smaller. If this is the minimum for me, then I expect it to be too small for most Americans. The bathroom was 3 x 1.5 meters, which I found too small. The room had one window only and it was situated in a corner of the room. This made the room dark and I find dark rooms unpleasant. I always had to have a lamp on. Gym: The gym had a number of cardio machines. I had hoped for weight- lifting material but those weren't there. Internet: There's wireless Internet in the hotel, but that only worked good enough in the lobby. In the room I would sometimes have normal Internet connection, then it would disappear (while I didn't change a thing), and after a while the connection would be back. That way you can't really work on the Internet. Going to the lobby and work on the Internet there should be an alternative, but there's often a draft because people are constantly going in and out of the lobby. The televisions with the news channels in the lobby disturb you while working on your notebook. If the televisions are off there's guitar music playing constantly, which can be a distraction. It's the same song playing over and over again, which makes the distraction worse. Therefore, going on the Internet in the lobby isn't an opton either. Surroundings: The nearest subway station was at the corner of the block, really close-by, which was very nice. There are lots of Korean good restaurants in the area. If you like shopping (LOL, which I don't :-) ), then Macy's is two blocks away, and Manhattan Mall is one block away. Reception: When I checked in the receptionist was unfriendly. Even though I had paid the total bill for my entire stay of 6 nights in cash at arrival, the receptionist still wouldn't accept an international driver's license as an ID, although it met all the requirements he mentioned. While at reception (!) he actually made me go through my luggage to find my passport, even though I had told him several times that I didn't know where I had put it. Although I travel a lot, this had never ever been an issue before (not even in the La Quintain in Los Angeles). He even had the guts to say that he wasn't obliged to let me into the hotel if I didn't show a passport. When I had half of my suitcase unpacked (in order to search for my passport), he complained about the contents of my suitcase being displayed in public, while it was him in the first place who had demanded me to do so. To be frank, I think that this man should find another job. Housekeeping: The personnell that cleaned my room were clearly different. They were nice and helpful. My compliments to them. Conclusion : Would I go there again? Don't hold your breath for it. The current experience moved the La Quinta OFF my list of hotel-preferences. Before submitting this review I sent it to the La Quinta main office in Irving, Texas in February this year to give them an opportunity to correct the situation, but there was no reply whatsoever. About me: I am a male in his fourties from Europe. I travel several times a year and often to the United States. In 2007 I stayed in least in 8 different hotels.

We reported this to the front desk and they kept passing the buck saying it would be on in half hour. It was off till around half 10 at night. We couldnt shower, use the bathroom or make a cup of coffee in this time. The staff really didnt care. We were checking out on the Monday morning and asked to speak to the manager at around 9am. We were told he was in the hotel but they didnt know where he was. This went on until half 11 and we had been down 5 times!!!!

He told us to take the matter up with the la Quinta chain which I have done but they have since ignored my email The hotel also has a friendly note in the room saying ask about our late checkout which we asked about and considering on average we had paid about $250 per night they were going to charge us $315 to use the room for an extra 4 hours. We didn\u2019t take them up on this. On getting our final bill which was minus $30 we noticed that we had been charged 3 different sets of fees and taxes per night. When asked what the Javits convention fee was the receptionist could only tell me that it was a government charge then she later mentioned it was a charge for our keys?? but on researching this cannot find anything to say that this is a compulsory charge. Therefore they added on $1.50 per night on top of the sales tax and occupancy tax.

Pro: The hotel was close to many points of interest which was nice (Empire State Building, Penn Station, Subway , Macys, etc). I didn\u2019t have a great view from my window but you can see part of the Empire State Building. Con: Front desk staff was rude when I checked in. NOTE: Make sure you show your AAA card when checking in, if you booked using your membership. I forgot to and the front desk gave me a story about how foreigners book using AAA rates not knowing what it is, therefore the customer must show the card when checking in. I guess I was lucky in DC because they gave me the AAA rates without showing them my card (Doubletree Hotel Washington DC - nice hotel). It wasn\u2019t too much of a rate difference and the regular rate was charged for only one day since I realized it, so more or less it was the principle of the fact.

We booked direct with the hotel and were able to take advantage of reciprocal membership of the AAA car association which provided us with an additional discount.The room was clean, everything worked and the bathroom was spotless. We were spoilt for television choices with over 40 channels to select from. As previous reviewers have commented the lifts are slow but that is only a minor flaw. The breakfast room was well patronised and a good breakfast had each day. The only down side to our room was its location near the ice machine which are on just some floors and why people would want ice in the early hours of the morning beats me, but it will wake you up if you are near it. Plenty of Korean places to eat out in near the hotel but beware US plate sizes are much larger than in Australia and you may not need to order as much as you would if back home.

The reception area is small and has a few loungers next to the lift and the small shop - it makes it feel like a friendly place to stay, and indeed the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

The room itself was basic - a double bed, tv, coffee machine, hair dryer etc. The bathroom appeared to have been updated recently and all in all was a comfortable place to sleep - which after all is all you need in a hotel in NYC, the only time we spent there was when we were sleeping! The 14th floor houses the bar which was small but cosy. An excellent idea as you look out at the ESB as you're supping away!

I stayed here six years ago, the last time I was in New York. At that time, it belonged to the best western group and was very nice, so I had no hesitation in booking again for this trip. However on arrival I was extremely shocked and disappointed. Our double room was a quarter the size it had been the last time. O.k hotel rooms are small in manhattan, but I nearly fell over the bed when I opened the door. Two bags and the room was full, there was no space to walk. This however, was not the worst. The room was filthy. The bed clothes were stained, there was a pubic hair on the tiles in the shower, there was dust and dirt everywhere. The room was exceptionally hot and the windows were nailed closed. The air conditioning was on but blew out a hot breeze while sounding like a train. Having been travelling for 20 hours and needing some sleep, we went to reception to request a larger room. We were informed that none were available and that we could be moved the next day. A business man who had been checking in at the same time as us, was checking straight out again. It was late so I put on my insect repellent, laid my coat out on the bed and tried to get some sleep. It was very difficult to sleep with the extreme heat and loud noise of the supposed air conditioning, which by the way cannot be turned off. Next morning, exhausted and wheezing from the dust, we went out to find an internet cafe and another hotel. The computers in la quinta were broken!. We booked into the sofitiel (a lovely hotel) and returned to la quinta about 1pm to collect our luggage and check out. When we arrived at our room, the door was wide open and our luggage was gone. Down at reception, after some investigation, it was discovered that the staff had moved our luggage to an upgraded room as we had enquired about it the previous day (at our expense). When we said we wished to check out they gave us a key to the room to get our bags and charged thirty dollars for late check out. I later emailed the apple core group to inform them. I recieved an e mail from the general manager, apologising and stating that this was unusual, however judging by the amount of similar experiences reported on this site, I don't think it's at all unusual.

The only positive that I can mention is the location convenient to Madison Square Garden & the Empire State Building. On the negative side let me enumerate: 1) General The hotel is run down & in serious need of basic maintenance (not to mention renovation). The staff seem to make a valiant attempt to run a proper hotel, in spite of the 'Fawlty Towers' building. The rooms are dingy & have water stains on the walls, although the room I had was quite large by New York hotel standards. Even when you put the 'maid service requested' sign on your door the maid may not bother to clean your room. At one stage I chased the maid, who had not cleaned my room for days, down the corridor just to get some clean towels. 2) Plumbing The plumbing in my room leaked in both the hand basin and the shower. The toilet did not flush properly (in spite of several visits from a surly & overworked maintenance man) - I remained a afraid of using it for the duration of my visit. The shower hot water only worked after a visit from the aforesaid surly maintenance guy. The toilet made weird gurgling & running water noises all day & night, this wsa not ideal for sleeping. 3) TV & \"Free Hi Speed Wireless Internet\" The TV in my room initially did not work requiring a visit from the maintenance guy. Once working for free to air TV I decided to attempt watching a pay per view movie. Unfortunately my optimism was not rewarded - on the pay per view the sound did not work (even though the volume was set to full). I advised the front desk & asked not to be charged for the movie. The wireless internet connection via ethostream is as slow as a dial up connection. I gave up on it & picked up an alternative that was available in the area outside of the hotel. 4) Summary DO NOT stay at this hotel if you have a choice.

The bed was comfy, and our room overlooked the street. The location was ideal -- we could walk almost anywhere within a half hour, and there was a subway stop right at the corner for when we needed it. Penn Station was maybe 2-3 blocks away, which made it very convenient to reach JFK. There are numerous Asian restaurants on the street - we especially enjoyed a delicious Korean barbeque one evening and Vietnamese pho another. Macys and a wide assortment of shops are just a quick walk away, and the Empire State Building is just around the block.

I booked two rooms on-line through the chain\u2019s website and used my AAA membership in order to receive a discount. The discount amounted to $18 per night per room for two nights, or $72. At check in, I was told I could apply my AAA membership to only one of the two rooms; that the other room would be charged the non-AAA rate. In the next breath, the clerk said she would honor the AAA rate for both rooms if anyone else in our group of four had either an AARP membership or another AAA membership. We came up with a second AAA card and all was fine but beware of this policy if you book more than one room at the discounted AAA/AARP rate. I can\u2019t say enough good things about the staff. Every maid, bellman, clerk, server or maintenance person we encountered was polite and accommodating. There was an efficient busyness, but our requests were honored quickly including a toilet repair that was finished no more than 15 minutes after we called the front desk. Our bedroom was clean and so was the bathroom. The bedroom had one queen bed, a writing table, a straight-back work chair, a chest of drawers, cable television and a coffee maker. The room was small, but completely adequate. We requested non-smoking rooms and there was no lingering smell of smoke. The closet was tiny, with about eight wooden hangers, an iron and ironing board. The rooftop bar resembles a backyard or fraternity barbeque and there is an enclosed area for inclement weather. The bar is open from 5 PM until midnight, year round. It\u2019s worth a trip for the view of the Empire State Building, even for non-drinkers. A mixed drink was $5. The hotel is located in the middle of 32nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Few places in Manhattan could be more convenient or more centrally located. There is a subway entrance on the corner of 32nd & Broadway, and we had no problem getting a taxi. The free continental breakfast served coffee, juices, fruit, cold cereals, oatmeal, bagels, muffins, toast and doughnuts. We stowed three bags, as we arrived six hours prior to check-in, and stowed the same three bags for several hours after we checked out. There are two elevators which were neither particularly fast nor slow. Our bill at check out was exactly what we had been told it would be, with no hidden charges. There are four separate taxes in Manhattan on hotel rooms; two are percentage taxes, one is a flat $2 per night tax and the other one is a flat $1.50 per night tax that taken together added a fraction under 16.5% to our room rate. The hotel is in a block filled with Korean restaurants and businesses. Odd for Manhattan, there was no delicatessen on the street but we located one around the corner on W. 33rd Street with the usual deli fare and a breakfast special of a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich and coffee for $2.

Positive: - The location was very good, right in the middle of Manhattan, near great shopping (Macy's) and located close to subway lines. The hotel is located in \"Korean Town\" with a variety of Korean BBQ restaurants nearby. We ate at one of the $9.99 BBQ and sushi buffets on our first night in NYC..a great deal for all you can eat! There is also a small Korean Market a few doors down that you can purchase snacks and water at a reasonable price. - Staff was nice -- the latino maid was helpful and kept our room clean. Also, the staff at the breakfast was very good at keeping the place fairly clean and choices stocked. - The continental breakfast was decent and offered toast, bagels, pastries, cold cereal and oatmeal. There was also bananas and apples, and your usual choice of beverage: coffee, tea, orange juice, and a cocoa beverage (which I really liked). Overall, good for a light fare and getting you going in the morning. - Be sure to check out the rooftop bar at night, which has an excellent view of the Empire State building! We hung out there a couple of times because the view was so spectacular. The bartender was friendly, and the music was great. Negative: -Room was really SMALL. We stayed in an -02 room, and asked for an alternative room, but were told the hotel was booked. Be sure to ask for a larger room - or ask if you can see the room before you sign for it. It will be worth it, even if you have to wait for the room to be ready. The room was also very musty and smelled. I had to was all our travel clothes again because the smell came home with us in our suitcases. One plus was the bathroom, the shower had good pressure, and there was hot water all the time. - The rooms did not look like the room pictured on their website. I think the photo on their site was a suite. When we were at the rooftop bar, we could peek into the window of a neighboring room and saw it looked like the photo. But our room did not resemble it one bit. - I read in an earlier review that someone else had a problem with their room key. We had the same problem, and had to get our keys changed three times because it did not work. The front desk could not explain why. - The elevators were SLOW, I mean really SLOW! There are only 2 elevators to service everyone in the hotel. We took the stairs a couple of times because it was faster. - Our room did not come with wireless accessibility.

I happened to hit a very busy hotel week without advance booking ... almost every room in the city was selling for $299 plus a night.

The best features -- 2-block walk from Penn Station for those arriving from Newark on the airport train, and complimentary wireless access. Everything else was dismal.

The typical NYC small room featured: -windows that would not open (and a view of an old brick wall) -noisy window A/C unit that never cooled the stuffy room -a desk too tiny for anyone to work at -scuzzy old green carpeting (suspect for my sneezing & allergy outbreak) -cheap, thin towels The hotel had two slow elevators and a basement fitness room that smelled of sewage. (There was an odd smell throughout the hotel ... like an unemptied grease trap.) I wasn't brave enough to try the breakfast room. (Starbucks and other options a couple blocks away on 5th Avenue.) There was a crowded rooftop bar which was nice for good weather evenings. Just be sure not to accept a room on the 14th floor where the bar traffic was noisy. The neighborhood?

We had a five-night stay in late October 2005 and witnessed firsthand how terrible the service is. I should preface this review by saying that we have stayed in several NYC hotels in the past, and are past residents of NYC -- we know that not all rooms will have a stellar view, and one might get a room that overlooks an airshaft. Be prepared for this, and remember that many, many people in NYC have apartments with similar views. Also, many, many hotel breakfast rooms use styrofoam plates and, yes, these plates may melt when hot toast is put on them. I mention these things because these are some of the complaints that have been lodged against the La Quinta by other Trip Advisor members. These are things that will occur at any NYC hotel in this price range, and travelers should expect this. Our complaint about the La Quinta is their inattention and indifference to customer service. At times the staff members were unquestionably rude. Examples: We had a plumbing problem that took 2-1/2 days to fix, because the front desk did not communicate at all with the engineer about what the problem really was. They wasted his time and ours. He never came with the right tools, and couldn't even fix it in the end. The housekeeping staff dumped a pile of soaps and shampoos in our room the first day, and never monitored the supply again. The employee running the breakfast room was surly and sometimes downright rude. The coffee/hot water machine was difficult to figure out and there were no instructions. If this employee encountered anyone wondering how to use the machine or having a problem with it, he chastised them in a voice loud enough for everyone in the room to here. On October 24th, we heard him sarcastically ask people that he was \"helping\" with this machine, \"Can't you read English?\" He did this three times! (Many of the guests at the hotel were not native English speakers, but the way the coffee maker worked was not apparent even to those of us who were.) When my husband accidentally spilled some coffee and burned his hand, this employee made rude jokes about the incident as he cleaned up. The man running the gift shop where one could buy tickets for an airport shuttle bus tried to con my husband into making a reservation without revealing what the price was. My husband's first question had been, \"How much is it?\" and this man did everything in his power to get my husband to sign up for the shuttle without answering the question.

Got a good rate through the applecorehotels reservations site. We arrived early, and were told a room was ready, but if we came back later we could get a larger room. We had tickets to a matinee, so we came back at 5:30pm and received a slightly larger room. The room was a smoking room, very smelly, and on the second floor (I had asked for a non-smoking room on a higher floor). The weather was hot and sticky the whole time we were in New York and the AC in the room was blowing air, no cooling. We called about this and maintenance came right away and flushed the system, telling us that it would cool down soon. After 30 minutes, there was no change. We called again and asked if we could be moved. The front desk said the hotel was sold out and they would have maintenance check on it again. After another 30 minutes and no maintenance person, we called applecore to see if they could help us (either move us to another property or get us another room). They said they would see what they could do. We left for dinner and talked to the front desk. They assured us they would get it fixed or move us. When we got back the room was frigid! We didn't dare adjust it the rest of the stay. So not a great impression upon arrival. But at least it was cool. The pros: price ($149 per night), breakfast included (well stocked and adequate quality), free wireless connection (easy and fast), location (access to several subway lines within the block and more just one avenue away) and rooftop lounge (right below the Empire State building). The cons: smoking room was more than Fabreze could handle, interior room had awful dark view (couldn't even tell if sun was out), countertop in bathroom was too long and you could not sit on the toilet without leaning to the side (and I'm not fat!), bed comfort and linens were below par (and I know not to expect much), tub was very slippery (we had to put a wash cloth down for traction), and the maid service was spotty (at different times there was no bath mat, no hand towels, no tissues, etc.). The TV remote would not turn the TV off and the reception varied with each station. I didn't have high expectations, but this was not worth $149 (even in NYC).

For some reason, the NY Times Guide to New York (2005) rates this place very highly, so I decided to try it. I've never been to NYC. They gave me a quiet, no-smoking room like I requested. On the 12th floor. The problems... A/C didn't work, it was on full cool but was actually heating the room. It was 77 degrees in the room when it was 62 outside. I called the front desk. They didn't send the engineer until I called again a couple hours later. He worked on it (drained rusty water out the window!). It worked for about 10 minutes and then it started to heat up again. It obviously needs some sort of overhaul. Of course, the windows are to be left closed! I called them again and again and they weren't really interested. Eventually they gave me a fan and opened a window. That worked pretty well as it cooled off in the city at night. For the rest of my stay I just left the window open. That may not be an option in the summer! The shower head had been taken apart. When I turned on the shower, water went everywhere. I put the shower head back together. Lots of hot water, great shower. The faucet in the sink doesn't drip, it leaks. If you get it just about half way between open and closed it might stop running (weird). The wireless internet did not work, the signal is too weak. As usual for a large city, I was picking up signals from wireless points in adjacent buildings, which evidently don't have free internet. The wireless doesn't work in the lobby either. The front desk has no clue, but you can't expect them to. So I used the \"business center\" in the basement. One thing I heard about this place - it stinks. Boy does it ever! The smell comes from the laundry room in the basement, next to the business center. It's that sour milk smell. With no A/C in the basement, it gets humid and then that smell is almost overpowering. The smell drifts up to the lobby, but isn't as strong. Importantly, the smell does not seem to make its way any further up the hotel. If you just come down to the lobby and leave you might never notice it. But if you need to do some work down at the business center, you might want to bring your own oxygen. The other thing I heard - the elevators. Yes, they are small and old and did break down, causing lines of people waiting to get up. But they fixed it quickly. The staff uses the elevators a lot, laundry baskets and equipment are often hogging them (where's the service elevators?). Watch the step when you get off! No problem with breakfast. They man keeps the place stocked while people swarm in and out. Just the basics. Good bagels. Juice machines spray your feet (stand back). They ought to fix that one toaster - if they would just put on a new handle people could use it. If you don't like the free breakfast, you can walk a half block out to 5th or Broadway and get whatever you want, including 3 or 4 fast food places. Lots of places to eat around there. The business center has some old and worn down PC's and \"chairs\". The internet worked well. A couple times some foreign guests were there surfing porn sites - whatever. They have a nice laser printer. You'll love the keyboard where the space bar doesn't work (trying writing email). It's important to have access to the internet to get tickets and times to events in NY. I downloaded subway schedules and maps. The location is great. It's in \"Korea town\", really \"Korea street\". I arrived via train at Penn Station. I just walked the two blocks to the hotel. Madison Square Garden is next to Penn Station, so this might be a good place to stay if you want to take in an event there. Empire State Building is a block and a half. The subway station is at the end of the block at Broadway and 32nd. Several trains run through there. Including the R and W which will take you down to Battery Park/Wall St/WTC site. The W and N will take you to Queens and the bus to LaGuardia. MTA is doing construction on the subway, so you can sometimes not get back to the 34th St station on weekends. You can also pick up those double decker tour bus at the Empire State (for tourists). Overall I had a good vacation. The hotel issues didn't become big ones. What bothers me is that La Quinta doesn't seem at all interested in keeping the place up. A lot of broken little stuff which indicates a lack of interest. NY isn't cheap, but that doesn't mean that can just let the place fall apart and charge less. Compared to other places in NY, it's cheaper and the location is good. But it might be worth spending the extra $ or so a night to get a place that's kept up. Because if you have some problems, they probably won't fix them.

(Literally)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3016572", "Content": "My parents, my wife and I all stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan just after Christmas of 2004, and I'm sorry to say it was a disaster from the moment we checked in. When we arrived, the parking valet told my parents that their RV had too high a clearance for the hotel parking garage, even though my mother had specifically told the reservations agent that they had an oversized vehicle at the time she booked the reservation, and even though the agent had assured them that this would not be a problem. We ended up having to park in a commercial lot several blocks away, at our own expense. The hotel did not reimburse us for the difference between their standard parking charge and what we had to pay to park outside. Once we checked in, we noticed almost immediately that the hotel stank -- literally. The stairways, which we had no choice but to use frequently because of the slow elevators, reeked of garbage and rotten eggs. The hallways on the guest floors had an ever-present odor of mildew, probably because the maids tended to leave carts filled with dirty linens and sheets out in the halls all day and night. And every morning, the guest rooms smelled of the food being cooked for breakfast in the lobby, which at that hour was so crowded that you had to wait in line for about 45 minutes just for a bagel and coffee. The rooms themselves were average-sized for a discount hotel in Manhattan, which is to say, quite small though not impossibly so. The cable TV mostly worked, once you got used to all the complicated steps amd menus you had to go through just to turn it on. The TV-Internet connection was absolutely worthless, and the hotel staff had no idea about how to operate or fix it. The shower water fluctuated between too hot and too cold for the first five minutes, then turned ice-cold and stayed that way. If two people share a room and take their morning showers back-to-back, the second one can forget about having any warm water at all. The maid service was the worst I've ever encountered in New York. On our second day, the maid did not come to service the room until 4:00 pm, even though we had posted the \"Maid Service Requested\" sign on the door before we went out early that morning. When the maid finally arrived, my wife and I had returned from a day of sightseeing and were attempting to take quick catnap before going out to dinner. When we asked her to come back after 5:00, she brusquely told us that her shift was over at 5:00, and that if we wanted the room cleaned at all, it had to be right that instant. I had to complain to the hotel manager to get them to send a maid after 5:00, and even then, it was done grudgingly. Even my wife, who always makes it a point to tip hotel maids generously, had no problem with not leaving one in this instance. On the plus side, the hotel is centrally located, just a few blocks from the Empire State Building, Herald Square, and Penn Station. The neighborhood is decent, and the price was inexpensive by Manhattan standards. There are a fair number of restaurants nearby, though most of the really good ones are either uptown or below 14th Street. But none of this made up for the poor service, the snails-paced elevators, and the atrocious smells pervading the hallways and stairways above the lobby. In spite of all of this, I have nothing against the La Quinta chain. Two years ago, my wife and I stayed at a La Quinta in New Orleans -- a city where decent and reasonably priced hotels are almost as hard to find as they are in Manhattan -- and found that one to be excellent. I got the impression that La Quinta bought its NYC hotel recently, and is making an effort to bring it up to their standards.

(Bed was almost up against the walls on both sides, barely enough room to wiggle sideways into the bathroom. TV set was propped on dresser almost directly at foot of the bed.) The room reeked, and I mean stank, sickeningly and unbelievably of cigarette smoke, as if the room had been an unventilated smoking lounge for the last 50 years (we had asked for a non-smoking room). But get this: the bathroom, which smelled even worse (if that were possible) had a swinging door, with no lock and not even a door handle. In fact, there was no latch of any kind. That's right folks. It was a \"swinging door\" such as you would find between the kitchen and dining room in a restaurant. This door was right at the head of the right side of the bed, and the toilet was just inside the door. No privacy in there folks, because the person sitting on the toilet behind this door (that did not even entirely fill out the doorjamb) was about 6 inches from the bed, which was the only place where anyone else in the room could be. Try doing your business under those conditions. Lovely. I immediately complained to the front desk, and I was given the room key to another room to look at.

I had booked the La Quinta simply based on the fact that it was located right downtown and it was the cheapest option available. To be honest, I went in expecting broken bathroom toilets and rude staff. To my extreme surprise (and that of my family) the hotel turned out to be the perfect traveller hotel. Free complimentary breakfast (nice) + clean rooms and the best of all LOCATION. Just a block from the Empire State building and only a stone's throw away from Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station. They also have a fitness center + a business center so pretty much an all in one package. I definitely recommend it ...I know I was apprehensive when I made my reservation, but hopefully this review will help others make their decision.

A good walk from Times Square but never really used taxis. Take comfortable shoes!! Room was a little tight but okay size (doubles). Restroom was good size.

We were looking for budget and found this wonderfully clean, centrally located hotel. And rumors about the front desk were untrue. We booked through Travelocity (not-recommended) and LaQuinta crew helped us sort out Travelocity's mistakes!! The stories about old carpet are true, but the bathrooms are completely marbled and redone, the rooms are clean. Small yes, great value yes!!! Walking distance to everything and the sky bar gets a fabulous view of the Empire State Building, you're in the building's shadow! The hot/cold water pressure was variable, take your shower before 9am!, Otherwise, we were shockingly surprised by the price, clenliness and location, we'd definitely stay there again!!!", "Date": "April 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNightmare!!\u201d", "Author": "HiaRob20", "ReviewID": "UR1833254", "Content": "Ok... while most of the reviews seem good of the hotel, you need to experience it first hand. The front desk staff is fine when you check in, but once you get past them its horrible. First of all, the elevators dont all work. One elevator for the entire hotel. You walk into the hallways, which by the way have a horrible smell to them. You get into your room.. theyre an OK size for a King Size bedroom. Turn on the air and nothing cold comes out. I call the front desk and they tell me the air is central in the hotel and its turned off because its \"going to be cold this weekend\". Mind you, its not THAT cold and if im paying for a room i should be able to turn on the AC without a problem. Then they send someone else to come up and \"fix the air\". The man says to leave it on LOW FAN and it should get colder in 15 minutes. Still NO COLD AIR AT ALL... all a lie... As my guests and I are still drenched in our sweat, I call the front desk staff again and begin to complain about the air and how hot it is in the room. If i wanted to spend the night in a sauna, I would have made a reservation at a gym. But anyways, they tell me that its \"New York law\" that they have AC's off during certain temperatures.. first ive ever heard of this since my AC was working at other hotels when it was snowing. EXCUSES.. EXCUSES.. EXCUSES. NEVER STAY HERE.. its the worst hotel. Youll be colder and more confortable sleeping with the homeless at Penn Station.", "Date": "April 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ossett", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic value place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Stephen111", "ReviewID": "UR1791037", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the La Quninta over the Easter break and had a fantasic time.
