Location : Middle Town near Grand Central Station, from Grand Central Station walk to Hilton Manhattan East Hotel take 7 to 10 mins just a straight way, it's easy and not hard to found. The area there is save, lot of expensive shop, famous building like Empire State Building, New York Public Library around there, and it took 10 to 15 mins or 20 mins walk to Time Square. Taxi driver have no problem to found there. 2. Hotel Lobby : Nice decorated, Free Wifi, have desk for trourist information like map, guide, comfortable sofa, nice desk lady, I had several time at midnight asking question, the Front Desk Manager (men, forgot the name) is really helpful, like asking for help how to make the free wifi working on my Galaxy Note, where to buy cigarette........ 3. Room : a - Room is small and you can say nice. The most important to me is the TV and music player, my one is not Ipod, but the have the clock radio which can put my Galaxy Note to play my own music. TV have not much channel but enough for a tried night when you fell very sleepy, they don't have much movie channel also music channel. The movie Channel is AMC and HBO, movie was old and boring. b - The bed is very comfortable, they have 4 pillow and it's also comfortable, the bed also have a long and big cushion and it occupied my bed a 1/3 portion so I just put it away. c - The bathroom is dated, bath tub have some dirty spot, the amenities like shampoo, conditioner, is not really plenty, and the most weird thing is they don't have hair dryer ~!! On Feb 24 Friday night when I arrrived from Virginia to NYC at 5:30pm, strong wind and crazy rain make me all wet even my hair, and they don't have HAIR DRYER !!! and the room have coffee and tea complimentary but I can't found the water even the water bolier, and there have no mini bar so I need to go to near supermarket at 3am to buy a can of beer! d - When I want to have hair dryer I call front desk and they send me hair dryer and water within 15 mins. At least I don't need to wait a long time with my wet and dirty hair, and I want to sleep very much! e - The view of the room is different from the site I saw. I got a room on 1616 (16/F), left and right side window is facing the back or roof or window of other building, no city view. f - When I asking is there any business center or the place which provide internet service, and they show me the business center but charges is expensive. g - For sleeping, the room is quiet , no noise to disturb you, and there have a nice mirror which stick on the bathroom door so when you close the bathroom door the whole door mirror will be the part of the room's wall. So lucky my bed is not facing the mirror or I can't get in sleep. 4. Awful thing : When I come back at midnight want to go to washroom, I found the washroom at lobby end the toilet bowl is full of pp and lot of tissue, floor is not clean, the whole washroom is very dirty, how can it happen on a Hilton Hotel????!!!!!! 5. Front desk staff : When I want to add one more night on Monday, the lady of front desk help me to check price, she give me a good advise that if book in the front desk they can make it for me without problem but the price is US$199 (not including tax), and the price I booked from Agoda on site is US$169, so she told me book on site if want to get the same price. On the whole the staff of this hotel is friendly and helpful. But some facilities like the lobby washroom is awful, the room should be get everything really before the tourist move in, The bathroom is look very nice little bit older, and the bath tub look not really decent, I think hair dryer is the MUST HAVE ITEM in the bathroom, the advantage of the room is lot of adapter for charging. So I can charge my camera and Galaxy Note. Totally this hotel not bad for the price US$169 from Feb 24 to 26, But now I checked it already turn to US$299. I won't move in for this price.

I hope other floors are wider, as I am not sure how a wheel chair can comfortably fit through. Upon entering our room, 908, an instant odor of urine started to pierce our noses. We called the front desk and they were able to put is in room 925. Both rooms were small, 925 a touch bigger. My $30 roll-away did not come with blankets or a pillow. I just slept in an extra shirt, but wished I called to get one, I was cold when I woke up. We had two angles of views or brick. I value Hilton as a good brand of hotel, and this was definitely not of Hilton Quality. The positive. The bathroom and shower were good, as were the soaps. The staff was nice and helpful. The lobby was nice, not big, but comfortable. $50 to park is cheaper than a lot of other places in mid-town, so to me, that isn't bad for a Manhattan hotel.

Parking is $51/day @ the garage for the hotel...In some states, that is the cost of the hotel room. Oh, and by the way, I also ordered room service. When I called the number, no one answered, so I called the front dest and was told someone would call me right away. I had to call them both back after 20 mins.

Now the pros. 1) This is a great eating part of town. All along 2nd Avenue, especially heading uptown, there are dozens of restaurants. 2) Delis nearby. 3) Grand Central and all of its subway and train connections are 5 minutes walk away (And the best subway lines in NYC, in my opinion... the 4,5,6, and the Times Square Shuttle). 4) The bar has good beer on tap. 5) The bell staff is particularly friendly. 6) The UN is literally around the corner. 7) Times Square is straight away on 42nd Street about 15 minutes walk. And if you are willing to walk, the Empire State Building, Macy's, Broadway shows, Rockefeller, St. Patrick's, MoMA, Central Park, the New York City Public Library building and Bryant Park, 5th Avenue shopping, and a bunch of other stuff are all within about 15-20 minutes walk max. So, it's a good alternative to being right at Times Square (which we've always found tends to suck you into its vortex and keep you from hitting everything else) but still hanging in Midtown. Others we spoke to felt that this was a very good location as well, because the neighborhood is so localized (the locals are the ones in the eateries, delis, bars, etc.). The downside to being in hotels that are closer to Times Square is that the touristy factor increases exponentially with each step toward Broadway and 45th. 8) The WiFi was free. 9) The room, a corner room in our case, was quiet in terms of hotel noise (Manhattan is always noisy so one can blame that on the hotel). 10) If you pull out all of the stops, AAA, advance purchase, etc., it's not too bad on the wallet for a respectable Midtown hotel. 11) Everything is clean and everything functions correctly.

I have a severe feather allergy-- I will very quickly experience symptoms when around anything down-filled, including getting headaches that can greatly impair my vision. I called the hotel TWICE before my reservation, in order to make sure that they were able to provide a feather-free room. TWICE. I arrived at the hotel, quickly dropped my stuff off in the room and went right back out the door for dinner. When I returned a couple hours later, I immediately checked the pillows to make sure that my requests had been honored. Nope-- 4 down-filled pillows, and I was already feeling it. I called the desk, very politely explained that I had a severe feather allergy and that I had called ahead to make arrangements-- the woman at the front desk apologized and sent someone right up. I asked her specifically if anything else in the room was down-filled, and she told me no. I take a shower, start feeling terrible, and realize that the entire comforter on the bed is down filled. I threw it into the hallway and called the front desk again, this time not so patiently. I ended up with an excruciating headache which lasted me through the first half of my race, and the situation could have been so much worse if I hadn't learned not to trust the employees of this hotel. I cannot believe how flippant this hotel is when it comes to VERY SERIOUS allergies. Can't wait until they get their first (well deserved) lawsuit. Also, when I brought all of this to the manager's attention, I hardly even received an apology.

Every other Hotel I've stayed in in New York has had free or very cheap WiFi, Here you had to use the business centre or pay what I consider an extortionate amount for daily access. I'm not sure if this is just this Hotel or the policy of the Hilton Group It 2011 !, Internet access should be a basic service in ALL hotels. It's as vital as clean towels or coat hangers ! As we were visiting from the UK, having access to Twitter and Facebook is a vital way of communicating with relatives and friends, even looking up and booking things in New York. As such it was actually cheaper to use data roaming on our smartphones for the short periods we needed access rather than pay for the WiFi. Our friends had several problems with their room which had to be reported more than once to get anything done, so a point lost on service.

We didn't find any bed bugs, but we did find a pubic hair, a clearish white stain, and a brown stain on the sheets. By this time we only had an hour to shower, iron our clothes, and get where we needed to go, so I called downstairs and told them what happened. They did send an apologetic person up to change the sheets and remake the bed. It was quite obvious the room had not been cleaned at all. The floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was nasty. I was pissed because: A. We are Hilton Honors members and even if we weren't I would still expect a certain level of cleanliness from a Hilton. B. Check in for most of these hotels is generally 3 or 4, so I was a little miffed when she showed up at 6 and they had no room for us. C.

At check-in the front desk were not able to accommodate us on the same floor. High floors were available either. In general the service at check-in was poor. Room 1 was on 3rd floor with a view of a concrete wall some 30 inches from the window \u2013 like living in a cellar. Room 2 was on 7th floor. Both rooms were of the same layout except for the bed configuration: One small window, quite old bathroom in need of updating and very low ceilings.

We booked this hotel because the price was great and included breakfast each night (just over $200 US per night). We had a budget and wanted to stick to it. Not wanting to spend more than $200US a night in NYC (notoriously known for some of the most expensive accommodation holdings in the world) we were expecting alot less than what we received. Room was very large for manhattan standards as was the bathroom. We were on the 11th floor but had no views, both windows faced brick walls, however we didnt expect much at this price, actually we expected to be facing brick walls so this was not a problem. Bed was comfortable, probably to comfy as we slept in a few mornings fairly late. Rooms dont have a min-bar fridge, there is a ice bucket with ice machines on several floors but a fridge would have been handy. Bathroom products provided (PeterThomasRoth) were great. Breakfast was ok, was included in our room rate so can't complain but wouldnt pay for it if it wasnt as selection was limited. Reception and bell staff were fine, not amazing but pleasant, breakfast attendants were pleasant also and the housekeepers were extremely pleasant, always smiling and so friendly and even left friendly post notes wishing us a great day. There was a lady who worked in the kitchen for the breakfast service who was rude, when she came out to put food out we saw her push past people and yell at the other staff and you could hear her yelling from the kitchen, we didnt get her name though. Apart from her though overall service was perfectly fine. The location of the hotel is a little removed from the centre of the action but we liked this. It's in a quieter part of town, a relaxing place to rest for the night. Its still in manhattan so you can never get away from the noise and excitment but its makes for a welcoming change at the end of a long day to come back to somewhere with a slightly more inviting and peacful feel. Its located in the Tudor City neighbourhood which is definately worth a walk around and is opposite the Ford foundation building which has a unique indoor garden open to the public. NYC is all about the walking but if you dont want to walk there are so many transport options. The cross town bus stops right outside the hotel and runs from the hotel along 42nd street right to the other end at peir 83. The 42nd street subway is also close by with a stop near 43rd street and runs under 42nd street with a stop at 7th Ave, perfect for Times Square. Grand Central is only about a 7 min walk away and has a great indoor food market place of Lexington Ave. You can walk from the hotel to Times Sqaue and Broaway Theatres in around 15-20 mins, with so much to look at along the way and high pedestrian traffic it may take longer but thats part of the NYC experience. If you are only in NYC for a few nights and spending most of your time around Times Square then this hotel may not be the best for you as you may get over the walk or transport quickly but you wont get the same value at the Times Sqaure hotels, you will mostly likely pay more for less.

Paid nearly $600 per night for the room (high season in New York I guess, there was nothing for less than $400 in the city). To be clear: overall rating would be average-to-good if the value for money weren't so bad. Check-in was efficient rather than friendly; service generally was of the \"we're here if you want to ask us for something\" kind rather than the \"anticipating your needs and at least pretending to be interested in you as a human being\" kind that I'd hope for this kind of location. Room was not huge but average for NYC, just about fit the 2 queen beds. Bathroom was functional and clean. Bed was comfortable and I slept well. My main issue was around lack of working internet. Wireless was a joke - the signal was so weak that it would stay up for at most 30 seconds. Wired had some DNS problem so I couldn't get an IP address. I was popping in and out of the room for various meetings and told them at the front desk of the issues. They said they'd send an engineer up to fix it, but he didn't have a laptop so couldn't actually test it (so of course he didn't end up fixing it). If I'm paying $600 a night I expect the on-site engineer to be able to at least hook up to the cable and see if it's working, without me having to be there. I also think at that price they could throw the internet in for free. Second issue was service at breakfast. We were hosting someone for a breakfast meeting and clearly wanted to order from the menu, but it took 10-15 minutes to get a menu (the waiter tried to convince us the buffet would be better - when we had made clear we wanted to order from the menu to enable us to meet at the table) and then another 10-15 minutes to get someone to take an order. Probably would not have irked me if the breakfast menu items weren't so expensive - but if I'm paying $30+ for breakfast, I expect someone to actually care about taking my order.

I made the mistake of going up the wrong set of elevators and into the wrong tower. That's how I found out! Anyway, backing up a bit, I checked in on a Tuesday night. Check-in staff very friendly and helpful. I was told that I received a Hilton Gold member upgrade. Great! However, I got to the room and thought, \"Really? This is an upgraded room?!?\" It was very small...even for Manhattan. Probably about 180 square feet. The view was non-existent. I wonder what my original room looked like! But, for the price, I really couldn't complain. And the room was cute,clean, and appointed with normal Hilton stuff, and the bed slept perfectly fine. I had no issues whatsoever. I would stay here again, easily, for the price. I was just 2 blocks away from the Shuttle to Time Square and I could walk to Time Square in about 20 minutes. A great great alternative to the uber expensive properties around W. 42nd St.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery accomidating and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "mmoodlight", "ReviewID": "UR108409748", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at this Hotel at first glance the hotel is very classy.

Everything that the other reviews say are true. Hotel lobby is smallish but has some nice seating areas, and the bar/lounge towards the back of the long lobby looked cozy and comfortable. There was fresh fruit on the check-in counter, apples and oranges (the container disappeared over the weekend). Our corner room in the South Tower overlooked 41st St., a lovely residential street. The room was smallish, with 1 queen bed, but nicely appointed, with a flat screen TV and a snug, modern bathroom. Our corner room had 2 windows, covered in lovely roman shades, and another one in the bathroom, oddly placed in the shower/bathtub. Two of the nicest things about the room: the windows opened--a rarity in ANY hotel--and since they were double-paned, they sealed out all of the noise in the streets below. Sleeping was wonderful! Unfortunately, the walls are thin and the pipes (when others are using their bathrooms) are a bit noisy, so our early morning started with noises from other rooms. My second favorite thing was the comfort of the bed. It was JUST perfect--not too hard, not too soft. The pillows were fluffy and gave good neck support. The sheets were wonderful with a high thread count 'feel'. The hotel has a small, nicely appointed gym, but even better is the 24 hour dry sauna in the gym's locker room. What a treat! The gym is open 24/7 (use your room key to get in), and you must heat the sauna up for 15 minutes before it's ready to use. But at 11pm, after a lovely evening at the theater, the sauna and gym were empty so we enjoyed a muscle-relaxing sauna before bedtime. Front desk and bellman service was excellent. We didn't eat in the restaurant (since breakfast was not included in our room rate) but the breakfast buffet, while it looked nice and complete, costs a whopping $16 for continental and $26 for a hot breakfast. Outrageous prices! For the price we paid through Priceline.com, this hotel was a STEAL. For a higher price, it is still worth considering if you can reserve a larger room with double beds or a king bed.

We were fine to bring the bags ourselves to the front. After he INSISTED, we let him take some, and then had to tip him for 6 bags. Then when we got into the van, the driver who was a 'friend' of the bellhop, complained that he had to wait, and had to drive ALL THE WAY from the airport to come and get us.

As a traveler who is used to the Hilton Gold and Diamond experience, I was disappointed in the quality of this hotel in comparison to the other ones at which I've stayed. There were definitely good points to the hotel, however. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, as one who regularly stays at Hiltons would expect. The blackout curtains kept the sunlight out and on the higher floors (I was on 13), there was very little street noise that made its way into the room. As is also typical with Hiltons, the decorations were tasteful and it was obvious that the company has invested a substantial amount of money in updating the hotel since its acquisition. The rooms were also very clean, which is particularly reassuring given the recent bedbug epidemic in NYC hotels. At no time did I fear that the cleanliness was subpar. There were also some substantial drawbacks to the hotel: - My room was not ready at my requested time that I included with my reservation. . -Being accustomed to the Gold and Diamond treatment, I was not offered a room upgrade (which I understand given it was NYC the weekend prior to Christmas) and there was no executive lounge. Complimentary bottles of water were also not provided in the room. -The elevators are excrutiatingly slow; not to mention tiny and only 2 out of the 3 were operating. Upon checkout, we waited in excess of five minutes for an elevator. Ordinarily, I would take the stairs; however, that is very inconvenient when you're on the 13th floor and have luggage to take with you. -The walls are paper thin. I mean, you literally hear EVERYTHING that is going on in the room next to you. This is hardly ideal for a romantic weekend away. So, all in all, kind of a mixed bag. At a macro level, it's a clean, comfortable place to stay and the appearance is on brand with what one would expect out of a Hilton.

Once we got to the room, there was no Pack'n Play. We had to call downstairs, and they came up with a very narrow rolling crib. This might not be so bad for smaller babies, but at 16 months, my daughter moves around a lot in her sleep. She ended up banging her head against the crib bars and waking up in the middle of the night. Another thing that bugged me was that, even though we had a balcony, we had to go back downstairs to get the key from the front desk; don't know why they couldn't give it to us when we checked in. We decided to have dinner at the downstairs restaurant, the Tudor Bar & Grill. What a disappointment! We tasted 4 different dishes in all, and all were bland.

The bathroom was just about acceptable, but looked like it needed a re-fit. We never ate in the restaurant, preferring to eat out. It seemed very over-priced for what it offered. The people we spoke to felt that the restaurant wasn't worth the cost. There is a well equipped gym available, although very small in size. The girls on the front desk were extremely warm and friendly and willing to help in any way possible, unlike the man of French origin on the front desk. The hotel is adequate for somewhere as a comfortable sleep-over, but expect any more than that and you may feel a little bit underwhelmed. Personally I would have preferred to have paid a little more for a slightly overall better hotel, rather than 3-star standard hotel which is what this hotel is in my opinion. Would I return to the hotel, on balance probably not. There are far better hotels available in New York with just as good locations, more importantly with better amenities and better-sized rooms.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNicely decorated but small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Chris_Jetten", "ReviewID": "UR69670193", "Content": "This hotel has now been completely transformed to a Hilton hotel, although from the size of the floors (only 7 rooms per floor) it is still clear that it was not designed as a Hilton.

No such surprise here: the rooms are the typical mini-size found all over Manhattan, and windows are smallish with limited views due to the hotel being surrounded by higher buildings. The other big difference with the HGI was the ridiculously expensive wifi, which is free in any HGI. I fail to understand why a more luxurious chain in the Hilton family still charges customers for what is rightly considered a basic service in chains lower down in the same family. Where Hilton does better than HGI is in the decoration of the rooms (and the hotel as a whole) which is really nice, the subtle and quiet aircon. Beds were comfy, and a lovely bathroom (but again: small).

As a Hilton Diamond got a quasi-upgrade had a corner room in a corner that had no view, but it was on the large side (by NYC standards) and was certainly nicely laid out and comfortable. Friendly, efficient staff downstairs. Also very nice that it's a refurbished older hotel, with the best features of a place that's been fixed up combined with a bit of the charm that comes with an older property. And it does have a boutique feel to it. Got free internet thrown in, but that was because my rate included a breakfast that I was entitled to anyway by virtue of my Hilton status. (Though I left too early for it in any event!) Possible that HH elites could trade their free breakfast for the free internet, but don't necessarily count on it. A few minor matters re the room: the desk is right beneath the overhead ventilation system, I didn't come across the normal variety of new channels (but maybe I just missed them in my haste) when doing a quick channel surf, and the toilet seemed to be kind of low pressure. But no big deal. A slightly bigger potential deal is that the concierge desk closes at 6 p.m. The front desk person was fine at recommending a few nearby restaurants, but the concierge hours seem a little odd to me, given that folks might need advice or help after 6 p.m. One thing I'd add for folks who don't know the neighborhood is that the hotel is about a block away from Tudor City, a pleasant little corner of NYC if you want to take a brief walk, hang out in the very relaxing smallish park there, and/or take in a view of the East River/UN. Bottom line, though, based on my 12 hours, is that I'd go back and might even consider it my first choice for a Hilton in NYC, considering location, quality and price ($260 advance purchase, at a rate that included breakfast).", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Fosforita", "ReviewID": "UR68432788", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and liked it very much.

I would say that the hotel is already hooked up for internet use so why a charge is necessary, I can only surmise. I agree that there should be a charge for printing to cover paper and ink. Otherwise, I do not feel this is a friendly situation for the casual traveler as I had to pay $5.00 + just to print 2 boarding passes. Drinks at the bar are minimum of $10 each.

There were renovations going on and only one elevator working almost every day. The night we checked in, the room they put us in was at the North Tower on the last floor (17th). The room was a typical small NYC room, but it was a nice room...just small. One problem, it was not made up. The bed looked like someone slept in it and there were towels on the bathroom floor. One elevator working was a little annoying because we had to wait for it to go all the way down to the check in area. The Asian guy (don't remember his name) was really nice and apologetic. He moved us to a suite in the South Tower, which was a much nicer and bigger room. We especially loved the space since we have a 6 year old with us. He enjoyed the room, especially the jacuzzi!

They put gold labels over the Tudor name in the room. The cons: The housekeeping at this hotel is the only bad thing about this hotel. They would make the bed and clean the bathroom, but they wouldn't refill the coffee, sugar and didn't replace the toilet paper when it was empty.

I have to comment that this was one of the best stays of my life. I have traveled from coast to coast and to the south pacific but this was my first trip to NYC. I don't know how this room may compare to other NY hotel rooms but in my eyes it could not get any better. It began with the basic need that my flight arrived at 8am and check in is at 3pm. I called ahead to see if I could arrange an early check in (AMEX actually called for me) and happened to inform them this was my anniversary. Well when we got to the hotel at around 9:30am they had our room ready and we got upgraded to a Jr. Suite on the 19th floor with a view of the river! In my eyes people from NY are more direct in dealing with you and please and thank you and small talk are not always prevalent. Not at the Tudor, I got all the hospitality I am used to from the entire staff. The room itself was just great, and from what I have heard rooms in NY can tend to be quite small. Not at all in our case, the room looked to be recently renovated and a decent size with couches a sitting area and large bathroom with jacuzzi. I really liked the large flat screen TV which swiveled so it could be viewed from the sitting area to the bed. I didn't come to NY to watch TV but I absolutely love the Olympics, and being on west coast time I would lay in bed watching them late into the night. The bathroom looked recently renovated as well, black granite countertops, toilet and bidet, and shower with jacuzzi tub. Housekeeping was fast when we needed some small. Very clean room and linens, we had to use the additional blanket in the closet as I don't like using the heater too much, and every day after that first night the bed was made up with the extra blanket already there. To some people this is not a big deal and should be expected, but to us the little things like that are just nice. We only used the hotel restaurant once for brunch and it was pretty good. The service again was great as the waiters would walk around bring us more muffins and pastries without asking. In addition to bringing us our drinks they asked if they could make us an omelet of our choosing even though there was no omelet station. All the staff was great about giving us tips about NY, particularly when we wanted a late night bite to eat or directions for wherever we wanted to go. We walked into the hotel around 2am one night and asked the front desk if there was anywhere to eat so late and she pulled out a menu of a local place which delivers 24hours with very reasonable prices, a very nice thing to have when you are hungry late at night in a strange city. On the last morning when we had to check out in took a matter of about 30 seconds to complete. We had to leave the hotel at 5am, and the pleasant woman at the front desk who helped with checkout also called our cab. Not only that but she called the cab to check on the status of when he would arrive after he did not come in the first three minutes, it felt nice to have someone so considerate of our time schedule even though we were not is such a rush that 5 min mattered. I know the reviews are quite mixed, but with satisfaction being so subjective you can\u2019t please everyone.

We took advantage of the in-house concierge to get tips and suggestions on what to do, but we didn't buy any Broadway tickets through the concierge, since they worked out at double the price to us booking them ourselves! Our room was a lot smaller than we had expected, since we had stayed in the Long Island City - Manhattan View Holiday Inn previously, but it was cleverly laid out and maximised the limited space. The HD TV lacked HD channels, but otherwise all the standard facilities were there (be sure to set parental control on the TV if you need to). Bathroom included a shower and bath which was a step up for us, and the coffee maker was located in the bathroom. The only problem we had was that the thermostat measured temperatures in F only, and we had to do mental conversions into C to get the temperatures we wanted, but it wasn't a big problem. Located near the east end of Manhattan, it was about four blocks away from the nearest subway station (Grand Central Station), but did have a very conveniently located bus stop right outside the hotel, so if you have a METRO pass, it's good for the bus stop or the subway, so you can catch the bus to the subway, and then transfer to whatever subway route you want. We didn't explore the hotel much since it was just meant to be a place to rest for us, but we did enjoy our stay nonetheless. Rooms were peaceful and quiet, and overall were very comfortable. We did have trouble opening our room window, but we gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt here and convinced ourselves during our stay that this was a security measure rather than a fault, but honestly we think it was a fault. The best part about our stay here was that it felt like a better-than-average hotel in Manhattan for a really good price. The biggest problems we had were the lack of any decent Manhattan view, and the distance from the SUBWAY (but as stated before this was overcome by the bus stop outside). I'm not sure if I would have felt as satisfied if I had had to pay full price for the room, but I have nothing to compare it to in Manhattan so I can't say for sure if it's a good Manhattan hotel or a poor Manhattan hotel!", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cawesome hotel\u201d", "Author": "zobo1", "ReviewID": "UR52477195", "Content": "recently stayed at the tudor hotel with my boyfriend for xmas shopping and sight seeing! had booked another hotel closer to time square but it decided to close for renovations! but the tudor hotel agreed the same rate of $125 per night so i was happy, on arrival the lobby is lovely the staff are extremely helpful at giving you directions and advice on subways and maps etc! our room was very spacious had a queen room on the 7th floor bathroom was big enough, overall this hotel is ideal for a trip to nyc is close to grand central and a 10min straight walk to time square! awesome loved it!", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cAdequate for Business Travel\u201d", "Author": "sophiafalcon", "ReviewID": "UR52322509", "Content": "It is unfair to say that the Tudor is bad- the staff is competent, the location is near public transport, and the rooms are not unclean.

There's a Starbucks across 2nd and plenty of restaurants nearby on 2nd Ave and on 42nd St. Like other reviewers have said it's about a 25-30 min walk to Times Square. The closest subway station is at Grand Central where you can catch the green and purple lines. There's no parking in front of the hotel and we had to temporarily park in the diplomat parking zone to drop off our luggage. Hotel parking was $59/night. Our friends found parking for $27/night at Central Parking on 1st Ave (a 15 min walk back to the hotel). The street and area seemed very safe and we didn't encounter any problems even walking back to the hotel at 1am. If you walk back to the hotel along 42nd, the hotel has a neon light sign you can see from a few blocks away to give you an idea how much further you have to go. The rooms were quaint, a little on the small side but acceptable. The queen sized bed was comfortable and the sheets clean. The room and bathroom looked to have been renovated recently. The walls are rather thin though and we could hear the ice machine on our floor at night (note that there are only ice machines on certain floors of the hotel) and people talking in the hallway.

Even the holiday inn is better than the Tudor. The Tudor is a decent place to crash if you need a clean bed in a quiet hotel, but the little details that make a hotel stay enjoyable and luxurious are seriously lacking in this hotel. First I'll touch on the positives. Cute lobby, great doormen to greet you, and helpful front desk staff. Our maid was kind, she left us extra towels as requested, although she left us no shampoo for our final day - so we couldn't wash our hair. They offer bath and body works products, which is a nice touch, too. The air conditioning in the room was fantastic, and the tv was big, flat, and functional. The room itself was small and dingy. While the bed area was clean, the bathroom smelled horribly of mold. Our sink wouldn't drain properly and the stench of the moldy bathroom made our room smell awful, too. Everytime I had to go into the bathroom I dreaded it! The phone in our room didn't work, either. I truly felt as though I was in a bathroom that had been surface cleaned but not properly sanitized for decades. Those blacklights they use on CSI would have forsure had a field day! As for the location, I can't comment much on it. We cabbed everywhere because it was pouring, but it's definitely a rather far walk from 5th avenue shopping (probably 20 minutes). We paid $125 per night on priceline, however, I would say that this hotel was only worth 100, not 125, and I wouldn't call it a 3.5 star. Also, for those booking on priceline, this hotel charges a fee of $50 per night if you want 2 double beds, so make sure you're aware of that before bidding. I cannot imagine anyone paying full price for this hotel...I felt a tad ripped off at $125. All in all, if you're looking for a clean and quiet place to rest your head for the night (with no extra ammenities or luxuries), then this hotel will do just fine. If you are scared of germs, hate mold, and in general want more than dingy basics, I wouldn't recommend the tudor. Did it ruin my trip? Not at all. Did it add anything exciting to it?

We also found our room to be very clean although we did encounter a cockroach in the bathroom on our very last night.

My only minor quibble is the high price of their wifi connection ($15 per night) and use of their computers in the business center (works out to be $5 for 15 minutes). However, a nice and pretty staff member did give me 30 minutes of complimentary computer usage when one of their computers froze on me. To maximize your enjoyment of this hotel, I would highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the bus system! The stop for the 42 and 104 is kitty-corner from the hotel. Both buses will take you to Grand Central Station and Time Square. The 42 will also take you the Circle Line Ferry, Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Javitz Convention Center. And both the 42 and 104 will literally drop you RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel on the way back. I know Grand Central is a short walk but if you have an Unlimited Ride MetroCard, jumping on the bus (which comes frequently) will help save the feet. The northbound 27 and 50 buses can be taken across the street from the hotel to the north on 2nd Ave. and either bus will take you to Rockfeller Center, and some great shopping such as Saks 5th Ave. The invaluable southbound 15 bus can be taken on 2nd Ave. as well and this bus will take you down to the East Village, Lower East Side and down to Battery Park. This bus is great as there is limited subway coverage in the East Village and Lower East Side. On the way back, the 27, 50 and 15 will drop you right in front of the UN. Take the stairs on the west side of 1st Ave and take the short walk back to the hotel through the quiet and historic neighbourhood of Tudor City. As for the hotel location, it is located at the eastern end of 42nd Street. 42nd street is generally a bustling street but it is quiet east of 3rd Ave. There is a grocery store just a block south of the hotel. Lots of dining choices toward the west along 42nd St. and in the north and south directions along 2nd Ave. I recommend trying the Good Burger located a block north from the hotel on 2nd Ave, or the Oyster Bar Restaurant at Grand Central.

Our room in the North Tower (#1010) was updated with a modern bath, flat screen TV and very comfortable bed and pillows and looked out on 42nd St.. The desk clerk said all the rooms had now been updated. Granted it was a small room, maybe 2 ft on one side of bed and 4 ft on the other and 5 ft at the bottom but that is fairly normal for mid price Manhattan hotels. One nice thing, there were only 6 rooms on the floor so very quiet. Hotel was conveniently located for our main purpose of visiting our son on East 75 St. It is a 3.5 block walk to Grand Central and 8 blocks to Times Square--not bad. A drug store, food market and grocery store all within 2 blocks. We ate breakfasts for 2 at Dave's (as recommended) up at 44th ($24 with tip), or McD's($8) down at 37th or Pax's ($12) on 42nd between 3rd and Lex. Did not use any of the Tudor dining facilities, so no comment. Had minimal need for staff but they all were friendly and solicitous when we did. Would defintely consider this hotel again. But it is more a 3 star than 3.5 star.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a good area with easy access to all of Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "Chicagohoosier07", "ReviewID": "UR28294615", "Content": "The hotel is only a few blocks from the subway and trains at Grand Central and within walking distance of Times Square and other attractions.

Originally rated as a 3.5 star hotel, Hotwire informed me that it had downgraded this hotel to a 3 star hotel based on feedback from members. With this in mind, as well as, reviewing the past guests' comments, I had fairly reasonable expectations. Prior to staying, I contacted the hotel directly to request a non-smoking, two bedded, newly rennovated room (as past reviewers have suggested). Katarzyna, quickly responded and indicated that she would place a note in my folio with my requests, which I realized was all that could be done. I actually emailed Katarzyna several times and she was quick to respond each time and most helpful. Upon check in we were given a beautiful room in the north tower with two beds, non-smoking, and newly rennovated. Considering this was Easter and that the hotel was fully booked, I was quite pleased with the upgrade. Although our room on the third floor has no view, it was quiet, clean and comfortable. The beds were great and the bathroom quite spacious. Yes, the hotel is historic and there are the odd annoyances that one gets from a historic property, but all in all the charm of this hotel is not lost with the rennovations. About the rennovations...at times I had to remind myself that the room had undergone a rennovation. The carpet was clearly new, the window treatments, light fixtures and bedding were all obviously new and upgraded. The walls were painted and the room had a flatscreen T.V. However, there were elements of the rennovation that just did not make sense. For example, the decision to keep the original wooden headboards and wooden furniture, which are clearly out of place with the T.V. stand (modern). Also, for a newly rennovated room, one would not expect the door handles in the bathroom to be coming off, the light switch in the bathroom to be broken, and the complete absence of a toilet paper roll holder in the bathroom. Also, the very automated lighting control panel in the room had incorrect labels on what lights each button controls. In one case someone had written on the wall plate, in pen, the switch for the bathroom. Clearly I do not understand why the rennovation would not be complete instead of piecemeal. However, that said, I really cannot fault the hotel on any other aspects. There are complimentary papers on the bell desk in the morning (Wall Street Journal & The New York Times). There is a Starbucks at the corner of 42nd and 2nd Avenue (turn left when exiting out the front door and walk about 100 steps, it is open at 6:30 on weekdays and at 7:00 on weekends). The bus stop is located at 42nd street and 2nd Avenue (turn left when exiting the front door, cross 2nd Avenue, and the cross 42nd Street to the bus stop) The number 42 bus goes all the way across 42nd street to the Hudson River, passing Times Square on the way. The number 104 bus also goes to Times Square and then up 8th Avenue. The \"Grand Central 42nd Street\" subway stop is about 2 blocks to the west (again, turn left coming out the front door, walk for about 5-8 minutes and the entry is on the left) A Metrocard for $7.50/person/day is a great option if staying under 4 days. If over 4 days, the $25/person Metrocard is good for 7 days of unlimited travel, which is a great convenience since it allows seemless transfers from bus to subway and subway to bus. (read: \"no hassles\") The number 15 bus that runs south on 2nd Avenue goes to South Street Seaport and eventually ends up near Battery Park and the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Really enjoyed the Tenement Museum this time in NYC. It is located in the Lower East Side at Allen & Delancy. (Delancy subway stop on the \"F\" line). I also tried the NYC Transit Museum in Brooklyn Heights and found this to be quite interesting as well. The best and cheapest way from JFK to Manhatten is the AirTrain from JFK to Jamaica station ($5/person) Then take the \"E\" train, which is express, to Manhatten. We timed it at 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on subway traffic. If going to the Tudor Hotel, you will need to switch to the number 6 train (green line) at Lexington Avenue and take the number 6 train one stop to Grand Central 42 Street. The hotel is only a 10 minute, easy, walk to the east. The hotel is in a quiet area of the city, but the action is only a 10 minute (or less) bus ride to the west. I enjoyed coming back to this area of town at night to sleep, which was quite easy in the very comfortable bed. I had no issues with the air conditioning or heating, of which we used both during our stay over Easter. Overall, I was quite pleased with the hotel, it's staff, and the value that I received for the price paid. I would have no reservations about staying here again.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cOur first NYC disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Roger00", "ReviewID": "UR27999196", "Content": "We have been visiting New York (and other US and Canadian cities) for almost 25 years - usually two or three times a year.

That chair blocked access to the bed. The small queen bed had a poor quality mattress which meant that our sleep was disturbed. The room was too small for a roller bed. My wife slept on the floor. So much for our wedding anniversary! Our several requests for a room change were met with 'We're full'. Also, the staff unforgiveably referred to our travel agent (Hotwire) in poor terms, saying that their only obligation with Hotwire bookings was to supply a room with a bed. I discovered how much they had been paid for our reservation and am confident that it was much higher than the rates paid for a group at the same time. After two nights of discomfort, my comments may have worked and they agreed to put us in what they called a junior suite. This was far better than our original room. If we had been there for the whole time, our report would have been more complimentary. They advertise a fitness centre. This was closed for rfurbishment. They advertise high speed wifi. The outrageous charge is $14.95 + tax. Internet use in the business centre is $20 per hour if I understood correctly. We declined both. American buffet breakfast is $22 per person. We found a diner round the corner where we were well satisfied for $22 for the two of us. We booked the Tudor as a 4-star hotel.

As I was traveling with my adult son, this was perfect for us. The room was clean and comfortable which was what I needed. If you were to spend a lot of time in the room, it would only accommodate one person, but my companions each had three people in their rooms, their rooms were quite a bit larger and they were quite comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly and helped each in our party to get the type of room best suited to them. For one of the rooms this involved a substantial upgrade at no additional cost. The concierge, bell staff, front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, going so far as to give us tips on our destinations for the day. The maintenance staff who I saw here and there (there were no problems that I needed them for) all greeted us with a smile and a \"good morning\".

We arrived on 9/4 and the two people who checked us in were very pleasant and gave us a room. We dropped off our luggage and went exploring, when we came back around 1:00am we inquired about getting a different room as our room had mold in the tub and in general was very damp. She said it would depend on our reservation, looked it up and said \"oh yeah, no we don't have any other rooms available\" I had booked on hotwire so I know exactly what she was saying without saying it. Had she said \"due to your discounted rate we are unable to move you to a better room\" I could have maybe accepted that. But I knew she was blatantly lying to me because I had just checked on the internet and for the length of our stay they still had Superior and Junior Suites available. She just wasn't willing to upgrade us. It was being lied to that has left a sour taste in my mouth with this hotel and the woman working the front desk was extremely rude. So I guess if you book on a discount site for this hotel, that entitles you to a room with mold in the bathroom and damp bedding. With that being said the beds were extremely comfortable (despite being damp feeling) and the room was an OK size for a NY hotel room. We were on the 9th floor of the North tower...no view of any kind except a brick wall, but thats pretty typical in NY. I am also conflicted with whether or not the location of the hotel is convenient or not. I liked the fact that our nearest subway station was Grand Central since most of the subway lines go through there so no matter where we were in the city it was easy to get back to our hotel area. However, every other hotel I have stayed at in NY was a 3 or 4 minute walk from the nearest subway station. While The Tudor is only 2 1/2 blocks from Grand Central it is 2 1/2 NY LONG blocks. Which took about 10 minutes walking at a pretty decent clip. Then because Grand Central is so huge it took about another 5 minutes to get to the correct subway line. So round trip from our hotel we always had to factor an extra half hour into our travel time. There were some very convenient aspects of this location, an Irish bar right across the street (but sadly played country music which I don't care for) a couple of Starbucks within a few blocks, a great diner a couple blocks away (I think its called the Comfort Diner, the hotel Conierge recommended it). The bath amenities in the room were plentiful and were Bath and Body Works, not some cheap off brand. The towels were fluffy (although damp, never dry). When I got home and unpacked my suitcase, all the clothes I had with me smelled musty and damp, so with that as a consideration and the fact that I abhor being lied to I would probably say I will not be staying at the Tudor the next time I am in NY.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at a reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "elkerette", "ReviewID": "UR19661461", "Content": "The Tudor was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed there before for business.

I needn't have worried. Everything went swimmingly. Because I had booked on Priceline, I phoned before I left home to make sure that the Tudor had a record of my reservation. They did. I arrived at 7:30am which was WAY early. The doorman helped me with my luggage to the front desk. I was the only guest present. I asked if it would be possible to check my luggage with the bell staff until a room was ready. The friendly front desk person said that while they wouldn't have my queen room ready for a while, there was a non-smoking room with two full size beds that I could have right then. Since it was just me, I agreed. I was more interested in the non-smoking aspect than in the size of the bed. The room was small, but quite a good size for Manhattan. It was clean but well-worn. There were some spots that could have used a bit more dusting, but the linens and carpet were clean. The bathroom was larger than mine at home and quite clean with ample towels and toiletries. The housekeeping staff had not checked the mini-fridge to see if it was clean, but then again that meant that the sealed beverages left behind by the previous occupant were also still there. The hotel is planning a room renovation and had samples of the future rooms in the lobby. They will be quite nice when the fixtures are updated. But the beds and chairs were comfortable and that was the most important thing. There were only two other rooms on my corridor and it was very quiet. A guest was speaking on a cell phone in the hallway at 10:30pm which was pretty late for me, but not for most people. The view was what I would expect for that part of town, mostly buildings, but I could see a bit of a park off to one side. There was some traffic noise from the street, but again, it is midtown Manhattan. My only two real issues were: the temperature and the lighting. The temperature control was either on or off and either hot or cold. Not exactly easy to get it right either way. The light switches didn't operate some of the lights and some of the light switches didn't do anything. Seems that could be rectified as well. It also would have been nice to know what the charge was to use wireless internet in the room. Since it was not disclosed, I chose not to use it. Didn't eat at the hotel. Didn't really need to. There are plenty of places to eat within a quick walk or subway ride. The hotel is only a few short blocks from Grand Central Terminal and several buses stop right in front so there are many transportation options. Next morning, I checked out at 5:30am to catch a train at Penn Station. I had mentioned this when I checked in and there was a cab out front, even though I had not always seen one there the day before. Made me wonder if they had phoned ahead.

We were expecting a 4 star hotel but our standard room was more like 3 star. The bathroom consisted of a toilet, shower and basin. The shower was very good - powerful and hot whatever time we used it! The room itself was a suitable size, a lot bigger than what you would get in a London hotel. It was fairly nicely decorated too. TV showed standard US channels with some good movies. There was no charge for watching (though you did have the option of paying for newer movies if you chose to). The minibar if it existed was inaccessible (we think it was under the TV) but we bought our own drinks down the road at the 24 hour Duane Reade convenience store and the hotel had a nice touch of having ice machines on a few floors so you could go and fill your ice bucket up as many times as you like. We used our bathroom sink as a giant ice bucket to chill our drinks. The bed was comfortable and queen size. There was air conditioning in the room which was good and not noisy. Plenty storage in the form of drawers and a wardrobe with hangers. Also had iron and trouser press. I used the iron once and it was fine. There was zero view from the windows and very little light came through them due to other skysrapers around. Housekeeping did a good job on a daily basis, I think only once did they forget to fill the tissues (not the toilet roll) up which is a minor thing. The room was an ideal base for touring the city. It was on the East side but only 5 minutes walk from Grand Central Station where you could get the tube everywhere! We walked everywhere apart from when we went downtown and to give you an idea walking-wise it was 20 minutes to Times Square and about 10-15 to Empire State. All in all a good central location I felt. The hotel was nice to come back to and unlike other hotel rooms we've stayed in we were quite happy to sit in our room for an hour or two having a drink and resting our feet before an evening out. There was no shortage of mirrors which as a woman I appreciate. One of the only draw backs - the front of house team were miserable. When we arrived, they said our room was for one night. We told them no, we'd booked for 4 nights. Then they tried to give us a smoking room which we said we didn't ask for. They sorted this fairly quickly but were very unfriendly in that they barely looked at or spoke to us. It costs nothing to smile as they say!

We got a good price on Hotwire - paid $160 per night and they did accommodate our request for two beds. The rooms were a comfortable size and the heating and AC worked well. The bed was very hard and we did request a different room and bed after two nights. After the second try, they did put us in a room with a tempurpedic bed, but this room was near the elevator - faint noise but not objectionable. The rooms need updating and they do intend to update in the future. The linens are medium quality. The bathroom was nicely equipped with hair dryer and makeup mirror (thank you!) and the shower was great. Perhaps booking with Hotwire does not get you the best rooms, and if you can, get rooms on the highest floors. Overall, we were comfortable and the location worked out well. Our friends had a nice view of river from their 15th floor room and we had a view of a church roof and walls above from the 9th floor. A three block walk to Grand Central Station and you are in subway and train heaven, Starbucks is nearby for the coffee fix. At first, restaurants are not too obvious at this location, but we did make a couple of good finds. For a quick, cheap dinner, try Goodburger on 3rd Ave just a block from the hotel. We had wonderful Vietnamese cuisine in a lovely little restaurant, two blocks north and 1 block west, named Boi. The food, ambiance and service were wonderful in this little gem. Dinner with nice wine was $90 for two. You are very close to the UN and a city bus stops right in front of the hotel and will take you straight to Times Square up 42nd Street in 20 minutes. The hotel lobby needs some TLC - furnishings are worn and we wished for a few tables, so we could go over maps and plans with our friends. The only tables are in the bar area and they don't want you there if you are not ordering. Given the high price of rooms in NYC, I think this hotel is a good buy. It is definitely not 4 stars, but well above a Comfort Inn, etc. My other hotel experiences are Hilton Times Square, definitely a 4 star and Hotel Edison, a 21/2 to 3 star.

It had an ironing board and working iron, and a pants press. The bathroom in our room was very clean and the towels were soft and plentiful. Usually I have to call the front desk for additional towels, so I was amazed to find more than the usual 3 bath towels in a hotel! The bedding was soft, clean, and looked to be new. The air conditioning was quiet and the room remained cool without becoming overly chilled. The view was nonexistant, but I expect that from an NYC hotel. The front desk staff was helpful, and we were quickly booked in even though we arrived at the same time as a busload of tourists from Italy. The parking was expensive, but it was in-line with what I expected to pay for NYC. The best part was the free buffet breakfast. Service was superb, the food was plentiful and very fresh, and they had the cutest little delicious potato pancakes rather than the tired tater tots or greasy home fries you usually get at a buffet. They had a large variety of fruit, the hot buffet items were actually hot, and we were greeted warmly by the servers who were attentive, refilling water glasses and asking us if everything was to our satisfaction. A waiter overheard me telling my husband that I liked the fruit, and went up and got me some more and brought it to the table without being asked. This was well above the service I would expect from a buffet or at a hotel in this price rage. We were originally from New York, so we didn't need much advice from the concierge, but he was helpful the few times I asked questions.

When we finally went to check in we were informed that we had no reservation even though I had booked through their website and had the confirmation page with me. Luckily, there were rooms available for all nights except the following one. However, as this was our first time in New York and because we had very short notice to find another hotel for a Saturday night this was an awful experience. We asked check in staff to recommend another hotel and three of them just shook their heads in a disinterested manner and shrugged shoulders . They didn't have any sympathy for our situation. Prior to this I had twice emailed the hotel on an issue and received no reply. I now think that perhaps they had double booked and didn't want to reply as this would be committing a room to us. I know of two other cases where the exact same thing happened while we were there! In one case the reception staff told a guest something about there being no guarantee of a room. I overheard another lady having the same problem.She told reception staff that whoever she spoke to on the phone the day before didn't give her two words and she couldn't get through to the hotel after that. It really was the most awful inconvenience as we had booked the 48 hour bus tour for the next two days and we couldn't begin that both days until about 3pm as we had to check in and out of the two hotels. When we went to check in the second time the new receptionist said we had no reservation but ,fortunately, I then recognised the other receptionist just passing by who had made our reservations the day before. However, despite the nightmare mix up it did get better! I really loved the room and the hotel is great. Walls are thin as I could hear the man in the next room yawning but there are only three rooms on each corrirdor and I think we were alone until the end of the week so for us this wasn't a problem. The air conditioning or fan was very noisy as well but as the cleaning staff left it on all day we didn't need it at night . By the way because of the mix up we had two rooms and it was noisy in both. However, on the plus side our first room was on the second floor overlooking the street but we heard no external noise.Oh I've just remembered when we had to change our hotel for the next night we asked if we could leave our bags with them in the security room until we returned and they weren't willing to do this either. Maybe it was for insurance purposes but they didn't explain that they just said they had no security room but we used it on the day of our departure so now I know there was one. I see others have complained about the location but I found it very convenient. Actually it was perfect for shopping, tourist attractions and transport. I would stay there again definately but I would advise to be very cautious when booking! P.S On a side note avoid using phones in room to make international calls.

Having no other recourse, with hotel rates on all sites crazy expensive in NYC for these dates, we crossed our fingers and took the Priceline plunge. We were pleasantly surprised on many counts. The hotel is in an amazing location, just a short walk to Grand Central Station on the quieter and more reserved east side of midtown, and still easy walking distance to Times Square, Fifth Avenue, and Central Park. Priceline only guarantees a double bed (ugh!) so we contacted the hotel directly before arrival to request a queen or king, and to let them know that we would be checking in late. The overnight front desk clerk was less than helpful and said that she knew of no such request, that we had a room with 2 double beds. We spent the first night there, the air conditioner was great (freezing) but there was hair in the bathtub (yuck). Also, it was a \"migraine room\", something that I experienced several years ago on a trip to NYC with a friend...all of the windows are blocked by different parts of the building, so the sun never comes through..not easy to wake up in the morning! Next morning we again requested the upgrade at the front desk, and were treated wonderfully by Vito (manager?) who upgraded us to a \"Junior Suite\", standard size room, which is large by NYC standards, great bedding and pillows, and outstanding views of the East river! I couldn't bring myself to complain about anything since they were so generous with the upgrade, but...the jacuzzi tub was unusable, even as a regular bathtub, since the drain plug didn't work, and when I pulled it up to possibly see what the problem was, the stench and rusty funk on it almost knocked me over. Suffice it to say we took showers. And the a/c barely blew, which was miserable since it was 90 degrees in New York last week. The Tudor has huge potential, but it needs some cleaning up.

If you've ever stayed in a full-sized Japanese hotel room, you know what to expect. However, it was really nice. Luxurious linens, very clean, and a great shower. They even provide a little gift bag containing (among other things) earplugs and a sleep mask, placed on each bed. Very thoughtful, considering that anywhere you stay in NYC, you're gonna hear some sirens. In the small stereo in the room, there's even a CD of new-agey fall-asleep music--which has hilarious commentary at the beginning. Check it out! The view out the window was of the building next door; but what else would it be? I walked past the lobby bar a few times, and it looked very nice, with lots of well-heeled-looking people having drinks there. It looked classy and cozy at the same time. The front-desk staff were also very nice, and checkin/checkout were a breeze. At just over $200 (corporate weekday rate), this wasn't a steal--but hey, it's New York. One other thing: I posted a comment on the hotel's website to suggest delivering some newspaper other than the USA Today in the mornings.

I had a room that had only two pillows and a small satin decorative pillow. The room was very clean and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The big negative here is the front desk staff. I encountered 4 different females at the front desk at various times during my stay. I am not a high maintenance guest, but found all of them to be rude and surly. The first impression was at checkin around 2 pm in the afternoon. There was a line of about 6 people. 2 attendants were at the front desk. One stopped in the middle of what she was doing to go in the back office and get money for food she had had delivered. She was in the back for 3-4 minutes getting money to pay the delivery guy I guess. When she finally got to me I said \"Good Afternoon!\" She rolled her eyes and said -\"Last name?\" On the second day of my stay, I called to the front desk to request a key for the minibar. I was told that the minibars are all out of service. I asked for a soda vending machine- I was told there were none. I asked where I could get a soda. I was told the restaurant was closed. I asked where the closest place I could get a soda would be. After a sigh-- (I am sorry for annoying this girl) but this should not be a difficult request. Another time I approached the front desk for directions. The young lady was on her cellular phone. She pointed for me to go to the bell stand for directions. The bellman was busy talking to the doorman, so I walked next door to the Helmsley and got directions there. It is really a shame, as this is a nice hotel. With new staff at the front desk, this could be an excellent hotel. I paid $400 and change per night. I received better service at some economy hotels.

I would stay there again but only if my arrangements were very srtaight forward and the rate was cheap enough.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Manhattan East", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93339-Reviews-Hilton_Manhattan_East-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$254 - $576*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">304 E. 42nd Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10017</span></span> (Formerly Tudor Hotel New York)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514625", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/79/e9/79e9e854e5282803ffe378f06739077a6large.jpg"}}
