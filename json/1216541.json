The only semi negative is the house keeping needs to take a little more time to detail. We had no towels or soap when we arrived and they didn't pick up like you would think. Really, dig stinking deal. We loved it. Were from Ohio so were use to non smoking everything. The smoke in the casino was noticable but not overwelming. We never went back to our room with the stench of smoke all over us. it was fine, no biggie. The dealers were awesome. Very helpful, informative and generous at times $$$$$. John is a great dealer, we always looked for his table. He was great to talk to and very explained the rules great. The entertainment was good at both the bars inside the casino. Neither drowned eachother out. If you want to go to Vegas but don't want to deal with the crowds on the strip and just want to relax this is the place to be.

Why spend $$$$$ on other hotels when we can stay here at a reasonable price, in comfort with exceptional views, every angle of Las Vegas.

Great sports bars with a lot of big screens/tvs for all you sports fanatics. Bank of America and Walmart directly across the street.

We avoid strip hotels, and while we enjoy the downtown experience, we're not as familiar with driving around downtown on weekend nights, so we looked for something off strip. The great service started with reservations. I was paying for two rooms for 3 different people, and didn't want to confuse the reservation system with my name on both reservations with different rooms on the same credit card. I emailed the hotel and got a quick response from the Director of Hotel Operations, who painlessly made the second reservation. I was impressed! When choosing our hotel we looked for value rates as well as casinos that could provide good cocktail service at our low roller rates. We were not disappointed! Parking was excellent, with lots of available spaces which dramatically cleared up after 6:30pm. This really is a locals place, so the early and late crowd did not exist on our trip. Checkin was fast, efficient, and we had no problems at all. The elevators were awkward, as you must swipe your room key before choosing your floor. With all our bags and checkin paperwork, it was a bit of a challenge. I appreciated the safety idea of needing it, but we saw a lot of people riding the elevator who were lost as to picking a floor, and simply got off when we did. Which reduced the appearance of safety, in my opinion. The rooms were HUGE! We had two queen beds on the 11th floor. The room was well appointed, with great views of the strip (if you placed your face against the glass), mountains, a local park, the subarbian houses close by, and in general peace and quiet. My one issue with the room is that it could have used another trash can. (How's that for nit-picking?!) Plugins were readily available both on the bathroom sink area as well as next to the table/lamp area. We paid $85 a night per room before taxes. We had a fridge, two comfy queen beds, a raised top/bar area seperating the bathroom and the living area which was convienent for throwing phones and items on before passing out in bed for the night. The flatscreen TV did not turn on in a deafening volume mode! There were a few hangers, and the lotion, and conditioned shampoo were appreciated by my husband. (I bring my own!) Our one issue with the hotel was lack of ice. Our floor (11) did not have ice, nor did floor 10, or 12. We did not complain, but our travel-mate did. She was told it was probably because people were filling up coolers. We found this hard to believe on Thursday night, Friday morning/afternoon/evening and Saturday morning. However, after she complained a few times the ice machines were working on our floor. We appreciated the response, and will definitely let the front desk know next time, if there are any issues. The casino staff was FANTASTIC! The dealers were great, the tables were cheap $5 BJ 3:2 payout, $2 roulette with 50 cent chips, $5 pai gow poker, and a ton of nickle video poker. There were tons of penny and nickel slot machines, and the types of games seemed to be fairly new, and a lot of fun. We were impressed with the promotions going on, but for people who only visit Vegas every 4-5 months we will probably not get the same response as locals, as their players club seems to reset points every 90 days. But we all got a pint of tequila and a pint of rum for our 3 days of play, and we entered into their Saturday night giveaways and one of us ended up winning $25! Not bad for a weekend promotion clean up!! Drink service was AMAZING! We really enjoyed the coffee shop, though their special was not impressive in cost or food amount (though it was yummy). I loved their country fried steak and eggs and biscuits and gravy was a great deal. This is not a traditional \"cheap\" eatery, but the food was hot, drink re-fills were quick in coming, and the service was friendly. We did not try the deli or room service. The hotel is across the street (almost directly) from a Bank of America, and Wal-Mart Supercenter. Awesome for us to fill up on soda and water for the room.

Just two years old (as of 8/10), the casino in the Eastside Cannery caters mostly to locals, but the hotel is not overlooked. Our very big room had floor-to-ceiling windows with a view toward the Strip. The place was spotless, and there was even a fridge (a rarity in LV), though, oddly, no coffeemaker. No big deal. Beds were very comfy with good pillows. Didn't go for the $13/day wireless Internet, but the big flat screen TV was nice. There's a coin laundry (3 washers/3 dryers) on the third floor, another rare find in this own. One thing: You must have a car to stay here. It's on Boulder Highway, about a 10-15 minute drive east of the strip. There's a bus that runs from the hotel along Flamingo Road, but LV bus service is notoriously awful, and can only be worse when it's 107 outside.

So I didn't hesitate to stay here again. This time I came away a little surprised. First off, was treated rather rudely at check-in. Upon arrival on Thursday for a three-night stay I was told that the king non-smoking room I had reserved six months prior was not available; that they only had eight king rooms in the whole hotel (That would surprise me). I accepted a double queen but asked about any possible free upgrades. From this point on the gentleman actually got snotty. He said no because I was staying three nights and he could only give me an upgrade for one night. He then threw (yes threw) my credit card and identification back on the counter so that I had to stop it from sliding across and on to the floor. He then did the same thing with the room key packet and basically dismissed us by turning his back without bothering to tell us what our room number was, where the elevators were (we at least already knew that) or even wishing us a good night. Horrible! The room, as last visit, was wonderfully clean, roomy, and very comfortable. Strange thing, though. We left the room on Friday at approximately 10am and returned about 8pm and the room had not been touched by housecleaning. We had to call down to get clean towels. The room was cleaned on Saturday fine. Again, strange. The gaming as always is very fair. You get to play and sometimes even win. The casino is roomy and really not very smoky unless you are sitting right next to a chain smoker. The cocktail waitresses are abundant and very friendly. It makes for a nice gaming session. We ate at two restaurants while there. Snaps is your standard 24-hour cafe/diner. The food is a bit average but the service is great and the prices are very reasonable. But had another interesting experience at Casa Cocina. Although the food here was VERY good the waiter was about as attention deficient as I have ever seen. For the most part we seemed to have to deal with the bus boy, who was at least accommodating. The waiter on the other hand showed up only to take the food order, delivered the meals (there were six of us) in spurts, and never bothered to check on how we were doing. We wanted to order another round of drinks but were never able to. All the while he was running around like the proverbial headless chicken and ended up dropping a meal on the floor at the table next to us where it sat for 10 minutes. It also took over 30 minutes to get our check after we finish, again without ever checking if we needed anything else (drinks, more drinks!). Next time we're here and want Mexican food we may just go over to Willy & Jose's at SamsTown about a block away. We'll see. I also noticed that their nightclub, Club One-Six was no longer open. Wasn't a big deal to me but thought it seemed popular last year. Another casualty of the Vegas economy I guess. Overall, not a bad stay, just weirdly non-consistent this visit.

Both the bride and groom are Las Vegas locals and when I see on the site, \"Voted #1 by locals\" I had pretty high expectations of a fun place. Check in was very smooth and our room was upgraded complimentary, which is a great start. The room was huge with very large whirlpool tub plus separate shower. Definitely the biggest room I have seen in Las Vegas. And the value per night was excellent. Generally, the service was good. Our room was cleaned everyday. The casino is well lite with many games to play. My disappointment was the casino was very smokey, to which it is Las Vegas and I did not expect a health spa or anything. But a smoke free room with a single treadmill or elliptical would have been appreciated. There are few healthy food options throughout the casino/hotel. When it comes to nearby spectacles, be like a local and take the bus because there isn't much within walking distance. Upon checking out, I left my make up in the room and when I realized a few hours later, my hours trying to recover my items was useless despite my cooperation with casino security. Two weeks later they sent the make up bag to me but all of the contents were gone. I know this is my fault for leaving it in the room, but it was disappointing that despite my recovery work my items were gone. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will stay on the strip.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida", "Title": "\u201cEastside Cannery Exceeds Expectations\u201d", "Author": "SteveGee", "ReviewID": "UR50966573", "Content": "In October I stayed at the Eastside Cannery for the first time.

We wanted to stay off the strip to save some $$ and we were on our way to the Grand Canyon anyway. If you have a car, it's easy enough to get to the strip or downtown. Originally, the check-in clerk put us on the 6th floor but after seeing the casino rooftop from our window, we went back to the desk and she gave us a room on the 11th floor without any problem. The rooms are large, with a floor-to-ceiling window. Beds were very comfortable. There was no smoke smell outside of the casino and it was very quiet all night. The casino itself was large with a good variety of new slots and $5 BJ tables. Drink service was very good. It was really quiet in there on Thursday night, a little more crowded on Friday but still easy to get any machine or get a seat at a BJ table. I found the slots by the elevators to be tight but they seemed a little better on the other side of the casino. My wife and I played for several hours and came out fairly even.

The whole hotel is only a few years old. The window in the room was huge floor to ceiling glass with an awesome view of the Vegas lights very beautiful. The staff seemed spaced out and indifferent. They weren't particularly rude or anything they just seemed out of it. It was a little disturbing. The only real negative to this hotel and its a big one is the stench in the lobby. It reeked of cigarette smoke- the smelliest cheapest cigarettes I am sure. It was so bad that by the time you got to your room you felt dirty and contaminated which really detracted from the beautiful room. The elevator was horribly stinky as well. Another thing which disgusted me was that this casino was very popular with the local gambling trash (apparently the winnings were good here) and they were here in droves. I do not like seeing a bunch of smelly trashy people on the way up to my room on a daily basis- so although the price was unbelievably low and the room was great I'm not sure I would stay here again or feel comfortable recommending this to a friend.

Not bothered being off strip as this was not a first or second visit to Las Vegas. We have stayed on strip, off strip and downtown before plus we always have a car. The hotel is OK but I don't think we will ever return to stay, maybe to eat as the food is good. We actually prefer next door to this hotel, Sam's Town for ambience. The room was nice with large window's and also kept clean. From the look of the fitting's they look like they will age quickly, so in a few short year's the place could look pretty tired. We did not eat at their buffet, it had just reopened but when we went it was seafood night which is not our favorite. We did eat at their sister hotel the Cannery and that was very good, one of the better one's and very reasonably priced. If the Eastside's is as good as that one, it would be worth the effort to go back. We tried using the pool, saw the wristband thingy but ignored it as there were only a handfull of people there and the attendant never asked. There was a family with 3 kids turned up after about 10 min's and the kid's were screaming their head's off and anoying everyone, so within 20 min's they had the pool to themselves as everyone left.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "az", "Title": "\u201cThe greatest decision in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "cbrownsfan42", "ReviewID": "UR31891834", "Content": "I recently traveled to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker. I booked 1 week at the Eastside Cannery. Just a side note i have stayed at about 30 different casinos in Vegas. This place is amazing. Quick check in complimented with coupons and a friendly desk person. The rooms are better then advertised. plenty of room and seating within the room. The bathtub could fit 2 people very comfortably. Housekeeping is immediate as well is the room service. The buffet is one of the best in town and the hotel provides you with 2 for 1 coupons at the players club desk. delicious cuts of prime rib, italian, chinese and american food is always provided. On wednesday the seafood buffet is second to none. I earned enough points at a couple hours of gaming to get 2 free seafood buffet coupons. The gaming center is great too. the dealers are all friendly and the floor managers are very socialable and helpful. With many table games and slots to play you will always have something to do. They hae a small poker room but it is more then enough to host there nightly texas hold em tourney. $25 entry and a pretty good pay out if you cash. The bar also has a really good band to provide you with live music any evening. As a matter of fact the casino was so much fun I never made it to the rooftop lounge. (sorry). Traveling to the strip was never more then 10 minutes, even during rush hour. And for $30 a night this place is weel worth the short drive. I have no complaints about this place and if they continue down the same path i will be staying here every year I come to Vegas.
