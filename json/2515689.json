Room was average, nothing special...overall I have stayed in nicer Embassy Suites. Not a whole lot around the immediate area for places to eat/things to do. If your wanting to stay at a decent place away from the noise/crazyness of the strip for a pretty good price then this place would be right up your alley.

But one very big \"but\" The morning front staff agent Ricky was rather rude to many guests. I saw him blow off a couple who came in early to make sure that they had a group of rooms booked together and had been directed by Hilton reservations to do exactly hat upon arrival. He rudely dismissed them with a \"I don't have time for this\". They went for a walk but that was ridiculous. I saw him repeat his behavior several times during my stay, always acting stressed out and as if guests were an encumbrance. If he was doing back office work, he should have stayed in the back office where he wasn't going to be disturbed. I needed some pain medication and noted that the pantry was out. He gave me an attitude when I pointed it out. Then when I asked if perhaps they had some stock in the back he snidely said \"Oh we can't dispense medication!\" That's not what I asked. I wasn't asking for him to dispense my prescription medication. They lost a simple sale with a really high profit margin; that's ridiculous! I was fine with the flight path on take off being right outside my window. The overall cleanliness was acceptable, only a small deficiency and housekeeping did a great job overall. The shuttle to the airport supposedly ran every hour at the top of the hour and to the Strip (the loose definition thereof) but actually it didn't run between 1130 and 4PM. Why? Also the shuttle doesn't run from the airport? Seriously? Sure a cab isn't that much, but if you have the shuttle, why not use it? The line for cabs when we arrived at LAS was a couple hundred deep and took 30 plus minutes in the heat. The website indicates I need to call the hotel to find out that there's no shuttle? Bad service. The final straw was when we needed to go to the airport. The shuttle didn't run at noon. I asked the front staff to call a cab, and I got blown off again.

This particular hotel is not of the quality I expect of this chain. The facility is worn and outdated, especially the rooms which need serious upgrade to the bathroom, furniture, and mattresses. The service is also lacking compared to what I usually find at Embassy Suites. They list airport shuttle as an amenity but do not mention that it only takes you to the airport with no pick up from airport requiring a $15.00 taxi ride. In addition, the shuttle only operates within limited hours both the strip and the airport--NOT operating between 11:30 am and 4:30 pm with last evening runs at 10:00pm. These shuttle hours require the use of taxis at other times which makes the lower cost of this hotel come closer to the more luxurious hotels on the strip. The 1 1/2 mile walk to the srtip would not be a good idea at night or in the summer. The breakfast is good but the evening manager's reception has a sign asking that guests limit themselves to 1 drink in contrast to other Embassy Suites that have no limit on drinks and provide delicious appetizers (here they provide goldfish, pretzels, chips and popcorn.

We went out and got back to our room after 4 pm and it still hadn't been cleaned. Mind you, we were on the 6th floor, the so-called gold/diamond floor and you think they would start there. When we used the hot tub in the morning the area surrounding the tub was covered by discarded cups and snack cartons from the evening before. It couldn't have been grosser. I have always wondered why people put their pizza boxes and other items outside their doors, but they do. When we got back to our room after dinner, someone a few doors down had left the remnants of a fast food meal outside his door. Someone else must have kicked them and there were french fries scattered across the corridor. We called the front desk and they said they'd take care of it. The fries were still there in the morning. Going on, we got into bed on our first night only to realize that there was no TV in the bedroom. Very strange. They brought one the next morning.

All rooms are suites, and the bedrooms are separated from the interior of the hotel by two heavy doors and the additional room. We didn't hear a thing. The biggest surprise was the amazing, cooked to order breakfast that's available to all guests every day. There are a couple of chefs on duty to take breakfast orders. The pancake batter was fresh and the omelets were fantastic! I was so impressed. THEN, there is a FREE Happy hour for a couple of hours every night where the drinks are on the house. My wife and I aren't serious drinkers and only took advantage one of the three nights we stayed. I had never seen that before. They weren't stingy on the drinks either. So - 1 - quiet 2 - close to the airport, the strip, and UNLV 3 - free delicious breakfasts 4 - free Happy hour every night 5 - very reasonably priced 6 - no casino.

Coffee Bar: Coffee maker did not work (replaced), refrigerator did not fit, stuck out 2+ inches, was slanted so door could not open all the way. Old, uncomfortable and mis-matched furniture. Old fashioned striped carpet. Lamp plug-in for laptop did not work. No HBO or normal Pay-Per-View movies. Atruim is dark with old-fashioned dark green carpet, plants with two swans messing up the water feature...all just so 70's. Again, I LIKE Embassy Suites!!

Not quite sure why they are kept indoors in a chlorinated pond! In any case, the 6-floor complex is situated near to the airport and has a good shuttle service to the airport and indeed to the Strip. It is doable by foot, but no dohbt in the summer, you would be glad of the air-conditioned shuttle service. Check in was a problem when as Diamond cardholder you are told that there is a room ready but the manager won't release till closer to the standard check-in time. We were allocated a suite on the sixth floor: the HHonors floor, but we are still not sure what the difference was between these suites and the other suites on floors 1 to 5! The suite itself was boxy and not as large as we have had at other properties. The decor was good but the soft furnishings were dated, especially the bathroom. We asked for the sofa bed to be made up so on return from our show, we could get our son into his bed quickly. The check-in staff member looked inquisitively at us, and surly replied \"ok\" with a rather unusual expression. The problem was that there were no extra pillows etc in the closet. On return, one of the seat cushions had been tossed up on the sofa and nothing else had been done...still no pillows etc...fed up, we popped two on the sofabed from the main bedroom. The evening noise in the hotel was not caused by the guests but by the powerful winds whipping up fans built into the walls, fairly close to our suite. The same receptionist as earlier in the evening couldn't have been less interested and offered to send an engineer to look at the problem. Half an hour later the racket was still as bad and the receptionist again was totally disinterested and couldn't update us on what the engineer had sorted...or not in this case! Breakfast was illogically set up, with two staff members having a great conversation in Spanish whilst the guests were waiting for tables. All they did whilst breakfast was in full swing was clear tables when it suited them. There was no hot water for tea and the orange juice machine was just dispensing water... The chef, however, ran his own efficient show and was cooking all the breakfasts extremely well and in an organised fashion! Check out was brisk as the manager just winked and said I was all set, even though I hadn't seen a bill. The system was down and was promised an email with the bill...still waiting! Not impressed!

Anyone can enter, break and enter, and do just about whatever they want to as if by the hotel managers approval. They are apathetic and nonchalant in attitude.

It got really good reviews and it was a great price for being relatively near the strip ($132/night with the AAA discount) so why not? Biggest mistake ever. First of all, my itinerary said that the total (including taxes) would be about $443. When I checked in, the lady told me it would be $510! She didn't even ask for my AAA ID even though it was \"required\" to receive that rate. We even got someone on the phone on the 800 line who CONFIRMED and told her that that was the amount we were to pay. I asked her why the price was increased and she kept saying \"oh well, that's what it says in the computer so I can't do much abut that\" Uh, what kind of explanation is that? After trying to make sense out the rate increase with her (She was completely incompetent) my boyfriend stepped in. She then says \"Oh well, we require a deposit. I explained that to her\" (which she did NOT) And another thing, I had no idea there would be a deposit! There was no mention of that ANYWHERE. Basically, I did not have enough money in my account to pay for the room at that moment, so they authorized me for $300 and I would pay the rest later, which was nice, don't get me wrong. But oh boy I felt like a fool later on. I went back the following day to pay the rest since I came up with the money, and was told my total would be $473, since the guy was \"nice\" enough to only charge us $30 for a deposit. That was complete b/s by the way. By the time it came for us to check out, they sent us a bill for $590! WAY over what I was told, and I was told about 3 different amounts for how much our stay would be! COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. We hassled the manager and he said the best he could do was take off $50 (he was a complete tool to us by the way, overly fake nice but extremely rude). I could keep complaining but bottom line: DOUBLE CHECK HOW MUCH THEY ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU. I paid over $100 what I was expecting to pay which no one should ever have to deal with. They also neglected our room, we asked for extra towels and blankets which never came. The rooms are nice and quiet, but hell I would have rather slept on the damn street in the Nevada summer heat had I known I would have to put up with that.

You'll need to rely on cabs (which are easily accessible in Vegas) or the hotel shuttle, which runs to Planet Hollywood every half hour by request. -If you're coming from the airport, DO NOT TAKE A CAB!

The breakfast was very good - plenty of choice of cereals, bread, cakes, fruit and drinks - and the freshly cooked omelettes were excellent. The hotel runs a free shuttle to the strip between 7.00 and 10.00 am and between 4.00 and 7.00 pm. - and also to the airport. Shuttle drivers were helpful and polite. I feel it would probably be better for guests if the shuttle to the strip ran between 9 and 12 noon as most people don't want to miss breakfast or have to get up so early on holiday. The decor in this hotel on Swenson Street was a little 'tired' - but not scruffy and it was immaculate. We felt a little sorry for the chefs and waiters as hardly anybody ate in the hotel in the evening - I suppost some people used room service. We ate there twice when we were too tired to go out again - the service was fine and the food was good though not gourmet ! It was fun to see Elvis and Priscilla the two swans who live in the pool in the atrium - they seemed very happy to be there. Our one complaint was that whilst we were there a group of teenage girl basket ball players were staying - and they were very noisy - leaning over the balconies and calling to each other - in typical giggly l4 year old manner. We felt the staff should have asked them to consider other guests. Once in our room we did not hear any outside or room to room noise. As the hotel is family friendly there are often a lot of children staying. The swimming pool outside was very pleasant. All in all a very reasonably priced hotel with great staff.

I realize that they're designated as the Embassy Suites Las Vegas \"Airport\", but I've had stays at hotels at the actual airport or connected property, but did not have this problem (Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport, Hilton Boston Logan Airport). If you're in a room facing Swenson, then prepare for noise and the room rattling. You're right below the flight line of the airplanes. I recommend requesting a room on the Paradise road side to minimize the noise.

Partly selected this property because of the nice outdoor pool area. Then the Health Department closed the pool our only whole day there (it was still closed upon checkout June 4). That in itself raises some concerns about the pool service. The management offered to shuttle us to the other Embassy Suites to use their pool. We chose to drive ourselves, and my kids did enjoy the indoor pool, but it was not nearly as nice as the Swenson property. 2. We were in room 624 - NOT an updated room, although my mother-in-law in 626 had an updated room (flat screen TV's, newer entertainment centers). Do I really care about watching a nice TV in Vegas? No. But why is one room updated, the other not, both on the Hilton Honors floor? 3. A/C issues - both nights we had problems with the room getting stuffy and the air not running properly. Tried turning down the temp - not much happened. Not great sleeping conditions. 4. Walls are thin between rooms. Each morning I heard the phone ringing for my neighbors wake up call (AT 5:45!) and then could clearly hear their cell phone ringing several times - I even got out of bed thinking it was my phone ringing. PROS 1. As others have said, the breakfast service is great. Nice selection, plus the cooks are personable and efficient. 2. Beds are very comfortable, and the rooms are spacious (the reason we chose this hotel). Nice large refrigerator and microwave, in case you have leftovers from one of the fancy restaurants in Vegas. 3. Parking is easy and a short walk to your hotel room. I like that there is no casino, especially when traveling with teenagers. 4. Location is good, and although I did not use their casino shuttle, it was nice to have it as an option.

Greeted when we walked in with a smile, William (Front Desk Supervisor) was incredibly helpful not only with getting us checked in promptly, but with our questions of the nearest casino, shuttle services, the resort ammenities. He was a dream employee, I kid you not, and Embassy Suites should be thankful they have someone like him. Next was our room, located on the 6th floor (newly renovated from what William told us). This room had everything we needed and a very nice layout. Two large flat screen TV's, microwave, kitchen sink, refrigerator, if we were staying longer than we were (2 nights) we could have made our breakfasts.. but wait.. they were free! We didn't take advantage of the complimentary hot breakfast the first day, however the second we did. And like I read on another review, these guys wowed us. Although there was a line-up, it went fast, and the chefs (2 of them) were very quick and extremely accommodating to all requests I noticed in the line. Managers Hour was for a few hours in the evening and included some appetizers, as well as free drinks. What a treat! A great way to start the evening off in my opinion, which is what we did both nights we were there. Finally, I have to mention the staff again. They REALLY do make a difference in your stay. Ralph (the hotel Ambassador) never left the lobby floor when people were around, and you could see him constantly speaking to guests and I can tell you that he spoke to us on many occasions just to make sure all was going ok and to make small talk, an incredible, incredible way to make someone feel welcome and at home. The shuttle drivers were also incredible helpful. What I thought were set schedules to and from the strip and airport, became 'where do you want to go?' and 'I can pick you up after', as we took advantage of their wonderful services, I tipped as much as a cab would have taken I'm sure, but in my opinion, these guys were worth it.

And I would recommend and re-recommend this property as a choice place to stay in Vegas, even if it is a few minutes off the strip!", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Jewel In The Desert, One Of The Best!!!!\u201d", "Author": "muttnjazz", "ReviewID": "UR15206892", "Content": "We stayed at Embassy Suites on Swenson last month to attend a conference and have a short vacation.

I've stayed at Hilton Grand Vacation and the Embassy Suites on Paradise in the past, and they have nothing on Embassy Suites Las Vegas. The hotel also has just completed the their renovations and the suites are welcoming... even have flat screen tvs. The outdoor pool is an oasis in itself.

After a long flight and getting lost on our way to the hotel (since we forgot to print directions), we checked in and were given a 6th floor room (which is reserved for Hilton Honors members) facing Swenson right next to the elevator. Because I had read negative comments about being right near the elevator and hearing planes, I was a little skeptical. To my delight, I never heard anyone in the hallway or at the elevator, and was never woken by a plane (and I'm a light sleeper). In fact, even during the day we hardly ever heard planes overhead. Ralph went out of his way to welcome us and greet us every morning during breakfast, and evening at the manager's reception. All the staff was friendly, and at least attempted to be helpful (we asked for directions and we were sent completely in the wrong direction). :) The breakfast is amazing. I had cooked to order omelets, pancakes or French toast every morning. The grill cooks are efficient and the food is wonderful. We only had more than a couple minute wait the first day when we got in line behind a group that was staying at the hotel for a convention. The facility is very well cared for and the rooms are very comfortable. The beds were better than most hotels. Throughout our week there were always conferences going on, and lots of kids running around, but they never disturbed us. Even the 10-18 yr. old cheerleaders were well behaved and kept in their own row of rooms several floors below us. The \"restaurant\" is in the atrium. It is sort of segmented off, but it definitely doesn't work for the upscale atmosphere I would like in a more expensive restaurant. We had lunch there one day, and a light dinner another evening- the Strawberry Chicken Salad is heaven. The one thing that was consistently negative was that the service was extremely slow. We didn't have plans to go anywhere, so it didn't matter, but it was still a nuisance. The pool area and fitness center are exceptional. The gift shop is a joke. Go to a real souvenir shop and save yourself lots of money (two postcards with stamps cost me over $7). As we were preparing to leave, we were offered the chance to store our luggage in the bell closet until our plane left several hours after we checked out. All in all, I would rebook with this hotel in a heartbeat. Being away from the strip, but within a 5 minute drive was great. We could get away from the hustle and bustle when we were ready to relax, and had a great time while we were there.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal get away from the hustle and bustle\u201d", "Author": "cam405", "ReviewID": "UR15179679", "Content": "We stayed at the Embassy suites for 4 nights. Initially I was afraid that we would be too far out of things but the hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the strip every hour (and also one to the airport). The driver will pick you up at other times if you require. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and feel the choice not to stay on the strip was the correct one. We visited several hotels and found them too big. The queues to check in /out were long and I found the atmosphere a bit anonymous. On the other hand we saw our hotel manager several times during our visit. He mucked in clearing tables etc if required. I liked the family feel to this hotel. The kids loved the pool and we used it as a way to break up out day. The adults loved the mangers reception with free drinks and snacks between 5.30 -7.30. The cook to order breakfast is fabulous with omlettes with several fillings to pancakes and waffles. There is also a hot buffet or fresh fruit, cereal, pastries. Really great value for families. Our kids loved the resident swans and got to feed them. The accomodation was very good with 2 LCD TV's. I was annoyed however by the table in the centre of the room which was an obstruction when preparing the sofa bed for the kids every night. The room had a safe and fridge. If i was visiting Las Vegas again I would definately stay there again. We did hear some noise from the planes but not enough to be a problem.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "omaha ne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Great Service\u201d", "Author": "maverick1974", "ReviewID": "UR14751895", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 3 nites with our 2kids. Here are the things we liked about the hotel. 1. Best exercise room ever for a htl. Great elypticals and treadmills with cardio theatre on each machine. Good free weights. Just an outstanding exercise room. Even provided earphones for the tv's. 2. Breakfast was great. If you were a little later in the A.M. the line for omelets was a little long but you could go to the separate station for scrambled eggsand bacon and continental with no waiting. A+ service down there. 3. Nice van service to both airport and the strip that ran once an hour. Definitely take the van to the strip and not your car. The strip is wall to wall cars all day and is absolutely no fun to drive at all in. Don't bring car to strip!!! 4. Occasionally I could hear a plane from the airport but for the most part the hotel was really quiet considering how close to airport it is and the fact there were a bunch of kids in the htl for spring break. 6. The suite was really nice with great flat screen tv's and lots of channels. The living room seemed a little smaller than some embassies but not much. 5. My kids loved the 2 swans in the lobby. Also, loved the fresh .lemon water in the lobby. Nice touch 6. The help at the front desk was first rate. I had a couple of requests that I called down for and they responded very quickly. When we would come back in for the evening the help at the front desk would always welcome us back which was a nice touch. 7. Had dinner in the restaurant and that too was great. I have stayed in many embassy suites over the years and this one is as good as it gets. 8. I enjoyed the free internet and printing in the lobby. They only had one computer but there was big sign saying there was a 15min. max. time so the computer was free much of the time. If I had one wish it would have been to have a little more heat in the outdoor pool. They said it was heated but it was mighty cold in that pool. If you are looking for a non gaming htl this is a great option.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Las Vegas Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d97971-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Las_Vegas_Airport-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$133 - $190*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4315 Swenson Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89119</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515689", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/25/f3/67/relax-by-the-pool.jpg"}}
