Very smart and full of promise, what a shame when we opened the bedroom door! The first thing that I noticed was that there was no light for the room. Hmmm, yes there was a light switch but no light, not even a socket to put a bulb in, the room was entirely lit by 3 small lamps from the 1950's. But surely this wasn't that bad, as the room was so small my mobile phone could have sufficed to illuminate the whole room. Air con was supplied by a fan (also from the 50's...), and the window only opened a few inches. The bathroom looked nice, however the toilet didn't properly flush and filled to the brim every flush. Both myself and my girlfriend found that by our third night, we had come out in suspicious rashes on our skin where we had been in contact with the bedding. Perhaps the most worrying thing has to be when the head maid, who obvioulsy is only doing her job, helps herself to walk into your room whenever she chooses (in this case early evening...) without knocking. Yes the location is great, just 1 min walk to Tottenham Court Road and 5 mins walk to Covent Garden, but at \u00a3100 a night (without breakfast....!), I wouldn't recommend this.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundalk, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWeekend in London\u201d", "Author": "gearoidoneill", "ReviewID": "UR127283750", "Content": "Great location, right at the end of Oxford St, and right beside an underground station - extremely handy!!

I booked a month in advance on a \u00a399.00 deal, the usual price for this room was apparently \u00a3150.00, the hotel was in a good location for what I needed but there is where the good points end. I booked a Double Room, they \"up graded me to a tripped\" (now I know your thinking, WOW what are you moaning about), the bed was smaller than a standard double and no way 2 people could sleep comfortably in it, the room was pokey and if you were clostrophobic then neither the room or bathroom would have been good for you. we called reception and they changed our room with no argument, though they were adement I had booked a tripple, ( I didnt, I had teh conformation!) we were polite about it, so we went back down to collect the new key, on approaching the desk we spoke to the receptionist who was sarcasic about the bed size telling us that it was about an inch bigger (it was at least half a foot or more bigger) she also told us that the room used to be a deluxe but they had changed it to a standard. So we were actually looking forward to a better room BIG MISTAKE, if I had a cat and swung it, it would have severe brain damage, the toliet when filling up after flushing made a loud tapping noise and was no bigger than the claustrophobic one we had just left behind, the airconditioning unit was out of the dark ages and made so much noise a jet landing would have been quieter. The window in the room only opened 6 inches and faced a wall. We were not staying in the room, lucky for us we were going out which i was glad of. On returning to the hotel you had to wait for the lift as they were always full up, 4 lifts for 600 rooms! though on the positive side, they were bigger than our room! Once we got back to the room it was still feeling stuffy though we had opened the window (to its full 6 inchs) so we had to have a fan on, it was not until I discovered a heater under the vanity unit, behind a dirty cage that was still on, and you got it! the valve was broken so it could not be turned off, so we had to try and sleep with the fan running all night. My advice, book a Premier Inn, there rooms are 100 times better, you get a King Bed, bathroom with a bath and space to swing your brain damaged caty and poilte staff, I know I stay in enough of them when I travel for work, I should have just booked with them, because they are all the same you know what you are getting.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "lytham", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant location\u201d", "Author": "blackpoolmanLytham", "ReviewID": "UR127040632", "Content": "This hotel is brilliantly located yards away from tottenham court road tube station and a short walk to Oxford street.

And there are some good things about this hotel. It is very conveniently located, two minutes\u2019 walk from Tottenham Court Road tube. It is clean. The staff are unfailingly friendly and helpful. There is an ironing room, very useful for someone who has just unpacked his dress shirt en route to a formal dinner. And then the irritations start. The \u201cmini-suite\u201d is just big enough for a double bed but although there are switches either side of the bed there is only one bedside light. There is minimal storage and no drawer space, and a large, immobile chair obstructs access to what storage there is. The triple glazed windows do a reasonable job of keeping the traffic noise out but you cannot sleep with the air-conditioning on. The complimentary tea and coffee does not include either decaff coffee or cocoa, so forget about a nightcap. Waiting interminably for the lift from the second floor, I generally concluded that life was too short and went down the stairs instead. The St Giles\u2019 allows its guests concessionary use of the superbly equipped gym at the central YMCA next door. Why does all the literature in the hotel say, and the concierge repeat, the mealy-mouthed formula that there \u201cis a nominal charge for it\u201d? It\u2019s a fiver. That\u2019s not at all unreasonable for a first rate gym in Central London. But you have to guess how much money to take with you, and it\u2019s another irritation. As is the fact that the swimming pool is closed for a fortnight for maintenance work, but they don\u2019t warn you about this in advance, so you roll up with swimming things packed in your suitcase which you won\u2019t be able to use. Yes, I know there is an alternative pool half a mile away, but there is a big difference between having a pool on-site and having to go elsewhere. Breakfast isn\u2019t at all bad (confusingly, having booked room only we were informed that we were entitled to a complimentary breakfast, but I am not complaining) though five somewhat desiccated button mushrooms looked lonely on the plate, and still looked lonely when accompanied by a slight littering of chopped chive. There must be a reason why the complimentary newspapers on offer are the Irish Times and the Irish Independent. I wouldn\u2019t particularly object to staying here again, but the irritations are such that I wouldn\u2019t rush to do so either.

Tottenham Court Tube station is a 2 minute walk and Oxford Street/Bond Street is 5 minutes away.

Location wise, it couldn't be better. Just over the road from Tottenham Court Road tube station, and only 15 minutes walk from Covent Garden. The building itself is not good looking at all, a horrendous piece of architecture, but the reception area is okay, and I was beginning to think that things were looking up. The room was a twin, wasn't very big, but for one night on business, it was fine. Clean and comfortable. The bathroom was stupidly small. It's amazing how they fit everything in there. Breakfast was a complete nightmare. I hadn't booked breakfast with the room, so was informed that it would be \u00a39.95. Pretty much average for hotel breakfasts, so I agreed. When staying in a hotel, breakfast is usually a fairly relaxing experience. Take a seat, order some coffee and a couple of rounds of toast and peruse the menu. NOT in this hotel. It's self service so you have to grab a tray and then queue for anything unto 20 minutes in order to get a hot breakfast. On the way to the hot food I passed a tray of croissants, bread rolls, cheese, ham etc. After grabbing some hot food, I made my way over to the juice, only to be told that there wasn't any orange. Okay, coffee then! Then I looked for a table. The place was packed and people were having to share tables, which were packed in so tightly and I had to get up and move at least four times to let other people leave the table or get to a seat. My hot breakfast was a bit of a letdown, so I decided that some toast would have to do. After walking around looking for toast, I asked a member of staff, who informed me that they 'don't do toast'. What? A hotel that can't provide toast at breakfast? Instead I was offered croissants or a bread roll! Not quite the same thing. The only way that I can describe breakfast is that it's like a busy service station. Too many people, no where to sit, and poor food. Never again! The hotel itself is fine. Great location and okay rooms, although it needs some serious updating. And the lifts are very slow.

Swift and efficient check in / out. However, from there on in it significantly goes downhill fast. The corridors are old and tired - a labyrinth of corridors, all tatty and in need of recordation and new carpets - ASAP. My friend and I stayed in a twin room for two nights and although we weren't in them long there were extremely claustrophobic. Again decor and carpet need lots of attention. We stayed at the rear of the hotel and on the Friday night we got no sleep at all - noisy bar or club downstairs that went on through the night - boom, boom, boom noises constantly... Breakfast is a complete joke - I appreciate we stayed the weekend before Xmas 2011, however it was so overcrowded I wished we'd not booked breakfast and eaten out. The large breakfast room was completely self service once you'd entered, and the stations with the food were so inadequate - my friend queued for a cooked breakfast for over 20 minutes and having still not gotten sight of the front of the queue decided against it... So much of the food had run out and was not replaced on either morning. Waiting staff did nothing but clear tables, hardly any replenishing took place. Our first morning we were saved by having a croissant (remind me how much we'd paid for the room including breakfast) and a coffee. Our second no croissant in sight even though we were in the room for 30+ minutes. Finally, whoever heard of a hotel that didn't serve toast at breakfast??? I stay in a fair amount of hotels on pleasure and business - in this country and others, and not once has there never been toast!!!!

The lobby is impressive, marble and very well presented - it looks like you are staying somewhere very classy. You also have access to a swimming pool - and you can tell because the smell of chlorine overpowers reception. Check-in was quick and easy and staff excellent. The negatives are the rooms - they are small (average I suppose for London) but they are dated (tv's are quite good), carpet and sheets very old fashioned and carpet in room and in halls is torn and frayed. It was, however, clean. Overall I would not say don't stay at St Giles, for its price (I paid \u00a390) it's more than acceptable for London and for work or if you are only going to be in the room for a short time or a few days.

We walked for 20mins trying to get shelter as taxis were taking an hour or longer just in Covent Garden to be arranged due to weather conditions. My nan and my aunts were in their early 70's but getting them into the warmth was priority. I rang my husband to try get him to find us a place to stay but having managed to walk around we came across to the St Giles a big hotel with a very helpfull and politefull door man Dave whom met us on arrival, my aunt and i went up stairs to try ask for a room or beg that they would put us up for the night knowing prices for a Friday was to deter us away or just being told no rooms, however a big saviour at last as one of the young kind hearted gentlemen; Shihab on his way up to the desk greeted us. I was tierd and cold and although a bit rudley asked if he could help us only knowing he was the night manager through the warm conversation by offering a room. He did what he could, as we waited patiently least in the warmth reasured by the security man Bart that Shihab would be more then going out of his own way to arrange a room for my elderly nan & friends and kindly assisting to finding the rest of us a close room at the My Hotel just the opposite road from the St Giles and putting in a plead for the prices qouted. So thank you. We took what he had presented us with & i must say we was delighted at being able to be provided of such delightfull service in the middle of snow struck London.

Having read on tripadvisor about the lifts i e mail ahead and asked for a low floor i got the first floor and a recently refurbed room. It takes a while to get used to the set out and after 2 days i still did not find the stairs although i did not look to hard. As the lifts were ok and we were always lucky, by the lifts is a vending machine with chocolate crips soft drinks and beer, this was great for late night munchies. Did not bother to unpack as only there for 2 nights, was surpised to see in the bathroom only 1 hand towel and 1 bath towel for the two of us also only one pillow each had i unpacked would have found extra of each in the wardrobe , found them the next day. The room is possibly the smallest ive ever stayed in but it was clean as ok for a couple of days would have asked for a larger room if staying longer. Also found the room a little cold had the heating turned up full and because of the snow not warm enough but for all the time we were in the room not too much of a problem. later we walked to covent garden took us about 30 mins ate there walked back went to see the show, after the show went into the hotel bar for a night cap the service was very good Had a good night sleep no noise either inside or out. Breakfast went down just before 8 no problem got seated straight away and yes because it is self service has a bit of a canteen effect and like others have said miss a bit of toast, but i was happy enough with the choice, fruit, yogurt, pastries, cold ham and cheese, boiled egg, jams, cerals, bread rolls and the hot choice of scrambled egg, sausages,bacon,has brown and beans, left me full enough. This day walked to leicter square again about 30 mins.

I come to London around once a month and am limited to cheaper hotels by my employer's budget. I've stayed in a few hotels in the area which are roughly the same price per night and they are generally acceptable. The hotel is big and very busy, which you would expect for a hotel which is so well positioned. I was allocated room 729 which I knew was a twin room. When I got in to the room it was really warm and smelled stale, so I looked for the air conditioning controls, only to find that there isn't any air con, there was a fan in the cupboard, but all of the plug sockets were so far away from the bed I wouldn't have been able to position it anywhere useful. Another thing I noticed was that the room didn't have curtains, it had some venetian blinds inside the two panes which made up the window. The blinds did nothing to keep out the bright blue light which was outside my window, which made my room really bright (it looked like there was a sunbed on directly outside my window). As my room was positioned near the lifts I expected noise, but wasn't prepared for the relentless noise well into the early hours. Every time a lift comes to the floor it chimes loudly like a door bell, not once, but 4 times (although one lift chimes 6 times - I know this detail because I was kept awake until roughly 2.00am listening to it). Why the lifts have to do this I really don't know, I find it hard to believe that I am the first person to complain about this. The doors bang quite loudly on some of the lifts too which is irritating. The bathroom was very small, but functional, there is a huge amount of storage space in the room too, so I imagine if you are in the room for a long time this would be a bonus. I had breakfast included in my room rate, I went down for breakfast at 6.30am, so I could try and beat the rush which I have read about in other reviews. Breakfast is really basic, not much selection, but what was there was of ok quality. Bit surprised that there was no toast though. I think looking at the other reviews of this hotel it is the luck of the draw whether you get a good room or a bad room.

It is also really handy for the British Museum. It is also practically on the top of Tottenham Court Road Underground station, this gives access to both the Northern Line and the Central Line. In a few years, 2017 I think, this will also be really close to the new Crossrail Line that is currently being build. This is not a laid back hotel by any stretch of the imagination, you know that it is a big hotel as soon as you walk in the reception area. Having said that there has always been enough staff on hand to check you in swiftly. The rooms vary in terms of size, if you book a single room the room is really, really small, however if you book a bigger room then there really is plenty of room, i.e. you get what you pay for in terms of size. The hotel has a really cool bar on the ground floor, not the cheapest place to drink, but does give you a feeling of being in the buzz of central London. Many hotels have vending machines and ice machines on each floor, however this is the only hotel that I have ever come across where you can get cans of larger from these vending machines which I think is a really nice touch if you get back to the hotel and want an ice cold beer in your room. Just one thing that isn't a bad thing, but that you probably need to be aware of is that the breakfast is not what you might expect. It is very much like a mass canteen and is probably the only part of the hotel that lets the rest down. I think that they have to run the breakfast like this because of the size of the hotel. As I say, this should not put you off visiting, but if you're really into your full English breakfast this will not rank amongst the best you will have ever tried! The prices for the St Giles are usually fair, especially for it's location. It is not what you would call a hotel with the personal touch and you could feel like you are one of many many people staying there.

Always check you get the excellent value buffet breakfast included, we did not ,one year and missed out,getting Coffe'n Go instead (our fault). This year we checked in at 11-45 am with no problem. Yes the rooms are not massive, but what do you need for an overnight stay. The bed is comfortable and there are extra pillows. There is a kettle for a reviving cuppa and no problem getting extra coffee, milk etc. The bathroom was large enough and very clean, with a powerful hot shower. We were warned at reception that breakfast would be busy around 9 am and to avoid that time if possible. We went a little later and had no problem. The hot food is cooked fresh and an array of options on other items, including fruit, cheese, ham, cereal, etc, to satisfy the multi national guests. If you start your day hungry, you are an extremely fussy eater. You can leave your luggage at the concierge desk for no charge( we always leave a small tip), if you want to have a stroll round central London. You are a few steps from Oxford St, Covent Garden and the West End. It's only a 10-15 min stroll to Trafalgar Sq and then on to all the other main tourist attractions. Check out the various hotel booking sites on the internet for a few mins and you will always get a good deal on the St Giles. It always ticks the boxes for our annual theatre trips.( by the way- go to the Leicester Sq ticket booths, for half price or less, theatre tickets)", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and not as bad as I thought after reading these reviews!\u201d", "Author": "Jack2955", "ReviewID": "UR122346531", "Content": "After reading all of the reviews on here I was not looking forward to our stay but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!

I got an impression of crazed activity in the bar off reception, and shrieks of laughter every couple of seconds. The receptionist was obviously stressed and polite but distant. I think she was surprised when I smiled at her and said thank you. Plenty of lifts, and an ice machine in reception- plus points for those! The corridors were a bit maze-like but smelled of fresh paint so I thought it looked hopeful that the rooms had been refurbished. My room was on the second floor on a side branch of the main corridor and was through a fire door that screeched every time it was opened- which was frequently throughout the night. A bit of oil might do it good. The room was small but had been refurbished and was clean and tidy. The wooden surrounds around the bed and wardrobes looked fairly new and unmarked. The bed was comfortable ( I was in a twin) sheets were clean and had been changed. Pillows were fine. The television was a smallish flatscreen on the wall. Perfectly adequate! Tea and coffee, yes..again, fine. Hairdryer under the table..no trouser press, which was a bit of a minus. The shower room was newly refurbished, clean and tidy, no faults there. The only thing was the towel was too small. I'm little so just about managed but anyone over 5'2 would struggle! I didnot like the fact that there is no room service in the St Giles. When I am away on business I am alone and do not like eating in a restaurant on my own. Well, I had to on this occasion and the noise downstairs had put me off going into the chinese restaurant incorporated into the hotel. The bistro similarly looked frantic. This was only early in the evening. So I opted for the in-house Italian restaurant. I was glad that I had. Very peaceful, calm service, lovely Italian waitress who took her time and the trouble to talk to me about the food. The steak that I had came with a lovely salad and fries which were fresh and crispy- just too many of them for me! She went a step further at the time for dessert and when I asked about icecream with espresso, she said that the soft icecream that tehy served was no good with coffee on it, but she recommended the hard Italian icecream with expresso coffee on it. I have had them before but this was honestly the best one I have had in my life. Delicious! back to the bedroom. All was well until it was time to sleep. the traffic noise was minimal than kgoodness, but the noise from other guests returning to their rooms was loud and disturbing. People let their doors slam, they called upon their neighbours with bangs on the door and loud talking. Obviously these people had no manners. In the morning, all was hectic downstairs and I could not face struggling to have a civilised breakfast in that atmosphere, so I skipped breakfast even though it had been paid for. Would I stay there again? I might, and if I do, I'll go to the Italian restaurant again..and take my own breakfast and earplugs.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMy little Box\u201d", "Author": "Woolfords", "ReviewID": "UR121894701", "Content": "My husband and I recently visited London for a special birthday occassion.

We arrived early on 12th December for a two night stay (approx 12:30) and check in wasn't until 2pm. The receptionist asked if we had any preferences to which we said if possible could we have a refurbished and quieter room. There was going to be a slight wait for this room to be ready and so we were able to leave our luggage with the concierge. Check in was quick and when we got to our room we were pleasantly surprised. We were given room 508 on the 5th floor, the room had been renovated and had everything we needed (see photos). The room was compact however this suited us, everything was to hand - after all who needs a massive room with lots of unused floorspace? The bedroom had a double bed, x2 spare pillows were available on the wall unit as were x2 spare towels. The carpet was new and freshly vacuumed.There was also a small flat screen tv, electronic safe, kettle with tea, coffee, milk & sugar, fan and also a hairdryer. Everything was immaculate and very comfortable.There was a handy window with privacy blinds (this was great as the room did get a little warm from time to time). The bathroom was refurbished and had a bath and powerful shower, liquid soap and shower gel was also provided as was a shower cap and plenty of loo roll. There were a couple of big mirrors that were handy for getting ready to go out. There was also a full length mirror on the back of the room door. Each day we went for breakfast early and then came back to the room to get ready. After leaving the do not disturb sign on the door (correct way round) we were not hurried to vacate. The first day we left the room at 9:30am and the day of leaving 9:45am. Each floor had a handy vending machine, surprisingly the goods were not that expensive, 50p for crisps and \u00a31 for water, there were also cans of alcohol and fruit drinks available. Breakfast was from 6:30am, we decided to get there early and beat the rush. The buffet style presentation comprised of bacon, sausage, hash browns, beans, scrambled eggs and rolls & spread. There was also cereal, croissants & jam, grapefruit & ham - more than enough to set you up for the day. If you get there early there is plenty of seating which is not crowded. Beverages consisted of fresh orange and apple juice and tea and various coffees - all self serve and unlimited. What we liked was the unobtrusive staff - they were very friendly and helpful when you needed anything. We did also take advantage of the coffee to go on the mezzanine level - lovely frothy cappuccino for \u00a31.50. Check out was 11am on our last day - really quick check out and we left our luggage with concierge again until we got our train. The helpful concierge even hailed us a cab to the station. There is no actual charge for leaving the luggage - this is totally voluntary and more than deserved by the staff. I can only think that the bad reviews are from visitors that did not get a quiet refurbished room, the staff were great and we cannot fault the service we received.

On arrival at the hotel just after 2pm we checked in swiftly and easily, despite the girl checking us in hardly raising a smile I really don't care, she did her job swiftly and efficiently and that's what counted for me. We were given a room on the first floor and found it easily. Upon opening the door I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. We had a twin room at the back of the hotel which was immaculately clean and smelt fresh. The bathroom was also sparkling and although there was no bath, we hadn't gone to London to spend hours soaking in a bath! The beds were very comfortable and the linen clean and crisp. There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room for a hot drink when you came in from a long day/night in London. There is a flat screen television if you want to watch a bit whilst relaxing in your room. I was also pleasantly surprised that there was a massive, well lit mirror above the dressing table, under which was located a good hairdryer meaning it was easy to blow dry and style hair without having to stretch to other mirrors or have none at all which so often happens at other hotels. I found the temperature of the room to be perfect for me, however if it was too warm a large, quiet fan for you to use. In the morning we went down to breakfast around 8.30am and yes, it was very busy. However there were plenty of places to plonk yourself down for a quick breakfast. The breakfast was nothing special but perfectly edible. Continental wise there were croissants, rolls, preserves, yoghurts and three types of fruit. Hot food was limited to Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Beans and Hash Browns. Perfectly acceptable for a 3* budget hotel. If however this isn't to your taste there is a Cafe Rouge and a Garfunkles literally two minutes round the corner which both serve breakfast. Upon checking out we asked if we could leave our luggage and it wasn't a problem. Not sure why people were charged \u00a31 per item, we were not charged at all. The concierge who organised the left luggage was cheerful and happy to help, as was the girl who checked us out, very smiley and extreemely professional.

Quite simply it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere. The room was dirty, I would not have wanted to walk on the carpet barefoot and there was a large chunk of enamel missing from the bath. Please bear in mind this is a central London hotel, literally in the heart of the shopping district. When paying Central London prices I expect a few things to come as standard - as they do in EVERY other hotel I have ever been to. These are: Free wifi both in the hotel and in the room a selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate with a few biscuits in the room toiletries to be provided such as soap, shower cap, razor and toothbrush, shower gel etc double glazing that WORKS... I had to clean the bath before I used it and was still wary of getting in due to the chunks of enamel missing. The standard stuff like a few sheets of notepaper and a pen/pencil by the phone was also absent. There was a note stuck to the wall in the bathroom stating that toiletries could be purchased from the vending machine by the lifts on my floor. I looked and it only contained a few bars of chocolate and some cans of beer. There is an ice machine but its on the ground floor and nothing was provided to carry the ice up to my room. In the end I didnt bother. Somehow they manage to block the London-wide free public wifi signal forcing you to use their own very expensive service. The rooms in the pictures on the hotels website are certainly NOT rooms in this hotel. They might be in one of the other hotels in the chain but definitely not this one. The air conditioning was far too loud so had to be kept off the entire night leaving the room extremely hot. There were no curtains on the window. The window itself was double glazed so I mistakenly thought I would get a peaceful nights sleep ready for my meeting the following morning. Despite the window being firmly closed I was awoken at 5.30 the following morning by very noisy traffic and shouting outside. I should not have been able to hear any of this, especially considering I was not facing the street and I was 5 floors up. The breakfast the following morning was a cheap disgusting hot buffet. The scrambled eggs were completely flavourless and the bacon overdone. Again, in Central London I expect my breakfast to be cooked to order not a help-yourself affair with every other guest breathing and coughing over the uncovered trays of food. I had a very unfullfilling breakfast which made me feel sick afterwards. If the room was clean, the bathroom repaired and the breakfast cooked to order, the facilities would be just about passable in a small town outside the city, maybe somewhere on the coast. Not in central London. The room was tiny, maybe 10' x 10'. This might be ok for a single room but mine was a double. One final gripe, the water pressure was so low it took me more than half an hour to run a bath. I will never again trust the rooms shown on a hotels website and I will certainly never be staying in a St Giles hotel group hotel again either. I did make a complaint but it has been ignored.

Very easy to find, just a couple of minutes from the Dominion Theatre on the Totenham Court Road tube (now re-opened) or from Holborn. Rooms very very clean but most of our group moaned on about thiers being very small. Were were short of towels and coffee but after a chat with reception they were brought up in minutes. Bathrooms tiny but hey you don't live in them. Good shower. No toiletries you can \"steel\" but a bottle of generic soap supplied...stuck to the wall and shower cubicle. The room was typical of a 3 star, oakwood paneling anddecor which could have been any hotel any place. Compact, yes but very clean. This is a very very large hotel and you will battle for a seat at breakfast if you are not early enough to beat the old folk on bus tours staying at the hotel. Get to breakfast early, you have been warned. Food was fine but no toast or fried eggs or banannas...bummer. Fair selection at breakfast but not extensive. The food that was there was good enough for me. Buffet style for continental or full english...I had both. To pay for full breakfast is \u00a39.99. Some used the small onsite shop. Reception is always very busy in the morning but if you are checking out you can just drop your key in a box and go. Concierge was on hand 24/7 and answered all our questions, though a smile would be nice. We arrived early but we were able to leave our luggage. The hotel has a small shop selling hot and cold drinks with sandwiches and snacks. The rocky road cheese cake was fab. The \u00a32.98 special of a drink and a cake was handy. Enter the hotel, go up a few stairs, then turn hard right up another small set of starirs and its next to the loo. VERY useful as its open to the pulic and it's much cheaper and quieter than the surrounding tourist trap cafes. For \u00a35 you can use the impressive sports centre of the YMCA as the hotel has its own entrance. Very nice 25m pool and loads of gym stuff. Some classes. They have lockers for \u00a31 deposit. I have two major beefs with this hotel. 1. the lifts take forewver to arrive. Most times I just took the stairs. 2. our party had two people per room but they would not issue a second keycard or allow us to leave our keys. This caused us MAJOR logistical headaches as our group often spilt up and on many occasions a person was left waiting for the other to come back. Staff - the cleaning staff were always polite. The reception staff were to the point but without personality. Watching them do thier job from the chairs in the small shop it was clear they had to \"process\" large numbers of guests and they often worked long hours, but a smile costs nothing. Location - a couple of minutes from Oxford Street and the British Museum. Right in the heart of shopping. Other guests - Due to its size the hotel seemed to attract its fair share of touring groups on buses and many internatioanl groups. pretty much as you would expect. Would I go back...yes.

I'm very tired of the staff that just isn't qualified for their job. When I was checking in, I specifically asked for ai quiet (very light sleeper) non smoking room (as I have allergies), and a good view. I get to my room and guess what I get - first room down the hall from the elevator, the noisiest place! and I open the door and guess what - strong smell of old cigarette smoke and the view at the wall! I go downstairs to change the room and the guy who checked me in immediately disappeared as soon as he saw me. The other girl immediately gave me a room on a different floor (ask for 7th, it was renovated, unlike 6th). On my second part of stay I had an Executive double. The only good thing I can say about it is the size of the room. Everything else is... There is no single drawer in the room, or a proper shelf for clothes or underwear or cosmetic stuff. I guess they think foreigners don't wear underwear and don't need a discreet place for tampons (sorry for being so blunt, but I'm so mad!). Its just stupid! Cheap plastic in the bathroom instead of tile, smell of sewer, tiny sink, cheap plastic shelf thingy where they put the hotel provided shampoo and other stuff, a shelf for the shower itself that doesn't stick to the wall, a very old blow-drier and the list goes on and on. Seriously. If you call a room executive double and charge the money you charge for it, have the decency to furbish it as such. The room where I stayed at the beginning of the trip, a simple double, had this very old blow drier that is stuck to the wall of the bathroom, very loud, very broken, very sad... And non existent sound proofing. The door is heavy but I was woken up every morning by the knock on someone's door at 8am with loud words \"housekeeping\". The elevators are a joke. They are programmed in such a stupid way it will take you ages to wait for it and then ages to get to the floor you need. The only good thing about this hotel is location.

The second room was a slight improvement on the first, except that the fan was extremely noisy as a bearing seemed to have worn out.

If you use it make sure the iron is clean. Someone had melted some material onto the iron and I had to rub it off once the iron heated up. The breakfast experience was awful. The dining room, whilst large, was crowded. I had to queue to get a table, and when I managed to sit down the food was poor. The coffee was weak, the \"orange juice\" was orange water and the sausages were very cheap, overcooked rubbish. As for the rest of the food, well I can only say that this was a one star experience. Any tourists visiting London from another country please do not think that typical English food is normally anything like this.

Swimming pool and sauna, and if you wanted you could have a facial or a massage which was well documented in the rooms guide. All in all, this hotel was good value considering its location and also considering the fact that nothing went wrong!

Luckily I had a small radio with ear plugs and just plugged them in and listened to classic fm ALL night which did not shut out the noise but helped me not to focus on it. Never again.

On reaching the first floor, I was guided by signs through the smoke (illegal) filled warren of a corridor to a bunker that was to be home for the next three nights. On entering the room I found there was one small 4\u2019 x 2\u2019 approx window which did not give enough light to find any of the switches or lamps despite it still being daylight outside. After struggling to find a lamp and then locate its switch, I managed to find two switches camouflaged on the door jamb, immediately inside the darkened entrance. One illuminated the bathroom and this allowed me to find other room lamps. To this day I did not discover the point of the other switch. Like many hotels, good lighting was a missing luxury. By far the best lit area was the bathroom, which was not that much smaller than the actual bedroom. It contained the promised bath and was ideal for anyone less than four feet tall! The modern trend of not supplying toiletries (allegedly to help save the environment, but actually to cut hotel costs) was abundantly clear. There were two shower caps and both the basin and bath came with soap dispensers. These were designed by a rocket scientist as the liquid soap would fly across the mirror (from the basin) or down the entire length of the bath from the other pot. The trouble was that this was fixed at shower height, so no good at all for those wanting to use the bath. This was most unsatisfactory. Once the lighting in the bedroom had been located and switched on, one waited in hope for a reasonable level of illumination which, sadly, never arrived. I felt pleased that I had not brought a cat to swing now that I could see the room. The cramped room was, or seemed, clean, as did the bathroom. A double bed indicated that the room could be shared by two people. I would challenge this. The room contained no cupboards, mainly, I think, because there would not have been room to open the doors! There were shelves (see photo) and a one foot wide space for hanging clothes, which was actually difficult to reach, even without a door, due to a large (for the room size) 1960\u2019s style chair and its close proximity to the bed! Tea and coffee facilities were provided, as was a sort of air conditioning, (switch found on the second day due to the darkness) and the first floor window could be opened a crack, but is recommended only for deaf people and had to be shut at night if you were to sleep in the reduced, but not eliminated, street noise. The howl of emergency sirens could be heard quite well, even with the window closed. A fan and safe were provided, both of these were good points and there was no extra charge. A small TV is glued to the wall above the shelving, just below ceiling level. This made the only viewing area from the bed. I could not find a radio. The TV came without instructions or lists of channels available. It seemed like Freeview. Many channels suffered from pixel break-up and it took ages to flick though just a few of the channels. The bed was lumpy and basic, but seemed clean. There are IKEA lamps either side of the bed. One had an unreadable PAT certificate, whilst the one on the other side, which was faulty, had no visible certificate at all. The breakfast was quite an experience. We were warned on arrival that it could get busy around 8.30 am. I arrived just after opening time (6.30, good for business people) one morning to find it half full. The cooked choice at breakfast was a poor introduction to those not knowing what a full English breakfast looked like. The room key card actually calls it a \u2018European Breakfast\u2019. I reckon that the sausage could have almost passed as vegetarian, it was dire. The rest was passable but it was the same every day, no changes at all, other than \u2018take it or leave it\u2019. The bread rolls were of poor quality and there was no bread for toast. Most other items were acceptable. It was self service and this seemed to work well when the place wasn\u2019t too busy. This is a large basic hotel which seems mainly used by busloads of tourists and people up for shows and or short work periods. My stay of three nights was more than enough for me. I noted that some people had booked rooms for a honeymoon. There is probably little hope for that marriage! It is one step up from the very basic hotels that have become popular in recent years, but you pay quite a premium, but if you want somewhere central for a couple of nights in central London it would pass as OK, but don\u2019t use it for a special occasion!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cso close to everything\u201d", "Author": "dimvel", "ReviewID": "UR118146830", "Content": "in the center of london, so close to oxford st and soho, but small rooms", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bideford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood overnight in london\u201d", "Author": "32rose", "ReviewID": "UR118086769", "Content": "My friends and I stayed here one night so we could enjoy the musical 'Ghost' at the Picadilly Theatre.It was in a very good location for all of the nightlife and for shoppijng the next day!

We communicated by email. They were brilliant, and asked me what I wanted, gave me a price list and asked what colours. And sure enough there in the room were these beautiful flowers waiting for her with a card in a nice big vase. The staff are so lovely there, so helpful. The rooms are spotless, the beds are very comfortable, and no matter where you walked around the hotel there is not a speck of dust or rubbish anywhere. It's in a great location, with a 24 hour sainsbury across the road, a boots chemist too. Round the corner is a cafe rouge, Garfunkels which are both great to have a meal in. Staff lovely there too, couldn't do enough for you. If you go on line on 2 for 1 you can download vouchers which is great to have a saving, especially if there are a lot of you. We booked the show through last minute. com and they are very good too, so easy to use and instantly your seats are booked. We had brilliant seats and a brilliant price. I think if you are stopping in London for a few days, the St. Giles is the best place to go, its great for value for money, it's central so oxford street is just around the corner and all the shop to drop is there.

Located a 15 minute walk from Euston Station and sixty seconds away from Oxford street/Tottenham Court, it is in a very good location for seeing most of London's sights. The room was a double, but on the small side, big enough for a bed and a small walkway down each side. It was summer and blazing hot, but there was no air con in the rooms, and my biggest gripe was that the room smelled very musty. The bathroom was ok, but there was no toilet brush and the toilet bowl was dirty from previous guests, the shower worked fine however and the shower curtain seemed brand new. Wi-Fi was availble in the rooms at a cost of around \u00a35 a day, I am 22 years old and have lived most my life with internet and hundreds of free wifi spots, so this seemed extortionate to me, i was very dissapointed. The hallways were quite cramped and during roomservice times you'd struggle to get past the carts, even sideways. They did do a thorough job of replacing all the sheets and towels however. We only used the hotel as a base to explore London, so we didnt spend a lot of time there, the only interaction we had with the staff was check in (We got stuck with a trainee, a little slow but very polite- we all have to start somewhere) and check out. where a helpful gentlemen walked to the next street to hail us a taxi.

We knew we'd be out most of the time, so would literally just be sleeping and showering in there so all we needed was somewhere cheap, clean and comfortable in a central location. The St Giles achieved all of these things. It is a basic room and is pretty small with not much of a window but I will say it's very well designed so all the space is used well! The bathroom was nice for the price too. It's definitely a step up from a Travelodge/Premier Inn if that's the kind of price you're wanting to pay. The lobby is fairly average and the halls are a bit like an office building but you spend a few minutes each day using these areas so who cares! Service was fine - not overly friendly, not rude! We didn't have breakfast but our friends have before and queued 20 minutes and were less than impressed so I'd give it a miss unless it's free or virtually free! There's a Sainsbury's two minutes from the door we just went and grabbed something from there. There's also a Starbucks & Cafe Nero less than 5 minutes away.

We had a separate living area with table, a huge bathroom with LCD TV panel in the wall with Bath and Shower. The room was clean and looked out towards the BT Tower (not the most exciting view but couldn't complain) and we had bath robes and slippers included with an LCD panel TV next to the seatiing area in the bedroom. In addition to this we had a note on our bed explaining that as an Executive Room occupant we got to eat in the Executive Breakfast lounge (which is just the Hakuba restaurant underneath the hotel) but this is a cooked to order breakfast with service and it was a great add on which we never expected.

The room on the 8th floor was comfortable although it could do with some renovation/upgrade to improve the presentation.

There is also a full english option available too. The hotel does have a swimming pool and gym facilities however there is a \u00a35 surcharge, which is rather steep for the facilities available.

The windows are awful and believe it or not I had an upgraded room!

I was supposed to be in the room with my husband and we wanted room to keep our bags and do work! There was no room just for me! And the extra space was a horrible horrible annexe leading to the bathroom - a bit like a junk room space. And the bathroom - I will post photos but it was mouldy and tiny. The room was noisy - you could hear everything in the corridors and the clientele was noisy and didn't care about talking at three in the morning. But then why would anyone have any respect in such a horrible hotel. The corridors seriously look like a the back corridors of a hotel not the public areas. A friend I was meeting, a Londoner, said that he was suprised I had been put there because it had been a YMCA - believe me - it still is! You can do better than this in London. Don't stay here. I was woken in the night by the noise, burst into tears and had a mini-existential crisis - it was that depressing to be in this hotel and frankly rather scary.

We arrived at the hotel around an hour earlier than the check in time, however they said we could still check in as our room was ready. We booked an executive double room on the top floor, bathroom was amazing, room was very nicely decorated and finished, maybe a little on the small side. But to be honest, you're not going to find a massive hotel room in London unless you're prepared to pay over the odds. We literally only spent half an hour in the room before we went out and then an hour getting ready before our meal. We ate at the chinese restaurant located on sight. The food was TO DIE FOR!! It was absolutely gorgeous!! After a long day of walking, eating a chinese with a nice cold cider was the perfect end to a wonderful day! The staff were very friendly and helpful, we did not need to complain or bring something to their attention as everything was just as we needed. The concierge was quite happy to look after our bags for a fair few hours the next day because we had to leave by 12 and our train wasnt until 6.30... something that was very helpful: didnt quite fancy dragging my clothes around on a boiling hot day walking the whole length of regent street and oxford street (both walking distance from the hotel) I honestly would recommend this hotel to anyone!

In the 3 weeks prior to staying in this hotel, we had stayed in 8 hotels of the same rating, all of which cost less. We were skeptical from the start as to why we had to pay upfront, as this is usually only required to secure a discounted rate, but agreed, as we had no other option. I now realize why this was insisted on, as we definitely would have insisted on a HUGE reduction in our final bill if we were to have paid after the farce that was our stay at St Giles. Of a plethora of unpleasant experiences, these were just some: 1. Reception staff were slow and unhelpful on every occasion we dealt with them 2. A call from our room to reception (at approximately 7pm) to inform them that the cleaner had not left toilet paper when the room was cleaned went unanswered 5 times. A subsequent call to the concierge to ask what the deal was ended with us being put through to the reception again! Really helpful considering this was the problem in the first place. And yes, this sixth call also went unanswered. 3. The hallway carpet was ripped and stained with what looked like chewing gum. 4. Our room\u2019s toilet was broken and wouldn\u2019t flush. This was fixed, and a bent, laminated note apologizing for the defect was left in our room (this left us with the impression that these defects must be quite a common occurrence in order for laminated notes to be necessary). 5. The safe in our room was also broken. A complaint to reception about this went unactioned for our entire weeklong stay there. 6. 3 of the 5 TV channels in our room were too fuzzy to be watchable and the other two alternated between being fine and fuzzy also. 7. The window in our room wouldn\u2019t open more than 10cm due to the great planning of putting the TV in front of it. This was lucky in a way, as some sort of LOUD buzzing generator was just outside and sounding like a helicopter. Great fun, as you can imagine. 8. The housekeepers knocked on the door at 8.30am \u2013 several times. Surely a system where you leave you keys at the front desk when you leave your room would allow the cleaners to know when guests had left their room and prevent them from interrupting guests attempting to have a sleep in on their holiday? 9. The ultimate catch was that, as our room was not air conditioned, we needed to leave the window open. However this meant we were kept awake by the generator. Ended up having to sleep with earplugs in order to get any sleep at all. Very relaxing I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. 10. A long one, but a perfect example of the inept customer service on offer from St Giles. Two Internet kiosks in the lobby sat side by side. My friend and I went on these at the same time (note that this had to be paid for, whereas internet was offered for free at all other hotels we stayed at). My access was fine however my friend\u2019s would not allow her to click through on many links, the timer simply counted down and the status bar read \u2018done\u2019 although the page had not updated at all. We went to speak to reception about this and the manager told us abruptly that nothing was wrong with the Internet and that the problem was due to the fact that she was trying to access online banking. Once I pointed out to him that at that very moment I had just completed mine, he pretty much accused me of lying, saying that online banking could not be completed in the hotel for security reasons. I pointed out to him that my screen was in fact still logged into my Bank\u2019s Netbank but he ignored me and continued to insist that online banking could not be accessed. I pointed out that surely this is the main reason that hotel guests would want to access the Internet during a holiday but he again insisted. I ended up becoming so frustrated with this man that I had to leave and go back to my room, as I was very close to loosing my temper completely due to the fact that he was not speaking logically. After being refused her money back for the defunct computer, my friend then jumped onto my computer and was able to complete her online banking also. 11. The lifts were ridiculous. The lift from reception was always packed to the point that you could be buried in the armpit of a fellow guest for much of the trip, something I do not wish upon anyone. The line for the lift often spilled out of the lift lobby area and into the main reception area. Getting the lift down from your room meant a wait of about 10mins, and once the lift did arrive it was often full and you would have to wait all over again for another. We ended up walking up and down 7 floors of the fire stairs several times as it was quicker and less traumatic to the nostrils. 12.

We just needed a clean bed (all twin rooms) and bathroom. The location of the hotel is as good as it gets for what girls want - Oxford Street, the theatres, bars and somewhere to eat.

The cleanliness is a bit dubious, I was pleased our bathroom was clean though. However, there was a not-so-nice-smelling damp stain on entering the room, we suspected from the bathroom. The room wasn't the largest by any standards but was fine for a night. The beds were clean and mine was quite comfy. The bathroom was small but nothing unusual there. I would recommend to anyone to take their own bath towel, the postage stamp size towels don't hide a great deal! There were spare towels in the wardrobe but these were only slightly bigger. Also, take a hair dryer if you use one. My friend discovered that the air is not warm enough to dry hair but the actual dryer heats up enough to burn your hand.

It was very uncomfortable, so much so that sweat was constantly running down guests faces. I tried to open the bedroom window to cool the room but upon doing so a nauseating smell entered the room. My guess is that we were situated right above the kitchen extractor fans. The smell of fish and stale fat was was revolting. We were unable to locate a temperature control in the room so had to sleep with a noisy fan which consequently disturbed our sleep. We paid 250.00 UK pounds per night for this room. The hotel is so busy trying to get the lifts is a joke. After waiting far too long, we always ended up going down the back stairs to reception. This proved problematic when we had our heavy luggage. The dining area of the hotel was like a free for all, works canteen rather than a restaurant. It was far too hot. So much so, we began to feel unwell. We struggled to find seats and wandered around aimlessly in the hope that someone would vacate their seat. The food was average, rather plain and tasteless. On a positive note, the reception staff were very efficient and polite and the conceiege staff were fantastic, going out onto the street and hailing a taxi for us and holding the taxi car door open like a true gentleman. Upon having to vacate our room at 10am we requested our luggage be stored for a couple of hours. We got charged for this service.

The room was clean & functional but lacked basic expectations for a room of that price.

We had e-mailed the hotel prior to arriving asking for a nice room. We were in room 754 and we had one of the biggest rooms on that floor according to the room map on the back of the door. I really think this would be an entirely different review had we got one of the rooms which appeared to be half the size of ours. Check In : We arrived at the reception desk at 11.30 and our room was ready. Pleasantly surprised. We reminded the receptionist of our room request, she said to go up and take a look at our room and that if we were not happy to come back down. This sounded very reasonable so we took our bags to the lifts and made our way up. Lifts: Worked fine for most of our 5 day stay. The only time they are slow is when most of the hotel wants to use them at the same time. There are 700 rooms and 4/5 lifts. Otherwise they were not a problem. The Room: Pleasantly surprised on arrival. Bathroom is small but the shower was great to be fair! Plenty of hot water every time. We had enought storage space for all our stuff, and a small tv on a stand in the corner. It was more than adequate. Our only problem with the room and our stay in fact was the in room safe. It wasn't working from day 1 and despite numerous requests was never fixed. We put our cash etc in the hotel reception safe the 1st time but we didnt bother doing this for the rest of the time. Luckily we got away with it. The room was clean and our sheets were changed every day. Towels weren't a problem either. Location: As all other reviewers say, this one has it. Outstanding location.

I recommend printing out a map to help you navigate from the tube station to the hotel as we were lost for almost half an hour with our luggage. It's down a side street in the main shopping street. My boyfriend and I had never been to Europe before and had only traveled around asia. For anybody who has been to asia you will know that for $150 a night you can stay in an amazing 5 star hotel with buffet breakfast included. I guess we were expecting our room to be alot bigger than it was. We were a little shocked when we arrived in our room and the bed literally filled the room. There was a tiny tv up in the corner and a little station where you could make tea/coffee. The shower was probably half the size of a normal sized shower and the curtain would blow in and stick to you while showering. The bathroom floor would flood too. The breakfast was a pastry and piece of fruit per day with the choice of an orange juice or tea/coffee. It's called 'coffee2go' so you can't sit down if one of the 4 small tables and chairs are being used. I think that for a hotel with such a great location in London its good value for money. I think I would have preferred to stay a little further out and just catch the tube in to where I wanted to go and have a bigger room. I found one of the staff members to be a little bit rude but for the most part they were friendly. Not 'go out of your way' type of friendly, just pleasant to deal with. If you've only traveled to asia before then be prepared for a shock when you see the size of your room and the breakfast. If you're a seasoned Europe traveler and are looking to stay in central London then this is the place for you. Oh I forgot to mention that it has a great leisure center which we joined for only a few pounds for the week. Theres also a supermarket across the road and plenty of pubs around if you are looking for something to eat.

However the hotel itself needs to be seriously updated. The room itself was disappointing. BIG NOTE: the rooms only have dial up - there is no wifi. This was a huge issue for me as I was in town for business and since my company doesn't use dial up, I was unable to use my computer in my room. The only other way to get internet access was to use a common computer down in the lobby which will cost you \u00a31 (one pound) for every 20 minutes. Upon opening up the door to the room, the smell of body odor which emulated was over-powering. As there is no air conditioning in the rooms, so I had to turn on the small, two speed fan and open the window which opens about a quarter of the way. The next thing you notice is the size of the room - which is very small - which was not ideal but I could be fine in it. I had to turn my suitcase sideways to get in the door. The closet was not tall so the longest thing that you can hang in them is a suite jacket. The room had a small tv (fine) which received 5 channels but only one that was not all static and the remote had no back cover so the batteries kept falling out. The walls are also quite thin so you can hear your neighbors. I also did a test and found out that the staff does not change the sheets at all on the beds during your stay. You have to request that. There was a small desk which if you pulled the chair out hit the bed. Even their welcome package which they leave in the room was not helpful. None of the topics related to pages and I am not sure when the last time was that it had been updated. For the fitness center and pool, they are not actually in the hotel - instead located at the YMCA which is underneath the hotel. You also have to pay additional to use the facilities and you need to fill out paperwork and the manager needs to approve your usage of the facilities. Also make sure you are aware of the check-out times - which is 11am. I was up early on my last day on my way out for breakfast at 9am and the cleaning person tried to come in my room. When I told her yes I was indeed checking out today but was just going to get some breakfast she informed me that I was late and that I needed to leave.

The next morning at approx 8am we were awoken by the fire alarm and had to run down 8 flights by the fire escape. After waiting for 10 mins outside we were told to go back in as it was a false alarm and it had done the same thing the day before. The bathroom was extremely small (again caravan came to mind) and although the bathroom door was frosted it didn't provide much privacy. Their was a long line for breakfast but it did go down quite quickly. Once inside the breakfast room the tables felt crammed in but there was a good selection of food. The position of the hotel made it very easy to get around, either walking or on the tube, with a stop almost straight outside the hotel. Overall it was nothing special and if I stayed again it wouldn't be for more than one night. In fact I am thinking of going to London next year but I am looking at other hotels so I suppose this means I wouldn't stay again.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGREAT PLACE TO STAY\u201d", "Author": "hammy78", "ReviewID": "UR69015225", "Content": "What can i say about this hotel? well, stayed here with my wife for a long weekend, i had booked it without looking at the reviews first,,, read the reviews when i came home and could not believe some of these negative reviews this hotel got?????.

The tube is literally a two second walk from the front door, the Dominian Theatre is about 3 doors down which is great if youre going to see We Will Rock You (which we were). Oxford Street is literally across the road which is where you want to be if youre hitting the shops! Leicester Square and Soho are about a ten minute walk or a tube ride if youre feeling lazy! Basically the hotel was bang in the middle of everything! It was fantastic! When we got to the hotel the lady on reception was very helpful, everything was lovely and clean and we paid and got our keys in a matter of minutes. We stayed on the 1st floor which is still quite a trek on the stairs so we used the lifts (which were fine!). Our room was quite a small one but definitely big enough for the two of us! We had a nice big (and EXTREMELY comfortable!) bed, bedside units with lamps, we had an all in one dresser, wardrobe and shelving units which was absolutely fine - electric heater was provided in case it got cold, which it didnt - it was quite warm. We had windows that part opened and air con - the air con was actually really noisy but at least it was there. People complaining about the noise absolutely baffles me - its in the CENTRE OF LONDON - of course it's going to be noisy! That's the charm of London. Saying that, it wasnt so noisy you couldnt sleep?! It was general hustle and bustle, some sirens etc. Hardly worth complaining about at all. The only thing we found noisy in our room was next doors air con - again, it wasnt loud enough to stop me sleeping and im the lightest sleeper ever! The bathroom was just lovely - very modern, very very clean and really swanky!! The shower was heavenly, we had fresh towels every day if we wanted, fresh toileteries every day. The thing i have to emphasise is how CLEAN the room and bathroom were! For breakfast we had the coffee 2 go option which was fantastic. You got a choice of pastries, a choice of fruit and hot and cold drinks (you get one of each) which was great for us because we spent quite a lot of money on lunch and teas and we didnt really want a lot for breakie - just wanted to get out and about! They also have pay as you go internet access which we actually found really useful as we needed to look for places to go and find where all the Samuel Smiths pubs were!! I have to say, as i have never been to London before this trip, the drinks were so expensive. At most pubs it cost us about \u00a39 for two pints. Sam Smiths pubs are all over London so we went on a little pub crawl between them all - for 2 pints at a Sam Smiths pub is about \u00a35 which is a lot better than \u00a39 on a night out! All in all, we had a great experience with the hotel, a great experience with the location and we will DEFINITELY be going back again. The price of the hotel is an absolute bargain for what you get and where you are - we saw more expensive hotels further away from the centre and they didnt look too hot.

Access is not available in the rooms - although it did say you could connect via a cable - didn't see this though. Tv reception - incredibly dodgy, usual 1-5 channels, plus the odd periodic appearance of a couple of freeview channels. I didn't try the bar/restaurants, I grabbed tea from an m&s a short walkup the road. If you are only staying a couple of days, and have a small bag, then there shouldn't be any problems, as other people have said, its not like you spend that much free time in your room. The biggest negative was the constant smell of cigarette smoke. It was so bad at some times I was expecting a smoke alarm to go off! - this seemed to be coming from neighbouring rooms. I didn't actually see any signs in any of the rooms, or in the hotel to indicate no smoking, so I can assume that tourists were not too familiar with the smoking ban here!", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location - and that's it...\u201d", "Author": "Bmews", "ReviewID": "UR63111206", "Content": "Just back from the 'St Grotty Hotel' as we dubbed it. Like a mass transit camp for evacuees, full of 'today is London, we stay here' coach parties. My SO was appalled at the room, me, well I've seen worse in time spent overseas. Reception and flunkies on the door look fine for clicking fingers for taxis, but go beneath the glitz and this place needs serious money on it. The room was a dingy lit double, so small with a bed, nothing else could fit in. The lifts are so slow (5? of them) we used to walk down from 8th floor. Shower needed serious deep cleaning / retiling, bathroom not painted for ages, room/bed linen smelt of smoke or just unlaundered for quite a while, the hot water took ages to come through - but hot when it arrives.The bed was past its prime, you could feel the springs digging in. Breakfast was like a military cookhouse or school canteen (they are cleaner and more organised) with help yourself in the teeming masses to overcooked scrambled egg and burnt bacon etc. The dining furniture should have been thrown out, it was that bad. The pool is near the hotel, not in it, you find out when you arrive, so we never made use of it. Fantastic for 5 mins walk to British Museum, tube 1 min, Oxford St & Soho 5mins. And that is its one redeming feature. If someone bought this place and upgraded it, they would have a real jewel in the crown, but either the current owners cannot, or do not have the dough to spend on it. If you want comfort, go elsewhere, if you want no frills fare just to crash out in and use as a base, then it suffices. Even a Travelodge is 5* in comparison with this.

However think it may rely to much on its location and lets other items slip... Check in/out staff rushed and rude - manners cost nothing! Rooms were very small and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a standard double bed. However, it was clean and the cleaners friendly & polite. Room had very little daylight & poorly lit (good luck doing your hair & make up). Terrible reception on the 5-channel TV (but hey, we weren't staying there to watch the TV). Italian restaurant is meant to be good.. but sadly closed at weekends! (Serious money-making opportunity missed there - a hotel full of runners craving pasta??) I'm no Londoner, but the price didnt seem that great value for what we got. Price for using room phone is ridiculous! \u00a32 to transfer an incoming call?? But my biggest complaint had to be breakfast. Our rate didn't include breakfast, which was fine. I'd phoned ahead and asked if on marathon morning I could possibly use a microwave to heat some milk & porridge - no problem, i was told. But on marathon morning I was disgusted to be charged \u00a39.95 for heating up MY OWN porridge! The catering manager was rude and obnoxious and instead of diplomatically settling the situation, preferred to argue it out infront of a packed breakfast room.

Yes, the room was small, but I wasn't planning to have a party in it for 20 people. Very comfy bed, tv, heater, fan, small kettle, chair, enough room for couple of suitcases, it's own safe, a great view (I stayed on 11th floor). What else would you need? This is London, so don't expect big rooms in hotels, this one is not an exception. So I don't consider the size of the room as a negative. The hotel itself is nice and clean. 0.5 minute from Oxford street and the tube. Exactly what I needed. A grocery store right in front of hotel. I got a very nice room with recent renovation. I was right near the elevator and at times it was too noisy (but I don't mind the noise). But you should ask for a room away from the elevator, cause it gets quite noisy when the elevator moves up and down. Also, 2 sides of the hotel are facing pretty busy streets with a noisy intersection. But it'll bother you only if you open windows. I didn't hear the street noise with windows closed. The receptionists and consierge where welcoming and helpful. I asked for a possibility of a late check out (at 2 PM) and they even offered me to stay until 3PM if I needed (i was leaving for the airport at 4pm). You can also leave your bags with the consierge if you are checking out in the morning but leaving later in the day. It'll cost you 1 pound per suitcase. I don't know how's the food in this hotel as I booked the room without breakfast and didn't use their restaurant. But there are lots of small cafes and restaurants nearby.

When we arrived at around 2.30pm, there was a long queue to check in so we went for something to eat before going back half an hour or so later and the queue was down to one or two people. Efficiant check in for us, directed to room 252 on the 2nd floor. The room was small with a small double bed, in fact the room was smaller than our room at home and we have a king sized bed as well. There's not much wardrobe space, no mini bar, a few drawers, the tv was hidden away in a cupboard, you had to pull the shelf out a little way but had Sky Sports One, which we weren't expecting. There are tea & coffee making facilities and more importantly, a plug socket right by the large mirror, ideal for plugging a hairdryer or straighteners in and much better than those horrid hairdryers in bathrooms. Our room seemed to be in a fairly quiet part of the hotel, no disturbances during the night from road noise or other guests. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was also small with just a shower cubicle but a good shower, shame the towels are pretty little, I'm a five feet nothing size 12 and it only just covered the important bits :) The alarm went off around 9am the next morning and several guests were wondering if they should go downstairs, we did using the staircase but I was surprised to see not one member of staff directing people or just telling us it was a false alarm - which it was it turned out to be. The lifts seem to take an age to arrive any time we wanted to use them so we did use the stairs quite a bit, along with several other guests, particularly when going down for breakfast. Breakfast is in a huge great canteen style room, basically you grab a table, sit down then one of you goes up at a time to get what you want. There's no table service at all, apart from clearing the tables, you make your own hot drinks and queue for your breakfast, but there's a decent choice, bread, fruit, cereals, bacon, sausages, beans, hash browns and scrambled eggs, which had a powdery taste. That said, it was hot and you just served yourself, so could pile up your plate if you wanted to. Check out was again efficient. I would stay here again as it wasn't an unreasonable price for the location in Central London, but I wouldn't stay for more than the one night due to the lack of space in the room.

She thought I was asking for low-fat milk (!) - I couldn't get through to her that drinking normal milk made me ill, which just frustrated me! I went to Sweden recently - they have lactose free milk behind the counter that you just have to ask for - great! UK hotels should follow suit. Other than that little gripe, great stay at this hotel. It's perfect for being central to West End theatres (this was my reason for staying) but it's literally 10 steps from Oxford St for shopping heaven too, and just across the road is Soho Square - a rare green bit of London - which was perfect for relaxing in the London heat waiting for shows to start.

My room was a double, but i was glad I was staying alone as there would not be enough room for two women to get ready in a room of that size. The TV was so old that the symbols on the rubber buttons had all worn off, so it took some guess work to operate it. It was an old style tv with a big back, so when I opened the window I nearly whacked the tv onto the floor. The traffic is loud and the room is hot, so one or the other must be endured before sleep. The location of the hotel is excellent, so traffic noise can be expected, which is why proper air conditioning should also be expected by the traveller. For me though the real disappointment was the bathroom. I have a bit of a fear of nasty bathrooms. Small spaces, noisy pipes and poor lighting, leave me feeling very anxious, so I'm afraid I didn't manage a long shower at this hotel. The shower was built into a cubicle space in the bathroom, which meant that when the shower curtain was shut there was no light. Tired and old fashioned bathroom, and tired dated room. I have stayed in travelodges and etaps which were much cheaper and much nicer.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glagow", "Title": "\u201cGreat location... everything you need for a city break.\u201d", "Author": "paulxxxpaulxxx", "ReviewID": "UR32248992", "Content": "Stayed at St Giles Hotel beginning June 2009.

Reception was large and all the staff we met were very efficient. However the whole lacks any personal touch, it's very impersonal and you can easily feel like a number. Breakfast takes on a buffet format, very much help yourself attire. Nice and simple. The location is great. Right next to Central Point. Tottenham Court Road Underground. Also right beside the 'We Will Rock You Theatre'. Just round the corner from Soho. The location was a great selling point. The hotel always semmed to be well staffed. Always a concierge on to help.

That was on the first morning. Second morning, arrived to find that due to technical problems there was no executive breakfast so we were directed to the main buffet breakfast which was ok because it wasn't that busy. I soon came to realise though that we had been spoiled the previous day as the food wasn't as good quality, I had cereal and the milk was sour, I pointed this out to a member of staff who told me where there was another milk machine but unfortunately this was also sour. My partner had the cooked breakfast which looked ok though and the coffee was alright. I must say though that other than this we had a good stay. Reception were polite and efficient, although queues were a little slow at busy times, concierge very helpful, lifts were always busy but we didn't have long to wait, the hotel is perfectly situated for the West End and compared to other hotels in central London that we priced up, I would say that this is great value for money.

Its location is right in the heart of the tourist zone: at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, so all the theatres and China Town/Soho is on its doorstep.

I suspect it would be stifling in the summer, as there is no air conditioning. The check-in was painfully slow and as the hotel has crammed in as many rooms as possible into its square footprint, this makes the lift service inadequate: be prepared to wait a long time or use the (hidden-away) stairs. I have stayed in hotels all over the globe but was deeply disappointed at my room given the price (\u00a370+). I couldn't quite touch both walls of my room with my hands outstretched, but not far off. The single room was so tiny that it reminded me of a cabin on a ferry - especially the microscopic bathroom (opening the door of the bathroom would remove the knees of anybody sitting on the toilet!). In addition, the cistern of my toilet had a constant overflow into the shower unit, so the noise of this dribble did not aid my sleep. The quality of the food at breakfast was OK but it's a mad canteen service where you grab some food and try and find a space to sit next to other guests. The cleaner came to do my room at 8.20am and at 8.30am, somebody came to try and clean the inside window! At this point, I gave up and left. I did not sleep well here.

Yes please - my room is not acceptable - we have several other rooms for you to try - are any of them clean or have a bath? No Sir - we dont have baths in most of our rooms.

Room not ready for check in as arranged, leading to logistical problems for us. Miniscule, badly lighted bathroom with faucets that would not turn off. Mildew in the shower. Had to go get towels from the housekeeping cart several times because they weren't replaced. Small, cramped, not-too-clean room with bad lighting and no temperature control. Uncomfortable bed and old, lumpy pillows. School cafeteria style breakfast buffet was crowded any time of morning and not worth the hassle. Concierge desk gave downright incorrect directions several times. Not enough internet access for a hotel this size, with only two terminals available for hire in the lobby (hogged by unsupervised teenagers whenever we tried to check email). No designated smoking area outside, so we often walked through cloud of smoke on the pavement coming and going from the hotel.

The room was a little cool, but then it was sub-zero outside. During the night the room was reasonbly quiet for a hotel of this size.

This was a trip we had arranged for our first anniversary. We had tickets to the theatre booked along with a meal etc, etc. We arrived at the hotel with enough time to get ourselves ready and get ourselves to the theatre only to be delayed by the receptionist who, apart from being quite difficult to understand, took an absolute age to process our details although we had in fact pre-booked. When we eventually received the keys to our room there was a fire alarm which meant the lifts were off limits. We were told that there was a problem and that we could take the stairs. Being on the 6th floor carrying our own cases, needing to get ready to get to the theatre...I don't think so. We decided we would have to leave our cases with the concierge and go as we were. The alarm stopped so we decided we would go to our rooms to get changed. When we finally got to our room I was appalled. A little dinky twin room (we had requested a double) that would have looked more suited to a pay-by-the-hour motel you see in American films. And it didn't smell too clever either! It was totally unacceptable. Being as we didn't have time to complain before the show started we decided we would request a different room on our return. We arrived at the theatre late (dodgy directions from a receptionist led us over 1/2 mile up Oxford St before we asked a policeman. The theatre was no more than 200 yards from the hotel entrance!) On our return I spoke to the staff and voiced our concerns only to be met with blank stares which said \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I asked to see the duty manager. On his arrival he was quick to tell me that they were fully booked and had no other rooms. My argument was that we hadn't been given the correct room to begin with but he insisted there was nothing he could do. I asked him that if we wanted to book one of their expensive suites would there be one available. He went silent. He then offered us a free breakfast to compensate to which I replied a free breakfast will not stop our room form being crap! He then offered us a 10% discount on the room but point blank refused when I said that 50% would be more like it for the inconvenience. I then requested a full refund and advised we would go elsewhere. After arguing the toss for another 5 minutes (they were reluctant at first even saying they were not allowed to do that) we left. We then jumped into a cab where a wonderful taxi driver named George phoned around for us and organised a room at another hotel. God bless you George! He didn't even want to take any money fro m us but we felt we had to thank him somehow. I am amazed that the hotel has actually received good reviews from people but then you can't really rate customer service experiences unless you actually have a situation where you have to engage a customer service representative.

It is a good hotel if you are just looking for somewhere to put your head down for the night. The hotel is literally two minutes away from the tube station so you can easily get around London from there. Although, we didn't find that we needed to use the tube a lot because the location is brilliant. The hotel is just off Oxford Street so is in walking distance of most main attractions. The hotel is clean but could do with being refurbished. Certain areas are starting to look a bit shoddy. The rooms are fairly small but adequate for a few nights. We had a brilliant view right over London from our window. The only problem was the window didn't open very far which meant that the room got very hot, especially with being on the 9th floor. If you want to spend a lot of time in the hotel be prepared to be about boiled to death. The water is also boiling hot and we couldn't find a way to turn the temperature of the water down in the shower! The breakfast was a bit manic and you must be prepared to queue for at least 20 minutes if you want a full hot breakfast. We didn't - we just stuck to cereal, croissants and fruit juice. The Italian restaurant at the hotel is brilliant. There is a brilliant menu to suit all food requirements and the drinks menu is also fairly extensive. The food is good but be prepared to pay a little extra that average for this food. (Also, if you want chips make sure you order them separate because you just get what you order, i.e. Lasagne and that's it - no salad, garlic bread or chips!) The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and the staff at the Concierge Desk were extremely helpful, made you feel welcome and couldn't of been better. Everywhere you went in the hotel, if you met a member of staff the politely smiled and said hello - some asked where we'd been and if we were having a good time. So, I couldn't really fault the staff. All in all, a good hotel if you are visiting London for a few days and plan on just getting out to see a few sights or shows.

The room gave you the feeling of being in a small cabin on a ship, with the bed which was just about a double, taking up all of the floor space. The bathroom which again was clean was also very small with a shower, toilet and sink crammed in - no room for a bath. The hotel bar was quite smart and minimalsitic but was very pricey even for London standards. After the show and a meal at a local restaurant we returned to the hotel in the early hours to find the hotel bar still going strong with a good crowd in which was nice to finish the night off. Breakfast was a bit of a nightmare, very much canteen style self service for absolutely everything. We were queing at various machines for coffe and tea and another for juice.

The staff made a good impression on us as they were so friendly and helpful. There endeth the comlpiments! The rooms were accessed by an exceedingly small and slow lift service. Once inside the rooms, our hearts sank! Despite all having booked under one name, we had two rooms on the 8th floor and 2 on the 12th. Where's the logic in that? We examined all four rooms and found that they all had their faults and virtues. Good points: 1) One of the rooms had a good view of London - Big Ben and Westmisnter Abbey could be seen. 2) Sheets and pillowcases were crisp and white. 3) Each room had an ensuite bathroom. 4) The location of the hotel - close to Covent Garden and British Museum. 5) The concierge staff - friendly and helpful. Bad points: 1) The excessive heat. It was like being in a sauna. It was so stiflingly hot that even breathing was an effort. 2) The smell - our room stank. It transpired that the ensuite rooms didn't have an extractor fan and so the damp air simply circulated around the room and bathroom. 3) The size of the shower - I have NEVER seen such a small shower cubicle. 4) The duvets - synthetic covers which didn't smell or feel clean. 5) The view from our window - a wall and a filthy dirty little balcony area. 6) Curtains which did not hand properly. 7) Only one chair per room - so the other occupant could only sit or lie on the bead. (Hence, I feel, the unclean feel to the duvets). 8) A fan which was meant to cool the room could only be plugged into the single plug that existed and was too noisy and ineffecient to do more than shift the hot air around a little. 9) The breakfast - only just about edible. The bread rolls weren't. Queues were massive. More like an ineffecient school canteen than anything else. I think that however cheap a hotel may be, ( and it wasn't THAT cheap!) it is fair to expect sweet-smelling and comfortable conditions. If I was a hotel inspector, I would close it down as I feel it is not fit for its purpose. I couldn't sleep or make myself comfortable in the room - thank goodness I only had a night to suffer!

The friends I was travelling with were not familiar with London, so I chose St Giles as it was close to the tube and the main shopping/tourist areas. I did not expect grandeur for the price but was more than pleasantly surprised with the stay. We arrived quite late in the evening, around 10.30pm and were pleased to find that the \"close to the tube\" claim was actually correct, unlike many others. Just a minute away, even with luggage to carry. Our rooms were clean and tidy, with prefectly adequate facilities for a short break. We went downstairs and took a drink in the bar, which had an excellent range of international and domestic beers, wines and spirits. A point to note, although some other reviewers have complained that the rooms were old-fashioned (because you want to spend loads of time in your room when you are slap-bang in the middle of a capital city?!), the bar was cosmopolitan in decor, with soft and modern lighting and design. Although we did not have time to use the fitness centre, it was good to have such a facility included in the building. Breakfast was pleasant, a good selection on the cold buffet, nice to have the option of hot chocolate as well as tea or coffeee, and although not cooked to order, the hot items were hot and edible which is not always the case with buffets. We ate in the Italian restaurant on our last night, the food was not incredible but filled a hole. Service was fine throughout our stay and although there were sometimes queues for the lift, we found an ingenious way of avoiding this - taking the stairs. If you want to spend most of your time in the room, then perhaps book somewhere larger and more expensive. The St Giles is more than adequate for short business trips/tourists/shoppers/concert/theatregoers. If you consider that the average London hotel charges \u00a3150 - \u00a3250 a night and we paid \u00a370, if I was visiting London again for a similar trip, I would certainly prefer to book the St Giles and spend the other \u00a3100+ a day on fine dining, shopping, entertainment etc. If you take a look at my other reviews you will note that I do not give praise lightly, but as the manager of a 5 star hotel I do understand what does and doesn't represent value for money and what should be expected for a certain price/star grading.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value for money.\u201d", "Author": "Cheshirereview", "ReviewID": "UR19259748", "Content": "I read the reviews before I went and was a little concerned.

The room was stifling, the A/C was so noisy that we had to turn it off and open the window which made us feel like we were sleeping on the street with the amount of noise that came in. I was sharing the room with my husband and we soon agreed that if one of us was trying to move around the room the other had to stay on the bed as there was no room to move about at the same time without bumping into each other. The duvet was not particularly clean and smelled of 'someone else' although the bed sheets and pillows seemed fine. There was a very handy safe in the room albeit in a very awkward position near the window so you had to move the large standard lamp out of the way before you could get to it. There is internet access downstairs near reception which costs one sterling pound per 10 minutes - a rip off... but I needed it urgently so put in my pound - nothing happened, stupidly I put in another pound again nothing. I told the concierge who informed me that it was not the hotel's responsibility and I couldn't have a refund. I would have to take up my complaint with the internet company. I told him he was having a laugh and he pointed me in the direction of the Guest manager who after hearing what had happened immediately refunded my money without question. Thank you Mr Concierge. On one of our days there my husband was feeling unwell so I put the \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door before I left so he could get some sleep. He had four phone calls within an hour asking him when he would be vacating the room for the cleaners. He explained the situation but they seemed not to listen and he was constantly pestered until he refrained from answering the phone. If you are only staying in London for a couple of nights and not planning on spending any length of time in your room then St Giles standard room is fine particularly if you're on a budget. However our room was particularly dingy and depressing and I would have to be pretty desperate to go back again. I forgave it the first time because of it's brilliant location but ....twice bitten so to speak.

The hotel is just off Tottenham Court Road, and about a stones throw away from Tottenham Court Road tube station. The British Museum is about 5 minutes away, too! As I said, the room is a bit on the small side, but unless you're paying loads, you're not going to get much bigger in London. We were on the 12th floor, and it was hot! We checked in at 2pm (Standing in a queue for 20-30mins), and as soon as we walked in we opened the window. When we returned to our room at 12.30am, it was still baking hot! There is a small fan, but I would hated to have been staying in this hotel if it had been really hot. Noise is a bit of an issue, but my advice with any city centre hotel... take earplugs!

You can not keep the window open, as you would never get to sleep. It was the hottest day of the year while we were there and the room was unbearable. You couldn't come back to your room during the day to relax, so my husband and I who had come away for a relaxing weekend without our children, just stayed out all day and only went back to get showered and changed. To make matters even worse, which they didn't tell me when I booked the room with the hotel direct, there is a building site that is next door and they were unloading scaffolding trucks all day. The wardrobe held about 5 items of clothing and had no door on it and the table lamp shades were all covered in water stains. The restaurant is like a school canteen, where you all line up with a tray and pick from burnt bacon, cheap sausages and sloppy scrambled eggs. You have to get your tea and coffee from a machine as well. The breakfast was so bad, even though we had pre paid for breakfast we didn't go down again and I am not fussy at all. If this hotel had been cheap, I wouldn't have minded so much, but it isn't. The fire alarms went off at 3am in the morning while we were there also. Which wasn't an issue. We rushed downstairs and guests were just opening their bedroom doors and shutting them and going back to bed. When we got to reception, there was no muster point, no staff on hand to inform you what was happening and the fact the hotel has 560 rooms and was full, there was only about 20 guests who had bothered to get up. We waited outside for 20 minutes and still no-one came out to see us and let us know what was happening. After 30 minutes and then finally having to ask the guy at the reception desk what was going on, he said it was a false alarm, but up until then no-one knew any news and all those guests were still in bed. It was frightening and dangerous. We went back to bed and it went off again at 3.50am, I rang reception and asked if it was a false alarm and they said we will ring you back!! When they rang back to confirm it was a false alarm we couldn't get back to sleep, as you were not confident that it was.

This hotel is perfect for my needs. I like things simple, yet clean, a place you can trust and reasonably priced. Cheap (in London) normally means dingy and far from the west-end. This hotel is perfect. Just off of Oxford street - walking distance to theatres, attractions and shopping - or you can just hop on a bus/tube to whereever. The hotel in itself is an old YMCA that has been refurbished - so that gives you an idea of what to expect. The entrance hall is very grand and that in itself can give the wrong impression - the rooms are a let down in comparison yet I still think they are well worth the money. Checking in can go smoothly but if you are unlucky you can be waiting a while in the queue. The staff are pleasant, mostly foreign, English their second language - but goodwill and patience is a virtue. My room in November was on the second floor and in May it was on the third - both times they were a \u201ccorner\u201d room. Maybe we were lucky there. We could use the stairs - when there were queues for the lifts, but beware the second floor is not really the second floor. The rooms where a pleasant temperature (I like it cold at night) - I turned down the heating on arrival and opened the window while we were out. I did hear of a few people complaining that the rooms were too hot - I don\u00b4t know if their thermostat was broken. Yes, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are as small as they could be - but my friend and I didn\u00b4t need more - we slept and showered. .. and then we shopped The evenings where quiet - but the walls on all sides up and down are thin - so you can hear some noises. Mornings are noisy - so if you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in I recommend ear plugs for the early hours. The hotel leaves a \u201cwelcome letter\u201d which advises what time to go to breakfast. If you do go at the \u201cwrong\u201d time then expect a bit of waiting. The breakfast is fine if included in the room fee - you can eat light or eat for the day. It is not strictly an english breakfast and not \u201ccontinental\u201d either - they seem to have tried to cater for most (european) tastes - maybe a bit pricey if you pay extra (I think it was about 7 pounds) - but seven pounds is not bad for London. Starbucks is not far away and a brilliant tiny tiny shop over the road that sells wonderful coffee and fairtrade chocolate. Problems: We booked both times direct with the hotel, first time a group booking over the phone, second time using their website. The first booking they had seemed to have lost my booking (but not the rest of our group) - the hotel was full yet they were very helpful and found us a room (don\u00b4t know who they had to kick out) - everything took a bit a time but all was well. The second booking, through the internet, went better. I received a booking nr but no e mail confirmation. I rang the hotel to confirm my booking and I was booked in and everything was fine- so the internet system worked but email confirmation failed. Both times I booked about 3 months ahead and paid about 98 pounds a night - excellent for London, for the location and for the quality. I am familiar to the area and wanted to stay in the Bloomsbury area for my weekend. St Giles is the place for me now whenever I return -especially with a friend or my husband.

Small rooms, lousy beds (mattresses are probably from the Queen Victoria era), noisy & busy, bad internet (non-inroom, I\u2019ll elaborate: The hotel is located near the east end of Oxford St, nearby Tottenham Court Road and its associated tube station, within a 3 minute walk. From Heathrow take the tube (underground) Piccadilly line and change at Leicester Sq for the Northern line going north for one station. The hotel itself holds hundreds (600?) of rooms which makes it quite a busy hive during peak seasons. This is well noticed during breakfast, check-in, check-out, storing luggage or any elevator ride. The moderate condition lobby conceals the worn out condition of its guest rooms. The rooms are small and clean but the furniture condition is quite in bad shape. The beds, for example, are inconvenient to sleep in probably due to mattresses which have been manufactured during the late 80s (19th Century). The room has some basic equipment like a safe, hair drier, electric kettle (with coffee and tea supplies). The rooms may become noisy both due to the location of the hotel and also the room density (narrow corridors and number of rooms per wing per floor). I myself had some trouble sleeping (not only due to the mattresses\u2026). The hotel supplies a good breakfast, buffet style \u2013 items include: cereal variety, eggs, ham, sausages, cheese, European coffee machines, juices etc. We managed to book this hotel for about 100 GBP per night for a couple including breakfast. I\u2019ve stayed in other hotels (even worse) which charged me double. The business facilities of this hotel are unnoticeable. For example - first obstacle for getting a fax was finding the hotel fax number which the main one goes to the concierge which is typically busy handling other stuff.

As i needed to be at my interview for 10am i really needed everything to run smoothly, but the water in the shower didnt have hot water running untill i had left it running for 25mins. Then once i had had a shower i needed to dry my hair only to find that the hair dryer in the room didnt work and they didnt even think to provide a new one. (Something that i thought should automaticly me done when something like that isnt working, as i used to was as a cleaner in a hotel, this was somthing i had to check every day) NOT IMPRESSED! luckily my parents came with me so i could borrow the hair dryer in their room which was working thankfully. When i have finallt managed to get ready, i went down to breakfast, to find a massive queue to breackfast which was nothing more than just a canteen. the food wasnt bad but i must say i did expect better. If that wasnt enought, the next night i was there, the fire alarm went off 3 times during the night, the first time at 2am however it only lasted for about 2 mins so no one even left their room as there was no information given to any of the guests by any of the staff. then again at 6.30am the alarm went off for 45 mins. only then did people think to leave thier rooms and head down the fire escapes. Once i had got to the fire assembly point outside the building, all the alrms had stopped. my dad then went to reception to find out if it was safe for us to go back into the building but the staff just looked at him as if he had 2 heads. i this point things had just got beyond a joke and none of the gues knew what to do. at 7.30 i finally got back to my room and back to sleep only to be woken up again by the alarm at 8.00. As we had been told nothing previously not one guest took the alarm seriously, which could have been extreemly dangerous if there was a fire. overall i just couldnt wait to leave, the only good thing i have to say about the hotel would be that the concerge couldnt have been more helpful. he was actually the only member of staff that gave any of the customer the time of day.

The bacon was covered in disgusting white deposits and the egg had seen better days. But the worse thing was the queues- 15minutes to get to the food. Then a good hunt for a table We couldnt face it the next day. The second issue was building work and the staff's attitude. If work needs to be done thats fair enough but customers need to be housed away from it and warnd- there was none.We didnt go to spend much time in the hotel- just as well. When we returned with one hour to change and dress for an early night out we were greeted to the most dreadful noise from building directly above our room. No human could have stood the noise.

I arrived at the hotel to check in at 6:00pm only to be faced with about 10-15 marble steps to be able to get to the lobby area. At 6 months pregnant and armed with a heavy suitcase this was not ideal. I went across to the concierge desk which is located next to the stairs and requested a member of staff to help me carry my case upstairs. He looked at me like I was making a completely unrealistic request and expected a tip for the privaledge. He didn't speak a word to me and literally chucked my case at me when I reached the top. I was then faced with the biggest queue to check in that I have ever seen. I queued for over 30 minutes which was very uncomfortable only to reach the reception and be told that my reservation had been cancelled. I assured them that it had not and they told me that I needed to speak to reservations which was not located within the hotel. I had no choice but to leave the reception area whilst it was sorted out. I then had to wait a further 45 minutes whilst my work telephoned the reservations desk (which was constantly engaged). During this time the only seating area was up another load of stairs and the toilets up a further set. I was heavily pregnant, thirsty, exhausted and needed the toilet. I asked the desk if there was a lift to take me to the seating area as I had nowhere to leave my case and I was told no, I would have to take the stairs. As i couldn't lift my back, I then had to stand in the crowded lobby area for the 45 minutes which eventually resulted in me collapsing on the marble floor. Instead of the staff checking to see if I was OK they just stepped over me. I made a complaint when I paid and the man gave me a very pathetic apology and laughed the whole way through it, I was discusted and was offered no form of compensation for putting both the health of me and my baby at risk. My room was finally sorted out and I went up only to find that although I had booked a double room with a bath I was given a very pokey small twin room with a shower. The beds were on wheels and everytime I rolled over in the night the bed rolled away. I spent the whole night afraid that I was going to fall out. The bathroom was so small there was barely room to turn around. I must have had about an inch between my bump and the shower entrance, which was very uncomfortable. The room was also like a sauna when I walked in and the heating was turned off. I opened the window but as it only opened a small amount the room remained constantly hot, which in February was very strange and uncomfortable. The breakfast was absolutely discusting and if your offered the choice, I would go out and eat. If you try to go between 8 and 9 the queue is huge and you have to wait until there is a free table. The resteraunt is set out like a greasy spoon cafe, and the cooked breakfast consists of sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and baked beans. It's lukewarm and tastes like plastic. The eggs weren't cooked properly, the bacon was covered in fat and the sausages were tiny, you'd need to look really carefully to see the meat. The fruit was all tinned and they had no toast available, it was all self service including the tea served in mugs and the juice from a machine. I had apple juice which claimed was pure juice, only to find that it had been watered down...YUK, I actually felt physically sick after eating here. When I returned home I realised that the hotel had taken two payments from my card, in the region of hundreds of punds, one which was for payment of my room and another which I had no idea about. The two amounts were different and I did not authorise it or sign for it. I telephoned the hotel as soon as I noticed the error and was told that only one payment was made and that I would have to wait until the Monday morning, (two days) before they could look into it. This is still being looked into, but if you want to stay at a hotel which has absolutely no customer service, horrible rooms, discusting food and who steals money from you then this is defiantly the place to be.

When I first saw this site, which was today, I thought I should search up the hotels I've stayed in. The first thing that shocked me, was all the negative comments and rewives on this hotel and I thought this cant be the same hotel I lived in... (Well, I just saw some pictures from the worlds worst hotels, and compared to them this is a luxoury hotel...haha) For the price it's an ok hotel, you get almost what you pay for, there are some minor problems, like the breakfast. We got a warm welcome when I walked in, the stab was smileing and offerd to take our bags up the stairs and etc. The Lady behind the counter was nice (and spoke perfect english, as the others we talked to working there)and the man in the information/tourist counter was really nice and helpful too. The service was great. (We were 3 friends, sharing one dubble room with an extra bed) The room was ok, not modern, but not the 50's motel-room look eighter. Smelled cleand and nice, it looked nice and clean aswell. (Which is REALLY important to me) The size was ok, it was plenty of room for ourself and our stuff. The bathroom was also clean and nice, but could been a little bit bigger, though. If you have problems with your back or have problems sleeping, you should be prepared.. because the bed's are quite hard, the dubble bed could also been a bit bigger, but I wasn't a huge problem. However ther's one thing I really disliked, out side the rooms in the hallways, there were some places you were aloud to smoke, inside...! Which is terrible for the guests and the staff who works there. I don't know if that's changed, but I hope so... The breakfast was also terrible, not any avalibale seats at the begining, it was over crowded and a chaos with people in the breakfast area. The food wasn't any good, but I have to mention that I don't like any hotel foods (And I've been to alot of hotels..) The location was GREAT we could walk to everything: the shooping streets, both expencive and cheap, museums,theatres, guided tours etc. A really central location! But I have to say it was hard to find any decent place to eat, if you wanted to eat in a resturant and not a pizza or burger place, you had to look for a while... I have a friend who recently stayed on this hotel (november or december 2007), and they thought it was ok, too.

I always check out the reviews on trip adviosr prior to commiting to a booking. The St Giles had mixed reviews, but due to it;s excellant location I took a chance....... Big Mistake! Check in was ok, given the key to our room at 1.30 and on first inspection the room seemed ok. The triple room consisted of the smallest double bed I have ever seen (a large single is a more acurate description) and a single pull down (hide away) bed. In all seriousness if you are larger than small build, the double bed would NOT be wide enough for 2 people. There was a charming view from our room of the london eye and a building site with huge (noisy) crane, of course this is'nt the hotels fault. The bathroom is a subitable size for a hobbit.!... the shower cubical is so small that the shower curtain sticks to you throughout your shower, regardeless of the position you stand in. Upon returning from our evening out, i realised that the \"Pull down\" bed did'nt have any pillows, I rang reception and was assured pillows would be bought up immediatly..... 40 mins later my pillows arrived. There is more road noise (Tottenham Court Rd) than I had expected, however sellted into a resfull nights sleep..... Only to be abruplty woken at 8.00 by the miad entering our room. I attempted to go back to sleep only for her to return 20 mins later and enter the room again. I can only assume that she expected us to be up, dressed, packed and ready to leave in 20 minutes. I attempted to address this with the maid, who spoke vertualy no English howver mutted something about the \" Do NoT DisTurB\" sign. There was NO sign in the room. I promptly got dressed, and headed down to reception to complain. The Receptionist who spoke in very broken and only basic english explained that it's a compnay policy to enter rooms if a Do nOT Disturb sign is not dispalyed??? I clarified that the compnay train housekeeping staff to enter customers rooms 3 hours prior to checkout out time, if the sign is not displayed. This was comfirmed by the receptionist! To add insult to injury, after being woken an hour earlier than we planned for our relaxing weekend away, we haeded down to breaksfst. We waited 20 mins in a que outside the resturant to be seated at a dirty table (we cleared the dishes ourselfs) and stood for a futher 10 mins in a que for the breakfast hot plate! The breakfast is possibly the WORST i have ever tasted, luke warm and basic to say the least. I picked up a Crossiant as i pused the hot breakfast aside, howveer this was rock solid and 100% stale. We left the St giles immediatly after breakfast and returned our cases to the NCP car park located under the hotel. We discoveerd that 2 vehicles parked next to ours had been broken into, with the drivers window smashed and completly ransacked. Our car was undamaged but this is NOT a secure car park. we were also advised by the hotel thet our parking cost would be \u00a315. We infact paid \u00a327. The customer service at this hotel is TERRIBLE. all the poor reviews are justified, i can unfortunaly vouch for this. If you are in two minds and thinking you will take a chance on this hotel as the location is good DON'T.

The beds were old, saggy and had blankets rather than quilts. The TV was a 14\" portable on the wall with a remote control that didn't work. The bathroom was tiny, brown and whilst clean had a horrible feel to it. Breakfast - More like a school canteen affair with food layed out all over the place with no organisation, hard tables and chairs, lino flooring and a dimly lit series of rooms. People just grabbed trays and then bundled in to get what they wanted there was organisation or structure to the layout. The quality of the food was very poor and bland tasting.

Check-In was efficient at 1530 and I even managed to get the receptionist to smile. We did notice there were check in queues at 1700-1800 as the business folk arrived. We were allocated on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel. Lifts had minds of their own and sometimes never came when called. Not too far to walk down fire escape stairs for us, but could have been a real pain if you are on the 11th floor. Our room was small, clean and cozy. There is no AC so that could be problem in summer. You do get tea & coffee facilities,hairdryer, TV plus pay per view movies (didn't use) and a free digital safe. Bathrooms are small and only useable by one person at a time, the shower was always hot and powerful even at 0830. Towels were rather threadbare, but I guess that stops people stealing them. Our room was located next door to the cleaners cupboard and we did get the odd whiff of cigarette smoke as the maids had a break. As we were at the back of the hotel noise was not too bad (from Bedford Avenue) but we could here the Cops whizzing up and down Tottenham Court Road. The bed was firm but comfortable and the maid service was efficient on both days with all towels/tea/coffee/milk replenished. There is NO fridge or mini-bars in the standard double rooms but there are vending machines in our corridor selling sweets and beer (\u00a32 a can). We bought carry outs from Sainsburys for when we returned from our long days out!

We went for breakfast at 0830 on both days and there were plenty of free tables thanks to the Managers letter,nice one! Maybe that is more for summer time? Breakfast was a self service affair with either bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, hash browns and beans or you could have cereals or the Continental Breakafast selection. Tea was Twinnings and served in mugs just like being at School again. I did find that the tea tasted medicinal and I think that was due to the water boiler needing cleaning. Coffee was good however so I stuck with that. The restuarant/canteen staff were very efficient and cleaned up tables straight away.

The reception queue was never-ending, and three of the previous night's guests were arguing with a front-desk attendent over discrepancies with their bill. When we finally got to the desk, they had no record of our booking, even though we had the internet confirmation with us! When that was eventually sorted, I made my way to my room - once again, the queue for the lifts was incredible, and frustrations among fellow guests was pretty high. However, I was prepared to forget all the problems once I saw my room. But what a shambles! I could hardly get in the door, it was so tiny. The room was horrible - the carpet was dirty and stained, the bathroom smelt of damp and there was mold in the grouting. The heat was stifling even though the window was open (you had to close this at night because it was just too loud outside). The only relief was a little electric fan - no air con. My friend was also having the same problems, but she also had to put up with a couple arguing loudly next door, and having very noisy sex the night after! She asked if she could book one of the films being shown, and was told that her room wasn't enabled for pay-per-view, even though the menu sat on top of her TV.

The bathroom, although convenient if you wished to shower, use the loo and wash your hands simultaneously, was the smallest I have ever seen, I would warn more generously proportioned guests that they should consider using the shower at their peril as I fear if they make it in, they may not make it our without sufficient lather!!!! The decor was tired and generally grimy and I did not risk a peak at the mattress in case it kept me awake; after viwing a spare one in the corridor the next morning, I'm so glad I didn't otherwise I would never have slept. I twice asked for a blanket as the bed only had a sheet and a top cover; regrettably it failed to materialise so I slepy with a coat over to top of the bedspread. My colleague reported that her TV ( a small portable circa 1986) was not working as was promised a repair; once again no luck so no TV! The communal areas on the1st floor were also fairly grim, although the reception lulls you in to a false sense of security as this area was perfectly acceptable.

Opening the door to our room we found the smallest room we have ever stayed in, having to go sideways trough the door with our suitcases. At least the air wasnt smelly but it was very warm, so we opened the window, but it couldnt open more than 8-10 inches. At first look the room seemed clean, but at a closer look we fond dirtmarks on the walls, small cracks in the tiling on the bathroom, and dust in the corners. Also there where no ashtray in the room, but we had speceficaly booked at smoking room, it first arrived after 2 complaints to reception over an 9 hour period. Getting up the day after to shower we found out that the air-vent / fan in the bathroom wasnt working, so all the moist and condensation from two people showering got out in the room, not very pleasant. We contacted reception and was promised that it would be fixed, but nothing happened. The bed was very small and uneven, if you sat in one end you would go down 10-15 inches but in the other end onle 3-5 inches. Also it is very short, so if you are taller than 175 cm. you cant lie stretched out. The tv in the room is badly tuned and a third of the channels listed in the guest directory, wasnt working. The hotel has only 4 lifts for 700 rooms so we often waited a couple of minutes before it arrived. The only good things at this hotel is its location, close to the tube and shopping / attractions, and its concierge who is very helpfull. The last morning of our stay, there was no warm water, so we had to leave without being able to shower. The only reason that we didnt left and found another hotel, is that we didnt spend more time there than to sleep and shower. We dont expect luxurious executive rooms to this price, but having booked a superior room (above standard) we at least expect the basic things to be in order.

Yes, of course it is. So you will be pleased to hear that you can stay right in the very center (well almost) of it at a reasonable price. Provided you choose the St Giles. The hotel is located on Bedford Avenue (between Holborn and Camden Town), the intersection of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street is a mere 100 meters away. You have access to the Tube via Tottenham Court Road Station (Central and Northern Lines). Oxford Street, Soho, the British Museum, Leicester Square, and even Piccadilly Circus are within a comfortable walking range. There is a variety of restaurants and snack bars in the vicinity, athough for a REALLY good meal I recommend the Marsala Zone, which is a bit further down Oxford St (on Marshall St, off Oxford Circus) and serves an amazing range of Indian specialties at a competitive price. Staff at the St Giles are generally helpful and the concierge service is above par. Breakfast is served buffet-style in a large breakfast room not unlike a company cafeteria or college dining hall. A good choice of hot and cold breakfast options, cereals, hot and cold drinks. So why have I not given the St Giles an \"above average\" rating? Simply, in one word: the ROOMS. Now, if you've read any of my other reviews, you will know that I'm not the kind of person who pays for budget accomodation and expects the Ritz. I also basically need my room for sleeping or napping, but not for much more. However, I do take offense when I check into a room and find the previous occupant's humongous TURD swimming in the toilet bowl. Ok, water pressure can be a bit low in London but this just tells me that room service did not bother to have a look (and probably didn't do a very good cleaning job in the first place). However, during the rest of the stay room service was ok. Maintenance staff also went out of their way to fix the door of our in-room safe and were very quick about it, too. Sheets were clean but there was a slightly musty smell in the corners of the room. Which leads me to something else: The room felt stifling hot (and this in April). I can't bear imagining what it must be like in August as there is no a/c and the windows do not open all the way.

Arrived back at hotel at 5.00pm to be given our room. We waiting approx 15mins for lifts then we went into our room and I have never smelt anything like it the fusty smell, the dirty stains on the carpet we were afraid to take our shoes and socks off. and there was no room to even open our suitcases such a squash. Then as we were heading out to theatre for a show we had to get ready the shower was luke warm and then would not turn off we had to call maintenance up, then the toilet would not flush and there was 1 plug in a room for 3 people - no plugs for hairdryer, laptop, phone charger a bloody joke and the power kept on cutting out, the towels were stinking just not acceptable at all....at this we called reception and demaned another room and they arrived up in 10mins and gave us another room which to be fair was cleaner and the smell was much better than the last hovel. Went out for our night out and dreaded going back to the hotel, I have never seen the likes of this before maybe we just got a few bad rooms as they were triple rooms and in what looks like an old part of the hotel. 3. At 8.30am on Sat morning there was the hammering of nails and a drill going that really finished it for us we simply got up, got dressed and checked out and went to a hotel in Mayfair 4* and only cost \u00a320.00 extra in comparison to St Giles. The hotel lobby was busy and this hotel must do well but it really was a horrible place I really wished I had booked into a travel lodge as it would have been half the price and clean.. basic but clean the the St Giles is very basic and a dirty hole at that. Very disappointed and we have stayed at many 3 star hotels but you would really be better in a hostel or a travel lodge this hotel is definetly one to be missed!!!!!!! To be fair the staff were very good its not their fault the place is so run down the hotel just needs bulldosed and these people given jobs in a decent hotel.

The size of the room: There was once an old lady who lives in a shoe: I now know how she felt. The temperature of the room, as well as the water in the shower, was luke-warm at best. The room heater is located under the tiny dressing table, allowing a miniscule amount of the heat to escape to the tiny closet that is the atrociously overpriced quarters you have purchased. Funny, you would think the heater would be able to cater to the entire 4m x 5m area. That is, unfortunately, not the case. Which doesn't matter so much, given that the equally as tiny window overlooking...the west wing of the hotel..opens a fraction of an inch. There is no room service available. There is laundry service. There are 6.5 channels on television. (The .5 is the channel with the lousy reception).

We had a great vacation in London. Our room was facing the street in the 6.th floor of the hotel. It was a twin room and knowing the size of rooms in London it was a normal / average room - not tiny and not large. It was clean! I normally would not have booked this hotel because of all the bad reveiws and ratings here but since I had to book the hotel through a tourist company in my home town I had no choise. I was expecting a horrible hotel but was pleasently surprised! Yes there is a lot of noise coming from the street. What do you expect in the middle of London. If you close the window like we did it it will not bother you. Ofcourse in very hot weather things wiil be different..... And Yes there really are a strange smell of urin in the room......My brother and I was joking about it before we went that we most likely would have to breathe through our mouth. Since we had been warned about it it acually did not bother us that much all though it was rather strange. We kept the windows open while we where out during the day and that kept the smell down. the breakfast was swell - I really cannot complain. scrambled eggs, lots of bacon, beans and what have you. cereals to your hearts content and coffe / cappuchino machine and fruits for dessert. The seating area can resemble a cantine but remember that the hotel is huge with 600-700 rooms The staff at the front desk was very helpful and booked us a guided tour to Stonehenge. I have no complains at all conserning the service. My brother and I wanted to see lots of shows when in London. We love theatre and was able to get great tickets at the tickets office at leicester square (look out for scams that want to sell you really bad tickets - there are so many of them and i have been set up at prior visits to London - make sure you find the roundshape ticket office next to the park. That is the real ticket office) We got great tickets for both Stomp and Fool for love ( 25 pounds for stall tickets) with Juliette Lewis.(my brother really likes her) and strangely enough we passed by her in the hotel lobby one night......kind of cool All in all a good tourist hotel.

This hotel seems to cater for groups, coach parties, and for individual travellers on a budget. It is in the same massive tower block as the YMCA and the bedrooms and dining facilities reflect some features of a YMCA hostel. The standard of the accommodation is fairly basic \u2013 and is substandard in many respects. This hotel certainly does not merit the three-star description, awarded by our travel agency. Our bedroom was very small but appeared to be clean. It provided the basic necessities for a short stay - with an en-suite bathroom, TV, telephone, closet, a safe, and tea & coffee-making facilities. However, there were several holes in the bedding. The tiny bathroom offered a shower only \u2013 but no bath. The washbasin taps dripped continuously and the shower had very basic controls only \u2013 so the temperature of the shower fluctuated from \"rather cool\" to \u201calmost warm\u201d. Our bedroom window was triple glazed, which provided good protection against noise from the street - provided we kept the window closed. Our visit coincided with a period of hot weather - so the resulting lack of ventilation meant that our room became hot and stuffy. The only bedding comprised top and bottom sheets, with a winter-weight duvet, which was far too heavy for the month of June. Consequently, we did not sleep very well. Furthermore, our bedroom had no curtains (drapes) \u2013 only translucent Venetian blinds, which did not prevent bright sunlight from waking us at sunrise. On a more positive note, we were very happy with the hot buffet breakfast (included in our three-night package). The breakfast room was not luxurious and was often very busy \u2013 so guests sometimes had to wait for a table to become vacant. However the rapid turnover meant that the food was always hot and fresh. The quality of the tea, coffee and other beverages was excellent \u2013 and far better than in some four-star hotels. The hotel invites its guests to use the YMCA gym, fitness centre, and swimming pool complex in the basement. Not many hotels in this category offer leisure facilities of this calibre \u2013 and the charge of GBP3 per person (which covers the entire duration of the guest\u2019s stay at the hotel) is very reasonable. The facilities at Hotel St. Giles are rather similar to a Travelodge or other budget chain. However, the nearby Travelodge is not prepared to offer luggage storage facilities following checkout. Hotel St Giles is happy to provide secure luggage storage for up to 24 hours, free of charge \u2013 which can be a major bonus, particularly if a visitor wants to explore London following check-out. This is a mixed review. Some aspects of the hotel were good \u2013 others were very disappointing. However, the location in the West End of London is ideal for a theatre package, shopping, and sightseeing. So would I stay there again? Perhaps \u2013 but only if the price was right!

Let's be pragmatic: look at the hotel's website; look at the reviews on this website; look at the price. Now, it doesn't claim to be the Dorchester or the Carlton Park Tower, nor does it say that rooms have air conditioning or that they are so many square metres. I really feel that with the St. Giles you pay your money (what - 75-95 GBP per night) and you take what you get. Yes, the lifts are slow. Yes, the breakfast room can be a little crowded - but there is a notice in the foyer that refers to this... Yes, the rooms are small (but see above). Yes, they might be a little warm (but see above). But come on, folks. For this price, what on earth do you expect?! Important factors are cleanliness: you can survive a little heat, but maybe not the embarassment of an attack of the dreaded bedbugs and the attendant red spots. I'd rather stay in a clean room, and the St. Giles provides. Look at the location, my friends. And if you want to be in the centre of things, you'd be pretty naive to think that even double-glazing could drown out all noise. Yes, perhaps the staff may have been a little surly during other members' visits, but in my experience they've always been quite helpful. Yes, I know, subjective...!! In summary, if you want to pay more, then fine. I'd agree that you would expect more from the rooms costing \u00a3100+ per night.

LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION... The one saving grace for the St Giles is the location, which all said and done is bang slap in the middle of the West End, with both Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road a brisk 5 minutes walk away. Tucked neatly away on Bedford Court, the hotel does serve its purpose well for tourists on a tight tight budget or for overnight business stays, though I am not sure I would consider this hotel for a romantic weekend with a musical and meal! A taxi ride to Euston Station is about \u00a35 which is good value for money in anyones book. ROOM WITH A VIEW? The worst room I have stayed in in a European city EVER! It is simple as that. London rooms are never large or spacious so my expectations were not high however... Single bed, pokey window that barely shuts out the road noise, a bathroom no bigger than a rabbit hutch (don't even look at the shower tray) all in a prison cell space no more than a broom cupboard. A big disappointment after walking the many miles around the warren of corridors in trying to find the room. Good, power shower doesn't make up for lack of space, comfort or cleanliness though. Saving grace is that there is a hard bed to fall into after a day away from the room! No incentive to stay more than the night hours require. I assure you you will want to get up and out asap in the mornings. FOOD FOR THOUGHT... Breakfast was ample, with a warm buffet choice of full english or continentental if required. Staff were preoccupied and didn't offer anything other than to point me in the direction of a table however. It is a free for all when it comes to food in the mornings and the queue is quite substantial between 8.30 and 9.15 so get in early. The restaurant and bar areas are both very modern with reasonable prices, plenty of seating, good lighting and a nice atmosphere. The evening staff are much more friendly, welcoming and service oriented than the morning staff though. IF I COULD OFFER YOU ONE PIECE OF ADVICE THEN... Only deal with reception when you have to. Very disorganised, not particularly welcoming and not forthcoming if there is an issue with room, rate, booking etc... Not at all customer focussed. Additionally, the lifts - going up no problem, nice and swift. Coming down (you are in a rush to check out with luggage or for breakfast) - forget it - 20 minutes is not unexpected from the 7-8th floor and even then it is tough going (the Titantic tunes don't feel you with confidence!).

On arrival the male receptionist for whom English was clearly not his first language had trouble finding my booking and called over a female supervisor who was very helpful. My booking was on file but neglected to include breakfast as requested. However, when I showed my copy of the corespondence sent to the hotel by my employer the booking was changed. Check-in was very slow, which was surprising as I was being attended to by a senior member of the team. As mentioned by other reviewers the lifts take forever to arrive which seems strange as there are about six of them. My swipe card stubbornly refused to open the door to my room so after 5 minutes of trying I returned to Reception where the supervisor reprogrammed it. Being told there was \"no problem with the card\" whilst watching her struggling to get it recognised by the card reader was irritating but she was polite throughout and the card finally worked OK when I returned to the room. Frankly my room was the smallest I have ever stayed in and although it was clean enough it had seen better days. The coffee provided comprised two sachets of Nescafe, two of whitener and one small plastic stirrer (no spoon). The shower was great as it comprised a walled-in cubicle and it worked well. The only drawbacks were that it took up one third of the bathroom and the combined on/off & hot/cold control was unmarked and setting it was a bit hit & miss. The restaurant (Hugo's) is in fact a pizzaria, with high prices for unexciting food. To give you some idea of how unimpressed I was, I actually went to the Pizza Hut in Charring Cross Rd for my pizza (which was great!). Breakfast at the St.Giles is 'buffet style' and whilst the surroundings are tatty and the food produced on the conveyor belt principle there is plenty of choice and you can help yourself to whatever content and volume you require.

My daughter, her friend and mother, and myself stayed there over the May day weekend and it wasn't that bad. First impressions were very encouraging. Reception staff were very helpful and polite. We were able to check in, but as our room wasn't ready we could leave our luggage at Conciere, foc, so that we could be luggage free to shop! The lifts were okay, but there was the odd foreigner who pushed their way in front, instead of waiting like the rest of us. The rooms were small, but adequate for our needs - somewhere to freshen up and sleep. There was no hot water in the shower, but a quick phone call to reception, and five minutes later I had hot water!! Nice clean towels and sheets, your own kettle, tea and coffee available in the room. There was a very small window, and because we were on the top floor (floor 12!) there was a lovely breeze to freshen up the room, but no views! Queuing for breakfast was a little annoying. As soon as a table became free some people from the queue would sit at the table, to hold it for their family/group they were with. That meant that those at the front of the queue would have a tray of food, but no where to sit. Why don't people use their brains!! It was just like the Germans putting towels on their sun beds!!!! However, the food was pretty good, and there was lots of it. When we checked out, we were able to leave our luggage at conciere, but this time we paid \u00a31.00 per bag - which was fine considering the convenience of not having to lug suitcases around with us while sight seeing. Overall, great location (5 mins from Tottenham Road tube, Northern line & Oxford Street, central line) and great service.

I stayed whilst visiting London on Business. My company had paid for the room in advance but the staff were adamant that they hadn't. In fact the Hotel charged the full cost of the room to my credit card before I left. When I return to work my secretary had to handle the matter and get a refund. On to the room itself - too much noise from the street below (actually sounded like the window was wide open even though it was tightly shut), loads of noise from inside the hotel too - school kids and students running around into the early hours!. I asked for a non smoking room yet when I got into the room it smelt so bad I had to buy an air freshener! They also mix smoking and non smoking rooms on the same floor so even if you are in a non smoking room you will still smell smoke. I stayed five nights and never once had hot water in my room in the evening. On two days my bed wasn't made and on one day I was given towels with holes in them!

We booked a non-smoking room for the weekend through Superbreak. The hotel is easy to find and was just 50 yards from Tottenham Court Road Station, and around the corner from Oxford Street. CHECK-IN On arrival we were told that they were re-doing all the locks on the doors of the non-smoking rooms, and that we\u2019d have to have a smoking room, but they\u2019d upgrade it to a bigger room. And they also said that if the room was too smoky, we should call for housekeeping and they\u2019d come to freshen up the room. Check-in was very slow, but we had a British girl serve us and she was very polite. Eventually, we headed off to our room on the first floor. And its true what everyone says\u2026..the lifts take FOREVER to come! THE ROOM Well, the room absolutely reeked of smoke, but luckily I\u2019d brought an air freshener with me! If this was an upgrade, I\u2019d like to have seen what the standard sized rooms were like! The window only opened about 2 inches, as the television was stood directly in front of it! The bathroom was the smallest I\u2019d ever seen! The shower cubicle was built into the wall, so the entrance to the shower was only half the cubicle width! Having said that, the shower was one of the better I\u2019ve used \u2013 good water pressure and constant temperature. There were 2 glasses and a basket of complimentary soap, shower gel, shoe shine and shower cap. The toilet roll was cheap and horrible, but I\u2019d envisaged this after reading other Trip Advisor reviews and had brought some of my own along. Also a very old looking hairdryer, but again, we brought our own.We had a kettle with 2 sachets of tea / coffee / milk / sugar etc on the dresser that had a mirror, shaving plug and light above it. We had a cup of tea each on arrival, and when we got back from our shopping asked at the reception for some more teabags and milk cartons, which was no problem at all. (You might want to note that there is a Tesco just across the road from the hotel, and we got some biscuits and snacks for the room when we got back late). There was a full-length mirror in the room. There was also a small wardrobe (one door!) with a safe inside. Bring your own hangers though! The television was a good size, and had several satellite + radio channels. There was no air conditioning and the room being so small got very hot. We didn\u2019t risk having the window open at night as we were situated next to a rooftop. I wouldn\u2019t like to stay there in the summer. RESTAURANT / BAR Breakfast was a complete nightmare! There weren\u2019t many tables available, and the queuing system was appalling! If you wanted to get a top-up fruit juice or hot drink, you had to go back to the end of the queue and wait what seemed like an eternity to get to the drinks at the end of the line. The glasses for the fruit juice were more like shot glasses so we filled up a mug instead! There was a fair choice: croissants, bread rolls, slices of ham & cheese, butter, jam, marmalade, cereals + milk, fruit and fried breakfast. The hot drink machine was better than the normal choice and had tea, coffee, latte, hot chocolate and more. The fruit juices were apple, orange and grapefruit. Once you\u2019d got your breakfast, you had to find a table! You either had to share with others, or wait until a table became available but have cold breakfast. We didn\u2019t have any meals other than breakfast here, although we did visit the bar for a cocktail before going out one night. The bar staff were friendly, although I felt the drinks were a little overpriced. CHECK-OUT We wanted to checkout early, around 10am so we could get some final shopping in before going home! As before, the queues were incredibly long and we decided to post our key cards into the \u2018express check-out\u2019 box, as we had nothing extra to pay. We then made our way to the concierge to leave our cases while we went out. We were dumbfounded to be given our collection ticket and a charge for the 2 cases at \u00a32.00!!! I\u2019ve never had to pay for that service before, and was quite annoyed. CONCLUSION The location of this hotel was great. Just yards away from Tottenham Court Station and being so close to Oxford Street made it ideal for shopping and bringing bags back to the room. The staff I encountered were all very friendly and polite. If you are only going for a weekend like we did, and don\u2019t plan to spend much time in the room then this is definitely a good place to stay. I\u2019ve stayed in several other London hotels, and this was no better or worse. If you are claustrophobic or plan to spend a fair amount of time in the room though, or it\u2019s during summer I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.", "Date": "April 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cSmallest hotel room I have ever stayed in.\u201d", "Author": "DublinDubliner", "ReviewID": "UR3305358", "Content": "Just back from a 3 day break in London.

First impression: a previous guest must have had a very bad night. The entry door had been worked over by a heavy and sharp implement of destruction. I wondered if \"The Shining\" had been filmed in my very own hotel room. We had elected to upgrade to a \"suite\" from god-only-knows-what. The bedroom (the one with the alledged \"double\" bed) was so small that I could stand on the bed and touch opposing walls with my fingertips. I could (and did) change the TV channel with my feet. Room number 2 of the \"suite\" would be better described as a crypt, and the single bed a gurney. There was a small table in this room as well as a wooden stool. The hotel was nice enough to leave stationary and a pen on the table. A previous guest had apparently written a heavy-handed note on the stack of stationary, and although the original letter was no longer there, the impression of the despondent writer's last words remained on the remaining leaves. In short, the poor man was NOT a happy camper either. One can only hope that he was granted his final requests. My wife checked the closet for a body but GUESS WHAT! The \"closet\" wouldn't hold a body, much less our clothing and/or suitcases. The \"bathroom\"? It was so small that the bathroom door had a cut-out in it so that it could swing inwardly and bypass the sink. I wished that the wall opposite the toilet had similar accommodations for my knees. I have been on small airplanes whose lavatories were luxurious by comparison. Let's put it this way: it would have been easy to mistake the shower curtain for toilet paper. (Okay, maybe not, but the shower curtain was much easier to reach than the toilet paper). The shower? That must have been where that nozzle projected from the wall above the toilet. So much for the bright side. On to the bad news. If you live in the UK and EVER have the urge to visit New Orleans, USA during Mardi Gras, stifle it.

And oh, you'll be moved to tears--- literally--- by the morose, mulitply-pierced-dressed-in-mourning Goths. Somebody PLEASE safely store all sharp and pointed objects! The concierges? Well, let's just say that they understand only one thing. I never did determine what that one thing is, but it's probably a word spoken in a language unknown to the live-bearing world. And the pizzeria! Hey, it would have been nice to have had some cheese on my cardboard hubcap. And why did the \"bottled\" water have a disturbingly sunny look to it? And why wasn't it opened at the table? And why didn't the restaurant have another, UNOPENED bottle of water for us when we asked for one? Breakfast will be an experience of a lifetime (provided, of course, that you survive your overnight stay). When ate at the St. Giles, the fare was interesting. Breakfast came in various shades of yellow, brown, and gray, and it had much of the taste and texture of food.
