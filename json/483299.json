Originally, I was concerned over the distance from the resort to the parks and the wait for buses, etc. We decided to drive 1 day to the park ourselves but every other time we took Disney transportation which is much better, even if you just miss a bus and have to wait on another one, much easier! It had been 17 years since we had done Disney....forgot how much we love it and how \"magical\" it really is. It is not at all over-rated....seeing the faces of our grandsons was priceless, and having a great resort to come home to after 8 - 12 hour days at the parks was great!

For the first time in our more than a dozen trips there, we stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort. We opted for the two bedroom villa. The arrival, checkin, and welcome by the staff was - of course - magical. True Disney goodness, with us smiling from Mickey Ear to Mickey Ear. The villa was very spacious, with a master bedroom/bathroom combo, a living room, full size kitchen, and a second bedroom with two queen beds and its own bathroom. The furnishings were comfortable and clean, the kitchen and bathrooms were fully equipped and stocked, and immaculately clean. So, from a comfort level, absolutely perfect. A walk through the property (gigantic!) will make you wonder if you are really at a Disney resort. There are almost no indications of that being in the land of the Mouse. Aside from the other tourists wearing their Disney gear, and the occasional employee handing out stickers to the kids, you will not find characters around, nor the topiaries, signage, etc. It's a lot more \"middle-aged\" then a super fun hotel for the kids. The food options are very, very slim. There is a counter service restaurant, with a limited menu, and a \"bar and grille\" option with an equally simple menu. I strongly advise that you eat your meals prior to returning to the hotel. My biggest issue was with the internet and cell phone connectivity. None. Not a lick of AT&T coverage in the room, and barely one bar on the other parts of the property. The free wi-fi offered was a joke. Might as well not offer it. I couldn't hold it connected for more than 3 minutes and it was painfully slow. That was on the laptop... I called the help desk and the representative explained that the wi-fi is new to them and they are still figuring it out. He also mentioned that smart phones, iPads, etc will have a very hard time connecting to their wi-fi \"because of the way our buildings are built\". Whatever that means. Unfortunately, some of us cannot be completely offline while in Disney World. So that was a very big problem. Bottom line: for a very comfortable setup, close to Downtown Disney, a big kitchen, that's the place to go! Beautiful property. If you like the food courts like in some other Disney resorts, this one may not be for you.

I would probably stay at The Paddock because that is where the pool is and it is closer to the main lobby, which is also closest to the Artist Palette, which you have to go to get mug refills and any small thing you need for the room. From where we stayed it was quite a trek. We had a one bedroom villa(my mother went with us) and she slept on the queen sleeper in the living room and it was very comfortable. My husband and I had a huge King size bed. When we booked our room I was under the impression we would have a crib, like your child has at home, but that is NOT what it is.

Our room was close to the front gate so we had plenty of exercise walking up to the main hub of the resort.

It is possible to take a bus around the resort if you want to wait but we chose to walk. I was also disappointed with the lack of a lounge (bar) area for an adult beverage. Next to the restaurant there was a \"hole in the wall\" where you could order a drink with a seating area with sofa's, chairs, pool table, but no bar like atmoshphere.

We had asked to be in the Congress Park area on a 4th floor - our request was perfectly honored. Upon opening our door (room 2825) we breathed in the aroma of fresh carpet & paint - and also found a brand new mattress and reupholstered furniture inside. They were still working on our building and the construction workers were very polite - they informed us that our unit and floor had just been finished days before we arrived. We felt very lucky. Love the Congress Park area of the resort. It is a 5 minute walk to the main building, food service, pool - it also is the closest to Downtown Disney - and most rooms have a wonderful view of this. Housekeeping was excellent. We enjoyed both the Paddock Pool and High Rocks Pool - both have water slides, food & drink service. Every area/neighborhood with in Saratoga Springs (there are 5) has their own pool. We enjoyed the counter service breakfast daily at the Artist Palette - and refilling our mugs. Sam who works there is a wonderful, informative employee. He took time to explain and help us with our Disney Dining Plan and always engaged our children in genuine conversation. We used the WDW Bus services multiple times a day - never experienced an unusual wait for service - it is an amazing well oiled machine. We love Saratoga Springs - and I have been staying in WDW resorts since 1990 - have stayed at Value Resorts and Deluxe Resorts and all in between. Saratoga Springs is sprawling and a great get away from the hustle and bustle of the parks. I remember laying in bed several mornings and thinking how amazingly quiet and peaceful it was. Always - make dining reservations well in advance. We made ours in November for a March trip and still were unable to get into O'hana at the Poly. Dining Plan/Restaurant info: the refillable mug program is now included with your plan - no additional cost to purchase a mug. Also, for counter service meals (i.e.: at parks), a dessert is included, usually a pudding something in a cup - you can trade out your dessert for a bottled water. We did this daily at lunch and each had a water for the warm afternoons. Great service, view and meal at California Grill! Also enjoyed Liberty Tree at the MK and Biergarten in Germany at Epcot. We loved the food (3 course Prix Fixe) and our waitress at Chefs de France in Epcot - amazing quality of French food but had a terrible experience with the Check In/Table waiting process. We had a reservation at 530p - arrived at 520p - and were seated at 625p. We asked the seating manager about the wait, he was unhelpful and rude. I believe the key is to either book at 5p or closer to 630p - the place fills up at 5p and then you must wait for all the tables to start turning over. They will not seat a party of 4 at an open table for 6... you will only be seated at a 4 top - same for parties of 2.

I had to wipe all the surfaces with Clorox wipes, even the walls, because there were black fingerprints everywhere. Our socks were dirty within minutes of walking around on the carpet. I think the units could really use some maintanence. Also, I tried to vacuum one day, I have small messy eaters, and the vacuum started on fire!

We booked the hotel as a part of a Southwest Airlines package that included the hotel, airfare, theme park tickets and the regular dining plan. We arrived at the hotel in the late morning, long before the stated check-in time of 3:00 PM, so the room that we had pre checked-in for was not ready. However, we were given an upgrade from our studio to a one-bedoom unit which included a full kitchen, a washer/drywer, a whirlpool tub and a three section bathroom in addition to the separate bedroom and living room. Our unit was in the Congress Park section on the first floor (which we had requested) and we were right on the lake overlooking DTD. The room was clean but the furnishings were beginning to show some age. However, it appeared that some of the units in this portion of the hotel were in the process of being updated with new furniture, etc. The maid service was excellent, completely discreet and unnoticed but always finished by the time we returned to the hotel, whether in the late morning or later in the evening. We only ate one time at the counter service restaurant at the hotel, but the selection and the food were quite good. We always rent a car at WDW and we drive ourselves rather than using the disney transportation. We have found after numerous visits that the disney busses are fine during most of the day, but are a bit of a problem at the end of the day when everyone is leaving the theme parks at the same time. Therefore, we drive from what ever disney hotel we are staying at and park at one of the monorail hotels (if going to the MK), use valet parking, and get on the monorail to the park. At the end of the day when everyone is waiting for disney transport, we simply reverse our course, get our car from the valet, and are back to our hotel while others are still waiting for a bus. When we go to EPCOT, we use a similar process by parking at the Yacht/Beach Club or the Boardwalk, then walking to the International Gateway entrance, and then doing the reverse at the end of the day. While valet parking had formerly been free for anyone staying at a disney property, it now costs $12 per day. Even so, it is more convenient than standing in line for a long time or walking great distances after spending a day in the theme parks. Check-out was just as convenient as the check-in, with our folio being ready at request at the front desk. They also printed our boarding passes for our flight back to Chicago. In all, we found Saratoga Springs to be a good choice, with the only downside being the distance from the hotel to some of the theme parks. However, as WDW continues to grow and expand, distances from point A to point B will likely increase as well.

We had a studio apartment which is essentially a hotel room with a queen-sized bed and a sleeper sofa. The room also has a small kitchenette area with a refrigerator, sink, microwave, and coffeemaker. It's also equipped with plates, cups, and other utensils. The room had a balcony with two chairs and a table that looked out on the golf course, but I'd imagine your view is different depending on the location of your room. We had 3 adults in the room and I'd say that the room was about average size for a business hotel in the US (therefore, I think \"studio\" is a little misleading and makes the room seem like it will be bigger). The resort was very clean (as is everything on the Disney property). However, because we were using a friend's time share, we did not get housekeeping service during our stay. They clean rooms every 4 days so we did not get clean towels during our stay. One can pay extra to have the room cleaned more often. We did not. Generally, I appreciate the conservation efforts and believe that most people can keep a room clean on their own for 4 days. The resort is huge. We saw at least 3 pools on the property during our stay. We were near a pool with a hot tub, which are both apparently open 24 hours/day (which is very nice). Depending on where your room is, prepare to do a fair amount of walking to the bus stop and to the main building for food. Also, even though this resort is \"next to\" Downtown Disney, I would strongly recommend taking a bus from the resort to the Downtown Disney area (especially after a long day at the parks). Even the closest resort buildings are at least a 1/2 mile from Downtown Disney. Again, 1/2 a mile is not a bad walk on a nice day, but after we spent the last 9 hours walking around EPCOT, we were not happy we took the recommendation to walk there. The main/registration building has a moderately priced counter-service restaurant with various options for breakfast (including dairy-free for my husband). We were not there at lunch time during our stay, but dinner options were various sandwiches and pizzas. There was also a table-service restaurant on the property that we did not try. There was a bar in the main building (which was near a large pool with slide). There was also a gift shop and mini-mart in the main building with a pretty good selection of food and drink (alcohol & non) to stock your kitchenette. Be warned, though, that the vending area in each building only has beverages (although the front desk did not know this) and there's no room service. One of the great advantages of staying at the Disney resorts is the shuttle service to the parks. Absolutely love this service. We didn't wait very long for a bus to each park each day or on our return back to the resort. We found seats on the bus each time as well. We also appreciated the lines that they maintain to get onto the bus after returning to the resort. After a long day of orderly lines at the parks, we liked that they maintained the first-come-first-served procedure at the bus lines. Also great service checking in our bags at the resort and printing our boarding passes. Makes it very easy once you get to the Orlando airport (although the security lines are a disaster).", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cHome Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "Frances D", "ReviewID": "UR125704624", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 7 days with our 3 kids (all under 6) and my 10 year old brother. We stayed in a two bedroom suite (room 94--, in The Grandstand section H of the property). Upon check in I thought it was quite a ways to walk from the main lobby area, especially for our visually impaired 6 year old, but we were assured it was less than a 5 minute walk. We happily walked to our room and it was peaceful and quiet the whole way. The room was beautiful! It over looked the golf course. It was clean every day we returned to our room and we never saw the cleaning staff at all. It was like a group of fairies came and secretly cleaned our room each day. There was enough room for all of us and our luggage, plus a kitchen and washer and dryer. The pool area in our section of the property was fun. It's a regular pool with a smaller play area for the kids. It also had a snack bar that is open during the day. The main pool near the lobby is very nice. There is a slide, play area for the kids, and near the convenience store in the main lobby. Plus, they bring out a big screen to watch Disney movies on some nights. The lobby area is also quite convenient with a gift shop and food store and deli. One of the best parts about Saratoga Springs is it is just across the lake from Downtown Disney. We rode the boat across the lake several times and it was lovely every time. On a side note, if you have kids younger than 8 take a stroller for them everywhere! The walk is not far for adults but kids tire quickly. We took a single and a double stroller every where we went and we definately needed them. Restaurants also accomodate parking for them. Anyway, the boat arrives about every 10-15 minutes but the wait is nothing. Plus, the boat only serves Saratoga Springs. The buses to and from the park are a bit more time consuming. You should definately allow 35-45 minutes to get to your destination. I did not heed this warning and we were late to our dining reservations more than once because of it. Plus, we left our room quite early in the morning in early April and it was cold out at 7:30am; it is also a bit cold out late at night. Other than that, The Grandstand has the first bus pick up for Saratoga Springs then 2-3 more stops around the property before departing to any given destination. Oh, some stops at Saratoga Springs do not get picked up for every park or Downtown Disney. If you're unsure ask one of the drivers when they stop. The only complaint I have is that our oldest tripped on the way back to our room from the lobby one night. She is visually impaired and the sidewalks are not very well lit and they slope up and down in some places and they turn in wide and sharp angles. She skinned her knee very badly. It hurt a great deal for the rest of our trip. However, the hotel staff was very nice about the whole incident. They brought out the first aid kit, cleaned it really good, and put a bandage on it. Then, much to her surprise and happiness, they gave her a crown and a wand and declared her a Disney princess (Disney really knows how to treat their guests, especially kids). She was overjoyed.

The bus stops are far apart, especially if you have little kids. If you have a car with you and plan to drive to the various parks, then it doesn't matter much where in the resort you stay. But if you don't have a car, here's a piece of advice that can make big difference. When you make your reservation, whether on the phone or online, make sure you request the Springs area, as close to the Carriage House as possible. Here's why: you will be within easy walking distance of the front desk (which can help you with park tickets), the restaurants, the main pool, the arcade and the Bell Service desk which can get you a taxi if you need one. Also, the Springs bus stop is the last one in the loop, so you will be exiting the resort and getting to the various parks sooner (yes, you will be doing the reverse on the way home, but then hopefully the kids will be sleeping). I suggest you reinforce this request by calling and/or faxing the front desk between a week and 2 days prior to your arrival, and letting them know what you want again, as a friendly reminder. The people to mention in a fax are the room assigners. They will not give you a guarantee, but will try to respect your wishes.

Boy, was I misguided. Both my husband and I agreed that this resort was so much better than we had even remembered. Although I initially requested a room in The Springs, we arrived for check in a little early with a cranky toddler so we opted for a room in Congress Park, which is where we stayed last time, but this room was in a better location in that section. I was appreciative to have a quick check in and several options of rooms. We definitely made the right decision! We had a first floor room that was steps from our car (we like to drive to the parks) which was a huge convenience. Sure, our patio looked out at the bus stop, but that wasn't a problem if you ask me. I loved being much closer walking distance to the central area. It was a pleasant walk, actually. The room is spacious and well laid out. My son really loved the jetted tub. We also had plenty of room for his toddler sized air mattress next to our bed, which we brought with us. We loved the market at Artist's Palette, too, which is the only downside of Kidani Village (they don't have one). I also was so pleased that housekeeping, at our request, serviced our room before noon each day so that we could come back from mornings in the parks and settle in for rest time.

After we checked out of BW, we had to go to Saratoga to check in because we were using the meal plan and that has to be taken care of at each individual hotel. This is rather inconvenient - I would have rather checked-in at night as to not waste time transferring from hotel to hotel. Check-in at Saratoga was very long. They had me listed for the room, but not my husband, so they had to cancel the reservation completely and re-do it.

There was also a 'quiet' more adult friendly pool which we only managed to use once. The restaurant there was great, as was the quick service restaurant which didn't really have much choice but thankfully offered an alternative to the usual burgers and chips (fries!). There was a bus stop just outside our apartment which was never too busy and the buses were extremely frequent. The resort itself was lovely and quiet, just what we wanted, and was nothing like the Animal Kingdom Lodge which we also stayed in (please see other review). We had a one bedroom apartment which was huge! We could easily have moved in it was so lovely. We had a bedroom with a lovely king size bed, a jucuzzi room, a shower room with seperate toilet and a living room/kitchen which had all the kitchen utensils you could need. We also had free wi-fi which was being tested in certain resorts apparently which was a bonus after reading that the charge prior to this was something like $20 a day. We had two bg flat screen TV's with limited TV channels unfortunately.

We had a two bedroom villa which was perfect for our family of five (all adults). There's one king size bed for me and my husband and in the second bedroom two big double beds that can fit two adults comfortable. My son stayed in one bed while my two daughters share the other. It has its own laundry and dryer which was really helpful. The kitchenette was well-equipped with an oven, cooking stove,dishwasher, microwave oven, big refrigerator, pans, pots,cooking utensils. The dining table can sit 6, but there's also the kitchen countertop for some extra dining space. The unit was clean and has a lot of storage space. There's a small balcony with a nice view. It was nice to wake up in the morning and see all the trees from our balcony door. We actually wanted to extend our stay for another day just because we really loved staying here. The only downside is the service. I would rate it a 7. Reception was excellent and friendly but housekeeping was not too efficient. When they cleaned our room, all the dirty bedsheets,towels,etc were placed outside our front door uncollected until the night we arrived from the park. I called the housekeeping to ask them to remove the soiled items but it took forever for them to do that. I had visitors (a family visiting Disneyland but staying in another hotel outside Disney property) who were curious to see our villa. I had to bundle all the dirty laundry myself and hid them in one corner. Until they left, it was still there. Overall, it will not prevent us from choosing Saratoga again.

Upon arrival check in was very fast if the girl was a bit offish but that was ok, I was tired so maybe it was me. We got to our studio room easily and found it as expected, as you enter there is a microwave and tiny kitchenette thing on your left and sink, dressing area and bathroom on the left. In front is the main room with double bed and sofa bed with tv and table and 2 chairs last but not least a double patio door to a nice balcony with chairs and table. Not big but big enough for 2. It is very tired but not dirty and as well kept as possible for the price. There are 4 pools and if you go away from main one and most of the time the smaller pools are normally very quiet. In the centre of the resort is the 2 restraints one the artists pallete which is a snack option type with awful food but that is my personal feeling others really love it, it is like an expensive junk food place and the other the turf club which is more like a restrauant but very pricey but this is Disney so on balance it is ok, especially if you are on the dining plan. Overall the resort is fine and I would be happy here as most of the staff really do care but here is the reason I will NEVER return to Disney, after 4 days at disney my wife became unwell and has been unwell for 3 days now with what appears to be food poisoning, one the first day I went to the turf club and had a quick meal and came back to the room and the staff kindly gave me a chicken soup to take away for my wife which I thought was great, the next day she came with me to the turf club and tried to eat but could not so they offered to box the food so we could take it with us but we thanked them and did not take them up on the offer. Tonight I thought I would see if they could kindly just put my meal in a box for me and I can take it back to the room but wow!!! I asked the lady at the front and she kindly said they could not do that so I thought ok fair enough and thanked her and started to walk away then she said I have to have a table so I said sorry my wife is unwell and just wanted something takeaway then she a Disney member told me very rudely that it is not her problem and not going to make them break the rules but said in a nasty way! I almost replied well really we have only eaten at Disney for 7 days so maybe it should be their problem but I just calmly walked away not another word to be said. I have been staying at Disney for 30 years now and this is the last time ever for me but for all you looking for saratoga then I would still recommend it as 99% of the staff are great and I am sure you will love it but the Disney magic was stolen away from us in under 2 minutes. Overall we have loved Disney and thanks to that vile woman we now look forward to another destination every 2 years :) goodbye and thank for many happy times.

It's set up more like a very large apartment complex rather than a hotel, though. It would be great for those who enjoy taking walks, going on runs or bike riding while they are on vacation. I traveled with my 6 year old son and we were about a 10 minute walk away from the main building where the resturant/grocery store was. Normally that's no big deal, but when you've already put miles and miles of walking on your shoes at the theme parks, sometimes it's nice to just be able to stop in the lobby and grab something to eat on your way up to your room. When we arrived at the hotel and got checked in, there was someone there to load our suitcases onto a golf cart and give us a ride to our room. When we checked out, however, that wasn't the case. In all fairness, we checked out around 11:00am, when everyone is checking out, but I tried several times and wasn't able to reach anyone at the bell desk to help us with our luggage. Therefore, I had to lug our bags all the way up to the main building by myself, (I was lucky to get my son to take his own carry-on bag). This took much longer than the normal 10 minute walk! The rooms themselves are okay. Honestly, I expected something nicer for a 5 star resort. They were somewhat outdated, but had everything we needed like a microwave, sink, mini-fridge as well as glasses and utinsels.

The Treehouse villas can accommodate up to nine people. There are 3 bedrooms ( 2 Queen and 1 bunk bed) each with its own flat screen TV/DVD and 2 full bathrooms and in suite laundry. In the living area are a double pull out sofa bed and a single pull out chair bed. A complete kitchen with full sized appliances comes stocked with pots, pans, utensils and dishware. Part of the 65 acre Saratoga Springs Resort, it is located far from the theme parks but we knew this in advanced and planned our schedule around this fact. Even within the Saratoga Springs resort, the Treehouse villas feel a bit removed from the main Carriage House where the reception, restaurant and swimming pool are located. We had very little interaction with castmembers because we really had no need. We rented through a DVC member so daily maid service was not included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only a trash and tidy on day four. The villas were clean and comfortable but a little dark. It helped by opening up the curtains but it could have used better lighting. Although there are many windows to take in the view, none of them open to get fresh air. There are no locks on the doors to each bedroom, nor are there locks on the bathroom doors so be prepared for the lack of privacy. There is an in suite safe provided to keep your valuables. There is also patio seating on an outside deck as well as a charcoal barbeque. There is a small pool in the Treehouse area but we did not use it considering we had record low temperatures while were there. The no charge WiFi is dependable and fast. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read a few complaints about how long and complicated it is to get to the theme parks using Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transportation and I had some doubts about it before arriving. But after a day we figured out what worked best for us and planned enough time to get to the parks. We requested a room in the south part of the Treehouse Villas. Visit this link for maps and more info/pictures. http://allears.net/acc/faq_treehouse.htm We stayed in villa 7058 which provided direct (less than a minute walk) easy access to the boat launch to Downtown Disney where you could connect with buses to the theme parks. It also provided direct (less than a minute walk) easy access to the internal south bus stop. Saratoga Springs Resort is so large and spread out that an internal bus takes you to each of the villas where you can connect to a WDW bus which in turn takes you to the theme parks. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus and often we were running to catch it before it left. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a helpful tip. Both the internal bus and the theme park bus travel in one direction. Returning from a theme park the bus travels from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Grandstand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Carousel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Paddock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCongress Park\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Springs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. What we found to be the most efficient was whenever we were headed to the theme parks we caught the internal bus that took us directly to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Springs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and transferred to a theme park bus. This minimized walking and avoided meandering through the other Saratoga Springs stops. Whenever returning from a theme park we got off at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Grandstand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This was the first returning stop and then took an easy 5 minute walk across the parking lot and through the golf course between the 17th and 18th hole right to our villa. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a quiet wilderness experience and have a family of 7, then this might fit your bill.

It is a Disney resort, but it is not too Disney. It is a posh resort, but not too posh. Think of this resort as an elaborate template to a perfect Disney holiday. You can dine where you want, visit where you want and play where you want both within the resort and outside the resort you are given ultimate flexibility as part of staying in a Disney Resort. And I would divide this flexibility into four parts. The room, the dining, the facilities and the transport. Firstly, the room. We booked a 1 bedroom villa, which is a studio apartment with an extra bedroom and an upgraded bathroom and washing facilities. This size room is perfect for a family of 4 with enough space to spend as a family, but enough space to give the adults some space too. Both beds were comfortable and we always kept the sofa bed in its bed form as you could still use it as a sofa as well. Whilst we didn't spend as much in the room as we could have, we appreciated the Jacuzzi bath to come back to after a long day in the parks, and the kitchen was as good as my kitchen at home! It was well equipped with everything you could possibly need and everything was as new. The groceries at the resort are overpriced so we visited Wal Mart once (about 15 mins drive) and at the start of our holiday we had a grocery delivery from Garden Grocer which the porter brought to our room. The staff were another thing that made this resort brilliant, with helpful and attentive waiters and bar staff, and also friendly security staff! Darlene was the nicest gate person ever - and she was great with our children. This theme continues throughout the whole of Walt Disney World. Now the dining. I would highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan and we would not travel back without it. It allows you to eat in and out of your Disney Resort Hotel as you please (but you should definitely make reservations online 180 days before your visit for all table service restaurants). Specifically at this resort, there are two poolside bars, one at The Paddock which serves a full food menu and one at The Springs which serves light snacks. These are complimented by the quick service Artists Palette which also serves a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu counter service style, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Outside of the resort Downtown Disney is just a short boat or bus ride away and is walkable, and provides access to even more restaurants and dining opportunities. The facilities - both of the feature pools at the resort are outstanding! The new feature pool at The Paddock is great and the slide gave hours of fun to our family. Ask for a room in The Springs area to be within walking distance of Reception, The Spa, The Lake Buena Vista Golf Course, both feature pools, and all of the dining locations. The second most convenient area is The Paddock. All facilities were well kept and the resort was impeccably landscaped. The transport - The nearest hire car destination is a 15 minute walk from the Hotel Reception or ask for a taxi (about 7 dollars). This is at the Buena Vista Palace Hotel. Alternatively rent ac car at the airport. A free bus service from the hotel to Orlando International is available and it is called Disney's Magical Express. Once at the hotel you can use your car to get around and note that there are two exits to the resort, so check your map to see which is best for where you are travelling to. The free buses to the parks were frequent, but if you are using them get up early and plan to take your bus at least 1 hour before the park opens to get you a seat and to the parks in time for opening.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Normal, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience with small children\u201d", "Author": "D Y", "ReviewID": "UR122146459", "Content": "It was 4 adults and two small children (4 & 6).

The check-in staff were very friendly, especially the one who checked us in. She was an intern from South Korea. I noticed she was and being Korean-American who can speak some Korean, I started to speak Korean to her. She was so overjoyed and then was very friendly and pleasant and explained everything to me right away. Kids Swimming Pool. There is a pool at the Paddock which is perfect for kids. It doesn't get deeper than 3 feet and there are slides and a gradual inclined beach-type side of the pool. There are three slides - small, medium, and large. They also have great pool-side games like bingo while we were there. And it was heated during the December months. Location. The Saratoga Springs resort is a 15-minute walk to Downtown Disney, or a brief ferry boat ride away. NEGATIVES: Size of the resort. This resort is so huge and wide that everything is spread out. That meant we had to walk a lot or even drive our car to get to the other side of the resort. To get to a pool, we had to drive or prepare to walk a lot. This we didn't like very much. Late Check-in. We were supposed to be able to check-in at 3 pm. When we got there at 2:30, they said no rooms were available until 4 pm. They said as soon as a room was ready, they would text us the room #. At 4:10, still no text message. So I called the front desk and they said there had been a room ready for quite some time and they didn't know what really happened. They made us wait while we didn't really have to wait. Somewhere, the communications lines broke down. No extra sheets or blankets in the room. Since they gave us a queen bed with sofa bed, you would expect there to be extra sheets, blankets, and pillows for the sofa bed, but there was none. When we called for some, it took them almost an hour to come and bring them to us.

We found the bus service to be very good, overall. We always choose a 2 bedroom villa as we like to have our own bedroom apart from the kids and we use the kitchen for quick breakfasts before the parks as well as snacks. CONS: The major con was that many of the rooms are musty and mildewy. The first room we were given smelled so bad we asked to be moved immediately. The second room was only marginally better. We were offered a \"deep cleaning\" which included filter changes. This only helped for day or so and the musty smell returned. I asked several times for a dehumidifier. I was told they were going to purchase one for our room but that never happened. I really did not want to move rooms again so we just dealt with it, though it likely would prevent me from staying here again.

The outside of the buildings are attractive but don't seem any different from Old Key West or the Beach Club as opposed to the Wilderness Lodge or Kidani Village.

To make a very long story short, the front desk cast member was not sure how to run a gift card and ended up taking too much money off of the card. The front desk managers got involved and after an hour of standing at the desk, they sent us on to the park and said they would call on our cell phone when they got it figured out. We never received a call from either of the two managers. When we arrived back at Saratoga Springs to get on the Magical Express, we checked with the front desk to see if there was a message for us regarding our credit.

We opted for the paddocks and were given a second floor room overlooking the lake in the next block to the pool and the bus stop. We were amazed by the size of the rooms. Two large bedrooms both en-suite. The master bedroom had a large Jacuzzi bath, a shower room and a toilet. Washing machine, dishwasher & full kitchen in living room. Three large tvs & dvd. The safe was on the small size..only really big enough for passports, tickets etc...no way would you get anything like a laptop in it. We had free wifi in the room which was a surprise. The resort was lovely, we used the buses all week and never waited more than 10mins for a bus and they were not crowded..we got a seat every time. We used the boat service across to Downtown Disney but walking was just as quick. We only used the pool at the paddocks but saw the others and they looked amazing too. At the paddocks pool they did entertainment for the kids and gave away little prizes. Their was a lovely fountain play area for the little ones. Housekeeping was done daily and they left supplies of washing powder, dishwasher powder and shampoo and shower gel on a daily basis. They did a good job at keeping both the resort and the rooms very clean and tidy. We used the counter service restaurant several times (artist palette) wasnt overly impressed here.

It is a lovely resort, but like others have said, it is very big and took us a couple of days to work out where everything was and which was the quickest route to get to it. We had a studio in the Paddock area, near the Congress Park bus stop. It was just over a 5 minute walk to the Paddock Swimming pool which was excellent. The main pool itself had a big slide for older children and adults which led into the big pool which was initially quite cold, although there was also a lovely warm hot tub next to it. There was also an excellent shallow childrens pool with slides right next to it, which our young children loved and would happily have spent all day there. There is also a laundry next to the pool, which was quite handy. The main pool up near \"The Springs\" bus stop and the restaurants also looked good, but more for slightly older children. Mousekeeping was excellent and we often returned to find our childrens teddies in various poses on their bed, which often brought a smile to their faces. The only thing I would mention was that when we arrived in our room after a 9 hr flight, there was only one bed made, when they already knew we were a family of 4. I phoned reception and they told me to pull out the sofa bed and get sheets, blanket & pillows from the wardrobe and make it up myself, which I don't think is good enough and not the standard which I would expect from Disney. Also when I booked I was told it would be 2 proper full size beds, but it was just one and a sofa bed. (Whereas my friend who booked a studio in Key West was given a room with 2 proper beds). The good thing about the location of our hotel was that it was within walking distance to downtown, which was far quicker than waiting for a bus or boat (although the boat was nice to take too).The walk just took around 15 mins from our room. We had the Disney Dining Plan, which I would definately recommend. It enabled us to dine in some excellent locations such as Chef Mickey, Ohanas, Cinderella's Table, Akershus & Narcosses, all which I highly recommend. Also for the quick dining, we found Wolfgang Pucks Express over at Downtown the best place for choice, away from your usual hotdogs and chicken nuggets. They did lovely wood-fired Pizza's along with freshly made salads and various pastas etc. While staying here we also ate at the hotel's \"Artists Palate\" and the \"Turf Club\", both of which were good. There is also a small shop selling essentials like bread, milk, cereals etc. which was handy if you wanted to make breakfast in your room before heading to the parks. The only thing which I would say which let the hotel down, was the bus service. On a couple of occassions we were left stranded for ages. One day we walked to the bus stop @ Typhoon Lagoon around 4pm, 5pm we were still waiting for a bus as none had come along. Then a guy who worked at T.Lagoon said our best bet would be to get a bus to downtown, which had just pulled in and then get another one from there to our hotel, as after 5pm the park closes and they stop sending buses shortly after. Well we got the bus to downtown and waited a further hour there without anything arriving for Saratogo, whilst watching around 4 buses appear for pretty much each and every other resort in that time. We gave up and walked through downtown over to our hotel. This night we ended up missing our dinner reservation in Epcot due to the time wasted waiting for buses. The irony of it all was that if there was a pedestrian crossing next to Typhoon Lagoon, we could have walked from there to our hotel within half an hour. We had stayed at the All Stars a few years ago and had never experienced a problem with the buses. Which is why I was happy to stay on Disney property again,as this would save us hiring a car, as we were unsure of the roads and driving abroad. However after this experience, when we return to Florida again, we will definatley be hiring a car! All in all I would highly recommend this hotel, but just hire a car unless you are happy waiting around for ages on transport.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "2JenxNParadise", "ReviewID": "UR120578224", "Content": "Okay so I visited this place as a guest of my brother who \"owns\" time there.

The shower in the master bathroom was huge, but needed more spaces to keep your soap and etc. The villa included a full kitchen, and an apartment sized washer and dryer and A small eating area, family room and a balcony. It even has a entry way kinda of \"vestibule\" area that makes it feel like you are entering an apartment. When you enter the facility, it feels like you are entering an apartment complex. Of course, who can talk badly about Disney's customer service right? It was exceptional! Okay - so more about this place, it is wonderful. Spacious, clean, and extremely quiet. In various places of the villa are extra ammenities just in case you forget, including a port a crib and a high chair. Extra laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, you know that kind of stuff. I didn't hear anyone ever while there, and we were there in the Summer - in a place brimming over with children! The check in process was quick and easy. Disney always does this very well. The pool we went to was large enough to not feel crowded and was the perfect temperature. There are multiple pools. They have movies you can watch from the pool or poolside at night. This places basically has everything you need. The only problem we had with the Disney buses was waiting for a bus to the magic kingdom. Sometimes it took up to 15 minutes....this is strange for Disney. They ahve shuttle buses that take you anywhere.

The hotel is immense. Almost too big. It took approx 45 minutes to return at night from the parks even without waiting more than 10 minutes for a bus to arrive. We were the 5th and last stop in the resort coming home. This seemed to be the only negative I could find with the hotel and I don't look for things to complain about. The hotel was clean and in really good condition. It reminded me a lot of Vero Beach in color scheme and decorative touches. The pool area had a nice slide for the kids to enjoy and it was easy to find a lounge chair near the pool. They had 3 lifeguards on duty which I appreciated. Our 1 Bedroom unit was fine for 3 people but I would imagine it would have been a lot more crowded if my husband would have joined us on this trip. The kids slept on the pull-out couch which was very comfortable for them. I had to keep their suitcase in my bedroom because there was no place to put it in the living room. The bedroom had a small dresser with 4 small drawers in total for the whole unit, definitely not enough storage! The bathroom had the typical Disney hot tub with the weird shutters opening into the bedroom. Not sure what family is using this hot tub! The hot tub in Kidani Village is private and in a bathroom with a door that closed and locked. I ordered groceries in advance and it was already in our room upon arrival.

We arrived early for check in (around noon) and our room was ready, we were in the Carousel building, right off the main entrance, but very far from the main building and pools. The room was spotless upon arrival, everything was in perfect working order, the view from the balcony was pleasant, overlooking a canal, some trees and the Cirque du Soleil building in the distance. You could hear bus noise from the road behind our building IF the balcony door was open. (when the door was closed the room was completely quiet. (In fact, as a person that prefers white noise to fall asleep, it was bordering on too quiet in the bedrooms. I was alone in this opinion.) Beds were comfortable, even though I prefer fitted sheets on the beds, the pack and play crib was very convenient to have in the room and the pullout sofa was deemed more comfortable than your standard \"2in mattress on an iron bar\" that everyone's in-laws has in their den. A/C was very quiet and the ceiling fans were a nice touch. The bathroom light had a motion sensor and would dimly come on when you stumbled in in the middle of the night, which was nice. We found the resort nice, the grounds beautiful, fairly kid friendly, the room definitely had plenty of space for the 6 of us; the kitchen was super convenient, and we felt it was a much better value over all than our usual plan of getting 2 rooms at a deluxe. The bus service to the parks, which is much maligned in many reviews, was fine for us, we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus at any time. (but this can vary wildly from trip to trip) Couple of negatives, housekeeping, we booked this through Disney reservations and are not DVC members, so we had housekeeping every day. The second day, housekeeping did not arrive until almost 4pm, by this time we were in the room with a napping toddler, so we just had towels dropped off. We should have probably called for early cleaning, but the next day it was done before we headed back to the hotel, so it may have been a fluke. Lastly, it wasn't too big of an inconvenience for us because we used our kitchen and had a car, but the carousel building we were in was extremely far from the main building of the hotel. It was kind of a hassle to have to get in the car every time we needed something from the store. Cannot say anything about the onsite dining, as we didn't use it.

(that woke us up 3 mornings). The rooms were very clean, well equipped and well maintained, no need to bring any extra cutlery, crockery, dish wash cloths, dish washer powder, washing powder, kitchen paper etc as all provided and replaced when used. It even had 3 lidded sandwich boxes. The beds were too firm for us but we are used to memory foam, we bought a cheap topper from wal-mart for $35 and left it behind. The sofa was very comfortable as a sofa but not as a bed, like me, my 18 year old who slept on it is used to nice soft memory foam bed, and found the sofa bed had a hard ridge across her shoulders, I tried it and would not have been able to sleep on it. My 11 year old found it comfortable. Although the site is huge the walk from The Grandstand to main pool and Artist Palette is reasonably short. We used the main Springs pool and the new Paddock pool both very nice, comfortable sun beds, plenty of them but spoilt by annoying loud music and cast members on loud speakers desperately trying to get guests who were trying to have a quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of the parks to join in with bingo and quiz's. (Why do they always do that!) The Artists Palette is ok for a snack but we found the menu very limited, much better at Port Orleans where we have stayed previously. The Turf Club restaurant is wonderful! The best meal in Disneyworld, this visit and on a previous visits, we have stayed in Disney World a total of 64 nights over 5 years, all on Disney Dining Plan, so we have eaten almost everywhere, The Turf Club is consistently the best for food quality, service and atmosphere.

Had a new employee try to check me in, and while he was very friendly, the process took more than 20 minutes. I felt there should have been a more seasoned employee there to help him. I arrived around 11am and wasn't surprised that my room wasn't ready - but it took 6 hours and about 5 phone calls before the room finally WAS ready. Hard to believe that not a single room opened up in that time frame that they could have gotten me and my family in. ESPECIALLY since this is one of the Disney resorts with a MANDATORY check out time of 11am - no late check outs. Room was very average. This is a Disney resort that is seriously in need of an update/makeover. Carpet is old and worn, our unit smelled like cigarette smoke. We stayed a total of 5 days and only received towel and linen service one time. If you want extra towels, shampoo, etc, you are charged for it. Personally, I feel like for the amount that you are charged to stay and visit Disney, these are minimal ammenities that should be included with any stay. Be aware that this property is VERY spread out - from most of the villas, it is quite a walk to get to the main carriage house or the activity center/gym/pool. I will say that once you get there, the main pool is great - the kids loved it (ages 6 and 9), and the workout center is awesome too. It's huge and pretty stat-of-art. We did use the activity center once when there was a threat of rain - it is also very nice - we played the Wii and ping-pong. Staff here was very friendly.

The room was clean and view of one of the side waterways, but it didn't feel that cool, initially we just thought it hadn't been used for a while and the A/C would kick in, we got on with our vacation, however a day so in it was realised the a/c wasn't working fully it was getting hotter outside and the room was getting hotter too! We rang maintenance, they sent someone out in an hour, but he couldn't fix it and we would need the A/c guy who was at lunch but he would be out soon, so we went out and when we got back, it clearly hadnt been fixed we called again, and got you are next of the list, by the morning I couldn't stand it anymore and went to the front desk, luckily the manager was there so we spoke ton him he called maintenance, heard the tell him we were first in the list, we went out for the day and got back, and yep no cool room, by now I was now angry we had been 5 days in a room in Florida with no A/C... So marched back to reception, this time we were caught by Karen, not sure of her role but she was there to greet and help guests, she initially asked if I was having a magical day, think my reply of a firm no surprised her, I told her the problem all we wanted was A/c.. She asked if anyone had offered a change of room... No I replied.. So now she sets out the change our room and also offered a credit onto the account of $150 for all the inconvenience... She gave us a room with a fabulous view of DTD, large balcony on the 4th floor, and we could see the pool, it was great but more importantly had A/C! Then she realised it was my hubby's birthday on the day of arrival, so she ended up crediting $400 on the account, she was fantastic and the remainder of the vacation was great and our spending money was covered too. The resort itself it fantastic well maintained, the pool was great, clean and plenty of beds to laze about on, yes its a resort is big but we like that as you have enough space and it's not too crowded, We loved the walks around the resort, and also into DTD, you have more choices on getting around from this resort, you can walk into DTD and get a bus to anywhere you want to go. We picked up our hire car the day after arrival from the dolphin, this was effortless and so much more relaxing then picking it up at the airport, we would do this again, though we dropped the car off at the airport rather than use the Magical Express, they pick you up far too early. We would stay here again, despite the small hiccup when we arrived and they more than compensated us for that, it didn't put us off staying here.

I personally didn't care for the mattress on the bed or the pillows - too soft. I woke up every morning with a backache. I wish hotels would realize that some people prefer firm mattresses & pillows. Unfortunately, our first impression of the room was not good, since the previous guests must have left wet, dirty towels laying on the carpet & there was a very bad smell in the room. We left for a bit & when we returned, it seemed that someone had sprayed some deodorizing spray & the smell of that was almost worse than before. We called the desk to complain & they did move us to another room.

As one of the moderate resorts, this is a nice hotel, but not super deluxe if you are looking for that. We have the Disney vacation club and this is our home resort so we stay here quite often. This time we were in a studio room which was one double bed and sleeper sofa in The Paddock area of the resort. For the two of us, it was really nice. I would think this type of room with 4 adults would be tight, but 2 adults and 2 smaller kids would be ok. My favorite part of the rooms is that the bathroom sink is in an open area and separate from the shower and toilet. Nice for doing my hair and makeup while my husband is in the shower. We like the location in that it is close to the Downtown Disney area, and depending on what building you stay in, you can easily walk over. The resort is very large and spread out, but you can usually get where you need to without too much trouble. For the amount of rooms (and people) here, I think the only thing that needs improvement is the amount of dining options available. It'd be nice to have at least two sit-down dining establishments at the resort. We were also in need of a computer at one point during the trip and there were none for use at the resort. Luckily the concierge was nice enough to assist us (they went way out of their way) but it would have been much easier if we could have dealt with it ourselves. There is wireless in the rooms if you do bring your own laptop though. My suggestion would be to ask for a room in the Congress Park area of the resort so you can walk to Downtown Disney but are still close to the main pool and eating area. If you aren't interested in Downtown, then it really doesn't matter where you stay. Although it is nice to be able to walk over there if you need bus service to another hotel instead of having to hop to a park first, this option is quicker.

The balcony was small and the door leading out to it didn't have a bolt lock so there was a little concern about safety since our kids are young and very curious.

However this hotel was aweful compared to any other place we have stayed in Disney and frankly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. From check in with stressed and less than friendly front desk staff to arriving in our room to find the kids beds not made. We called the housekeeping who told us that \"there are sheets in the closet and we should make the bed ourselves!\", no kidding. So my wife didn't complain and grabbed the sheets to make the bed only to find there were dried \"BUGS\" in the sheets. We called again to get fresh sheets and they did come make the bed. The next morning we woke up to realize we had no toilet paper. I did go to the front desk and when I said i was not happy with the way we were treated and unhappy with the hotel itself the manager handed me the house phone and told me I could call disney guest services to inquire about staying somewhere else, he didn't even ask why i wasn't happy or if there was anything he could do. The room was worn and not very clean. They didn't even clean it the day before check out so we had no clean towels. It was just horrendous. I have never written a comment here before and am not that picky but this was just over the top bad and it was obvious that this was the norm.

Hopefully this review is a fair assessment of this resort versus the many others that are available to choose from. This was my first stay at Saratoga Springs, and it was in a 2-bedroom villa with my parents, sister and brother-in-law, and boyfriend. Overall the villa felt more than roomy enough for the 6 of us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bedroom that my boyfriend and I shared with my sister and brother-in-law had 2 queen beds that were pretty comfortable, and there was enough drawer and closet space for all of us. We also had our own connected bathroom with shower to share, and a sink area with 2 sinks. We did have some issues with our toilet, as we found it was leaking during our stay. Maintenance came by to check it out, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was ever really fixed. However, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it impossible to use the bathroom so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big of a deal. My parents had a room that connected to a bathroom with a large standing shower and bathtub, as well as 2 sinks. The toilet was in its own room so that it could be accessed from the main living area, and had a sink as well I think. There was laundry as well, which was really nice to have. The kitchenette and living area were both a very good size, including a dining area that easily sat 4-6 people, and we had a nice balcony looking out over the property. Keep in mind when you stay in a Vacation Club villa that you only get maid service once every (I think) 4 days, not every day. As for the resort, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that I saw very much of it. It was December, and unseasonably cold at that (it was in the 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at night!), so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit the pool. However, from where we were (in the back of the resort), there was a lot of construction going on as they added a second pool to the property, which would have been closer to us than the pool near the Clubhouse. We were VERY far away from the Clubhouse, and on top of that, our bus stop was closed for the pool construction, so if we took the bus, we had to walk quite a way to get to the next closest stop. We are able-bodied and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blazing hot or anything, so it was fine for us, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big enough resort that it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have really been necessary either. I imagine they could have found a way to safely load passengers somewhere closer to us. I imagine with the inconvenience of pool construction being done, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably better now. I never really visited the lobby either, as my parents checked in for us before the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kids\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arrived on a separate flight, and it was too far to walk when we had free time. My sister has Celiac disease, so most of our eating was done elsewhere within Disney World; I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Saratoga Springs was able to accommodate her sensitive diet other than with salads, so it was our preference to eat elsewhere instead. This resort also has a spa on-site which I have heard good things about, but have not visited myself. As for the overall location of the resort, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty good. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the Downtown Disney area, where there is a lot of shopping and eating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably walkable to Downtown Disney from the front of the resort, but we always drove or took the bus. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a golfer, this is probably one of the best places you can stay, since your proximity to the golf courses is great (it basically sits almost on top of one of the courses). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not super-close to any of the theme parks, but they are all a reasonable driving distance from the resort. I wish I could offer more information about this resort, but it was a short trip for me and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend as much time exploring and enjoying the resort as I normally would have. The resort is themed on Saratoga, NY with a horse-racing theme throughout, and is done in a very classy way without being too over-the-top. Overall, the grounds are lovely and the rooms are spacious and clean (the resort is also on the newer side compared to other Disney resorts). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d choose it again because I prefer to be a little less secluded than I felt here when I visit Disney World, but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a great hotel worthy of 4 stars for what you get. I took a star away because the resort is so big and sprawling that you feel disconnected from the main hub of the Clubhouse if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying close to it.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cDisney does it again!\u201d", "Author": "valeriedquick", "ReviewID": "UR118678526", "Content": "If you ever have the chance to stay at any of the resorts on the Disney property I would say try your best, from the Welcome Home! to the everyday service you get it just makes your stay worth the extra you pay.

It lives up to Disney's quality. The rooms are villas - they have studios, 1BR, 2BR, and 3BR grand villas.

Counter surfaces are granite and the couch pulls open to bed if needed. The grounds' upkeep is stupendous. It's an absolutely beautiful resort. Going on morning runs around the spring/lake, it's probably the most serene of all the WDW resort paths. The buildings are subdued, pastel shades, the grass is always green and manicured, the water is always clean with fountains everywhere, and trash on the ground is never seen. The resort is spread out, and the rooms all have their entrances on the outside, unlike a traditional hotel building. Some like that, some don't. If you have a car, it allows you to park closer to your room. You can walk, take a bus, or board a water shuttle to Downtown Disney and West side - a mecca of restauarants, shops, and entertainment. You can't walk to any of the theme parks from this resort, so if that's important, other on-property resorts might be a better choice. But being located somewhat in the middle of all of WDW, it's not truly far from anywhere. We golfed at the Lake Buena Vista course on this trip; the clubhouse is located right there, thus no traveling. Disney is great with their golf, offering complimentary cab rides, club transportation, club storage, etc. The on-property food options are very good. The Turf Club has always been excellent on our visits - lunch, dinner, and drinks, Artist's Palette is good for quick food (and not all standard fare), and the pool bars sometimes offer a few snacks in addition to drinks.

Of course the next day we discovered the ELEVATOR, which would have been helpful information had wwe actually reallu needed it. I will say, the Manager on duty that night did everything she could to make it up to us, including buying us dinner after our 90 mintute check in experience, and the room was typical of a DIsney Deluxe Villa, clean, comfortable and well equipped, but the location was an ordeal the entire stay.

You feel remote - almost as if you're camping - but you're only a short bus ride away from the center of the resort and all its attendant amenities. The villas themselves are single-story structures that are accessed by a wooden stairs; this is not a great location for those who have certain mobility issues. The units are roughly circular, with cathedral ceilings, an open kitchen/dining room/living room area, three bedrooms (one with bunk beds) and two baths. Everything is executed well, and the rustic outdoor theme prevails throughout. My kids loved how spacious and secluded the treehouses felt. There are some downsides. The pool is very small, but nice, and there is no direct-to-parks bus service from the villas - you first need to get to the main Saratoga Springs resort by bus or boat. The boat also stops at Downtown Disney, which is convenient. In sum, the villas themselves are great, and its relative isolation is both a benefit and a downfall - it seems like you're tucked away in the woods, but if you want a quick bite to eat at a restaurant, or a trip to one of the parks, you're in for a bit of a hike and some delay.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisney Treehouses are Great!!\u201d", "Author": "Wareheim", "ReviewID": "UR118005723", "Content": "This was the second year in a row we have stayed at the Disney Treehouses and we already have our reservations for next June.

We only visited the parks on one day so spent a considerable amount of time at the resort and using its amenities. I thought the resort was located in a great spot...right across from Downtown Disney. Our room had a fabulous view of Downtown Disney (right across from the hot air balloon). One evening we simply took a walk over to downtown and then got on a ferry to take us to Wolfgang Puck for dinner. There was so much entertainment for us as a family and to please all ages. You can be amazed by magic tricks at Magic Masters or fascinated by the \"live\" statues a little further down. You can try your hand at making race cars at the lego store or you can be amazed by juggling acts near Ghirardelli. There are outdoor musicians in the bandstand areas and other acts elsewhere. The shopping is fun, the food choices are plentiful and diverse, and the outdoor entertainment is free! You can also go to the movies, see Cirque de Soleil or try the indoor amusement center. The Saratoga Springs resort itself boasts a lovely pool, a circular slide, a zero entry pool on one side and a kiddie play area on the other. Their fitness center was large with a good amount of machines and fitness equipment. I went every day trying to stay in shape. The theme of the hotel evokes Saratoga Springs around the turn of the century. I happen to like this theme but thought that Disney did a better job of theming at the other resorts. The resort is one of Disney's largest with lovely grounds and \"springs\", but oddly the hotel lobby seemed small and not as well designed compared to other numerous resorts. The Artist's Palette convenience store off the lobby is nicely done and the kids can draw on tabletop easels. They had fun with that (even the older ones). I was a little disappointed with the room as well. The pull-out couch was busted, the drawer in the armoire was banged shut and the sliding door was impossible to open. I called maintenance to repair these things right away but I was annoyed anyway. The room doors open into an open air hallway. I wasn't crazy about that nor was I pleased with the garbage in the hallway, as well. The room was missing some of the shampoos and amenities when we arrived and I had to call for that as well. When I called the manager he was very responsive. Saratoga Springs is also a preview center for the Disney Vacation Club. Even though we are already members we enjoyed a complimentary luncheon afterward and a meet and greet session with Mickey and Goofy.

Lots of activities for the kids poolside. They have a movie every night on a big screen by the pool...that was pretty cool.

The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom on the side with the two queen beds was basic whereas the bathroom on the king-sized bed side was more luxurious. There was only one very small wall-safe with one key to share, so if you are two families it can be tricky. The kitchenette was small but adequate. There were three LG flat-screen tvs in the villa. We stayed in the \"Springs\" section which was close to the pool and restaurant, but frustrating because it was the last stop on the shuttle route. So the 5-minute drive to Downtown Disney took 20-25 minutes. The shuttles were a disappointment. Yes they run every 20 minutes (sometimes every 30 minutes) but they never arrive at the same time. What I mean is one morning, for example the Magic Kingdom shuttle will arrive at 10 and the next it will come at 10:10. It is totally luck of the draw whether you get a shuttle right away or have to wait 20 minutes. Also leaving the parks they don't add extra buses at closing, so they were always packed and you had to wait 20 minutes for the next one. The shuttle service could definitely be improved. My biggest complaint is with the staff. They are polite and all smiles, but they tell you nothing. They hand you your key and say 'have a nice trip'. We were joking at the vacation club slogan, \"Disney's best kept secret\"...well everything is a secret at this resort. They don't tell you that there are free lockers in the spa but you have to pay for the lockers by the pool. They don't tell you anything about the difference in the quality of the quick service restaurants. They don't tell you that there is no difference between your kid's meals and adult meals on your quick-service card (which means you can buy any adult meal using your child's points). They don't tell you that they will charge you 17$ for a 30 second long distance call from your room. I have been at resorts where they invite on a tour of the resort and explain everything, nothing like that here. Back to the restaurants for a second. If you are on quick-service you can get some small corn-dog bites, fries and a drink at Casey's in Magic Kingdom, or you can get bacon-wrapped meat-loaf with fried onions and a port-wine reduction at Wolf-Gang Puck in Downtown Disney. There is nothing wrong with Casey's, actually their hot-dogs are fantastic. However the range in quality of the quick-service restaurants was quite stunning. For example, for the four of us to eat at Casey's it would have cost 40$ whereas it would have cost 92$ at Wolf-Gang Puck, but both cost us only 4 points. Something to consider. Disney is awesome and the Saratoga Springs Resort is a nice hotel with nice pools. Being close to Downtown Disney (we walked many times after our shuttle disappointments; we also took the boats a couple of times) was nice, but it also meant we were a good 20 minutes from the parks.

We arrived rather tired but very excited. After picking up our hire car we set off to our resort arriving at around 5.00pm (US time) The check in system was very quick and easy and we headed up to our villa in the \"Springs\". The Resort's villas are split up into different areas: The Grandstand The Springs The Paddocks The Carousel Congress Park All of which have their positive and negatives. We chose the \"Springs\" as my mom has walking difficulties and this area is closest to the resort amenities. We had booked a 2 bedroom dedicated villa for 2 adults and 2 teens. This meant we had 1 king size bed and 2 queens as well as a fold out sofa bed. It also came complete with a kitchen and all of its utensils, crockery, cookware, dishwasher, oven, microwave etc. There was also a washer/dryer & flat screen t.v's in each room etc Full listings are available on the link below: http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/saratoga-springs-resort-and-spa/services-amenities/ We had requested a water view when booking which we did not receive in our first villa. Marching straight back down to reception the Disney staff worked their magic and produced another 3 rooms in the Springs area which we then investigated ourselves then took our choice back to reception. My family and I were heading out to see \"Harry Potter Land\" early the next morning so we had arranged for bell hop to collect our baggage at 5.00 AM. They arrived spot on time and took our bags away. On return from our trip to Universal Studios we went straight up to our new villa. All seemed perfect with our lovely new view until my mom and my boyfriend felt the floor vibrating wildly. We hopped back down to reception after two night's of my mom and boyfriend trying to convince my dad and I, that the floor was really moving! Finally we were allocated our last room which did not have the wonderful view like the villa before but did have a floor that did not vibrate! We had a brilliant stay over villa 4727 for the remaining 11 nights we had. The Artists Palette served basic food e.g nuggets, sandwiches, salads etc. We ate breakfast in our room and shopped at Walmart for our extra food. The shop at SSR also sells bread milk etc but obviously your paying that extra bit more. We were fortunate to have been on the DDP which ensured we were all full at the end of each day and cut budgeting for meals each day. We did book \"The Turf Club\" for a night, but after supposedly missing our name being called after we had sat in front of the restaurant for 1 hour, we did not get our meal and settled for nuggets and CHIPS ( I hasten to add these are crisps) before an early night in bed. The pool movies begin at 9 pm each night at the main pool just across from the Springs. Unfortunately due to bad weather our planned movie was called off. My mom and I also had an opportunity to use the spa. We both had a healing hands massage $150 and were also able to use the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. It was a very therapeutic atmosphere and a nice break from the hot sunny afternoon. Overall I would recommend this resort to anyone. You are only at the most a 10 min walk away from Down Town Disney and you can also take buses and boats direct from the resort. The staff were wonderful as you would expect from the Disney team and our villa was always pristine clean every single day.

More like condo complex with multiple buildings similar to Old Key West and unlike Wilderness Lodge, Boardwalk, Yacht/Beach Club where the villas are housed in one building. So the feel was a little bit different and the location is not quite as convenient since it is further away from the parks. But still a beautiful property, 2 large pools (new Paddock pool just opened) and few other smaller ones. We golfed several times so convenient for that since Lake Buena Vista course is right there and Osprey Ridge is very close by. We actually arrived @ noon but our room wasn't quite ready so since we had a tee time, we hit the golf course.

We stayed in a Treehouse Villa of the Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa on Disney property, and did not meet a single unhelpful or unfriendly staff member. The villa was sparkling clean - the attention to detail was amazing. It was my husband and myself, my brother and his wife, our son, and their three kids. The room with the bunk beds was great, my brother's two younger boys shared the bottom bunk, their 8 year old daughter took the top, and my two year old was in a pack in play, they all slept peacefully in the same room. I was worried it would feel too oppressive and crowded with 8 people, but it was fine. The master bath was awesome. I don't usually lament leaving any part of a hotel when I return home, but that bathroom made it hard to go back to my normal one! We had a complex reservation, I had also gotten rooms at the main part of the resort, one for my sister and her husband, and one for my father. I researched the layout of the resort, and made very specific room requests so that even though the Treehouses were in a section of the resort a little ways from the main part, they were in the section that was closest to us. I also requested a treehouse that was along the outside edge of the treehouse circle, also being very specific about room numbers. My dad and little sister were put exactly where I asked, and they put them next door to each other because they noticed the reservations were linked, and while the treehouse I got was outside of my specifically requested numbers they clearly understood the spirit of my request and stuck to that. One thing that was hard was that the Treehouse villas are a ways a way from things. Don't take a room there if you don't mind doing a LOT of walking! We like walking, so it wasn't too bad for us, but if you're the type of person who is in a hurry to get places, the Treehouse villas are not for you, stay in the main part of the resort. I also read in some reviews that the lighting in the Treehouses was a little dim, and I have to say it wasn't that great. Not bad, but not great. The bedrooms were the worst for this. The last con is that I wish the buses that went to the parks stopped in the treehouse area. I knew they didn't, but having stayed there that would have been the one touch that made the treehouses perfect. The pros for the treehouses specifically were that they are all separate condos, not attached to each other. With an 8 year old, 7 year old, 3 year old, and 2 year old running around, jumping and yelling, it was REALLY nice to not have to worry about annoying people in adjoining rooms. The treehouse area was VERY peaceful and quiet. We may have been smack in the middle of the biggest tourist attraction in the world, but it felt like we were in a quiet cabin in the woods.

We were given our Welcome folder, but had to ask where our room was located and how to get there. We had put in a request to be near the main Springs building, but that was not accommodated. We understood this, especially since it was June and we were checking in on a Monday. However, we did not expect to be so far away. Although I had stayed at many other WDW resorts and driven by Saratoga Springs many times, we did not have a good concept of the large expanse of the property. We were assigned the Carousel area in room 7236. Luckily, this was very near the bus stop, but even with a good sense of direction, we couldn't grasp where we were located from the main building or how/if we could walk there. It took us until Wednesday to finally navigate our way on foot. The villa was as expected with all the usual comforts of \"home\". However, we were struck that there were only 2 plates, bowls, and hand towels since we would not have housekeeping until Thursday. Our biggest frustration was transportation, particularly to Downtown Disney; this was especially important to us, as we were not going to the theme parks on this trip. Throughout our stay there were considerable consistent waits for the Downtown Disney (DTD) busses. I would expect this in June; however, the theme park busses were readily flowing. We would often see multiple busses to a single park before ever seeing a DTD bus, which was surprising since we were located so close to DTD. Even though our resort did not share busses with another resort, the transport time to/from DTD was more than expected with a stop at the Marketplace, Pleasure Island, Typhoon Lagoon (during the day), and the multiple stoplights on Buena Vista Dr. It seemed to take less time to transfer all the way over to the parks to resort hop than switch at DTD. In fact, the day we went to Beaches and Cream at the Beach Club for lunch, we elected to bus to Hollywood Studios and walk. Likewise, the night we went to O'hana at the Polynesian for dinner, we gave up on waiting 25 minutes for a DTD bus, and instead braved the Extra Magic Hour crowds to bus to the Magic Kingdom and then took the Monorail. The return trip via DTD bus was better, but keep in mind that was at 11pm on a week night. What we learned throughout the week was that the boat from Saratoga to Pleasure Island was much faster, more reliable, and more pleasant. Although the internal bus routes made sense once we figured them out, they were not explained at check in and the bus stop signs did not include this information. Initially getting from the Springs bus stop to the main building was a virtual mystery. I would have never guessed we needed to go through a small gate, through the main pool area, and up stairs/ramp. We felt like we were in a maze. We finally found the internal bus route information in small print in our Welcome folder and after asking one of the drivers. We had originally planned to spend a good deal of time at a quiet pool, but since the Paddock was closed, we could not walk to a quiet pool. We were so tired and frustrated with the busses, we didn't end up using either of the quiet pools. This was a huge disappointment for our non-park stay. Luckily we did have a leftover ticket from Typhoon Lagoon from a previous stay and were able to obtain a \"Getaway Glen\" that was a great experience. Once we figured out how to get to the Springs building, it wasn't that bad of a walk. However, if my 67year old mother had been with us, there is no way she could have made the walk in that heat. Finding Community Hall was also a struggle; even with the maps, we still had to ask for directions. The sign hanging from the ceiling around a corner was virtually hidden. It was a nice offering for DVC members to have free DVD rentals. However, near the end of our trip we discovered my Key to the World (KTTW) card, as the primary guest on the account, did not have DVC printed on it, but my friend's card did! How/why did this happen? This meant we missed out on restaurant discounts during our stay! As for dining at the resort, the \"food court\" is certainly off key. There were only a couple of things on the menu I would eat there, so we didn't have a single meal at Artist's Palette. (I do not expect Brie cheese to be on a WDW food court menu. Food courts are for traditional Americana; leave the cuisine to the table service restaurants.) Speaking of, we did greatly enjoy a late lunch at Turf Club; the sweet potato fries were a nice surprise. The highlight of our stay was our server Melissa from Georgia. She was a perfect Disney server: giving just the right amount of suggestion without showing offense when we selected something else, positively engaging us in personal small talk, quietly waiting to the side for us to finish a conversation prior to clearing plates, patiently waiting for our selections from indecision, and not rushing us to complete our meal. I wish she could be my server at every meal! Our housekeeping was the day prior to our departure. When we returned for the day, I was stunned. While the trash had been taken out and the dirty towels had been removed, no clean towels had been left, no plates had been restocked, the beds had not been made, etc.! I have never experience this lack of service at any of the other DVC resorts. Our departure Magic Express letter arrived with no bag tags and our envelope included another family's letter! Luckily our tags did arrive in a separate envelope later and I trekked to Registration to return the other family's letter. Finally, I looked for my folio statement outside our door on the morning of our departure, but it wasn't there. I thought perhaps this was an effort to be more green and not print them. However, upon inquiring about this at Registration I was shocked to hear I hadn't been setup for Express Checkout. How could this be? My credit card had been attached to my KTTW card all week, and I had certainly used it. I was told this should have been setup at check in. Apparently the Cast Member who rushed us through check in had skipped this. As my colleagues at work said, only \"Disney-ite\" like myself would have noticed some of these things; normal guests would likely not think twice or even realize some of these issues. However, many of these things were very out of the ordinary from other stays we have had. It seems this resort is lacking in training, reiteration, or general Disney service expectations. Perhaps this is a case that the resort is simply too big for management to uphold a quality of service easily found at the other resort properties. We are still glad we had this quick getaway experience, as any trip to Disney is better than none at all or traveling elsewhere. However, in the future Saratoga Spring will be among our last choice of on-property resorts. Best wishes for future success. DISNEY RESPONSE (I hesitate to post this, as I got \"flamed\" for it on another site.) We were not looking for any type of response at all. Yet, based on our numerous stays and detailed account of lots (although small) issues at the resort, a Disney Rep did call me and they offered us two free nights at the DVC resort of our choice.

After a long day in the Disney parks, who wants to hike to the pool just to cool off? And when you get to the main pool, well, the entire thing is only 3 feet deep. You can't even kick your legs without scraping the bottom. The only restaurant on premise is a teeny cafe with limited options, so one morning I drove to ANOTHER DISNEY RESORT just to get a decent buffet breakfast. There is no transportation between areas of the resort, which is widespread and horribly laid out, and forget taking the buses to the parks--you won't get one unless you wait for an hour. Even the boats drop you off in the back of the hotel with little access to the main resort area. To make matters worse, our room had no functioning air conditioning...in the middle of summer. No one would come to fix it, either. The room was also dark and poorly planned, with a bathtub in the middle of a room that was unusable because no doors or walls concealed it (and there is an excess of useless doors separating spaces that shouldn't be.) Perhaps worst of all, there is ZERO AMBIANCE to this resort. There's no over-the-top Disney glamor, no breathtaking design. You are literally stuffed in ramshackle wooden condos stacked on top of one another. It feels like a prison, and Disney should be ashamed to call this their resort.

Weather was wonderful, and our kids (5, 4, and 2) had a wonderful time. The holiday weekend was extremely crowded in the parks, so we spent nap-time each day back at the resort.

We were staying with another family in a two-bedroom condo, and we never felt cramped. 2. Pool was awesome with a killer waterslide! Kids loved it for an afternoon break. 3. Transportation to/from the park was easy. Bus station was right outside, and we never had to wait more than 15 mins or so. That turned out to be a good time for applying sunblock. 4. Disney DVD borrowing from the activity center. This is an awesome perk in any Disney resort, and since my kids really needed some down-time each day we took full advantage of the free movies. Ask about it at check-in. What we didn't like: 1. This resort is very spread out, and dragging sleep deprived children long distances was tough for us. Probably not an issue for people without the little ones, but I would have loved it if there were better ways of moving people (we frequently stay at the Disney HHI resort, and they have the best luggage carts that can be used as people-movers). 2. Would like more options for food here. There's just one cafeteria-style joint and an upscale-looking restaurant (not suitable for the little ones). The cafeteria was good, but after getting the same few sandwiches each day I was a little tired of them. Perhaps a rotating menu would help? Going out to dinners each night is not an option for financial/logistical reasons, and eating the same thing each day just gets a little old. Those were small issues, though, and they really wouldn't apply to everyone - Just our experience.

The kids liked the SS main pool more than the liked Horizon Harbor with it's pirate ship pool. Our room was ready around 1:30. I had serious concerns about staying in the tree houses -- they are super far from the main resort -- not even on the same side of the little map of the resort that they give you when you check in. I thought about asking for a regular villa, but decided that we could handle driving to/from the pool for one day. Boy was I glad I didn't change our room! We ended up with a tree house right on the river. We could see boats passing by from our living room window! The tree house was gorgeous! Completely true to the theme. And the kids (ages 3 and 7) absolutely loved the bunk beds in one of the three bedrooms, even though we have bunk beds at home. We had dinner reservations at the Turf Club at SS. We thought about driving over, but decided to take a \"boat\" to dinner! The boat launch was a 30 second walk from our tree house. We packed our swimsuits for an after dinner swim. We waited about 5 minutes for the boat, which dropped us off right outside the Turf Club. Dinner was okay -- nothing special, but it was convenient. We ate at 6 with 2 young kids. Definitely eat later if you don't want to have a ton of kids around. The after dinner swim was way cool! Only very minor complaint was that every employee was trained to say \"WELCOME HOME!\" any time they saw a guest. After about 10 welcome homes, it got a little annoying. We can't wait to go back!

Every \"cast member\" is friendly and helpful. OK, what it's not - It is not as themed as the other main hotels ( Contemporary, Polynesian, Grand Floridian) but still feels Disney like. It's not a Ritz Carlton, the villas are beginning to show a little age, but we were impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance. It's a little distance to the parks, so we rented a car and could be from our villa to the parks in under 10 mins. So, if you are looking for a larger condo type property and would like the use of a kitchen then you will enjoy Saratoga Springs.

We ate at the casual location,The Artist's Palette; a few times. Food was great! The pool that we used was excellent. Large and a nice water slide. The gym was well equipped and clean. Here are my estimated times for bus travel... Epcot and hollywood - 5-10 mins Animal kingdom - 15 mins Magic kingdom - 15-20 mins at the most Again, we were the last stop for the buses so adjust accordingly if you were staying around the first stop (add 5 mins or so) I've read quite a few reviews about people complaining they waited 20-30 mins for a bus to pick them up.. this NEVER happened with our stay.

On the average every 2-3 yrs. In addition to staying out of the park, I've stayed at a variety of resorts in the park. Animal Kingdom Lodge, Port Orleans, Contemporary, and Boardwalk.

Both pools were fabulous and they are building another one in the Paddock section which should be done next year (i think) That looks like it wil be awesome! Dinner at the Turf Club was the best dinner we had all week. It was perfect. The boat ride over to Down Town Disney is delightful. Staff, grounds, room, etc were all spotless. I read a couple of negative things about this resort being SO gigantic that it causes a problem.....it was bigger than any other I've stayed at. I mean there is a bit of an issue if you wanted to just go refill your mug and grab a snack..... we were in the paddock, and it was a bit far to just run over for a quick soda, but it did not hinder our trip. I also did read that the bus service was a bit slow. I felt like that was true, however, the distance to the park was not bad at all so that made up for the wait time. One tip I've learned - making your way to Fort Wilderness for the Hoop Dee Doo from any Disney Resort can take forever (unless you are at the Contemporary!) Skip the multiple bus/boat trips and just take a cab to save time on your arrival. It only costs like $9 - then take your time and boat/bus it on the way back!! Love you Disney....

Then again given the size of some of the guests and unwillingness to walk even a few meters I can see how this may be a problem for them. Pools - The resort pools were all very good, if you have kids I would suggest staying in the Grandstand section as the pool here is more child orientated with numerous water guns for the kids to spray at each other in the kids area of the pool. The Congress park pool is very nice and while having a playground nearby is more suited to adults (my kids still had a great time in this pool). The main pool was also very good with 2 slides and a hot tub, there was also a video arcade next to the pool that the children enjoyed visiting. Restaurants - In my opinion the food served at this hotel was very poor, the Turf Club was something out of Kitchen Nightmares, when I read the menu I was surprised at some of the offerings and wondered if the given dish would work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If you do eat here go for a burger (not the chicken burger) which was actually quite good. Everything else that I tried here was poor, terrible Calamari, horrible chicken burger, shredded buffalo wings with blue cheese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did not work. The Artists Palette was below average, my son enjoyed the flatbread pizza from here but the other offerings that I sampled were not very good. You can also purchase a refillable resort mug but this only allows you fizzy drinks, my family received one each as we were on the dining plan but only used the mugs on 2 occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was due to not wanting to give my kids fizzy drinks all the time and also due to the locations of the soda fountains being far away from the rooms. On a plus the Pizza delivery to the room was good and the Pizza very tasty (Pizza delivery is by a different company). Rooms -The Studio that we stayed in was of a good size, we could have done with more storage but overall I cannot complain and the room was also clean with everything in working order with a flatscreen TV (some reviews mention that they had the old style TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), one thing that is needed is WiFi, strange that it is not available and would be a big plus if they introduced. Location of the resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A great positive of this resort is being in walking distance of Downtown Disney, from Congress Park it is only a 5-7 minute walk, I had considered staying at the animal kingdom lodge but after eating at Boma there one evening and seeing the number of people from this hotel getting the bus to downtown Disney of an evening I decided that I had made the right choice. I overheard a number of the Animal Kingdom lodge guests debating if it would have been better to stay at Saratoga due to its location next to Downtown Disney and was left with the impression that the Animal Kingdom lodge may have very little to do of an evening. Buses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Overall I found the buses to be regular for Saratoga to all parks except Magic Kingdom?? I am not sure why there always seemed to be a delay in getting a bus to or from Magic Kingdom given that this is the main park? But for all other parks the connections were good and I never had more than a 10 minute wait. Would I recommend Saratoga \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Yes, if you can get a good deal or are a vacation club member I would recommend the resort, it is good value, has OK connections and has a good location next to Downtown Disney. Would I stay at Saratoga again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Probably not, I was on the dining plan and was therefore able to visit a number of the Disney hotels, from these visits I decided that I would stay at the Polynesian (I like the theming, pool, location and that it is on the monorail), or the Beach/Yacht club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great pool, location. Both of these hotels are more expensive than Saratoga and so it is unfair to compare but as I next plan to visit Disney in 4-5 years I would rather spend the few days that I am there staying in a better location. On a positive I would class Saratoga as far better than the Contempory hotel which really should be demolished - the California grill was a very good restaurant and Chef Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was great for lunch but it does not take away how ugly the building is, you feel like you are staying in a 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public housing block. I would also rather stay at Saratoga than Wilderness lodge which I was not impressed with when visiting Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Backyard BBQ.

The Grand Villa has 3 bedrooms and sleeps up to 12 people comfortably. By square foot, the villa was bigger than my house! We had a full sized living room with a 2 story ceiling, a full dining room complete with a breakfast bar area and a small deck, a full size kitchen and 4 bathrooms. The kitchen was good sized and had everything we could have asked for. Each of the bedrooms has a private bath as well as a bath off of the kitchen. The master bedroom had a whirlpool bath as well as a king sized bed while the other 2 bedrooms on the second level had 2 queen sized beds and regular bathtubs and showers. The only complaint I had was that the beds were quite soft and not as comfortable for me as I would have hoped. We didn't venture down to the main pool area, but visited the pool down by Congress Park. It was very well maintained and the water was a great temperature. Towels are available at the pool but can't be brought back to your room. The staff was very friendly and quickly responded to concerns. We spotted several snakes below our deck and called the concierge. Within minutes, there was a security guard keeping an eye on the snakes and pest control was on the scene shortly thereafter. The area we were in, Congress Park, was just a block from Downtown Disney. There is plenty to do from shops to restaurants. The main area of the resort has a small store as well as spa services. One of our family was celebrating a birthday and we were able to easily work with the concierge to get 2 small cakes for the celebration. This resort is fairly far from Magic Kingdom and such, but they provide buses to the parks on a regular basis. The average time between buses to any park is about 20 minutes.

The condos are located right next to Downtown Disney which made for a pleasant walk through beautiful grounds to go out for dinner. It was chilly in Jan and the pools were heated to a wonderful temp. The only thing that might be a negitive for some is the fact that it is located on the edge of Disney property and is a good bus ride to any of the parks so allow extra time to first wait for a bus and then the drive to the park. The only other complaint is that they have carpet under the dinning table (really who thought that would be a good idea?) and a toll had been take from all the children dropping food onto it. It was not pretty and felt like it needed a good deep steam cleaning. But other than that the rest of the condo was spotless. This is a great set up for anyone traveling with a large family or group.

If you ar traveling with a person using a scooter, I would highly reccomend getting a treehouse that is handicap accessible. We took my 80 year old mother who can walk a litlle so we did not ask for a handicap room. In order to charge the scooter each night,I had to srive/push the scooter underneath the treehouse to find the outlet. We were in room 7005 and there was very little room for the scooter to get underneath the treehouse. Once under, itwas very difficult to drive the scooter as the floor is covered inches deep in pine needles. Once I made it to the outlet, it was literally pitch black.

Our first stay was good (see previous review), but it wasn't so great that we were pining away to come back again. So with lower (though not bad) expectations, we actually had a better time the second go around! One of the main contributors was the better location of our room; we stayed in Congress Park which had a large pool and hot tub within extremely easy walking distance. Last time we were here, we stayed at the Paddock and had a HUGE walk down to the pool, which was difficult on an injured brother-in-law and an older mother-in-law. Come to think of it, maybe it was a better time because they weren't with us this time... :) It was a great time to come to Disney World though. Even with it being kind of a busy time with kids off for MLK day, we never waited on a line at any of the parks beyond 30 minutes. The pool by Congress Park was often empty too, families seemed to prefer the main one with the slide, activities, and proximity to food/drinks. Food at the Artist's Palette was as good as we remembered it - I was looking forward to the cheeseburger flatbread after our first visit. Getting hungry now just thinking about it. The room was clean; no complaints about that at all. It's a great resort in terms of proximity to Downtown Disney too, which we visited almost every day. It's not too far to walk to, but my wife and I like the ferry service so we took that most often. Service was great. The check-out service was probably the easiest I've done with Disney to date. I was amazed at how effortless it was. I couldn't tell what about it changed from the last few times we've been there, but it made a difference.

We don't have the Disney Vacation Club because I usually can find some great deals using our Annual Pass. I got a 2 bedroom for 40% with this pass. I think it ended up to be around $350/night which is very reasonable in my eyes. We've stayed at several Disney and DVC properties in the past 5 years, including Bay Lake Towers (our favorite after this trip), Key West, Wilderness Lodge, etc. Here are some of the pros and cons that I found at Saratoga Springs: Pros: - The location was nice. I loved walking or taking the boat to Downtown Disney. It is a nice area to go outside of the parks. I didn't find the travel time via buses to be that long either. - Buses were great in mid November. If you go when it's busy, the buses will be busy. But it was relatively quiet and we never had to wait long. - The cast members we experienced at the hotel were extremely nice. Especially the activities team. We had such a blast at every activity my 2.5 year old participated in. - The handled our room request to be in the Springs section and on a higher floor. - I was so worried from other reviews that the grounds were too large. I found it pretty nice. We took a bike tour one day and found it big, but not that big. Caribbean Beach Resort is MUCH bigger...at least it seems. - Grounds are beautiful - Security was always very efficient and nice. - Bell Services was probably the fastest I've ever experienced at WDW - Lots of parking Cons: - Cheap tile! I know it sounds picky but the buildings are gorgeous, and everything seems to be very detailed. However you walk into the bathroom and it looks really cheap! Just my opinion. Not a deal breaker obviously but it looked like it belonged at a Value resort. - The Grandstand section was pretty far away from most of the activities. The Springs and Congress Park were much better located. - The walk to Downtown Disney was nice....but towards the end took a random left turn and seemed to go a bit out of the way. Kind of surprised. I visited Saratoga before it was Saratoga - the Disney Institute and I remember there being a shorter path. - The washer and dryer was gross. The dryer was pretty much falling apart and very dirty. It obviously wasn't maintained. Having a toddler, we used it every other day and I had to spend some time cleaning it before we did any laundry. Never had that experience at Disney...or any hotel with washer/dryer. - The quick service was small. For it being a very quiet time of year, the lines were SUPER long. We waited an average of 30 minutes every time we visited. Sometimes more or less. I would hate to see what it looked like during a high season. - Very small store but was well stocked. - Layout says that 2 bedrooms had 2 balconies. Not the case for us. Only one. - Never got a privacty sign. Or saw one on anyone's door. - Didn't get housekeeping one day. Another day we were getting back from the parks around 2pm and housekeeping knocked on our door. I told them I was putting my daughter down for a nap and if they coudl come back in an hour. She knocked around 5 minutes later (waking my daughter up) and I asked the same thing. Maybe 20 minutes later, knocked AGAIN and I asked her to come back because she was waking up my daughter over and over again. She told me she would come back around 5pm with a second shift. Never came. I don't mind missing the housekeeping when I asked them to go because my daughter's schedule, however don't tell me one thing and never show. - Turf Club - we were excited to eat there but there was no variety! And seemed very expensive. - Not much storage for our clothes in the master bedroom - Every day the number of towels in our room got less and less. By the 8th day (our last day), we had one hand towel and maybe 3 bath towels! - The master bathroom has a very odd layout. I don't mean to be picky, but I was 11 weeks pregnant and frequently going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. It was like two \"rooms\" away and off on the side. Just odd. - The shower in the master bathroom is on the small side. Compared to other DVC 2 bedroom properties - Bay Lake Tower had 3 bathrooms for a 2 bedroom suite....this one only had 2. Just a note. - Twice we were kept up by the housekeeping talking and banging around outside our door. I thought it was kids but after the second day, my father got up and found that the housekeeping room was right around the corner and heard them being loud. Disappointing and unprofessional. Just a note, as I don't want to assume anything. My daughter got a pink Minnie doll from my parents in the beginning of the trip. This doll went EVERYWHERE with her. As we were packing up, she was carrying the doll and decided to follow me as I packed us up. On the way to the airport, she asks for her Minnie doll and we can't find it. Figure it has to be packed in one of the suitcases. Get home and it's not there. The last time we saw it was in the hotel room. Called Housekeeping and Lost and Found immediately....as in that afternoon we left. I gave them a description of it and our room number, even where she was when I was packing. They haven't found it. I am not pointing fingers but usually Disney is good about getting these toys back to the kids. Overall we like Saratoga Springs. It was very nice and the room was ideal for our young family. However there are some negatives that made our stay at Bay Lake Towers superior to this one.

The food court has decent options compared to some of the other Disney resorts (which surprised me I expected them to be more or less identical). We ate one night at the full service restaurant on the property and were quite \"underwhelmed\" given its price. On the plus side, the boat to Downtown Disney is convenient and staff was very helpful. When we checked in out the first room we were given smelled badly like it had been smoked in (yuck!) - I went to the front desk and the apologized at least 10 times and gave me a new room. In summary, is a fine place to stay - by most standards I would say its overpriced (if you are paying and not using DVC points), but that's pretty much true for anything Disney, however this lacks the feeling of being of the Disney experience. The resort is comfortable but it will be easily forgotten once you've left.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice grounds.

When we arrived at 4pm (had done online check-in before we left) we were told that our room wouldn't be available until after 7pm. However, the front desk CM quickly got my family and I into a room at what we all agreed was a better location for our family than the initial room (The Grandstand, which is much closer to the Carriage House than the resort map might suggest, and more than walkable). We were in awe of the sheer size of the property and the beauty as well. The room was fantastic if a little dated (tube TVs?; carpet could be replaced), but extremely convenient with full kitchen and full size fridge, as well as enough space for a family with twins plus their \"GiGi.\" We were surprised at the lack of room service other than pizza delivery, which we found a little pricey ($58 for two large pies). We also sampled both dining offerings from the hotel (Turf Club Bar and Grill being far better of the two, try the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger, but The Artist's Palette being more convenient in a rush, I really enjoyed the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich), and my wife got a mani/pedi at the spa which she thought was one of the best she had ever had. There was a pool right outside our door and down an elevator, and the bus stop (first stop on SSR route) was a short walk. My only complaint about the buses are that a bus to Disney's Hollywood Studios arrive much less than the twenty minutes that is suggested by the hotel, so if you miss it, you could be waiting for a while.

TVs still old tube-type. The walls seemed thin to me. I had never noticed on prior stays here, but I could hear the neighbors TV all night. My biggest complaint is that at 9:45 this morning the maid was banging at the door. I opened the door and she said \"Housekeeping\". I gave her a funny look and told her we are still here. She looked really put-out, and then wanted to know exactly when we would be leaving. I told her at 11:00, when we have to leave, and shut the door and took my own sweet time packing up. She then hung out down the hall and watched me as I started taking stuff out to the car. In 9 years of DVC plus many years before that staying on property, I have never had this happen to me. This isn't $39.99 on I-drive where you might expect this kind of thing. The people staying here either paid at least $15 grand for a membership or over $400.00 a night for a room.

We booked a trip for our once in a lifetime family reunion in January of 2010. We booked 2 -2 bedroom villas for our family and my husband's brother and family. We have 2 guests with disabilities - so made a request, 11 months in advance, that the rooms be at The Springs (near pool and food court). We arrive, as scheduled, on the day after Christmas. Our room was not only not ready, they were unable to have the 2 rooms in the same building!!!! They smiled their Disney Smiles, and basically told us that they were sorry, but there wasn't anything they could do. My husband took it in stride, and agreed to be put in a room far away from amenities in exchange for rooms next to or across from one another. So SS moved our room, and off we went to rent a car so we could get to and from the pool and food ($500 + for the week)!!!!! The next day, our relatives were finally able to get in due to the blizzard. When they checked in at 10p - their room was across the campus in The Paddock. Again, Disney smiles with an \"I'm sorry, there isn't anything we can do\". They settled to getting some sleep and allowing us to handle it in the morning. Their room was dirty, with dirty linens in the tub and stains on the carpet. Again with the \"I'm sorry\". In the morning, I went to the front desk, spending greater than 2 hours to finally facilitate a room change for my in-laws to a room in the same building, not the same side or floor. Again, smiles and \"I'm sorry, but there isn't anything we can do\". I specifically asked if their keys would need to be changed when they changed rooms and was told no, so off to the parks we went - happily to EPCOT for a dinner package for all 10 of us, followed by the Candlelight Processional and special viewing for Illuminations. All was well until we went to pay for the package at dinner (we were on the dining plan). My brother-in-law's card was declined!!! I seems that when they re-assigned the room, all the keys were cancelled. Nice. This pretty much highlights the good parts. I could mirror what other's have said about the slow buses that make you wait in the elements (in our case freezing temps). The rooms are more than showing wear, and heard many stories about walking into rooms that were already occupied. Overall, the difficulties we had were just basic hotel/motel issues that should have been made right by the staff.

Our little guy was on his 1st trip-got a pin and a voice mail from Goofy in the room-very cool. BOTTOM LINE- loved it- we lucked out as we traded through RCI- I could not have afforded 7 nights here at standard DVC resort pricing- I would return-great experience in all areas- it is less \"Disney\" than other resorts...more sophisticated- my 4 year old did not notice but it has less whimsy than many of the other resorts.

Son used the pull out couch to sleep-so I don't know how comfy that would be for an adult. Kitchen had any materials we needed, though we purchased the Disney dining plan (HIGHLY recommend) we did have the Garden Grocer deliver some snacks, fresh fruit, coffee and cream and we used the kitchen minimally for this. There was an entry foyer b/f actually entering our living area- this was perfect for \"parking the stroller\" every day-it stayed out of our way. washer and dryer-excellent perk for any family-we easily washed 5 loads of laundry-towels, etc. balcony was small but comfortable--looked over street and landscaped grounds- plentiful trees, flowers and saw many bunnies. FOOD- was ok- the selection is a bit limited in comparison to other DVC properties-nothing we ate was bad-it was all tasty-but limited selection. The on site store was small but adequate. I loved that we could grab breakfast plates (waffles, eggs, whatever) and walk them right out to High Rock Springs- the pool area. We ate meals by the pool frequently. The POOL- probably 2nd best (after Disney Yacht and Beach)- exceptional- always found a lounger or shade as needed. water slides were a blast for kids and adults.

We always waited 15-20 minutes fro a bus. Downtown Disney is the closet stop-it is within walking distance along a nice path if you have the time-we walked back from Ghirradeli one evening with ice cream cones:) We rode the bus to MK and would hop on other transportation as needed. Our longest trips from SS were Animal Kingdom and Typhoon Lagoon. Buses on the SS route were clean and air conditioned-unlike some of the other bus runs. LOCATION- ok...so you are a bit far from most things Disney- my spouse feels that this is what would hinder a return trip-staying closet to MK or Epcot would be ideal for us. Was it unreasonable?

I stayed in the Grandstand Section which was an easy walk to the main resort where the restaurants are located. It had it's own \"quiet pool\" with a pool bar and it was also the first stop for the Disney buses when they were going to or from the parks. This was a very nice feature as it assured you a seat on the bus even when it was crowded. SSR is also only a short walk or a boat ride to Downtown Disney which offers a number of restaurant choices. In the spa there is a very complete gym with state of the art aerobic equipment and free weights and machines. There are walking trails along the golf course for early morning walks and there is also a \"Nature Trail\" that connects SSR to other Disney resorts. The resort is on the Lake Buena Vista golf course and as such, it has access to a driving range and a putting green, making this a good choice for a Disney Golf Vacation (which I'm doing next January).

Congress Park is a quiet area on the resort and has its own pool and jacuzzi area which was also an excellent place to relax (towels provided at the pool). The apartment was perfect for our needs and very well equipped. However, the apartment could have been cleaner as we found tomato ketchup on the skirting board around the breakfast bar and a some dusty areas on furniture (and this was not attended to during our stay). However, on the whole, the apartment was just what we needed. Large bathroom with spa bath and a large separate shower room, full kitchen facilities and dining table/breakfast bar, also washing machine and tumble dryer etc. We used the Disney transport most days and we did not wait too long for any of the services to the parks. The resort is also very close to Downtown Disney - only a 10 minute walk and also boat ride every 20 minutes. Staff were very friendly and helpful and check in and check out was very smooth. We found the Disney Dining Plan excellent value. We did not dine at the resort (Turf Club), however we did dine at the Flying Fish (Boardwalk), Le Chef de France (Epcot), California Grill (Contemporary hotel), to mention but a few - all on the dining plan and all excellent. One thing to note is that you will need to book well in advance (i.e. at least 4- 6 months before flying as we could not book some of our choices, i.e. Cinderellas Castle at Magic Kingdom).

Although the check in buidling was very pleasant, we did struggle to understand the member of staff who checked us in as her English was very poor, but we got there in the end and after an initial problem with our 21 day Disney Ultimate Tickets, we were allocated room number 8621 in the Granstand. We were early to check in (around 12:00) and were initially told our room wasn't ready until 16:00 hours, but I think because of the hanging around we had to do, they moved us to another building and we therefore managed to get access to our 2 bedroom villa immediately after. It took us a while to find our ' block ' as Saratoga Springs is huge - although beautiful to walk around by the golf course. Our room was on the first floor in the Grandstand and directly near the Grandstand swimming pool and by the pool there was a water play area which was fantastically themed. We were also close to the Granstand bus stop which is great as you are first to be picked up and first to be dropped off ( note there are 5 bus stops in SS). Couldnt fault the bus service at all, not much waiting around. Saratoga Springs has 3 pools, the main one has two slides, a larger one and a smaller one for infants. The main pool was busier than the one outside our room so we tended to use this one every day - some of the time we were the only ones around the pool. There is also a bar by the Granstand pool which only opened towards the end of our stay - maybe when the respost gets businer - although it didnt seem busy any of the time ! You can buy a selection of drinks and also refill Disney mugs here. The food court (Artists Palette) is located near where you check in and is always spotlessly clean with attentive and very polite staff. I must say the staff in SS were the best we have encountered at any WDW resort. One thing to mention about the food court is that it doesnt seem to do substantial meals, you cant get burgers or fast food there at all - not a real problem to us - but sometimes if you wanted something other than a large turkey filled ciabatta or sandwich, you would have to go elsewhere like Downtown Disney. SS is opposite Downtown Disney and there are two ways you can actually walk there which was great for us as we do a lot of walking and exercise at home. The main path takes you to the Market Place and is well signposted on all the maps, but there is another path that you can access near where you can get the boat, which after a 10 minute walk you arrive near Cirque du Soleil at the other end. However, if walking isn't for you, you can always take the bus or the boat to the Downtown area. We ate in the Turf club once (which is the restaurant located behind Artists Palette), the service and the food was very good, with a fair amount to choose from like steak, burgers, crab cakes etc. We also hired one of the Surrey bikes for half an hour and rode around SS 3 times, but be warned on a hot day its quite hard work !! The cost around $20. One afternoon there was a storm which went on into the evenining, so we got a DVD - which we were told as we weren't Vacation members was free to rent (up to 3 per night) so that was a pleasant surprise. The two bedroom villa we had was huge, it doesnt feel small and even though there was 4 adults and two children, we didnt feel we were all in each others way. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with a jacuzzi type bath and large separate shower just off bedroom one. Each bedroom has its own TV and the living area has a TV plus DVD player. The alarm clock in bedroom one also had an iPod dock which means you can play your own music if you like. One of the few negatives about the kitchen is that it doesnt have a kettle, so if you want a cup of tea, you either have to boil water in the microwave or via the coffee maker ! The only negative was the houskeeping, it doesnt seem to be as good as even the Moderate or Valur resorts, most days it was the bare minimum done which seemed to get worse as our stay went on. Examples or poor housekeeping was not leaving filter coffee or toiletries etc. We also left a tip every day during our holiday and one day we left 2 x $50 on the table in the bedroom by mistake which we found out was taken by the member of staff cleaning our room that day thinking it was a tip !! We got it back though and she apologised for her ' error '. Also, coming from the UK, SS does not sell phone cards (like some other WDW resorts do) and you cannot dial international numbers from the pay phones using coins. I did get a quote to call home using a credit card which would have cost around $30 for a few minutes which I didnt bother with. I wouldnt recommend dialling overseas from the room phones as they are horrendously expensive as we learnt to our cost during a previous visit. Best thing to do is to buy a mobile phone from one of the supermarkets as this is much cheaper.

We chose a 1 bed villa. Upon getting the magical express from mco we arrived around 40 minutes later to the hotel it was absolutely stunning - we were greeted welcome home by a lovely man called Nick. When booking we had requested a room close to bus stop as I'm in a wheelchair and would be easier. Nick didn't think we were close enough so moved us to The Grandstand area. Which I would recommend bus stop, reception and a pool were moments from our doorstep. Our room was massive considering it was just the 2 of us- the bath tub is amazing. The Mousekeepers were amazing too every day we left them a little tip and when we came home from a crazy day at the parks our room was spotless they had even put the dishwasher on. Every member of staff we came across was very friendly especially a lady called Jill who was great helping us try to find Disney miniture golf. 1 thing I would say is don't make any phone calls from your room we made 3 calls lasting a total of 7 minutes and it cost us $80. we got a phone card from a nearby pharmacy. The Disney buses were great also- they longest we waited was 20 minutes for a bus to Epcot the night it was open late with extra magic hours. Another great perk of staying with Disney.

We stayed in the Grandstand and this is an ideal location as it is the 1st step for all returning buses from the parks. Room service was daily and the room was always clean upon return with fresh towels, soaps / shampoo and washing up liquid left when required. My main disappointment was the room. We booked a studio and whilst I could not fault this for cleanliness it was perhaps of the standard of 3*+ / 4 Star room you would get at a Thistle, Marriott, etc, nothing exceptional. The Kitchenette had a microwave, coffee maker, toaster and fridge but not rings or oven. The Artist's Pallette did get busy mid morning for breakfast with quite long waiting times. We did not use the Turf Club restaurant so am unable to comment on this. Staff were always polite and tried to be helpful.

I think saratoga springs would be good for larger groups who need a villa...but although it's pleasant you should thoroughly explore all options!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful!\u201d", "Author": "AlbertaAnonymous", "ReviewID": "UR82906279", "Content": "Saratoga Springs is a beautiful resort!

I am a vegetarian and 99% of the food did not suit me so I tended to eat elswhere. The room service was daily and soap powder was daily in the first week.

There is no internet access at this hotel and when i asked at the hotel reception I was told about another hotel which had business facitlities (cant remeber which). The room did have a internet cable if you bring your lap top but you can get internet at disney quest. The rooms were large. It is a double pull out couch bed in the main living area and a king size in the main bedroom. The bathroom was huge also. it had a separate room for the spa bath with washbasin, another room with a shower and washbasin which led to the wc. You do not need to go throught he room with the bath to get to the wc just the shower room. Air con is available in each room also. The room I was in did not get any direct sun, which made it it a bit duller but due to the hot weather it was nice and cooler.

They provide a service where you can rent directly from a DVC member. It is especially great for last minute deals if you live in Florida! We rented 2 studios, which were located near a pool, playground and bus stop. There was a lovely boardwalk across the lake to the main pool and restaurants.The main pool is amazing, with a large waterslide, and a smaller slide for the little ones. They also have a great \"splash area\" with donald duck and a small waterfall! Our kids had a great time checking out the property for all the hidden mickeys, and the staff was happy to help! The only drawback to this resort is that there are only 2 restaurants on property. We took the free boat ferry to downtown Disney the second day to find some dining options (try Wolfgang Puck Express...delicious and inexpensive). The service and activities provided are what you would expect from Disney...exceptional! We had a lovely time. After reading the previous review, I am a little baffled as to what the reviewer's point was?? Yes, when you go to public places, you will see people of all shapes, sizes, cultures, etc... Not a problem to our family. My only complaint is when adults feel the need to wear t-backs to a Disney resort! I just love trying to explain to my 2 year old why \"that lady's butt is hanging out...did she forget her pants? :)\". I didn't see any \"scary crowd\"...just a lot of families, young and old. No crowds at this time of year, so it was a great weekend. We would definitely stay there again.

On check in we were allocated a room at the Springs Section near the Main pool, but requested to change to Congress Park, as we wanted to be nearer a quiet pool, we arent into pool activities and slides and wanted to be quiet with easy walking into DTD, and they changed us without problem , infact on checkin they were so helpful and did their best to accomodate us, and we they had given us a view of DTD as well , though as has been said before most views are obscured by trees but the thought was nice anyway. Had no problem with language barriers, though i think they have people from all over, when I went back to check in much later in our stay to pay off the bill, the girl behind the checkin at the time, was clearly from the UK, though she was busy trying to help a guest checking in , the conceirge called me over to help instead so I didnt have to wait - and sorted my bill for me, despite that she was supposed to have \"clocked off\" herself for the day, so the service I feel for us was excellent. The room was clean and comfortable, amenties good too, and no issues with the TV reception, we had two in the villa one in the lounge and one in the bedroom, Ok they werent flat screen, but hey I didnt come here to watch TV all day... only need to check out the weather channel! as long as the room and bedding is clean thats my only concern - and it does seem they are in the process of upgrading as there was work going on with other villa blocks. Lucky for us this was a dry time in Florida so the weather was hot, not too humid. perfect! The pool area at congress park has to be the best, we hired bikes for one morning and cycled round the whole resort including the Treehouse section, its a beautiful resort, yes it big but we didnt think too big, we enjoyed walking around, cycling and exploring. We even saw a family of Otters in the lake when crossing over the long walk bridge, fantastic. We loved the fact you could go out and walk about the resort and hardly see a soul, we walked from Congress Park into and through DTD then out the otherside by Disney Quest back into Saratoga at the Carriage House side..... so quiet and a lovely walk. I often wonder with the amount of walking thats done at the parrk, people dont like to walk about a beautiful resort, we would often find ourselves walking \"the long way\" back from Artists Pallet to our room so we could enjoy the walk, there are plenty of benches to sit and rest and admire the surroundings en-route. it was so relaxing, and away from the hustle of other resorts. My only complaint about the resort is about Artists Pallet, whilst it was nice not to have the usual fayre on offer - the choice is limited and at breakfast time its hectic in there, I do understand Disney probably feel its a \"self catering\" resort as all rooms have a kitchen of some sort and most people are out and about during the day and evening, but the breakfast (though it was good) was a bit slow whilst waiting in the queue to place your order (Once pladed though it was fairly quick on the buzzer - served hot and fresh and delicious too). I know someone mentioned about the room numbering - we were given a small map on checkin, noting our room number and floor - our room 2334 - this meant block 2 floor 3, and room 34.... once you grasp that its easy to find where you are, and we found our room really easily. We loved this resort, enjoyed the factilites and loved the quiet pool - Bus service was good we hardly waited to get anywhere when we used the buses (we always have a car but tend to use the buses for MK - saves all that parking, trams and then either the boat or monorail when the bus takes you straight to the main gate!). but that could be the time of year too, we hardly waited for any rides either.

The TV was an old-model box set that had mediocre reception. You'd think that a resort of this class would do better. Also, there's no wi-fi, which is absolutely ridiculous this day and age.

The rooms are large but don't have very much room available with all of the furniture, something that made it tricky for us to setup the pack n play for the baby and still be able to safely walk around the room in the dark. The front door was tricky to open requiring us to insert the key card for a long period of time before it would unlock. Everything else about the villa was great. The service was the only thing that was lacking during our stay, check in occurs in the Carriage House which is not close to the Villas at all, after check in you have to drive back to the main road because the villas have a separate entrance. We checked in at night and it wasn't until we made it to the villa that we discovered that the check in clerk didn't activate any of our keys requiring a drive back to the main resort, this was very annoying and there was no apology. None of the lobby staff spoke fluent English so there was a language barrier with them explaining things such as how to get to our villa and how many cars we can park. While there I witnessed another guest asking for the location of a lobby phone to call her room, she was told that they didn't have one and they wouldn't let her use the counter's phone to call her room, this all occurred with me seeing the lobby phone about 20 feet away. Out of 3 cast members present within eyesight of this phone, none of them knew of its existence nor showed any concern or willingness to assist this guest, that was very disappointing.

We were soaked to the bone! Back to the hotel to dry off and get settled in until the rain stopped. At the desk, we were told that our room was not ready yet and that we'd have to wait until 4pm. I asked the manager if there was anything they could do to get us a room to dry off and change. They offered us towels. Now I try not to be unreasonable, but when you pay lots of money to stay at Disney (which is not cheap for the 2 bedroom villa), you have an expectation set for a level of service. This expectation was not met up to now. 5 of us standing in the check-in area, soaking wet and shaking from the AC and the best they could do was towels for the 4 hour wait till our room was ready? Seriously Disney? Once we did check-in, our room was nothing short of spectacular! We stayed in \"the Villas 4127\". Big rooms, nice kitchen with granite counters, wonderful view, the pool was right across the street!

We were at the end of the block on the top floor and other than a drunken man one night - we were never disturbed. The resort is big and it was a good walk to the beverage machine each day - thus our free to refill cups were barely used. We did not use the main pool, children community hall or either restaurant either for this purpose. We were driving anyhow so drove to a number of on property restaurants at other resorts to make the best of our dining plan - highly recommend Le Celier, Teppan Edo and Ohana's for dinner. Little pool by our block was clean and pleasant to use after a day at the parks. My daughter would swim and I did the laundry. Laundry facilities are next to all the pools and are free and used only by studio guests as all other units have them in the room. Service was good.

The room was very clean and well stocked. I loved the washer and dryer! The pool area was right below us and to the left was the golf course. We asked an employee; I believe her name was Jill, to show us the path to the Carriage house and instead she told us to hop on her golf cart and she took us there. It was nice to find out it was just a very short walk, even nicer to run into someone that was so very helpful. We left Sat. morning headed to Hollywood Studios and the Magic Kingdom later that day. Our wait time was less than 10 minutes from the resort...about 15 miuntes from the park. There was also a cast member at the resort to record when each bus arrived. The Grandstand is the first pickup so we also got to view the other parts of the property as other guests were picked up. We did not return until 10:30 that night and were so happy to arrive to a clean room. Our bed was one of the most comfortable beds we had ever slept in and our daughter fell fast asleep on the pullout couch we made up for her. Sunday was a day spent at the resort. After arriving to a clean room from church, we played in the arcade, in the pool, and then headed to downtown Disney after dinner. We actually walked there and had a wonderful time. Monday we waited for about 5 minutes to catch the bus to the Animal Kingdom and Epcot in the afternoon. Just another awesome day and we highly recommend the ride \"Soarin\" at Epcot. We were on the dining plan and had dinner Friday night at the resort's Turf Bar and Grill...pretty good but a 25 minute wait even with reservations, Saturday night at Crystal Palace in the Magic Kingdom....this is an excellent buffet with Pooh characters, Sunday night at Chef Mickey's, still our daughter's favorite, and Monday night at the Garden Grill at Epcot with Chip and Dale. The characters at this restaurant spent more time with our daughter than any other site and the food was really, really good...it was a lot of fun!

After reading some of the reviews I was worried about the walks, buses etc but found none of these to be a problem. We stayed in a Congress Park (CP)1 bedroom villa with view of downtown disney, and after walking and biking the resort I am glad we did, the other areas were a bit boring in my opinion. CP is about a 5 minute walk to the main pool, restaurant, spa etc. We used the main pool almost everyday and there was always enough chairs even though we got their late afternoon. Pool Bar was dissappointing, we did enjoy the ping pong tables and games. CP has its own bus stop which was very close and the longest we ever had to wait was 15 minutes but most came less than 10 minutes from CP and Parks. We bought 5 day hopper + passes and probably only needed 4 days. We visited all 4 parks, both water parks and disneyquest 2x, so the \"and more\" package paid off for us. I was underwhelmed with both Epcot and Hollywood but impressed with Magic and Animal Kingdom, waterparks and disneyquest. We went at opening and completed parks by midafternoon and used either pool/waterpark for rest of day At the last minute I opted for the dining plan and probably would not do it again. SInce we were there 7 nights and were in our hotel each evening it probably would have been cheaper to do lunches in parks and make our own dinner with 1 or 2 nice nights out- ordering food for delivery ahead of time. However, if it was a shorter stay and less down time the plan is worth it and everyone else in our group loved it! Our favorite meals were at Coral Reef and California Grill---kids also loved Beaches and Cream. Least favorite meal by far was the Sci-Fi diner. Food in parks was fairly typical processed amusement park options...not that great. Other meals were at Earl of Sandwich, Wofgang Pucks and Wolfgang Puck Express, Turf Club, ...none great and none bad. I think it important to say that our kids are 12 and 14 so an experience with younger kids or no kids might be different. Also, we intentionally took the kids out of school to avoid crowds and all of us agreed that was worth it. We had very short lines for attactions--at Magic none at all-- we were able to get a seat almost every time on the bus.

Imagine walking from the Downtown Disney bus stop near Rainforest Cafe to the parking lots past Cirque du Soleil La Nouba and you'll understand. Therefore, it takes a bit of research, planning, analysis of the resort and asking questions beforehand to avoid disappointment with your accomodations. We did all of that and were thoroughly pleased with our 2 Bedroom Villa in The Grandstand's 9101-9436 building. This was our first visit, so I'm not familiar with the Studio, 1 Bedroom, 3 Bedroom Grand Villa or Treehouse rooms; but staying in our Villa was more like renting an apartment with maid service than staying at a resort. And that's a compliment: Massive closet space, a well layed out full-size kitchen, comfortable sleeping room for 7 people, 3 televisions and telephones, 2 bathrooms with decent privacy for everyone, breakfast bar, sliding doors to the secluded covered patio with a golf course view, a dining nook with seating for 6; all the comforts of home. We were on the first floor without any close neighbors and didn't hear a peep from anybody all week. Our patio opened up to a courtyard facing the rear of the properly; overlooking the 17th and 18th holes of the Lake Buena Vista Golf Course, a seldomly used walkway and the Sassagoula River. It was like sitting in our backyard. Our building was about a three minute walk to The Grandstand's quiet pool and more importantly; the same distance from the Bus Depot. That's crucial at Saratoga because it's the first stop Disney buses make and the first drop-off at the end of the day. It's also a good way to get around the property if time is not an issue or you don't feel like walking. The main pool and check-in were a five minute walk up and down some hills; but still manageable. Our quiet pool was pretty large with some nice landscaping, a BBQ cabana, plenty of seating, Children's splash area, it's own bar, restrooms, lockers, hot tub, changing facilities, towels, tables and was rarely crowded. We wouldn't have visited the feature pool at all if the kids didn't love the slide; which is fast, long and wild enough for the adults to enjoy. That pool does get crowded; but finding a table or lounge chairs wasn't a problem and we noticed the water was warmer. A cursory glance at the property map indicates The Grandstand is surround by a golf course, The Carousel is secluded with only 2 buildings, The Paddock spans half of the resort and some buildings are quite a hike to anything, Congress Park is congested and close to Downtown Disney and The Springs is in the middle of it all. Disney reservations are pretty good about honoring location requests if possible and they recommend placing a request about 10-14 days in advance.

Check in took a while, but not too bad. The only problems I had were first, Bell Services didn't want us taking our luggage to our own room (we hired a van from the airport...highly recommend), so my husband handed it off while I did check in. An hour later I called them, b/c we were still waiting, We were in our room for an entire hour just sitting there because we had no luggage. Also, the Garden Grocer (fabulous) had dropped our food off and it was with Bell Services so they had to make 2 trips. We ended up being in our room for about 1 1/2 hrs once we had our luggage and grocery items. Housekeeping. I have never in my entire life seen such shoddy housekeeping. It actualy became a joke throughout the week with my family. We could only tell if housekeeping was there because the beds were made. 1 time they didn't wipe down the counters, they always left coffee in pot and never moved a single item out of the way, so if you had shoes on the floor, they left them exactly where they were. I don't think they cleaned the bathrooms. We had fresh towles every day (well, all except one when they didn't come--but they did when I called in the evening) and they made the beds and ran the dishwasher, but that was all. We never saw any staff members for anything, except by the pool when they played games with the kids, that was great. The pool area was nice. The hotel itslef is huge and the fact that there were 6 bus stops in our hotel alone was a bummer, especially since we were stop #6 coming back from the parks. If your picky about pillows you might have an issue. They have these strange little bed pillows that I found odd. We stayed in The Springs and I'd stay there again, it was very convenient to a bus stop, pool and main area. I read some reviews about the rooms being too small and I'd disagree with that. Also, there were complaints about The Artist's Palette restaurant. I will say, the ordering/paying system is a nightmare, but the food was refreshing. Not your normal run-of-the-mill chicken nuggets and hamburgers. I loved the veggie slaw. Loved the trendy menu. Overall, room-wise my husband and I and our 4 children ranging from 6-16 were very comfortable.

We checked in and requested a room close in and were given a studio in one building over from the main lobby. Arriving in the room, we found it to be quite comfortable; however, the heat/air conditioning unit was constantly running and was quite noisy. We had already asked to be moved to the building next to the lobby and were glad for that. We froze all night even though the thermostat read 74 degrees. In the a.m. we moved to the other room with a beautiful view of one of the ponds with a fountain on the top floor. Great location, bad room from the standpoint of cleanliness and general maintenance. We found the patio doors to be filthy to the point of it being distracting trying to look at the view! There was dust everywhere and I mean thick fuzzy stuff along the baseboard throughout the room like they never vacuum the edges of the carpet. Also, there were handprints and spots all over the front of the microwave and around the sink and cupboard doors. The loveseat was filthy! And the cushions were sinking into the sofabed frame. Not comfortable. We sat on the bed while watching TV. Then when I took a shower I looked up to find black mold on the shower wall in several places but worse yet, a large patch of it on the vinyl shower curtain liner! Needless to say, I called and spoke to housekeeping and was assured it would all be corrected. Just minutes after we returned to the room later in the day, the housekeeping manager arrived at our door to see if all had been done. I showed her everything and she said the shower curtain liner was supposed to be replaced by then and would ensure that it was done at 5:30 p.m as well as everything else. When we returned to our room after dinner, nothing had been done! So, we had to wait until the next day and call again!! There seemed to be a new liner in every laundry basket set outside each room for the housekeeping staff but where were they putting them??? Not in our room! Finally got it done, but the dust was still there and all the other problems. We just got tired of complaining. I would much rather stay in a hotel in the future. They are cleaned daily - at this type of resort you just get clean towels every 3rd day. Yikes! This was maybe a 3 star setting, not what we normally expect from Disney or anywhere else. I would seriously consider another option if you have the chance. And I sure would sell my vacation ownership pronto if I was an owner and encountered this situation at this property! And, of course, it just confirmed why we have never opted to become timeshare owners.

We were given a room in the carousel block overlooking the gate house. We told them we had requested the springs and they rang and tried to find us a room somewhere else.

We came back the next evening to find all our luggage already waiting for us in the new room. The staff were always friendly and very helpful and no problem was too big or small. The studio was really nice and clean. The maid service was good and she came in every day with clean towels, soap, shower gel and shampoo. A couple of times we received towel figures that my daughter thought was great. The bus service to the parks was also good. We never waited more than 5-10 minutes to get to any park. The bus stop was right outside our room and they were never crowded getting to the parks. We did encounter the odd bus that was really busy coming back from the parks but it was always manageable. The resort wasn't very busy so I don't know what it will be like in the summer. We had the free disney dining plan which was so good. We ate at all the parks and a lot of the nice hotels. Our favourites were Boma at Animal Kingdon, Park Fare 1900 at Grand Floridian and Chef Mickies at the Contemporary. We only ever had breakfast at the Artists pallette. It was basic but ok. It is really handy as you get extra drinks that you can take to the parks with you. The pool area around Congress Park is really quiet and was hardly ever used. If you are looking for a Disney Hotel that is pure Disney in your face then this is not the place for you. It is a really quiet and relaxing place without all the hype of Disney but still on Disney.

Our 1 bedroom villa was in The Paddock block, about 7 minutes brisk walk from the services & facilities of the Carriage House and main pool area, which was not a problem to us. It was just 2 minutes stroll to the nearest bus stop and we found the WDW bus service to be excellent. We never waited for a bus for longer than 5 minutes the whole time, despite doing some of the more difficult journeys between parks and turning out at some of the busiest times, eg immediately after Wishes @ Magic Kingdom. Also it was only 10 minutes walk to Downtown Disney, which was handy. The villa was excellent - roomy, modern, well designed, with quality fittings/equipment, comfortable beds and good quality bathroom facilities. Air conditioning worked well and was not unduly noisy. Villa had a pleasant view over a small lake and the atmosphere around the whole place was peaceful and relaxing. This was a welcome calming contrast to exciting daily hustle and bustle of the theme parks. I find some of the very negative comments in other reviews a bit bemusing. However if you want every single part of your WDW visit to be over-the-top Disney themed, this may not be the place for you. The service from staff on site was very good throughout, in particular the housekeeping and reception area people. We booked direct with WDW and I think got good value.

The Dining Plan came as a 'free' extra when we booked and proved to be all we needed for food, having prepared our own light breakfast in the villa. The food was generally very good, particularly at Olivia's cafe and Boma. Counter service meals were OK, though difficult to find occasional healthy choices. Minor points would be - The Springs blocks would be better location for anyone wanting to be closer to main resort facilities. Congress Park looked to be a good location, especially the side overlooking the lake between S. Springs and Downtown Disney (we requested a villa in Congress Park but this did not seem to be acknowledged).

We chose this resort based on its proximity to Downtown Disney and because this appeared to have a more adult atmosphere than some other Disney resorts. We stayed in a studio room in the Grandstand section. Based on my research, I had requested to stay in either the Grandstand or Springs sections. Both of these sections are close to the main lobby and restaurants. The Grandstand bus stop is the first of 5 total bus stops within the resort. This means you will be 1st to get on the bus on the way to the parks and 1st to get off the bus on the way back. Due to the time of year, the buses were never crowded. We also never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus to arrive. They started running at 7am in the mornings. To get to Epcot, the bus ride was about 20 minutes. To get to Animal Kingdom, the bus ride was about 25 minutes. To get to Magic Kingdom, the bus ride was 25 - 30 minutes. And Downtown Disney was only a 10-minute bus ride or 10-minute boat ride away. The studio room was a pretty standard hotel room. It was very similar to a Hampton Inn or Garden Hilton. Bed and seating area, kitchenette, small bathroom with single sink vanity. The room was clean and in good condition. Daily housekeeping was more than adequate. Our only complaints regarding the room were the size of the in-room safe (barely large enough to hold my mini laptop and a cell phone) and the air conditioning unit made too much noise at times, making it difficult to sleep. Also, there was no wireless internet available, which we found unusual for a deluxe resort in this day and age. Service throughout the resort was friendly and efficient. We had checked in online prior to arriving. Once we arrived, we were given our packet and were in our room within 5 minutes. We had dinner at the Turf Club on our last night. The food and service were both excellent. We had breakfast at the Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette one morning, and while the selection was limited, it was a fast and easy way to grab a meal.

This is where my disappointment began. We've been DVC members for 12 years. We stayed at Saratoga last year and wanted to stay at a different resort this year. I made our reservations at least 2 months ago and was told that there was no availability at any other resort for the 3 nights we requested. I asked to be put on a waiting list and called back a week before our stay, but still no luck. Yet I read on Trip Advisor where people are geting upgraded from the value resorts to a one-bedroom condo. I had to use my points, for which I've spent tens of thousands of dollars to stay in a studio. We arrived for our stay after 10 p.m. after a long day of travel. I had done the online check-in and requested accomodations near transportation....this and ground floor were the only requests you could make. Our reservation was not ready when we arrived. We had to go through the entire registration process. They had to print our room keys. The celebration I'd registered online was not acknowledged and we were not asked if we were celebrating any event. Our room was at the farthest possible point from ANYTHING in the resort. We would have to drive to a pool, the gym, a restaurant, anything...and it was a very long walk to the transportation stop. The room itself was fine. I don't like the queen size bed in the studios, although they would not have room for a king. The room is surprisingly small. By the time we got to our room ( the signage at the resort is very confusing and nearly impossible to read at night due to the color scheme.), there was no option for any food, with the exception of pizza delivery, which we grudgingly ordered. The pizza box is still sitting outside of our room two nights later, since it won't fit into any of the wastecans in the villa. My hope was that housekeeping would pick it up and dispose of it. This stay did not feel like \"hotel\" stay. Although I don't expect daily housekeeping, I do want to feel like I'm a guest of a hotel. Didn't get it this time.

Also, the Pop has great theming, nice pools, and a large food court with a good variety. About a month before our trip we received an email offering a free upgrade to either Old Key West or Saratoga Springs. Not being a fan of Old Key West, we opted for Saratoga. Our plane landed around midnight and got us to Saratoga Springs around 1am. We had checked in online in advance to speed up the process, so when we got to the lobby, we went to the express checkin line. We stood there for about 5 minutes while everyone stared at us, so we then put ourselves on the main wait line. When I finally got to the desk, the cast member acted like I was wasting her time for not getting on the right line - very rude. Then when I asked her how long it would take in the morning to get to Hollywood Studios, she answered \"a little while\". When I asked her to be more specific she said \"an hour\". I said \"an hour?\" she smirked rudely and said. \"Yep.\" SO RUDE! We were then outside waiting for a bellhop to drive us to our room which took another 10 minutes of waiting outside with no cast members around. Finally we get to our room. It was ok. Clean, but kinda boring, and NO magic at all. I know this is themed like Saratoga Springs, but they easily could have incorporated Mickey or something into the decor. They do it all the time in the parks. The next morning we realized that our room was very VERY far from either the main lobby or even a pool. I'm used to walking a bit at the Pop Century, but this was unacceptable. Also I am really not a fan of these huge resorts with multiple buildings. You spend most of your time walking through parking lots to the bus stop. You may as well stay at a Days Inn. We called the front desk and explained that we were unhappy. I wanted to switch back to the Pop Century. I was so upset b/c I didn't even feel like I was at Disney. We asked for a different room, and they were so rude and unwilling to help. We finally had to ask for a manager who moved us to the OTHER far side of the resort, but at least it was closer to a pool. The pool themeing was minimal and underwhelming. The hot tub was so overly chlorinated my eyes hurt and I had to get out. The food court is way to small for a resort of that size, and doesn't have many options. Overall, it was my worst resort experience in my 30 years of visiting Disney. We had been thinking of joining the DVC, but I know now that I won't. Maybe it's me, but when I go on vacation I don't want to be at my \"home away from home\". I wanna be on vacation. With maid service. Without a kitchen.

Arrived at check desk 1900hrs Aug 29th, to be greeted by many staff as there were no queues. The lady i spoke to was English very polite and professional and went out of her way to add celebrations to our trip and confirmed they had managed to meet our choice of location 'The Springs' in the building opposite the main pool. We always place a request about 7days before we arrive stating where and why we would like to stay, there are no guarentee's however we have been lucky i guess. Yes it is a large resort and we could have ended up way out in the sticks, however i was happy we got what we wanted. Our view was of partial downtown disney rooftops and a little pool, we had a top floor view. Great view of hot air balloons on a morning and the characters in flight balloon. One thing to point out though with regards to the staff there were some clients blaming service desk staff for a rainy day, they were asking staff 'what they should wear' due to a few rain clouds. They became irrate when staff were unable to answer? (who could answer?) as they had come for sunshine (havent we all) so i believe the staff have enough to contend with. What im saying is people blame the resort for simple things, im glad i took no notice of the previous negative reviews, i would have missed out on a great trip this year. I understand there is such thing as a bad resort stay too (i have had one) i just get annoyed when reading reviews, as to what people are complaining about. Arrived at our room which was a studio which was lovelly and clean, windows were slightly grubby (finger marks) but who cares i'm not staring at those all day. I had my daughter '6' and niece '12' with us, who gladly shared a sofa bed and did not complain of back ache etc etc, whilst me and husband shared a comfortable king size bed. I have a decent 'Milbrook' bed at home and preferred the hotel bed. I think if you cant sleep on the hotels bed then you have'nt exercised enough around the resort or theme parks. The sheets were changed once a week and we rec'd daily mousekeeping, as were were'nt staying as a vacation club member, so we rec'd toiletries too. I would say more coathangers are needed for a 2wk stay, so we took our own always do. Parking was great plenty of spaces outside the building,there was a lift if we needed it, which we took when we had the luggage. Pool was excellent plenty of loungers, lifeguards, clean towels and tables, normal Disney standards really. Great slide and kiddies wet area, choice of x2 hot tubs and surroundings were preasant too. The pool bar opened late morning and closed pretty early, then again its not Vegas or Benidorm. There was a drinks refil station outside next to the pool bar for those who purchase the refil mugs, however it seemed to attract wasps, which end up in your drink - be warned. There was plenty of activities around the pool area daily such as: Disco, Bingo, Hula Hooping and Pool movies at 8pm, my daughter enjoyed them all. They have programmes at the front desk with all the activities such as crafts in the clubhouse etc on and movie times. Transportation - we had a car as we hate waiting around, we took the bus once back from another resort after dinner and it was a nightmare, not Disneys fault though it was down to an over reactive client scratching her leg. We tried the boat, but it was too relaxing for me its ok if you have time to kill, great views though of the new treehouse villas, as we had to pick up there. Gate house staff are so polite and friendly no matter what, they never get a mention, but they are part of this resort and do a great job in welcoming you. We had free dining, so we had booked all our table services 90 days prior to get where we prefer, variety - The food was great, the Artists Palette (counter service) was'nt huge but did the job for a quick counter service fix. I would have liked a burger and fries, although no fries im afraid just kettle chips, we survived by going to Beaches and Cream at the Beach Club for our burgers. I understand the need to develop a healthy approach to meal times. There are other places to go if you need typical american fare. Bakery items were lovelly and fresh whatever time of the day. They sell grocery items for those with cooking facilities. The shop wasnt as large as ones in other resorts, however they had what we needed. The Turf Club was excellent, only went once, we booked prior to our visit and can understand if it was fully booked constantly. Saff were very acommodating toward my niece who was a fussy eater. We never took a surrey bike around the resort, will hopefully do that 2010 trip, as there is plenty of facilities onsite to try. Our avid Disney lover friends came to visit us at Saratoga, who were staying nearby Disney resort, they were overwhelmed with the resort and tried the walk from the resort to Disney Marketplace and said it was fine 10 mins. They dont have hire cars and would prefer the resort simply because they can walk to the marketplace to catch a bus to the many resorts for dinner reservations, a 10 min walk to marketplace saves waiting on 2 buses.

I think the Paddock or the Carousel areas would benefit more from having a themed pool area, but it's not that big of a deal. All areas have a pool, themed or not. Check in was easy, I did ask for a room change to Congress Park, but no rooms were available. We checked into our room in the Grandstand and we had a partial view of the pool. Unfortunately, the fridge was leaking and the floor was soaked. Getting your room changed in a resort the size of this one is an experience that should be used for torture, in my opinion. It's not like you can just take the elevator down to the front desk. Changing our room was at least an hour long process, that was NOT pleasant. The front desk employees were completely unhelpful, if not rude. Finally, our room was changed and it was fine. Housekeeping is a joke at this resort. Every corner had inches of caked on dirt and dust. The top of the armoire was covered in a layer of dust, there was mold in the bathroom, etc. The rooms look much older than they are.

Even though the resort seems to be the largest and most spread out of the Disney resorts....we found that the map makes it seem like there would be a far walk everywhere, but that wasn't the case at all...Artist Pallette had mediocre selections as far as food, and we did not try the Turf Club,sorry.ONE RECOMENDATION TO DISNEY-AT THE END OF PARK HOURS,MORE BUSES DISPATCHED FOR THIS HOTEL...Although the wait wasn't too long, the buses filled up fast, and when everyone's feet are aching at the end of the day, nobody is in the mood to wait for the next bus.

After 8 days here's my take on this place. The good: The pool was absolutely fantastic. Very shallow, so it was pretty safe for kids. Had separate slides for adults and toddlers, a zero entry area with shade, and a splash section for the little ones. We really, really loved the pool. Room - 1 bedroom suite was comfortable and view to a pond was beautiful. Stayed at the Springs, which is right next to the main building (front desk, restaurants,main pool). Very convenient. Front desk - service is outstanding - like any other 5 star resort. Our 22 yr old hurt her shoulder and the front desk put us in contact with a drugstore that made deliveries to the resort (got everything within half hour). Absolutely no hassles. Also, our toddler got sick and we did not want to expose him to a clinic, so we got in-room doctor services ($300, but worth it). Magical express - used it for return to airport. It was comfortable, punctual, and a nice ride. Although they put on a video selling anything Disney that lasts for most of the trip. Airline Check in - long line at 10 am Sat. Plan for at least 1 hour. However, we were able to get our boarding passes and check our luggage in (and avoid the airport hassle). Great advantage and worth the line. Location was also good for a mixed party like ours. We would go to Downtown at night using the boat service, which was quite efficient. The bad: OMG! The food at the Artists Pallette!!! If you plan to stay here for a while, either cook or have lots of restaurant reservations. We could not get into the main restaurant, so many of our meals were at the Pallette. Food is boring at best, and the selection is grossly limited. Flatbreads are plain, sandwiches are always cold, nothing is outstanding. Very very expensive cafeteria food. Also, there is no room service (only pizza delivery). The hotel is beautiful, but not themed (don't believe the horse racing thing). It looks and feels like a well kept apartment complex. There is no Disney feeling here, which was a major dissapointment. The ugly: Housekeeping is mediocre at best. They have a habit of placing baskets with supplies on the floor in front of your door, which I consider unsanitary (towels touching a hallway floor?). Also, they have supply carts all over the hallways - at all hours, even at night (check my photos). This is quite unsightly, and made it difficult to maneuver a stroller around corners. Cleaning the room was limited to doing the bed, changing the towels (and I have my doubts about this one), and throwing some (not all) of the dishes into the washer. For $500/night and a daily tip I do expect the room to look sparkling clean. Did not happen - things were in the exact same position we left them. Also, the cutlery in the kitchen drawers had (food?) residues and looked gross. Very very dissapointing service. Overall, this is a fine resort, although overpriced for what you get. If you absolutely must stay on Disney property, I would strongly suggest one of the other themed resorts. I will not be staying here again, mainly for the housekeeping issues, but also because there is no theming and it feels quite generic.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cThe Truth - Saratoga Springs\u201d", "Author": "PWPres", "ReviewID": "UR43439537", "Content": "Third year in a row,third different Disney resort. Check out my other reviews on AKL and Poly........This is the truth people from a regular person just like you. We recieved a free upgrade from ASMovies and were excited about staying on this property. First of all the cast was great at SSR. All of them were very friendly and helpful. Mousekeeping was efficient and did a great job. The room was clean folks but the outside of the buildings and grounds could have used a bit of attention. We were in the Congress Park building and the view of DTD from the quiet pool and viewing area was special. I've had Savanna and Majic Kingdom Castle view and this view was right there with those. I'll have to admit that it was a short walk to the main building or you could wait on a bus.By the time you caught an in house bus though you would already be there just by walking. Springs and Grandstand were also this way as far as being reasonably close. This resort did not have that same \"Disney Majical Feel\" to it. It really was like an apartment complex on Disney property but that's not saying it was bad,just different. It's a very quiet ,relaxing resort. You don't get that awe inspiring feeling here like you do when you first walk in AKL or Wilderness lodge and it's not a \"Disney fun\" place like Pop or All-Stars. It is however a beauitful and polished resort. The main pool WAS a blast and the slide was great (not too crowded). My kids and i went to our quiet pool at congress park every night at about 10:30 for a late relaxing swim. Had it almost to ourselves. The food court/gift shop Artist Palette was smallish(and i do mean small) but very clean and the food although limited in choices was great..Turf Club Bar and Grill is a nice restaurant but it aint no Jiko. Online check - in was about a one minute process.The buses were about what you would get at any other resort,about every 15 minutes or so. At park closings,buses were crowded as expected.Overall we enjoyed our trip and are glad we got to experience a DVC resort for the price of value but we probably wouldn't stay for a second time.Just not Disney enough for us. We would recommend SSR to all of you.It's a Disney vacation you want to at least do once if you are like us and come every year or many times a year.

We also loved that we were the first stop on the bus route, big plus. Also this section was great because there is a bus that goes from the main lobby and pool area to the Grandstand. That is not the case for the other sections of the resort. The other sections would have to take a bus going ouside the resort and then back to go from the main section to theirs. Also loved it because it was a very quite section. We stayed in a one room suite. No complaints. Our room was very clean. We did the online check in and so when we got there we simply walked up to the online check in counter, received our vacation packet and were on our way in less than 5 minutes. The only negative I can say is that once we were on our own the first time we were completely confused on the resort layout. The map that they give you at check in isn't the greatest. We didn't realize that we could have taken a bus directly to our section at that time. But that was only a one time thing and we were being stubborn and trying to figure it out on our own.

We have stayed at Disney's Port Orleans resort for the last four years and fancied a change. Afetr visiting Saratoga Springs through the Vacation club in 2008, we decided to give it a try for this year. We were not disapointed. Being a 'show home' for the Vacation Club, this place gets even more attention to detail than other Disney resorts. We booked a one bedroom villa for our family of four (2 teenage girls) and found we had plenty of room. These rooms come with a fully equipped kitchen with cooker, huge fridge, washing machine & tumble dryer, a seperate shower room, bathroom and huge jacuzzi tub (set up so you can watch tv from it!) seperate lounge with huge TV and DVD player. Saratoga Springs theme is of Victorian horse stables/equestrian centre, with the LBV golf course surrounding the property on one side and the river on the other, the setting for this resort is awesome. We stayed three weeks this year and as usual had a fantastic time, Disney has so much to offer, Orlando even more with Universal studios and Sea World, for people who don't want to lounge around on the beach for two weeks, this is the only place to come. Booking early last year got us Free Disney dinning. This offer is the best, we ate in all the top Disney restaurants including Cinderellas castle, Grand Floridian, Magic Kingdom etc, This included 6 restaurants with character dinning (great for the kids, autographs, photos etc), we added up our receipts and lost count at $2800!! and we still came home with some points unused. This offer will save you fortunes and take the worry away from where shall we eat. We book on line with Disney directly and then get seperate flights and car hire avoiding the extras a travel company may add to your costs. For example, this years holiday was booked last year when we returned home. Booking early gets you some good incentives like Disney dinning. This holiday was for 2 adults, & 2 kids (14 & 11) three weeks in the stunning Saratoga Springs resort, 21 day Disney passes, FREE Disney dinning plan, plus a few other benefits came to \u00c2\u00a33300.00 add flights from Virgin \u00c2\u00a32400.00 car hire from Netflights (Dodge Charger) for three weeks \u00c2\u00a3400.00..... all done. The FREE Disney dinning plan will save you fortunes, I promise. Last time we checked, the same holiday booked through Virgin was \u00c2\u00a38360.00, we payed \u00c2\u00a36100.00. We have booked same again for next year (2010), there are seven of us this time in a two bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs, we got all the same extras and this has worked out at \u00c2\u00a3850.00 each. We need to add flights and car, this can be done in January when you get the big airline sales.......

Let me start by saying that we loved SSR and have already booked to go back next year (In a one bedroom rather than a studio) so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off if some of my initial comments seem a little negative in comparison with POR Firstly lets look at size. SSR is big. There are lots of reports saying that you need a car to get around this place. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. What you need is the will to walk. We stayed in Congress Park, opposite Downtown Disney and about as far from the main pool and restaurant etc as it is possible to get. The walk takes about 5 to 6 minutes; a bit of a pain if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining hard but not too bad if you remember what your legs are for. If you are not good at walking then just take your time. The scenery is mainly very pleasant and you are on vacation so why rush. Take a while to look at the trees for the Hawks (these have a tendency to eat the ducks, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very Disney); or look at the turtles in the ponds (there are loads) and make sure you avoid the snakes (we saw one about 4 ft long sunning itself in the hedge next to the path). The kids will also love all the frogs and lizards. It must be said that the walk from Congress Park to The Springs (the central area of SSR) is not very Disney either. The area around the rooms is very nicely landscaped and very pretty, especially at night. However, the central road does feel and look very much like an access road (which, of course, it is). The Disney \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imagineers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd must have had the day off when this bit was designed. When comparing this resort with POR there are some down-sides. The restaurant/Shop are much smaller that POR and have a much smaller selection. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even serve pancakes at breakfast! I can only assume that this is because SSR is a villa resort and most guests are expected to buy and cook their own food. Although much smaller than POR we never had a long wait for breakfast. In addition the reception area is smaller and not very heavily staffed and the Arcade (if you have younger children) is tiny in comparison. There were also a lot of broken machines and some wag had walked off with the puck from the air-hockey table when we were last there. The main pool is very large and very well designed. They show movies around the pool nightly (although these are tricky to hear and we never made it through one without a thunderstorm closing the pool area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not something even Disney can control). The down-side with the pool (the same was true of POR) is that at 9pm the life-guards go off duty and this is seen as an excuse for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153older kids\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take-over the pool. At this point the pool area stops feeling like Disney and starts feeling like summer break in the Bahamas. Unless your kids are ok with having a twenty something jump on them in the middle of the pool it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a good idea to beat a hasty retreat at this point. Sadly the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet pools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tend to suffer from the same problem (predominately, I report with much sadness, caused by my own countrymen). Lets get to the room now. The room was very good, although not significantly larger that at POR. Where it did have a big advantage though was with a balcony (or patio on the ground floors) which opened the whole room up and made it much lighter than the rooms at POR. Another significant advantage is the pseudo-central air. POR has the old-fashioned in-window aircon units that sound like they are made by jet-engine manufacturers. SSR has a locked-closet (by the kitchenette in the case of a studio) that contains the aircon unit and this is then pumped in centrally. I say pseudo because the aircon unit is still technically in the room and still a bit louder than I would ideally like but it is a lot better than POR (oddly the temperature controls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really seem to work either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever I did with them it was either too hot or too cold). One other area that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really work for us is the pull-out bed. The studio apartments have one double bed (which is extremely comfortable) and a sofa-bed. For 2 this would be ideal, and it does serve to make the room look bigger. However, when in use the sofa-bed is not all that comfortable and certainly not big enough for teenagers and above. The room would have been better served with the more traditional 2 bed layout in my opinion. See, I told you it would sound like I was being very negative. Now for the good stuff. The room feels very much higher quality that POR and having large sliding doors to the balcony gives you a much greater feeling of space and certainly affords better lighting. There are other nice touches too, like the DVD player and the radio-alarm with an iPod doc so you can listen to and charge your iPod whilst in the room. The soundproofing is also superb. Although there was some evidence of external noise this was extremely limited. What noise there was unfortunately came from the afore-mentioned testosterone-fuelled antics around the pool late into the night. Because of the time of year we visited the view of downtown Disney was obscured by trees, but the view we did have was still very pleasant. One thing Disney do get wrong in all of their hotels (IMHO) is the size of the safe. As with POR the safe was a maximum of an inch deep. This is fine for money or passports but not much good for those of us that travel with several thousand dollars/pounds worth of camera equipment. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not expecting a walk-in vault, but something big enough a camera would be good, other hotels seem to manage it ok. So to sum-up; the grounds have lovely landscaping, the rooms are excellent and for us the location was ideal (we used the restaurant at downtown Disney a lot, which we could easily walk to from our room). Oh, and one final thing that always seems contentious, the Disney transportation system. We had no problems with busses going to SSR (and we were there for 19 days with no car). However, there were delays sometimes in the busses going to the parks and you can often find you have been on a bus for 45 minutes and ended up 100 yards from where you started. This is not unique to SSR however. Would we go back? Absolutely (already re-booked for Aug next year). Would we recommend it?

We stayed in a 2-bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs because we received a free stay here when we joined the Disney Vacation Club at a different resort. I would not recommend this property unless you have a car and intend to cook in the unit. Saratoga Springs is just huge. Our unit was probably about half a mile from the main building with the restaurants, shops and main pool. This would have been ok if we had intended to cook our own meals in the unit, butwere intending on cooking in the unit, but since we were on the Disney Dining Plan, we had to drive down for breakfast, soda, or a snack. This was very inconvenient. If we did not have our car with us we would have had to take a Disney Bus (!) to get to the main building. This does not make for a very relaxing vacation in my mind. Another consequence of the hugeness of Saratoga Springs is that the Disney Bus must stop at five bus stops before it even leaves the resort. It takes forever to get to the parks. For these reasons alone, I would not choose to stay here again. Another negative was the concierge staff. Some of them were very inexperienced. When we arrived I tried to get them to print out my tickets to Spirit of Aloha, a dinner show at the Polynesian . Using the meal plan, you reserve the show in advance and the concierge at the resort is supposed to print out the tickets, deducting meal credits from your account. .It seemed the concierge did not want to do this, she talked me out of it, saying it was too far in advance. When I went back the morning of the show, they did not know how to issue the tickets. They deducted the credits from the meal plan, but when we got to the show, they showed it was unpaid and had to deduct more credits. Luckily, the cast member at the Polynesian was able to fix things, but we were late for the show. On the positive side, the main pool with the slide was very fun and had great activities for the kids. There was a nice game room and kids club. The Turf Club, the resort's full service restaurant, was very good. The Artist's Palate, the food court, had good food but a very limited selection. The unit we stayed in was very lovely and clean. However, it had minor plumbing problems. A toilet stopped flushing on day and the air conditioner leaked water onto the carpet of the entry way. These issues were addressed immediately so they did not become problems. Another issue was that the high speed internet did not work.

I was able to wash towels instead of waiting on housekeeping to bring me clean ones as well as sheets and blankets!!! We felt very safe, great locking devices in the room, well lit property, bus stop within walking distance. We stayed on the second floor. Resort is close to Downtown Disney, fantastic restaurants, i.e., Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Chilis, McDonalds(beats spending a ton of money at the Disney restaurants), Wal-Mart Supercenter just 6 miles(first day we made trip to Wally World to buy groceries). Even though we were not close to the main pool with the slide, we watched Channel 20 on the t.v. and it gave you instructions on how to use the bus transportation to get from your villa to the pool and back to your villa from the main pool...very easy...catch any bus( it stops at The Springs---where the main pool is) then when you are ready to go back to your villa, catch the Downtown Disney bus(this bus stops at every bus stop in the resort before heading to Downtown Disney).

BIG savings!!! Because we visit the theme parks often throughout the year, we decided not to rush this time....we would check the Extra Magic Hours in the evening on Channel 19 and sleep in during the morning hours, lounge around the resort, then go to the park that offers the EMH and avoid the CROWD and heat, and get on the popular rides QUICKLY!!! So, if you are not in any rush, that is the way to play in the parks!!!

We booked an 8 night stay in a Studio room. Prior to arriving at SSR, I checked in online, which, for the most part, was quite easy. One comment about online check in is that there is no real place to make requests. The only requests that I could make for my room would be either A) close to transportation or B) ground floor. I chose ground floor, but decided to make further requests in person when I physically checked in. The process couldn't have been easier! I will always use this in the future! I requested that we stay in the Congress Park section and that we have a view of the Downtown Disney area. We kind of got both requests granted. We did get a room in the Congress Park section and we had a somewhat obstructed view of the Downtown Disney area. Our view was more of the archway leading into the quiet pool and then beyond that was Downtown Disney, but mostly our view was of trees. Choice of locations in Saratoga Springs is CRITICAL! This resort is huge and spread out - much like Coronado Springs, except I believe this resort is actually larger. Some sections of SSR can be a haul from the main pool and main building that houses the Quick Service location, Artist Palette along with the store. I looked at a map and thought that Congress Park would be ideal because it was the section next to the main building, but yet it still had a quiet pool and a walkway to Downtown Disney. In the winter or during cooler, less humid months, this section would be ideal. However, during our stay, Orlando was breaking records with heat indexes. There was no way we even attempted to walk from our section to the main pool or to Artist Palette. We also never used the walkway to Downtown Disney. In fact, the entire time we were there, I never saw anybody use that walkway. We wound up driving every time we needed to refill drink mugs (think Nescrapfe in the morning) or to use the main pool. In this regard, having the quiet pool just steps away from our room was fantastic. The main pool was usually busier and noisier, so the quiet pool was used with greater regularity. The buildings and our room were very clean. I also noticed that Artist Palette, even though it would get quite hectic and crazy, stayed VERY clean. That was a huge plus that we sadly couldn't say about the Mara at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Also, the food at AP was quite good. I liked the food offered here better than the food at any of the Deluxe resort Quick Service locations we've been to thus far. I didn't try breakfast there, but the lunch and dinner was good. Again, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if I wasn't staying on property, but if you happen to be at the resort, it's great in a pinch. The main pool is pretty standard for a Deluxe resort. There are a few waterfalls, but nothing fancy. It is a free form pool with the requisite water slide. The slide is similar to what you would find at Animal Kingdom Jambo House or Wilderness Lodge. Nothing fancy, but the kids seem to love it. The one day we used the main pool, it was so warm it literally felt like a hot tub. I know the sun and recent high temperatures probably heated all the pools, but this was noticeably hot. We never swam in that pool again. In fact, we left it and went almost immediately to the quiet pool in Congress Park and it actually felt refreshing and like a pool should. It was comfortable - not hot! The bus situation was less than desirable. The busses make about five internal stops before they leave the resort to -- the Treehouse Villas. Seriously! It took forever to get on the road towards the theme park, so we just drove ourselves after that. Be advised that you will need to factor about 40 - 60 minutes for travel time if you plan to use the bus. Driving our own car allowed us to leave at about 7:30am-7:40am to make it to any given Extra Magic Hour park at 8:00am. That seemed pretty good as opposed to having to wait at the bus stop at 7:00am! I couldn't help but draw comparisons between SSR and Coronado Springs. Both seem to be sprawling and large. Some rooms could be a hike away from the pool or main building. There are many internal bus stops if you use the Disney Bus system. Also, there are no internal corridors. One of the things I love about the Deluxe resorts are internal corridors. These are great for those frequent afternoon lightning and rain storms. It's no fun to have to run outside in the rain to a main building just to get something to eat, wash clothes or go to the game room. I personally do not care for the \"condo-style\" of this deluxe resort. I will say that there were some definite benefits to staying at a DVC room. I liked the increased room size and some of the features of the studio room were great. I loved the larger refrigerator, the microwave, the toaster and coffee maker. However, I absolutely HATED the fold away bed. This room, like almost all Studio rooms, had a queen bed and a queen sleeper. The sleeper bed, which I was lucky enough to sleep on, was terrible. The mattress was about as thick as a Ritz cracker and there was a metal bar that ran down the center of it when it was unfolded. The bar made it impossible to sleep in the middle because you would roll to one side or the other - also, metal bars aren't notorious for comfort anyhow. Suffice it to say that it was actually more comfortable to sleep on the bed in it's couch form, even though my legs hung over the arms. Even though we are only a family of three, a one bedroom or two bedroom is the only way to go with a DVC resort. So the Studio room had some definite benefits over a regular room, but it also had some drawbacks - namely the sleeper bed. All in all, I would recommend this resort to somebody who likes the moderate level resorts. I would not pay or use DVC points to stay here. I hate the condo style resort. I also don't like the sprawling layout of most moderate resorts. I prefer the enclosed internal hallways and the layout of the traditional deluxe resort. One thing I forgot to mention, when it rained, the hallways in our buildings became like little lakes. There were huge puddles of water even though we were on the second floor. For whatever reason, there were always towels thrown down in the hallways and \"Wet Floor\" signs everywhere. You literally couldn't go down a hallway without having to move a \"Wet Floor\" sign out of the way.

Also, this building is next to the main building which houses the front desk, concierge and Artist Palette, which is the \"quick service\" restaurant and store. Our suite was in very good shape. I believe I read on TA that this was one of the original buildings, but we found everything to work well and be reasonably new-ish. The first morning, when I went to make coffee, the carafe lip was broken off and not realizing it, I cut my finger when washing it out for first use. We called housekeeping and they quickly brought up a new carafe for our use. Other than that we had no issues with anything in the unit. We have younger children (7 and 10) and they slept in the queen sofa sleeper, which although doesn't use a traditional mattress, was very comfortable. The one bedroom unit is set up so that people can enter the bathroom two ways and so that the one bedroom can be locked for privacy. The large tub is in the master bathroom area, which is nice as my one child took a bath and the other one showered at the same time, in separate rooms. The main pool was fine, not too big, but not tiny. My kids loved the waterslide. All the parks are within 10 minutes drive. We used the bus for Magic Kingdom only and found it very convenient to use our rental car to drive to the rest. The parking is free at all theme parks if you are staying at a Disney resort. Our room was tidied every day and fresh towels were given everyday as well. I read there was a fee for this, but I didn't pay it at check out, nor did I order it in advance. Not sure what hapened there, but didn't complain. My suggestion is to shop on the way to the resort, bringing things like coffee filters and your own coffee, although they do have some you can use (pre-filled coffee in a filter), and other snacks and food items from a real store, if you plan an extended stay. All in all no complaints and we thoroughly enjoyed having the washer and dryer and apartment like accommodation!", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Il", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay \"Loved It\"\u201d", "Author": "goofymamabear", "ReviewID": "UR33557419", "Content": "We were there June 21 to 27, there was 5 adults 3 teens 1-2 year old, we had a 3 bed room villa was great more room then we needed, I am not sure what all the bad reviews were about there was always something to do from ridding a bike to playing basketball to seeing a movie by the pool, we could even get DVDS or game to play back in our room.

The kitchenette includes a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, and sink. We liked the room but there was some dust and the carpets were somewhat worn. I sat out on the porch a lot, which directly overlooked a courtyard area with benches and also one of the large waterspouts. Our room was in the Springs section, which is closest to the main pool and main building. Food at the casual Artist's Point was OK. Food at the Turf Club was excellent. There is a boat dock right behind the Turf Club, where you can catch a boat to Downtown Disney. Bus service was pretty good although, as anywhere at Disney, the buses can get crowded on occassion. Springs is the last stop. Sometimes we walked to the Paddock bus stop, which is second. The Paddock stop also is near a pool and play area, plus is has bathrooms. We enjoyed the pool and the water slides are quite fun. There is an arcade off of the pool area. One of the best perks was that there are free washers and dryers to use. There are two nice looking har-tru tennis courts, although I did not get to use them. They are near a shuffle board court and a basketball court. They play family movies each evening at 8:30 at the main pool. Found staff to be excellent in all respects. The resort is huge.

We travelled with two small children a 2 year old and a 4 year old. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express as a means of transporting us from the airport to the resort. We had 5 carry on bags that the driver of the bus took from us and put under the bottom of the bus. When we got to the hotel, I was strapping my youngest son in the stroller while my Mom was tending to my 4 year olds and maneuvering the bags. The driver dropped our bags and took off. By the time I turned around and noticed that two of my bags were not there the driver had already took off. I immediately notified the bellhop and the front desk when I checked it. I provided a description of the driver and our bags. This was 11 p.m. at night. I was given a claims number and told that at the end of the night the driver would return any bags left on the bus to lost and found. I was given a claims number to follow-up. When we reached the room I called and they had no updates. I then called again at 1 a.m. and still no updates. I was then told that I had to wait until the bags show up. One bag contained all our toiletries, diapers prescription medicines etc. The other bag contained our camcorder, digital camera my sons Nintendo DS etc. so I was very concerned that not much seem to happening in recovering my bags quickly. The next day I called numerous times and was given the same answer--no updates. I kept insisting that they need to find the driver and I was told that there is no tracking system to determine which bus they put me on and since I don't know the driver's name it would be difficult for them to figure out. At this point I went to the Saratoga Springs Concierge to speak to a manager to see if they could help me. During my discussions, I was informed that Disney Express is not a \"Disney\" Company and that I would have to work with Meers Transportation who owns and operates the Disney Express. Keep in mind that these were the same individuals who were not very helpful to begin with. I was told that they would search all the Disney properties to see if the bags show up as a first attack in handling the problem. I kept insisting why they are not looking for the driver of the bus and I repeatedly provided a description of the driver, detail information about the time we got on the bus and the stops the driver made and still no update on the driver. What should have been an exciting vacation and especially for my 4 year old because it was his first trip to Disney, turned into time spent talking on the phone repeatedly, following up with Meers and the Saratoga staff about my lost luggage with no new information on a daily basis. I arrived on a Saturday and it was not until Tuesday did I receive a phone call from someone at Meers transportation about my bag. I was called because my issue was turned over to Meers Claims Department. The gentleman I spoke with expressed surprised that the driver was not located and I again reiterated the same information that I told numerous times before. I provided him with a list of the items I had in the bag and he questioned me as to why I allowed the driver to put my bag under the bottom of the bus if I had so much valuables in there and why I didn't take it with me on the bus if I could take it as a carryon on the plane. I explained that the driver told me to put the bags under the bus so I did. The value of the stuff in both my bags was about $3,500. I did not hear from the claims department on Wednesday as I was told so Thursday afternoon I called and left a message that I was concerned since I was leaving the next day and no one called me back. I received a call back informing me that this is shared liability since I left my bag on the bus. I was also informed that the driver was located and he told them that all the bags that got on the bus got off the bus. I was also told that the driver is a veteran of the company and for all they know those bags did not get on the bus in the first place. I was horrified to be spoken to in such a manner. The claims agent went on to tell me that what they can do is provide me with $250 per bag for a total of $500 and that that amount should be enough for me to cover the deductible on my home owner's insurance. I informed him that that was unacceptable for the value of the things that I had in the bag and I was told and I quote, \"I don't know what to tell you, you might want to get a lawyer.\" I was stunned for the utter disregard for my personal property. I have already loss because the pictures of my children and my family on our camera will never be replaced but to be spoken to in such a manner was appalling. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was told that a supervisor was not available. I reported the incident to the manager on duty at the time at Saratoga Springs and I was told they would follow-up because they received a voicemail for the claims agent. Interestingly, on my return ride to the airport, I refused to put my bag under the bus and had a confrontation with the driver who informed me that I am required to put my bag under the bus because if the bags shift and hit a passenger they are liable and he could loose his job...Oh the irony because I was berated for putting my valuables under the bus by the claims agent on the one hand and told by the driver on the other hand that it is a requirement. Today is exactly two weeks since I left the Saratoga Springs hotel and I have not heard anything from anyone at Meers Transportation. Since I had recently bought into Disney vacation club, I contacted them to see if and what they can do to assist me in helping to resolve the situation. I am still waiting and I am no closer to finding out what is happening to provide compensation for my property. Needless to say, this was not an ideal vacation because of this situation. While the Saratoga Springs property is nice, I believe the staff did not handle the situation properly in helping me resolve things. I was at the mercy of whoever was the manager on duty at the time that I go to the front desk to inquire. The staff did do two things for me, we received a $50 credit on our account to help purchase necessities such as toothbrush etc in the gift shop/grocery store onsite and I was given a ride to Wal-Mart to buy some replacement for things that were lost that we needed on the trip. Disney \"sells\" the magic of what they have to offer. However, in the event that things go wrong an individual is at their own mercy. Especially in tough economic times such as these, families are making sacrifices to continue to take vacations when we do so, we expect certain standards to be met and unfortunately the Saratoga Springs (Disney) did not live up to those standards. My recommendation is to find your own means of transportation from the hotel and should you decide to stay on a Disney property be mindful that if things go wrong you could be on your own.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, FL", "Title": "\u201cDisney has gone down hill.\u201d", "Author": "NotHappywithDisney", "ReviewID": "UR32149057", "Content": "We stayed in a Studio and I think the maid thought that we were timeshare holders instead of registered guests.

In the past 2 visits to WDW, we have stayed at Old Key West Resort in a 1 B/R Unit, and this unit by itslef is equivalent to the 2 BR unit at SSR. Check in was a breeze, and at first, we were assigned to the Paddock section, but I requested for a dedicated 2 BR unit in either Congress Park (so we could get a Downtown Disney view as well as be close to a pool) or the Grandstand Section (which is the newest section). The Disney rep was very accomodating and got us into room 1611 at Congress Park...which we thought was great, but once we were allowed in the rooms at 4pm....limited view as the unit was on the 2nd floor and trees blocked your views of the pool, and could not see DD at all. We were all too tired to change, so kept the location. The positive was that it was a 15 minute walk to DD and 10 mins to the main pool if you wanted (or you can catch any bus that would come by and get dropped off at the Springs Section and just walk back). Again, the 2BR unit fit all of us ok...my wife and I and our infant took the master BR, and my brother, his wife, and 2 kids took the 2 queen beds, and my mother slept on the pull out sofa couch...which she did say was not that bad for being a pull out sleeper. Kitchen was small but had all we needed, plates, pots, pans, etc...but the biggest issue was the refrigerator....it DOES NOT have an ICE MAKER. It was HOT while we were there, mid 90's, and the only ICE MACHINE was located on the first floor, which we would fill up a small garbage bag with ice and keep it in the fridge. (when we stayed at OKW the past 2 times, we loved the fact of the ice maker!) The have a very small dining room table in the living area...which would fit 4-5 ok, but not all 8, if you were eating in the room. But the kids liked eating out on the patio and the adults ate at the table...so worked out. Rooms were fine and the beds were comfortable. Positive for Disney to provide a pack-n-play for our infant, which worked out great. The washer and dryer is a stackable...but kind of loud, so if you did laundry at nite, you can hear it in the Master BR and living areas. In regards to the bussing system, we had a rental car for the week, but mainly used the bus systems to get around the parks, which was great....I think the most we waited was 10 mins for one bus. If you are shopping for groceries, there are local stores, but I would recommend the Super Walmart, which is only about a 10 minute drive. There is a Goodings and Winn Dixie grocery stores that are alot closer, but their prices were 10-20% more...so be careful.

Unfortunately, Saratoga Springs is in the latter category, especially considering the fact that this is not a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvalue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resort. During our recent 8 day stay here, we experienced the following problems and concerns: 1) The guards at the front gate were sometimes very abrupt and were rarely welcoming. First, there seems to be a disconnect between the front desk and the guard shack such that the guards do not know if someone is arriving if they checked in online. This seems like it could be easily remedied; but unfortunately, it resulted in a bad first impression when the guard gave us a \u00e2\u20ac\u01533rd degree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on his list. Other experiences were hit or miss, but only once in the 8 days did a guard act personable and friendly towards us. 2)This was by far the noisiest resort that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is the first time that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to clearly hear conversations of our neighbors, particularly annoying since our neighbors were night owls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often up until 2 am. 3)The mattress was- lumpy and uncomfortable, with distinctive sag. 4)The room was not in typical Disney condition. Tile grout in and around the shower was dirty, and the shower curtain did not fit the entire shower door, causing ponding water (and I suppose, the dirty grout, over time). Also, carpeting was worn in some areas to the point that the tack strips underneath were poking through. 5)Housekeeping here did not live up to Disney standards. When we arrived, there were dishes in the dishwasher, there was no laundry soap, and following the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrash and tidy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 service, the housekeeper left the rear door wide open \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a security threat as we were on the first floor. 6)Dining at the resorts quick meal eatery, Artists Pallet, was a strange experience. They use video monitor menus to represent what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available, but the monitors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match what they were offering in the display cases. Also, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve developed this convoluted system whereby you place your order at the counter (with the food pre-made and ready to go), but rather than handing the food to you, you get a pager, and wait, and wait, while the staff take the food out of the case and put it on a tray. The more formal dining area is too small and books up, so unfortunately, this may be the only game in town. It was not all bad news, as the bus service at this resort works much more reliably than at other Vacation Club Resorts that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. Also, they have an excellent pool area with a water slide and night time pool side movies. However, for the cost of staying at this resort, the few bright spots do not outweigh all of the negative aspects that we encountered. We did bring our concerns to the attention of the Front Desk staff, and they promised that they would speak to the involved department supervisors. Hopefully, by the time of your stay, these issues will be remedied.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastern, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cSaratoga Springs Resort is an excellent place to come home to every night while at WDW!\u201d", "Author": "No1HotelAdvisor", "ReviewID": "UR29752180", "Content": "I have seen many reviews of this resort... both good and bad. I was a bit apprehensive about booking here, especially since this was the first time we were staying on Disney property. We booked our vacation and decided to stay in a one bedroom villa that included a king size bed with a double pull out sofa bed in the living room. Many reviewers complained about how uncomfortable the sofabed was. Has anyone actually ever comfortably slept on a sofabed??? >>> I think not! A sofabed is typically a temporary bed and should not be looked upon as being comfortable now matter where you go. Anyway, we checked into our room in the Congress Park complex with a room that overlooked Downtown Disney... all I can say is that the view is priceless! The quiet pool is looked in the middle of the four cluster of Congress Park buildings. The quiet pool means that since most families go to the big themed pool, the smaller pools are often more quiet with less kids and typically left to the adults. The pools are open 24 hours, but these hours are not advertised anywhere. The water is maintained at 83 degrees celcius which was delightful. A Disney Transportation bus stop is looked right outside of the the cluster of Congress Park buildings. Parking is excellent, whereas you can park very close to the building and do not have to worry about valet service for parking or a bellhop for luggage. The villas or rooms are like little apartments. When we checked in we did find a few housekeeping issues that needed to be taken care of. Immediately two executive housekeeping team leaders came over to see what was wrong. They not only got on top of the problems but left us \"Disney magic\" to make up for the inconvenience - animals made out of towels around the room, fast passes for rides, and other cool things. The villa was in excellent shape- the walls and paint in excellent condition, the curtains and bedding seemed new as well. The team leader was not happy with the look our of sofa and dinner table so she ordered us new ones which were delivered the next day. The carpet was a bit worn and the team leader told us that she is working on getting new carpets put into the Congress Hall rooms. She said that part of the problem is that Congress Hall is so popular that the rooms are being constantly rented and there is a lot of wear and tear, especially on the carpet. The kitchen was stocked better than my own house! Everything from pots, pans, dishes, cutting boards, tupperwear, wine glasses, toaster, coffee maker... you name it and it is there. Many people complained about the coffee and coffee maker. We asked housekeeping for extra coffee and they always left it. The coffee pack is coffee inside of an enclosed filter. The coffee was actually good. We did however find out that Disney Vacation Resort guest must pay for the coffee while hotel guests do not and can get as much as they want. The rooms, especially the bathroom, are huge! The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom is also huge and quite relaxing. Having a washer and dryer in the room was awesome and housekeeping would leave at least one box of Tide everyday to do laundry. The resort is big, but not unmanageable. It was nice to walk around the beautiful landscaped grounds. Being on the first floor, often ducks and rabbits would come up to our patio door looking for little snacks. The property has a guarded entrances run by Disney employees (not rent-a-cops) like all of the other Disney resorts. While we had our own car, Disney buses seemed to be always coming and going. The resort offers \"golf cart\" type transportation around the resort for those who have trouble walking. One of the best aspects of the resort being big was that everyone is spread out making it a great place for adults, honeymooners, couples. Even though kids are around, the size of the resort makes them seem less obvious as some of the other Disney resorts. The resort offers bike riding, horseback riding, as well as activities such as movie nights in the pool, bingo, arts and crafts, and story times. My only two complaints are that the resort convenience store and \"gift shop\" is very small in size compared to other resorts and is not open 24/7 like the other resorts. The store closes at 11pm which is inconvenient when you are coming in late from a park and want to refill your drink mug. Also, this resort does not offer room service which I did miss. They do offer pizza delivery but that is it! I hope in the future they fix these few problems. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The housekeepers did sometimes seem to \"rush\" or skip over the cleaning but all we had to do was alert housekeeping and the problems were taken care of asap! What I do not understand is the people who left reviews on here about the resort and the rooms being in disrepair, dirty, etc. If you want the problem fixed you must notify the staff immediately. Waiting until you come home or just complaining on here will not fix the situation. We had all of our problems fixed immediately after the staff was notified, and they gave us special little presents to make up for the mistakes or problem. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone... families, couples, honeymooners! Yes it is not the closest to the parks, but that is also part of the charm. You sort of remove yourself from the hype and rush of the park and return to a resort where you can relax and unwind! The other resorts around WDW might be closer to the parks or themed heavier, however, how much of the Disney theming can a person take? Coming home at night to the villa was like coming home to your own house... not a hotel room and not Mickey's, Donald's, or Goofy's house. The villas are very grown and tastefully decorated. Having a car made the trips to the parks effortless and since we were hotel guests we never paid for parking at the parks and were often allowed to park at other resort hotels parking lots without hassle. Overall- 1. Great Location- near Downtown Disney and away from the parks 2. Big, tastefully decorated villas and rooms. 3. Awesome to have a washer and dryer in the room. 4. Being able to swim at 3am after a long day in a park- PRICELESS! 5. Looking out the window to glow of the lights of Downtown Disney- also Priceless! 6. Big, wondeful jacuzzi tub in the bathroom! 7. Huge bathroom with one section have a sink and jacuzzi tub, another room having an oversized glass shower with another sink, and a third small room or water closet (toilet). 8. When you have a problem... notify the staff immediately so that the problem may be fixed or so that you may be compensated for the issue. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HOME TO COMPLAIN OR WORSE YET- COMPLAIN ONLINE (when the problem could have been fixed). This was my first time staying on Disney property and I will definitely come back to this resort again... indeed it did feel like home! \"Welcome Home!\"", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVisited twice in April, disappointed both times....\u201d", "Author": "jlmktm", "ReviewID": "UR29681306", "Content": "This review is for two different visits in April 2009. These two visits were our first and second experiences and in both cases a disappointment. We are Orlando locals and annual passholders at Disney World. From time to time we come for fun, have come with family and prior to moving to Orlando, visited the different resorts over the years. We have been Disney World regulars for 34 years and the larger the resort grows, the deterioration of not only the parks, the resorts, the customer service but the overall experience. We came the first time April 14 to 17 and had an 11 yr old young lady visiting over her spring break. We decided to give the Saratoga Springs a try. We had the two bedroom villa. The villas are a \"step down\" in quality from their original DVC villa resort, Old Key West. Old Key West is old, but the overall space is better, furniture better, but does lack some of the bells and whistles of the Saratoga. The living room furniture at Saratoga is very cheap, very uncomfortable, and for such a new resort, very damaged. Our sitting chair had a two inch slit with stuffing coming out, stained, and the housekeeping staff is terrible. Very surface cleaned. The dust was so thick on both the tv cabinets, we could write our name in the dust. The bench kitchen table and chairs was horrible. The seat cushion was held in place with velcro and when it came loose, the dust and amount of old food was gross. Had issues with the dryer while there, the kitchen floor was sticky and needed a good mopping and we discovered dirty dishes, sliverware and some cooking items that were greasy and dried food in plates and dried egg on the spatula. The outdoor patio area was very dirty with bird dropping all over the place, including the chairs. The cob webs were thick and a good broom dusting would have cured that issue. Their internet service is very SLOW.... and if you have work to do... good luck... The second visit was again for three nights, April 21 to 24. We thought we would give it another go, just in case it was a fluke. But, Saratoga Springs again proved to be a disappointment. This visit we stayed in a one bedroom because the young lady was not with us. We had the exact same experiences. Sticky kitchen floor, dirty uncomfortable furniture, unclean dishes/pots/pans, dirty outside patio, cob webs, bird mess, and again dust so thick we could write our names in it. They never seem to actually move the lamps on the end tables, just dust in front and the back of the table is thick in dust. The furniture is very stained with water marks, scratches and again cheap uncomfortable furniture. It is obvious they need some retraining of their staff on cleaning. On our first visit, we noticed there was a scatter of literature and when we called down to the front desk they had housekeeping bring up the information. When the lady showed up, she was so RUDE to us. She had a wrting tablet and when I opened the door, she never said hello, ot look up from her pad, just held out the packet. I said to her, is this everything and she grunted. After that, I kind of threw it back at her and shut the door. I was not going to allow this rude person to treat a paying guest this way. I did not ask for anything that should have already been in the room. We are not Disney Vacation Club owners, but while down at the main pool and again at our local quiet pool, we engaged with couples and both times they were DVC members. In both encounters, they expressed their disappointment in Saratoga Springs, how use to be was nice, but that Disney was not keeping it up and they shared some of the same complaints that we were experiencing. It made me glad that we were not members of the Disney Vacation Club. As annual passholders, we are offered discounts at some of resorts during the off seasons and this is a great way to experience some of the resorts. But, I will say that even with the discount, the price of the villa was not worth the rate. I would hate to be a guest paying their premium rates or DVC member and paying their rates and have such a dirty place to \"come home to\". Not my kind of \"Welcome Home\". Last fall, we stayed at the Fort Wilderness Cabins with our son and his family for five nights. We booked two cabins. Our cabin was ok, but we had issues with the sewer system. Everytime we flushed the toilet, we could smell sewage smell and it lingered in the confined bathroom. Their staff never did fix the issue and this was horrible. We also experienced issues with their internet service as well. Inconsistent, very slow. You would think that Disney could do a better job with the internet considering they charge you ten dollars per 24 hour period. They also cheat you and cut you off your internet access after about 22 hours. We had this happen again and again. We will not be going back to Saratoga Springs or the Cabins at Fort Wilderness ever again. Old Key West may be older, but sometimes newer is not always better. For the price of Saratoga and Fort Wilderness, not worth your money. There is a lot better off site at a better rate and other options on the Disney property.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean, soul-less, apartment-like complex\u201d", "Author": "Chris_Battersea", "ReviewID": "UR29240905", "Content": "I am a huge fan of Disney...they do great parks, cartoons and entertainment. However, they are not great at hotels if Saratoga Springs is the standard. If you like staying at places like Homewood Suites, Hyatt Place, Hampton Suites or Doubletree...stay there. Saratoga is a Disney-imitation of these types of properties...but more expensive. You stay for the 'convenience' of being near Disney attractions (namely, Entertainment Island and the main-street of overpriced shops/restaurants). The landscape is beautifully maintained and it looks like a suburban apartment complex. The 'theme' is loosely based on the horseracing motif...but, only loosely. Arrival is when you see the signs 'welcome home' (my home is certainly not like this one...) and you have to have your name on a check-in list to get past the rent-a-security guard. You drive up and are met with cheery international badged staff who then direct you to check in where even more friendly international badged staff give you 20 folders and an 'all purpose' Disney key card which 'unlocks' all of the Disney magic. Or rather, the ability to charge whatever Magic you purchase back to your main hotel bill! After check in...you have to either take a bus, a golf cart or walk (in April, humidity and heat is inching upwards at mid day...so, no one walks unless they are in bathing suits!) to your 'complex'. There are several small pools scattered around the 'complex'...but, the main pool is a combination of a small kids play area, fake-rock water slide, food bar/snack bar/bar and sun lounger area. It is located near the Artists Palette (shop/serve your self restaurant) and the Turf Grill (dining room). The Spa is next door to the pool/check in area. The room. It has to be said, they are well thought out with all the necessary elements to make it feel like a home/apartment away from home...lots of little touches like ironing board, kitchenette with utensils, lots of towels, etc. Spacious for a family of 4 to co-exist without feeling cramped or lacking in convenience for storage, snacking/nibbles with a mini fridge and balcony. However, the lighting in our room was a bit dark. The doors seemed to always be getting in the way of people when they were opened and the relentless air conditioning made it a noisy sleep or a humid steam bath snooze. All of the bedlinen seemed synthetic and the carpets were a bit rough and seemed to have a faint mildew (typical of carpeting in Florida) smell...which, is why cleaning fluid smells are so in evidence! The positives: clean, a bit soul-less (like an apartment complex), well landscaped, frequent transport to all important places/sights/parks/etc, and very friendly staff. The downsides: the all pervasive smell of chlorine from the pools and cleaning fluids, the rooms are not that comfortable, and the expense. Disney is not cheap! Who is it perfect for? American families of 3 or 4...who, all seem to have an enormous quantity of baggage and child-care equipment...buggies, bags, push chairs, backpacks, etc. Plus, Americans seem more used to the 'apartment' style hotels than Europeans...do you bring towels to the pool, or get them there? Can you wear flip flops to dinner? Where do you get microwave popcorn at midnight if you haven't brought your own? (all real questions i overheard at the front desk). You get towels at the pool, yes you can wear flip flops (sandals) and the Artists Palette sells micro-pop till closing (at 11pm). If you drive to Disney, and want a week with space for all of your equipment, and if you enjoy kiddie-friendly pools for the 3 - 10 year old age group...this is the place to come with friends and family. It is not a 'hotel' per se...more of an apartment-hotel complex located conveniently for more restaurants and shops than the theme parks. As I said, I am a huge fan of Disney - but, won't be returning to the Saratoga Springs. The Grand Floridian is the place to stay if you want to splurge 'on property' of Disney...otherwise, stay at one of the more dedicated professional hotels outside the park and save your money for food/drink and souvenirs in park.

I dunno, it's Disney's job to fix it, not mine :) Pool is undergoing renovation. No big, luckily I don't have kids. DVC tells you that pool hopping is just fine and dandy and then you get a list of all the places you're not allowed to hop too and all the times you can't hop. Not that they have any idea who is staying where but it's kinda silly. The quick service food at this place SUCKED. That's probably more of a personal thing because I didn't like the taste, not that it was necessarily bad. Saratoga also is a \"New York State\" themed resort so it has a tendency to attract New York city residents (why would you go on vacation only to stay at a place that reminds you of home?). Generally people from the midwest, like us, need a little more personal space and we're generally a little softer in our personal interactions with each other. Take this with a grain of salt it's completely my own opinion, but not every character at Disney is hired by them :) Minor stuff.

Our 2 bedroom villa was nothing less than disgusting. The window sills were rotted, the carpet looked like the original one that was installed whenever this place was built (worn, pulls, stains, lumps - we wouldn't even take our shoes off) and overall the place was musty smelling and dingy. But we got off easy - my inlaws had the same dingy-ness with an added sour milk smell. We REALLY should have complained but just sucked it up. Believe me, my letter is going out in the mail today. Also, upon check-in, we were notified that the main pool was closed for refurbishment -- I have 4 young children and spending a day or 2 at the pool is just as important as going to the parks, so this was devastating to us and to my kids. There was no notification given to us of this prior to our arrival. So instead, we had to use the pool by our unit - which was a very basic pool - no slides, no snack bars, no drinks - nada. Very boring. Totally not what I have in mind for a vacation. We were in Congress Park, so if you needed anything from the store it was a 10 minute walk. Really not convenient. Considering this was our first visit using our vacation points, it really makes me nervous of what is to come. I hope this was not an indication of what the resort that we joined (Animal Kingdom Lodge) is going to be like.

Great location very close to Downtown Disney (which is why I chose it) boat or a 10 minute walk. One main pool full of little excited children but other pools dotted about so you can swim.

The maids were great we left in chaos most mornings at 7.15am and when we got back all was tidy. I found the front desk and concierge very good and we could even get checked in etc through to the UK as we flew with North West. If they said they would do something they did it and on time. We rarely ate at the hotel but the night we did the food and service was very good but we had to wait an age as it was too cold to sit outside and that was half the table space. The Artists Palette provided basics for breakfast but I agree they could do more with this as there are people who spend time at the property not all day in the parks as we did.

This resort is directly across the water from Downtown Disney so the rooms that face that area, really have a beautiful view at night. There are so many pretty areas to this resort, you have ponds with water fountains and then there were areas that surround the golf course. I traveled with my parents and my 6 year old son. We rented a 2 bedroom villa that faced a nice courtyard that overlooked one of the ponds...very relaxing. This resort really worked well for my parents since they choose not to go to the parks every day. My son even talked Grandpa into riding bikes around the resort one day and they both came back and said how pretty it was. We were there during a busy time but you never felt crowded. I'm sure the weather played into that alittle bit. We had weather that ranged from mid 70s to high 60s, so the pool area wasn't that crowded. We did use the main pool 2 of the days and it really is a nice pool. My son said it was one of his favorite slides. We have stayed at Animal Kingdom as well as Port Orleans Riverside and visited Port Orleans French Quarter as well as Caribbean Beach for swimming. The resort really is nice with kids...tons of things going on all day with the staff and they also have movies at night for the kids by the pool. This resort also has a kids club if you would like to have some adult time...I did not utilize this but in talking with some of the guests...it was rated highly, they said the staff was great with the kids and had alot of things for them to do. Overall, I would not hesitate to come back to this resort. I'm glad I had the opportunity to stay here because it changed my opinion of this resort.

We are not part of the DVC, but continue to stay here - because why mess with a good thing! This year we stayed in a 1BR unit and my inlaws stayed in the studio. Well, they were adjoining rooms so with the door open it was the EXACT same room as a 2BR unit. So booking a 2BR unit would have been much cheaper in the end (and it also defeated our purpose of having separate rooms, but I digress....). This is the first year that I found the carpets to be a little worn, but everything else was great. The room was spotless, linens were fresh and clean and all the dishes/flatware were clean. Housekeeping ran the dishwasher for us each day and always brought new toiletries and detergent, even if we had not used them up. The grounds, like all of Disney, are very well maintained and spotless. I really wish they had a central room to get on a computer and check email. I would think that would be a no braine for a vacation club resort. You can have internet in your room if you bring your laptop and pay the daily fee for the cord (no wireless), but no common computer area. No words can describe the convenience of having a washer/dryer in the room, especially now that the airlines are starting to charge for luggage checks. I packed for myself and two childern in one suitcase and simply threw in a load of laundry every night. The week we were there were the coldest days in the history of Orlando. Just my luck! So we never got to use the pool. But I assume it was heated because some crazy families were still in the water. Our room in the Springs building was conveniently located to the pool, main building and restaurants. The Grandstand building also has its own, less crowded pool which is lovely in warmer weather. Springs is the building to request if you dont want to walk much around this VERY large property. Grandstand is good too because there is a path that cuts across to the main area. The other buildings are a longer walk, but also quieter. The Disney bus system is often scrutinized in reviews, no matter what hotel it is. It's not a personal limo service, people! The bottom line is that they come APPROX ever 20 mins. It could be a little more at certain times. If you just missed one by minutes, then you will obviously wait a longer time. There were times we waited 3 minutes and times we waited 20 mins. It is what it is. The buses are clean, direct and they save you money on car rental/parking and time. Even if you have a car, I recommend using the bus for the Magic Kingdom because it takes you directly to the main gate (as opposed to parking, taking the parking lot tram, going through gate 1, taking the monorail and then finally getting to the main gate) which is SO much easier. There are 5 bus stops within the SS so those stops adds a few minutes to the ride. The buses stop at them in the same order, so if you have 2 stops going toward the park, you'll always have 3 coming back in. The water taxi and walking path to downtown Disney are great. the water taxi lets you off on the marketplace end of downtown disney and the path take you to the west side of downtown disney. So if you are going to a specific restaurant, keep that in mind. General Disney tip - try to make as many of your meal reservations in advance if you can. 407-WDW-DINE does the restaurants in the parks as well as others on Disney property, including the Turf Cub at Saratoga Springs and the Downtown Disney locations. Going \"standby\" at restaurants will make things much longer and frustrating. The Artist's Palette is okay. Service was slow during busy times but the food and the variety are both pretty good. They sell some essential groceries at the expected Disney markup prices. If you have a car, there is a Winn Dixie about 5 mins away. Turf Club was very good and I recommend taking advantage of it, especially after a busy day at a park when you don't want to be out walking and dealing with lines anymore. If you have a baby, the rooms come with a high chair and pack and play so you don'tneed to request them. Next year I am thinkng of trying the Old Key West, just to mix it up a little. But I am nervous to make that move because SS has always been so great for us. Having a separate bedroom for the kids makes a world of difference at night. When doing your research here, you need to remember to compare SS against other Disney resorts, NOT against a typical 5 star resort. I really feel that some reviewers here were expecting the Ritz Carton based on the price of this resort and are then let down. This is a pricier Disney location because it is better than OTHER DISNEY resorts. Try to keep the perspective.

Usually, I research and book trips, but this time a family member had his secretary do everything. She picked Saratoga Springs. We had a very nice time. Spacious rooms, 3 tv's for 3 areas. very nice tub with jacuzzi in master. Nice kitchen with microwave etc.. I liked the aspect of having a washer and dryer, and I liked the fact that we had maid service every day. Since I did not do the research, I cannot completely criticize. When I book a resort for a family vacation. I book a room that is near the shuttle, near the pool, and absolutely includes a breakfast. We did not have these options. Again, I don't want to write an unfair review, because I know there was some type of meal plan, we did not have the meal plan on our trip. So we were far from the shuttles, (got off at the wrong stop and wandered around for 40 minutes one night, all fourteen of us, we were far from the pool, we were far from the store and restaurants. Again, not the resorts fault, our secretary did not ask the right questions. We stayed at Congress Park. And the shuttles were quite slow in the mornings. Now, having said that, the rooms were nice and clean, with everything replenished every day. Except, sadly, my daughter's 50 dollar visa gift card was stolen from room by maid service. I didn't report it, since she should not have left it out, but other than that, no complaints. We had no proof about the gift card and like I said, I just let it go. The resort was clean and quiet. I never saw the pool. If we had stayed in a section, closer to the shuttle, restaurants and pool, then....that would have been great. Also, they screwed up our return to the airport and we did waste over one hour of our time and came close to missing our flight. they were supposed to print out boarding passes right at the lobby,( a wonderful service to make the airport transition smooth) but after waiting and waiting, they finally admitted their system was down, and they could not print out the passes and by then the airport shuttle was gone. When my husband spoke to a woman named Anne, she told him to go and get a taxi yourself. ( 3 or 4 taxis we were supposed to pay for ourselves.) He got angry and said with a mountain of luggage (fourteen people's worth) how were we supposed to go and hail a taxi and lug the luggage (again) and Anne said if you had fourteen people we should be able to handle it. (Very rude and none of her business) She did not know the ages and health restrictions of our family members. However, after much ado, they rectified the mess by sending us our own huge bus and got us to the airport where we all got in yet another line and got our boarding passes.

They more then made up for the hassle of taking 3 hours to book. We got upgraded to a one bedroom suite!!! It was beautiful. We stayed in the Congress which was quite a bit away from the main pool, but super close to Downtown Disney. We could walk there in 3 minutes along the path behind our Building. Instead of waiting at the Congress bus stop for buses that took long, we walked 3 minutes to Downtown Disney stop and got on a bus ususally right away. So we figured a way around the bus issues. We felt at home at the resort. The first day we got there we stayed at the main pool all day. We loved it!!! Do yourself a favor and don't poop yourself out right away going to all the parks, get some R&R at the Resort. They won't disappoint!!!! Ride the surrey bikes, its a nice ride on beautiful grounds. The only thing that may have gotten a little old is the Artist Palette restaurant. The menu was small and never hardly changed. Wished they would have had more of a variety.

Our biggest regret was not leaving more time for staying at the resort. If you are going to pay the money, then save some time to enjoy it. We were too busy on the run from park to park that we only used the pools late at night, didn't get to use the spa at all, and had to use up several left over meals from our meal plan as we were checking out. This resort is awesome. Staff was friendly. Housekeeping very efficient and really paid attention to details. Pools were fantastic and hot tubs were very warm and relaxing. The steak house on site was high priced, but with our Disney meal plan, we only paid tips. The hotel also had a quick store and counter service again that was priced a little high, but our Disney meal plan covered it. We actually took a little boat over to Downtown Disney which was easy and relaxing. We had a one bedroom suite, which had a full kitchen, dishwasher, washer/dryer, huge garden tub, and separate shower area. The king size bed was very comfortable and cozy. The blinds really darkened the room so much that we never made it to any early entry hours at the parks. We did well to get up and out by noon since the room was so great after long nights at the parks. Busing to the parks came quickly although they were very, very cold even in August. The overall feel and grounds were so relaxing. It sits on a golf course itself and my son was able to walk over to the golf range. We have only ever stayed at the Sports hotel and did return to it in October. I was miserable there after staying at Saratoga Springs. We even came back to S.S. on our last day to eat and swim a bit before leaving. My son works at Magic Kingdom and we are returning again in December. i can't afford S. S. on this round even with his discount due to Christmas, but I have to say after staying at both I would rather stay at a not Disney hotel then to return to the Sports hotel on Disney. Saratoga was so close to Downtown Disney and easy to get to when leaving for groceries or shopping or to get my son at his apartment. The Sports hotel took so long to get to and was very inconvenient. We are actually going to try the Vista Palace this time based on reviews at Trip Advisor. Our family had lots of good memories from this resort that will last a lifetime. If you can afford it or can get a discount on one of the sites, you will be pleasantly surprised.

We had the groceries delivered by garden grocer-very convenient, a little pricey.

Pros: kitchen, large tub, and extra space; Mousekeeping was great. My kids LOVE the main pool. Grounds are lovely, and my kids loved walking around with all the fountains. Got area requested (Springs) and was very close to bus stop. Cons: the room had some wear and tear-- minimal, but when you are paying through the nose, you do notice the wear on the carpet and the stain on the couch (actually, the couch in the living room was just all around bad). I stressed a lot about transportation based on previous reviews but it turned out fine. My parents had one 40-minute wait for a bus to Downtown Disney (disability limits my dad's walking) and we had one other long wait for Disney's Hollywood Studios. Otherwise, we had very good luck with buses. They run VERY FREQUENTLY in the early morning, and I do suggest anyone with small kids get to the park before the park opens-- no lines for a couple hours. You get a lot done.

My husband and I stayed in a studio from 9/14/08 thru 9/21/08. Overall our review of the hotel is good, not great. If you like a casual laid back open air style hotel than you will like this. The outside of the buildings are very pretty. This resort has many buildings so if you are in DVC or a timeshare exchange and you are looking to stay at Disney chances are they will have spots here first over the Beach Club, Yahct Club, Boarwalk or Animal Kingdom Villas. So if this what you can get, than I would go. It is on the Disney bus line, you have all of the standard ammenities etc. So I wanted to provide some critiques below that will help you understand why I thought it was good not great and why next time we would go to another resort. My only complaint about the room was that the toilet stunk, there was an offensive smell that came through the toilet. Also our extra set of blankets and sheets didn't look and smell very clean. The main pool area is cool. It has many nooks and crannies and a water slide, plus plenty of chairs to sit out. Another great feature was the laundry room right near the pool that is free of charge to resrot guests. I went to the pool mid way through our stay did a load of laundry and didn't feel like I was doing chores it because I was right back out at the pool in no time. We ate lunch at the turf club one day, it wasn't anything special but the food was good. If you want to buy your groceries from the Artist Palete you can, but do know they have a limited selection, I would recommend ordering from garden grocer. We used them and they delivered our groceries (which the bell station held until we got there) before we even arrived and they left me a couple messages to let me know they were on there way and that if we were in the room they would bring it to us. We went to other hotels to look around while we were here and the more compact styles (all in one big block of hotels) of the Yacht and Beach Club were preferrable to us. Saratoga Springs is one of the farthest from the parks (for an on-Disney property). We stayed in the Paddock (one of major blocks of hotels). Very nice outside, we were near to the quiet pool, which is just a regular square pool. We were a 5 min walk from the main building. A good tip is that there are several bus stops within Saratoga Springs, So take the estimates in times to the park and add a few minutes for travel through the resort.

This resort is absolutely huge. I suggest doing your homework before you arrive so that you can request the area you would like to stay in. We requested the Springs section of the hotel because it is the closest to the main pool, lobby, and restaurants. However, if you are looking to have a view of Downtown Disney you will want to stay in other sections of the hotel that are considerably further away from the main areas. I've read other reviews and have seen plenty of complaints about the size of the resort and the distance from the main lobby some of the sections are. My response to that is...if you are lazy and do not like to walk then Disney probably isn't the place for you anyway. The grounds are beautiful, there are plenty of benches along the way, and even a few times a nice employee will offer you a ride on their golf cart. My family was there during Tropical Storm Fay so we did not get to explore as much as we would have had it not been raining every day. There is a walkway from the resort to Downtown Disney as well as a boat shuttle launch; neither of which we got to take advantage of. As far as dining options go, they are pretty limited here. There is a small food court type area that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We ate breakfast here almost every morning and have no complaints. If you are looking for a quick meal and not some big, fancy sit down then this place does the trick. We did not eat lunch or dinner at the resort but did have a late night snack one night which was tasty. There is also a lounge area and full service restaurant. This was the only dissappointment...there is not an actual bar. There is only a walk up bar window and seating area with a pool table and small tv. If you want to relax at a bar I would go elsewhere. Port Orleans Riverside...which is only a boat ride away, has a nice lounge with a piano player and more upbeat atmosphere. I cannot fully comment on the pool area because, as I said, it rained every day. However, it did look nice. The slide looks fun for kids and there is a large hot tub and pool bar for adults.

Spacious villa with in room laundry, daily maid service for non DVC guests, Jacuzzi, stand-up shower, 2 TVs, full, kitchen, sofa sleeper, pack & play crib, ironing board/iron, vacumn, king bed and balcony.

I stayed there almost two weeks beginning on Aug. 3rd 2008 with my Husband, our Son and my younger Sister. We were greeted at the front gate by security which already had our info and welcomed us \"Home.\" This immediately put me at ease and ensured that the kids could do their own adventure seeking while on the grounds! We checked in with no wait and were greeted by friendly \"cast members\" whom made the process extremely simple and fun for the kids. I was impressed at how much Disney trivia the cast members put into our brief encounter. Ex. There are over 30 thousand rooms at the WDW Resort and it would cost a few million dollars and over 90 yrs. to stay in each of them! Before we left the front desk, my Husband was given a \"Happy Birthday\" button which would prove to be his ticket to spontaneous greetings and even a song or two throughout the WDW resort and parks ! We were delighted to find a kitchenette in our \"studio\" supplied with a microwave, refrigerator, toaster etc. and it was nice to have coffee already in our room the next morning. The \"Studio\" is decorated in traditional New York Style with a few \"Hidden Mickeys\", if you look closely! We also had a nice balcony to sit on in the mornings and watch the golfers as they made their morning rounds. The studio proved to have ample space for 4 people and we liked that we could iron our clothes in the powder room while someone showered in the adjacent bath. Maintenance and Housekeeping were friendly and accommodation. In fact, we requested maintenance while we were there and they had someone out and the problem addressed in minutes. They didn't even enter our room to fix the minor mishap, and truthfully I had almost forgotten about it ! The pool area was fun and the kids spent every extra minute in the water or playing in the water features which I too joined in on the fun once or twice myself ! My Husband liked that he could sit at the lounge which was right at the pool and I liked the extremely convenient laundry facility which was located in the pool house. I could watch my shows while the laundry was going, (free of charge of course) and watch the kids in the pool area just in front of the building. There are also house phones around every corner if you need to call housekeeping or your room while you are out on the property, and I ended up using them a time or two when we forgot sunscreen or needed Disney info from the front desk. I had wondered if we should take the Disney (bus) transportation because it was said to be a long ride during busy seasons. However, the bus stop was a quick walk from our building and the buses ran literally every few minutes. We rode the bus to the Magic Kingdom on the first day, and went straight there with little or no wait. In fact, we drove to Typhoon Lagoon on the last day we were there, and I wished we had ridden on the bus after we parked and walked to the entrance ! I also would like to mention the resorts restaurant, \"The Artists Palette\" and gift shop, which were top notch in traditional Disney standards ! Be sure to buy a resort mug and get the free refills ! The resort also offered great activities for the kids each day we were there and Disney movies for the entire family at night in the main hall, so between visiting the parks and enjoying the resort, we never ran out of fun things to see and do ! Oh, and don't forget to rent one of the \"family bikes\" as we called them so that you can cruise the entire resort and see all that it has to offer ! There are beautiful pools and playgrounds all over the resort, not to mention that its within walking distance of \"Downtown Disney\". If you have the time, the SSR Spa comes highly recommended and there are pkgs for any one on any budget ! Anyway, I am giving this resort the thumbs up ! It was relaxing and fun and was truly a place to call \"Home\" and I for one will certainly be \"going back home\" when we visit next spring !!! I Hope this was helpful, Anecia from TN P.S. I have so many beautiful picks of the resort, but haven't had a minute to upload them since we got home! I will be sure to ad pics next time !

We stayed in a 'Studio' which had one bed and fold-out sleeper sofa. Our room was spotless and very comfortable, but it was not a large room when occupied by 4 people. Our two young daughters slept on the sofa bed and said it was comfortable. Honestly, we didn't spend alot of time in our room (I mean, this is Disney!), but after a long day at the parks we slept very comfortably here. The kitchenette area was very nice with everything we needed to keep/make snacks in the room. The balcony overlooked the water and we loved feeding the ducks that would run over whenever we went out there to enjoy the pretty water view. We found the grounds to be beautiful, clean, and did not have any problems getting around the resort. But these Disney resorts can be large - you will have to walk. If that's a problem, then consider a different resort/hotel. We thought the main pool was terrific with it's faux stone & waterfall, creating a pleasant grotto feel, and our girls loved the waterslide. The lifeguards were attentive and there were pool games led by a cast member that kept the kids happily occupied while we enjoyed relaxing with drinks from the poolside bar. The cafeteria style restaurant was clean with typical Disney breakfast fare and we found the staff there to be nice, though admittedly a tad slow (but I'm a New Yorker so 'slow' is a relative term). One of my absolute favorite things about this resort was the water taxi to Downtown Disney. It was so convenient, and such a pleasant way to get somewhere after the hustle-bustle and crowds on the busses. With DD just across the waterway we had tons of dinner options and the water taxi was such a relaxing trip. The only negative thing I can possibly say about Saratoga Springs is to agree with some other posts that the waits for the bus could get very long (upwards of 40 minutes). If you are planning to use the bus to get to a dinner reservation at a park or another resort, you may need 1-1 1/2 hours to get there (no kidding). But even knowing that now, I would still definitely return to SS and stay there again.

They found out that the bell person delivered it somewhere else even though we specified the room because we initially changed rooms because we were placed in a room with a view of the parking lot. It was a looong walk to the main desk from our congress park hotel room and we actually took a bus to get to the pool if our blistery, tired feet coudn't handle it at the end of a park day. That was when the bus came. It was repeatedly about every 40 minutes or so even though the cast members always told us that they come every 20 minutes. Then we finally found out that there is a new gps system on the bus routes and they are 'working out the kinks'. Get to the buses early if you want to get to a park when it opens!! Many other guests were complaining too. So the hotel is too spread out. The decor is nice but nothing that stands out. The layout of the rooms are really strange. The first night I wound up in the closet, knocking over the ironing board on my way to the toilet. Bring a nightlight! Seriously, check out the layout of the bathroom and its odd shape/3 doors. The good thing is that every time you complain they give you a fast pass. We had so many that we couldn't use them all so we wound up giving them away in the parks!

We are glad we were able to use points, due to the nightly rate at this location being very high. Check in went very well, with our Castmember providing us with some great tips for picking up the bus system. We stayed in a studio (room 5412) in Progress park. Room was very spacious with a mini fridge and microwave and wet bar. The bath was an average hotel size, nice space at the outside sink area with a standard tub and commode in a separate room. This was nice as I would continue to get ready while hubby was taking shower etc. After reading reviews of bus waits I was expecting terrible lengths, but we must of had luck with us because we waiting no more than 10 minutes at any given time. We had all intentions of accomplishing Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and MGM, but only got to MK due to other persuits. If hitting the parks I would recommend visiting touringplans.com. We used thier itinerary while at MK and followed it to a tee. We walked right on to alot of rides and had not more than a 20 minute wait at some of the more popular rides (haunted mansion) The resort is within walking distance of Downtown Disney, but it's not a short walk and a little confusing making your way there. We only walked there one evening for dinner at the Rainforest Cafe. Note: no reservations available at this restaurant and it's quite busy. Since there were only 2 of us we quickly got seats at the bar. I would suggest taking the water taxi (shuts down at 11pm) bus system or a cab from the front of the resort. It's much quicker and will get you there. I would definately recommend the House of Blues Gospel Brunch on Sundays at Downtown Disney. It was a fantastic show and the food, which consisted of breakfast items as well as (southern) lunch was equally as tasty. I can't say enough. This is very popular so I purchased tickets early, which granted us a great seats in the \"pit\". There is a 10:30am and 1pm shows, but get there early. I suggest having someone in your party stand in the will call line and another in your party standing in the restaurant line. Both lines get long fast so make sure you are there at least 15 to 20min before the show starts. Since we purchased tickets with the \"and more\" feature we also visited Disney Quest. This is really just a large video arcade. Both hubby and I didn't do well with the virtual reality games, it made us queasy. So we made our way through each floor then headed off. Start at the ground floor then use the elevators or stairs to make your way up. I could see where this place is fun for kids and although I love video games it was really too loud for us. Maybe we are getting to old!! :-) The resort was very quite, we had no issues with loud families. Although I think folks should be more considerate with thier strollers on the buses. But we didn't use the pools or restaurant on the property. There is a supermarket and restaurants out the back entrance of the property. The market is open 24 hours which is nice for late night ice cream runs. This is a great location for familys that need a little more space to spread out.

We ended up staying there for the first time in May 2007. We weren't too thrilled about the idea of staying there since we had read it wasn't as themed as other Disney resorts, but all of the other deluxe resort villas seemed to be booked. We were more than pleasantly surprised! The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very, very clean and the furnishings seemed new. Housekeeping left us \"towel art\" of ducks in our room, which was a very nice touch. We paid for a regular view, but were put in a studio villa that faced a lake that leads to Downtown Disney. It was very pretty seeing Downtown Disney all lit up at night from our room. It was also nice to be able to walk there from our room in just a few minutes. The whole resort is pleasant and classy. The grounds are pretty and very well-kept. The pool is a very good size and is quite nice. Playing bingo by the pool with a cold drink from the pool bar was enjoyable. The quick service eatery, The Artist's Palette, is probably the best quick service I've tried at Walt Disney World. The food is sitdown restaurant quality at a lesser price and is fast. The Turf Club, the resort's sitdown table-service restaurant, has amazing food. I'd reccommend their Angus-chuck burger, onion rings, and blackberry lemonade in particular! The resort does have a nice arcade and a spa, too. We did not go to the spa, however. One of the great things about this resort is that it's very large and thus not seemingly crowded. Of all of the resorts I've stayed at at Walt Disney World, this one is definitely the most peaceful. We have never had a problem with noisy kids or anything at Saratoga Springs. We usually feel like we're the only couple in the whole resort when we stay. I think the rooms must have great soundproof walls because we never heard our neighbors. The only possible negatives about this resort is that it can be a long trip to some of the theme parks, and the resort is quite large so you may be in a building that is far from the lobby/shop/restaurants or from the bus stops. If you're renting a car, it'll be a snap, though. It's right next to Downtown Disney, as I've said, and that's a plus for some people. Also, the resort does not offer room service, so that can be a little inconvenient for some people. I do wish the resort was more themed. There are statues of horses here and there, but mostly it's pretty plain. It is beautiful though-- don't get me wrong. Just not as themed for a deluxe Disney resort. Kids or people really wanting a \"Disney character\" feel might be disappointed. Adults and teens will most likely appreciate the victorian surroundings.

We chose the Disney Saratoga Springs Resort (DSSR) somewhat at the last minute and were only interested in a 2-BR villa as my parents were going to be staying with us. By the time we booked, the DSSR was one of the last 2-BR villa resorts available. We read the TripAdvisor site and most bloggers said they enjoyed the DSSR as it was one of the newest ones on Disney Property. Why I gave it a 2-star rating. Essentially this reflects what I believe a poor value for the dollar. You are staying at a high end Disney resort and for this money I expect nearly everything to be perfect. My step-mom is a long time Disney fan and has spent time all over the park for the last 20 years. Even she was disappointed in the quality. The good and the bad: 1. Checkin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great staff and friendly people. All willing to help and quick with a smile. Our flight arrived from EWR to MCO at 1030 and even though checkin isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t officially until 1600, we were in our room by noon. 2. Room: All seemed in order but on closer inspection the bathrooms were not quite up to par. My step-mom is a self-proclaimed Ms Diznee and has stayed extensively at multiple Diznee resorts for the last 20 years. She even commented that the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upto normal Diznee standards for cleanliness. While generally clean and new, the room was not completely serviced (stocked with soaps and toiletries) when we checked in. Also noticed the bathrooms (both) appeared to be quickly cleaned up, but not the usual Disney quality that most have come to expect (i.e. hair on floor and toothpaste gobs on one of the curio shelves in the Master Bath). Since we were an early check in, it is possible that the maid-staff hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completed their Quality Control check. Tough to tell. 3. Carpet in villa noticeably worn in the traffic pattern areas. 4. Landscaping and common grounds absolutely manicured and post card perfect. 5. Main Pool w/water slide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was the only pool we visited all week. For the most part we liked it and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my 3 year old off the big slide. She loved it. We did notice the table and chairs area weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as well kept as they should have been (Tues AM: found torn up, half used, ketchup wrappers under table and a moderate level of grime on the table top from the day prior. Wed: again, grimy table and half of a broken up blueberry muffin under the table). For $500+/nite the pool deck and accessories should be spotless. a. Note: Waterslides not operational until Life Guards on duty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10AM b. Very family friendly pool with a beach-style shallow water entrance and Donald Duck sprinkler pad that has water squirting up from the ground. c. Pool water extremely comfortable even for my wife the freeze baby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would say 80-85 degrees F. Quite nice. d. Showers in both the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathrooms are a nice feature, unfortunately, both were out of soap. While not a big deal, for this level of resort, I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go around asking for someone to refill the dispensers. Know what I mean? 6. Great fitness center and spa.

I have extensive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153road warrior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience at all different levels of hotels and generally feel DSSR had a few mis-steps that you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally encounter at comparable high priced hotels/resorts.

Poor bell service and bus service.\u201d", "Author": "rgoel", "ReviewID": "UR15548070", "Content": "SUMMARY: Overall, we had a great one-week vacation staying in a 3-bedroom grand villa at Saratoga Springs. We were 6 adults and two kids, and the 3-bdrm villa was very comfortable and spacious for us. We could have had a couple more people with us, and we would have been fine. But they advertise a 12-person max for this type of room, and 12 would have been a bit too much. We had huge windows overlooking the beautiful lake and Downtown Disney from all the rooms, high ceilings in the family room, a dining room big enough for everyone, a kitchenette with all the utensils we needed, a dishwasher, a fridge, a stove, a laundry with supplied detergent. It really did feel like home for the week we were there, and we'd even find ourselves saying things like \"alright kids, time to head home\" at the end of the day spent at the theme parks. The service, including cleaning, was great overall. SIZE OF PROPERTY: A lot of people complain about the fact that Saratoga Springs is such a huge sprawling place that it takes 15 minutes to walk from your room to the central registration/lobby/dining/pool area. Well, that's true I suppose, but for me that was part of the charm. By making the place so spread out with many separate buildings, guests are living in a more natural setting, with trees and walkways and landscaping surrounding every building, and each building having only 4 floors and holding about 50 rooms total. Feels more like home. Contrast that to a mega-Hilton-like-tower with 100 floors and 2000 rooms, where you never have to step outside to get from one place to another ... just take the elevator. It all depends on your personal preference I suppose, but I really liked the Saratoga setting. Besides, each of the five different sections of Saratoga Springs has their own swimming pool and their own bus stop, so you very rarely ever need to go to the central registration area anyway. In the entire time I was there, I was only at the central area 4 times -- once when we first arrived and checked-in after which bell services gave us a golf-cart ride to our room, once to buy a couple of groceries at the Artist Palette (I walked), once to visit the larger main swimming pool (we walked), and once at the end of our stay to catch the Magical Express to the airport (bell services gave us a ride in their golf-cart). But really, you can get away without ever needing to walk to the lobby, and nearly all questions or other needs can be taken care of over the phone. And the auxiliary pools, though smaller and without water slides, are just as nice and less crowded. THEME PARK BUS SERVICE: The bus service to the theme parks was mostly great, but spotty a couple of times. They advertise that the buses run every 20 minutes, so theoretically your max wait time should be 20 minutes. We used the bus *a lot*. We had different people in our group coming and going at different times, and we'd also frequently make two separate trips to the theme park in the same day (coming back to our room mid-day for a nap). Most of the time, I think we got really lucky and waited 0-10 minutes for the bus to arrive. But over the course of the week, there were a few cases where people in our party had to wait more than 30 minutes for the bus to show up, which was frustrating. In any given roundtrip from your room to a theme park, there are a total of 6 stops on the route -- one at the theme park itself, and one at each of the 5 different sections of Saratoga Springs. But each stop takes just a couple minutes max. The bus ride itself lasts about 20 minutes for Magic Kingdom, and 10-15 minutes to the other parks. In total, plan on needing about 35 minutes on average to get from your room to the theme park, or vice-versa. And in some rare cases, recognize that it could take up to 50 minutes. If you factor this into your planning, you won't be disappointed with the bus service. Some of the newer buses, with their wider doors and wider aisles, are more stroller-friendly than the older buses, but you never know which kind of bus you're going to get. If you have an small umbrella stroller, it's no problem at all. If you have a larger stroller that doesn't collapse as compactly (like us), then it's definitely trickier and you need a dedicated person (someone who can lift the stroller completely over his head if necessary) to deal with the stroller and nothing else. And sometimes those buses get packed to the limit, where even the aisles are completely full with standing people. In that case, a large stroller is going to use up as much space as one person would, but that's okay. Lots of people like us do take their larger strollers for comfort reasons (they recline, and have sunshades, storage baskets, and trays, etc.), and so you'll never be the only one on the bus with a large stroller. We don't regret our decision to take our large stroller with us everywhere we went; it was a lifesaver. MAGICAL EXPRESS: The Disney's Magical Express service is not quite as magical as it sounds, and I'm convinced nobody would use it if it weren't for the fact that it's free. When we arrived in Orlando after our very long journey, we waited 20 minutes for the bus to arrive, then they loaded us onto the bus where we waited another 30 minutes just sitting there, and then it was a 30-minute ride to Saratoga Springs including a stop at another resort along the way. (I'd hate to be one of those families staying in a resort located at the end of the route ... that would suck having to sit through stops at all the other resorts.) Our suitcases didn't arrive at our room until six hours later, although I don't know if that was our airline's fault or Disney's fault. At the end of your stay, they make you board the bus a full 3 hours before your flight time, and if you want to check your luggage and get your boarding passes directly at Saratoga Springs rather than hauling your luggage to the airport yourself and checking in there, then you had better get to the main desk at least 3.5 hours before flight time. For folks with early flights, this can be a real pain. Which leads me to the bell service ... BELL SERVICE We had way more trouble than I expected with the bell service on the way out. Firstly, you have to call and schedule the bell service to come pick up your luggage a full 24 hours before the scheduled pick-up time. (I guess that's a side-effect of the property being so sprawling.) But we didn't know about that, so we called a mere 12 hours before scheduled departure time (good thing we called in advance at all ... I'm accustomed to being able to just call them up right when you need them), and were told that bell services were booked up at our desired time, so we had to settle for even earlier checkout time than we had planned for (so now, some people in our party are scheduled to leave the room *4* hours before flight time). Even with that advance reservation, bell services didn't show up, and after 15 minutes had gone by, I called to find out what's going on and the dispatcher was confused as to why nobody had shown up yet, and she said she would send somebody out right away. Five minutes later, somebody showed up. Okay fine, I can forgive one screw-up. But then, the second group of people in our room, who had a different flight schedule and a separate reservation for bell services, had the same problem! Bell services again just didn't show up at the scheduled time! I called up and the same dispatcher woman was like \"Um, I thought we already picked up your luggage an hour ago\". I politely explained that that was for a different group of people, and that we had clearly made 3 separate bell services reservations the day before. \"Oh, okay, sorry about that, we'll send someone out right away.\". Sheesh, I expected better than this. Because of the bell services screw-up, we didn't have time to check our luggage and get boarding passes at the resort itself, and we almost even missed the bus entirely. GROCERIES: This isn't really a Saratoga-specific issue ... it's more of a Disney-wide issue. If you have a room with a kitchenette, it's definitely in your interest to have breakfast and possibly even some light meals or snacks in your room. It saves time and money, and is less stressful than eating out all the time, especially with a bigger group. The problem is that there are zero good options for getting groceries if you don't have access to a car, and I think we looked at all the available options. * GardenGrocer.com offers grocery delivery to Disney resorts for a small fee, but the folks there are unreliable and unresponsive and have no customer service values whatsoever, so I couldn't get the answers I needed in order to be able to use this service. * Goodings supermarket has a web site (http://Shop.goodings.com) where you can supposedly place an order for groceries to be delivered. But it is by far the worst designed web site that I've ever used in my life, and so horribly slow that it would take literally a whole day just to navigate the web site to get your grocery order in place. * Albertson's. You can fax in a grocery order to Albertson's (on Orange Blossom Trail) in advance, they'll do the shopping for you and pack it up, and then you pick it up on the way from Orlando airport to Saratoga. But Albertson's is half-way between the airport and the resort, and now the problem is that you can't use the free Disney Magical Express bus service. So you have to shell out $60+ for a cab or a limo ride. We went with this option, as it seemed the best one at the time. Just my luck though, Albertson's screwed up our order and gave us only half of the groceries we had ordered, and we didn't realize it until we got to our room. All that money for the limo ride for nothing. When I called, the rep at Albertson's said she didn't know how that might have happened. Great, thanks a lot. * After you get to your room, shop yourself at the nearest Goodings Supermarket, Winn-Dixie Supermarket, or Publix supermarket. Based on our experience, I think this is the best option. You'll pay $10-$15 each way for a cab ride, but that's not too bad. Goodings is the closest to Saratoga, but not close enough to be walkable, and don't let anybody else tell you otherwise. (We were told by someone that it was \"easily walkable\", so we tried to walk it after realizing that our Albertson's order was half-missing, and it took us an hour to get there, and my legs were jelly.) However, I also believe that Goodings has less selection and more expensive groceries (maybe 20% higher) than the other supermarkets, especially when compared to Albertson's.", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta, NY", "Title": "\u201cCleaning issues at the Saratoga Springs Resort\u201d", "Author": "MrsMissy159", "ReviewID": "UR15386123", "Content": "We stayed in a two bedroom villa to sample the property with a view of buying into the vacation club.

They would call me when the villa was ready - Not. Finally, at 5:00 I called housekeeping and was told the condo was ready to occupy. An entire day wasted. When I got to the villa, it had not been cleaned properly - merely surface cleaned. There were crumbs on the table, bench, sticky counters, finger prints all over the sliding doors and coffee grounds inside the cabinet where the garbage was contained. I called housekeeping and they sent someone to my room 3 hours later without any cleaning supplies. She just wanted to \"confirm\" the room had not been cleaned properly. So I went to Walmart, purchased cleaning supplies with my groceries and cleaned myself. I left a $5.00 tip each morning with the hope of having a clean villa. This helped but some days they did not come to clean until after 3:00 pm. So we would come back to the room after visiting the parks, then come back for a nap only to find the room had not been cleaned. It was a continual hassle. Finally, on check out day I asked if we could check out at 3:00 instead of 11:00. The front desk said we could stay until 1:30 pm. I was finishing packing and the cleaning people knocked on the door. I told them I needed 10 - 15 more minutes. The cleaning \"supervisor\" than told me she would call security if I wasn't out of the room immediately.

The food is not good but most food at Disney is not good. I suggest eating at Epcot or Downtown Disney. Portobellos and Fultons are two of our favorites. Also, buy the $11 mug at the resort because it is nice for the free refills. As for the pool it is a nice size and fun for the kids. The staff play fun games with the kids in the afternoon and there is usually movies around the pool at night.

There were pros & cons to this Disney resort. First, because it was brand new everything was beautiful. The resort (in typical Disney Style) was immaculate and the rooms were gorgeous. We had a very nice first floor room with a patio that overlooked a pond with a fountain. We stayed in a 1-bedroom unit which gives us the extra space we all need after spending hours in the parks and at the pool. Having a kitchenette to eat breakfast in is not only a cost saver, but a nice quick, healthy option. We were about 1/4 mile from the pool. Not a bad walk compared to many of the other units. The pool was fantastic, especially for the kids. The zero depth makes it especially kid friendly for the young ones and easy to keep an eye on them. The counter service restaurant was quick & convenient with an ever-changing menu that offered us a lot of options, rather than the standard hot dog & hamburger fare. Our complaint about this hotel (in comparison to others) was how large and spread out it was. We were always on buses crammed with other people from the hotel and multiple bus stops within one hotel is tiring. There are so many people that need buses that we often found ourselves waiting at the parks for quite a bit of time so several buses could haul all the people in line back to the hotel. If we ever stayed here again we would be very disappointed to stay in any of the units further from the main building.

We had a 1 bedroom Lockout in the Congress section which is walking distance to Downtown Disney. You have to see Downtown Disney. It has everything there you would like to see. The rooms are very nice,a little small but well maintained. Our only complaint(suggestion) is NEVER! get a 1 bedroom lockout and have 4 kids(a group of 8 with 2 hotel room units) on Spring Break move in beside you. They should have just stayed with us in our unit as it sounded like they were in our Living Room most of the night. Security arrived at 3 am and 5 am to tell them to keep it down. We have 2 small children and these guys and girls were running in and out all night to other rooms, the pool you name it and every time the door slammed (they are VERY loud) the kids woke up. The Entrance Door in the Lockout is right beside yours and opens to the Kitchen area so it offers no noise barrier. We even had the Pizza Delivery guy knock on our door at 3 am because the kids could not hear him knock on their door. NO I was not amused by then. We paid a lot to be away from Spring break partying and thought Disney would be quiet family fun. This was not the place for teenagers to be partying we thought. We ended up moving after the 2nd night. Lockout units offer 0 noise barrier,TRUST ME! Saratoga Management gave warnings to the kids and said they would take action but we had to move to avoid the noise. We could not take another night. March Break in Disney World is VERY VERY busy and we booked Disney to avoid College kids on Spring break. We never expected it inside a Disney resort and the worse part was moving. The new unit had a broken AC unit and they gave our old room away before we even got out of it (those poor people). We came back from Animal Kingdom to find people in our room and we still had all our things in the room because we were told to move after we came from the park so the room would be ready for us to move into. Management messed up huge there. When we finally moved it was over 80 degrees in our new unit so it was tough to sleep again and they needed parts to fix the AC so it was well into the next day before it was fixed. Live and Learn. The resort is beautiful though and the buses are a great way to get around. You will wait no more than 15 or 20 minutes and saves you parking fees. The restaurant in the main building has good food but small. I have to say that I agree with most who say it is not the Disney Experience the Kids crave. You are far from the parks (cannot walk) and no animated friends so I would actually save the money and stay outside the gates next time and spend more on going out other places as well. It is just Not! very Disney....Save the money (it is VERY expensive ) and not a true Disney resort experience in our opinion because we knew we wanted to be in a Family resort away from Spring Breakers. It never happened. They found us. I do not think the other Disney Resorts would put up with this. Just an Note about our Week 2 at Daytona and how they deal with Spring break. We stayed at Ocean Walk (Daytona Beach) the next week and WOW! Most Kids were put in the North Tower and Most Familys in South Tower. It was Quiet in the units after 10pm and Security kept things in order. We were on the 18th as well so very Quiet. The kids partied full tilt but it was well controlled. Excellent job by Security,Police and Beach Patrol. I saw the beach Patrol in action when a kid went out too far. The rip currents can be deadly and I thought I was in Baywatch when the Lifeguard called in for help. A Hummer, 3 Atvs,2 trucks, and a boat were all on scene in less than 2 minutes and yes they wear red bathing suits. The kid swam in with 2 lifeguards and none the worse for wear.

Everyone is friendly, professional and very helpful. The ride to the resort is about 20 minutes but feels like much less because the driver is giving you useful tips and a video of information is playing as well. Before you know it you are at the resort and if you plan your magical express ride a few weeks in advance you can do all this without worrying about your luggage at all. It will appear in your room later on that afternoon. Check-in took about 10 minutes but that was because I had a ton of questions to ask and we pre-paid for all of our meals and theme park tickets. I strongly advise the meal plan, we had the basic plan and it was plenty of food for the day at $38.00 per person per day. You get one counter service meal and one table service meal including entree, non-alcoholic beverage and dessert. You also get a snack which can be popcorn, a drink, ice cream or an assortment of things to choose from. The snack carts and restaurants all have a symbol next to things that count as a choice toward your meal credits so it is really easy to use. 2 adults for a week was only $530.00 and the food was really good...I have to admit I thought it would be just greasy burgers and soggy fries and I was pleasantly surprised by the choices that are available. The artists counter service restaurant @ Saratoga had salads, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas and tons of things to make in your room. One suggestion if you are a coffee person bring it with you and don't forget filters...they charge $5.00 per day for the coffee packets after the first one. The prices for the convenience items are inflated but try to think of everything u need on a regular basis ans just pack it...you can take half as much clothing as you need and do laundry halfway through the week. The in=room washer and dryers are luxurious...we had toasty warm towels after every shower! The kitchen is stocked with everything you can think of and we made coffee & breakfast every morning with the food we ordered from gardengrocer.com , it was a tip we saw on this site and it was perfect. $50 for a weeks worth of groceries and bottled water...I strongly recommend you order the bottled water at least as florida water id not award-winning...(sorry fl..). The fitness center was clean ans well-stocked the hoursare from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. so you have plenty of time to work aup a good sweat before or after the parks. The pools were beautiful and well maintained. Yes, the resort is pretty big but has really been exaggerated in some reviews. Although as a NYer I may think walking 1/4 of a mile to be perfect acceptable while others may not.. The grounds are beautiful and each area is not more that 5 minutes from the main bldgs. Downtown Disney is a very quick walk across the bridge from saratoga springs..it is quite a beautiful walk especially at dusk. Downtown disney is fun and exciting, tons of shopping, dining and people watching. There are 5 bus stops around the property to get the buses to all the parks and downtown disney, you can also take a water taxi or walk to downtown disney ( which I recommend, it will be much faster). The buses run about every 20-30 minutes and the rides are from 5-15 minutes depending on which park you are going to. Disney really makes it so easy to just have a worry and hassel free vacation. I was truly impressed. The parks really sell themselves so I am not going to say much about them but to suggest you get your personalized maps from disney with your points of interest marked off and deciding what your itinerary will be ahead of time...even if you are not a planner..have a loose itinerary r you could get carried away and never see a few things you really want to see. The maps are free just request them on disney's website. And everyone will ask you where you got them cause they are really attractive too. Really good restaurants I suggest are Planet Hollywood in Downtown Disney, wolfgang puck also in downtown disney westside, Sci-Fi Dine-In at Hollywood studios, san angel inn at the world showcase mexican pavillion in epcot , and the turf club at saratoga springs. In conclusion I wasn't sure what to expect but was blown away by disneys service, the helpfulness and friendliness of their cast members, the beautiful surroundings and disney's uncanny attention to detail.

A friend and I booked a week long stay at the resort, along with the disney express tickets, weeklong park hopper with add ons, and the disney dining plan. All of the above were well worth the money spent. Our room at S.S. overlooked a lake, as well as Downtown Disney. A small pool and hot tub were a moments walk from our door. I loved this, as it seems that most families with children went to the larger, themed pool, in the center of the property. You don't truly realize what lounging by the pool means, until you remove the hoards of screaming children. We also had the cutest little man tending to the pool. He would always greet us with a smiling hello, and ask us how we were doing. One day in particular, we had mixed some alcoholic drinks, poured them into the room glasses and brought them down to the pool. This is strictly against hotel policy by the way. Well along came our little pool cleaner, and I immediatly apologized for having broken the rules. He simply smiled, waved his hand at the sign, and said that \"on vacation there are NO rules.\" Needless to say, we shared many a drink by the hot tub that week. The room itself was nicely appointed. It contained a queen sized bed and bedroom, bathroom with shower and deep tub, a living room, dining area and kitchen. Another major plus was an in room washer and dryer. On the last night of the trip, which I usually spend packing and doing nothing, I was able to wash all of my laundry. The hotel even provided complimentary laundry detergent and dryer sheets. This saved me from having to do work when I got home. My friend and I only ate at the hotel's Artist's Palette, which is a counter service restaurant located in the main hotel complex. The food was tasty, but I'd recommend venturing to some of the restaurants in Downtown Disney. This isn't hard to do either, considering Downtown Disney is only a short walk from the resort. This comes in handy too, as Downtown Disney is the only source of night life in the entire Walt Disney World Resort. If you pay for the park hopper ticket with add ons, you get free entrance to Paradise Island every night. This is a strip of about 8 night clubs to suit any taste. Our favorite was 8 tracks, the 70s and 80s themed club, as well as gay night at Mannequins (that's Thursday night for those who are interested). Drinks are a bit over priced, but then again isn't everything at Disney? One final note, I'd recommend paying for the Disney Dining plan. It is 40 dollars a day, per adult, but will save you hundreds of dollars for a week long trip. For a week long meal plan you get 7 daily snacks (water, bagel, apple, drink), 7 counter service meals (equivalent to eating at any of the parks' fast food eateries), and seven sit down meals (which you can double up to eat somewhere fancy). We decided to eat on our own buck one day, and doubled up a meal to eat at the Flying Fish Cafe, located in Disney's Boardwalk area. This was well worth the value, considering our two person dinner came to roughly 150 dollars. I hear they offer a premiere dining plan now, where you get two sit down meals a day, as well as two snacks, for a higher price. I'd still go for the basic meal plan, considering we found it difficult to finish our meals.

The two-bedroom suite had lovely appointments and a very practical layout in which the second bedroom had its own bathroom and large vanity area, away from the living areas. The master suite had a whirlpool tub and a very comfortable king-size bed. There were three televisions each with DVD players, and a full kitchen with coffeemaker, microwave, garbage disposal, range/oven, dishwasher, and full-size refrigerator. The bathrooms were beautifully tiled. The master bath was broken into three adjoining sections: the first had a sink and vanity with the whirlpool tub and a closet off to the side which included an ironing board and iron. Through the next door was a large glassed-in shower and pedestal sink. Off this room was another door to the toilet. This wasn't a tiny room either. Outside this area behind a louvered door was a stacking washer and dryer. Not full-size but perfect for doing a load each day. Other than a light bulb that didn't work, all was in order in our suite. I enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the mornings with my coffee and a view of the landscaping which had been given much attention to detail. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and we had free bus access to the parks and the Disney Express brought us from the airport and back. We didn't have to handle our luggage once the bell hop picked it up until we got it at our home airport. We even received our boarding passes before leaving the resort. The pool is beautiful, with one large and one small waterslide, and is open for about 18 hours a day, with a lifeguard most if not all of that time. The spa, which I didn't have the time to use, was rated one of the top five in North America by Conde Nast. There is also an arcade and game room, which we didn't have time to use. This resort is near Downtown Disney, and one can take a boat across the lake from SSRS to get there. It's nearest the Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. I would definitely stay at this resort again.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cDid not love the prings\u201d", "Author": "birthdayboy42", "ReviewID": "UR13907780", "Content": "We have jsut returned from a trip to Saratoga Springs in DisneyWorld.

We chose Saratoga Springs because it was Disney's newest resort and we figured it would have the least wear and tear. The hotel was clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. We rented a 1 bedroom villa, which was plenty of room for the four of us and allowed us all to sleep in different areas of the villa. (Important for us so our children would not wake each other up and we would not have to go to bed with them at 7:30 pm!) I would say the room is equal to a 3 star hotel room, on par with a Marriot. We had a pool right outside our room which was quiet and convienent and the larger, more crowded pool was a 10 minute walk away. We were able to walk to Downtown Disney from our room, also about a 10 minute walk with two kids in a stroller. Disney provided a pack n' play for the baby and we had them deliver a crib to our villa for our toddler. Both worked out well. Since our villa had a kitchen, we bought some groceries at the Artist's Pallette, which is the quick service restaurant near the main pool. They have a small grocery section and carry a fairly decent range of items including eggs, waffles, milk, juice, cereal, bread, some canned goods, paper plates, baby food, aluminum foil, beer and wine, etc. The prices were a little bit higher than you would find at home but not too bad. One note for parents: I didn't see diapers but was told they only sell Huggies in Disney. (for Pampers users out there) We brought them with us but a good tip I got was to order some online (maybe from Amazon?) and have them shipped directly to the resort. The resort will hold them for you until you arrive. We took the bus twice a day to the parks. The bus stop was just outside our room and the wait was fairly short wait as was the ride. We were able to fold up our double stroller and carry it on to the bus with us to the parks. We thought we would be spending more evenings having dinner in Downtown Disney than we did. It ended up that we had dinner most nights in Epcot. In hindsight, it would have chosen a villa at the Boardwalk or Beach Club, which are both in walking distance to Epcot. I can't stress this enough - Make sure you make dinner reservations before you leave for your trip. At least for the first night. By the time we checked in, got settled and got our bearings, we quickly realized there was at least an hour wait for most restaurants. We were hungry and tired from travelling all day and the hour wait with two kids was just not an option! On last unrelated note: Wherever you stay, try to go check out The Wilderness Lodge. It is a really fun property, the lobby is especially cool and I think they also have villas.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York State", "Title": "\u201cSometimes beautiful does not matter!\u201d", "Author": "Abu1030", "ReviewID": "UR13852166", "Content": "Although the grounds are beautiful and the buildings are beautiful....The rooms were mediocre.

So there was a long line everyday for breakfast and they would run out of food. It was horrible. If you wanted to eat at another hotel you would have to take the bus and that would mean at least another 30 - 45 minutes. I don't understand for the life of me why they would have only 1 restaurant open for a property this large!!!! That 'sinsane! Our room was nice, but way too small for 4 people. We had a queen/full bed and a pull out. If you are traveling with 2 adults and 2 children get a 2 bedroom suite or stay at a hotel with larger rooms. The bus system needs some work. We waited a average of 20 - 30 minutes for a bus to come and it was usually crowded, so we had to stand. This was both going to and coming home from the parks. The bus from Downtown Disney to the hotel (which is next door) is about 15 - 20 minutes, because you have to stop at Pleasure Island and many times the bus drivers changed shifts there.

The resort was nice, but I'm not sure it was exactly right for us. Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good: *The resort is absolutely gorgeous - beautifully landscaped grounds, secluded and quiet, fantastic pools, nicely decorated rooms, friendly staff. We stayed in a studio in the Grandstand section, which is the newest section of the resort, and it was really very nice - the quiet pool in this area has water features, pool, and spa and the bus stop is close to the rooms (and also the first stop, so we never had to stand on our ride to the parks). *The Magic Bus from the hotel and luggage delivery was seamless, though it did take 3 hours to get our bags. This is a great feature and really made things easier for us traveling with a small child. Also, getting our return-flight boarding passes and checking our luggage right there at the hotel was a huge time-saver. *The queen bed in the room was exceptionally comfortable. *The bus service is well-run and we never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a bus. The bad: *The resort is nothing short of HUGE and the maps they provide are not very helpful! I read the other reviews about this and thought those people must just be in bad shape, but I assure you, if you have any kind of disability (in our case it was a relatively fit, though pregnant me and a toddler who demanded to be carried everywhere), you will find it exhausting getting from your room to the main area (carriage house, pool, restaurant, etc.). *The resort is set pretty far away from other things (as were most of the WDW hotels, from what I could tell). I realize this is part of the charm, but I assumed we could easily get (by bus or foot) to other hotels or other Disney areas for dinner, etc., and this was simply not the case. The one exception to this is Downtown Disney, which is about a mile walk and a relatively quick water taxi ride. *I chose this resort primarily because I thought we could buy a few things and prepare some meals in our room (like breakfast). Unfortunately, though, the pantry at the Artists Colony sells mostly junk food - sugary cereals and snacks, frozen burritos and hot pockets, etc. - so this did not happen for us. We did buy some milk and fruit to keep in our room, but not enough to sustain us by any means. If you do not have a car, I recommend you pack some groceries. Otherwise, you'll be stuck eating junk or eating out all week. *The food at the Artists Colony is not good - overpriced cafeteria food and not a lot of choices. We ate there more times than I'd like to say and I really hated it by the end of the week. Also, it is very disorganized - you stand in line to order, then you get drinks, then you stand in line to pay and then you have to return for your food and there are people going every which way to try to find the right line. If I stay here again, I will plan out my meals the first day and make reservations at the sit-down restaurant on site or at downtown disney. The ugly: *The hide-a-bed is U-G-L-Y. It is literally a 2-inch foam mattress on a plywood platform. Next time, I will choose a resort with 2 queen beds over a resort with a hideabed and microwave/fridge. *Another very bad part of our vacation (and this really has nothing to do with SSR, except that the limited food choices drove us to it) was the meal we had at CapN Jacks at Downtown Disney. The food was TERRIBLE!!! The worst I have ever had. In fact, the food in general at Disney - hotel, parks, etc. - was pretty sub-par. The best meal we had all week, no joke, was breakfast at McDonalds at Downtown Disney the last day of our trip and that's only because it was the one time the food was average but we did not feel we were getting ripped off. *Check your charges as you are making your purchases!!! My son is not yet 3 (almost, but not yet) and we clarified this with the front desk upon check-in, but we were still charged for a park ticket for 2 days for him (even though under 3 are free). I bought the tickets at the concierge desk at the hotel who simply said \"its taken care of\" (I didn't approve the charge or sign anything) and did not realize we had been charged until check-out. When we tried to get this resolved we were told 1) we used the ticket, so there was nothing Disney could do, then 2) because I indicated at the time I booked the room that he was 3, they could not change this (even though they indicated to us they had changed this on our reservation at check-in) and then 3) the issue could not be resolved because a manager was not on duty. It was my fault for not checking the charges, but this really is no way to treat people. I now have to try to resolve the issue by phone and I am not optimistic I will see my $124 again. The resort is beautiful and it was nice to be on vacation, but I doubt we will stay at this resort again. For us, it would have been better to stay at a nice Disney or non-Disney resort with comfortable beds, that is near other things, so we would have some options for meals and entertainment, then take a taxi or shuttle to the parks. The resort is way too pricey and beyond decor, bus transport, and ability to buy park tickets and get our boarding passes at the hotel, there was not a great deal of Disney magic (at least not enough that I think we would miss it if we stayed somewhere else). Also, the studio aspect of the room (microwave/fridge) was relatively useless, since we did not bring groceries with us, and did not make up for the fact that we essentially had a room with only one functioning bed.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cwonderful week\u201d", "Author": "Canela4", "ReviewID": "UR13566644", "Content": "We exchanged our timeshare for this resort.

We also found that having a kitchen was a big money saver for breakfast and snacks. We used gardengrocer.com and had groceries delivered right to the room (cheaper and more varity than the Disney service and since we don't use a rental car at Disney, very convienent). Having a washing machine right in the room was great too. We never unpacked some of our clothes and know we will pack less next time.

My husband and I are DVC members and own here. There were 10 of us total (myself, husband, 5 yr old son, 14 yr old daughter, mother & father in law, sister & brother in law, 7 yr old neice and 3 yr old nephew) and we booked a 2 bedroom unit (2 baths, full kitchen, small living/dining area) and a studio (1 bath, sitting area & kitchenette \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect for 2 adults). We kept juice, milk and snacks on hand, plus the all important coffee and tea supplies!!! When making our reservation back in May, I specifically requested that both rooms be together and in the Congress Park area of the resort. Both of these requests were granted with no problems. Having stayed here twice before, when the resort was brand new, the Congress Park section was the only section completed and that is where we are most comfortable. The nice thing about this section is that is only about a 5-10 minute walk to Downtown Disney Marketplace and their bus stop. Also, you can walk to the main area of the resort, pool, restaurant, golf course pro shop, boat launch, in about 10 minutes. There is also a quiet pool and small playground overlooking the lake. Make no mistake, the resort is absolutely huge and sprawling, but also very beautiful. If you have the time and energy, take a stroll around the lake and resort! There are 5 bus stops, one in each section, which have buses that go only to the parks and Downtown Disney. (If you need to get to a resort, you will need to get on a theme park or DD bus and changes buses there.) They run every 15-20 minutes or so. This is no different than the bus routes at the other resorts, and might actually be quicker than some! You can actually take any theme park bus from any resort stop to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Springs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stop to get to Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette and theme pool area, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like walking. The counter service restaurant, the Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette, is small and usually over crowded especially at breakfast time. The gift shop and food store are all part of this area and share the same cash registers. Some of us ate there a few times and had no problems with waiting too long. The only complaint is that the line to order food is smack in the middle of everything and makes it look like the place is mobbed, but it moves quickly. It is a little disorganized, but service and food was good! Hopefully, if a lot of us complain about the set-up, Disney will make some changes. Fortunately, the weather was absolutely beautiful and we were able to use the pool. Our 14 year old loves the big slide and the 5 year old loved playing in the Donald Duck fountain. There is also a smaller slide for the little ones! We were there in the morning from about 9:30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11:00 or so, and it was not crowded. The water was a perfect temperature. We did not use the hot tub or pool bar, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on them. SSR also has a spa and fitness center, which we did not use this time, but have used in the past. The spa is a little pricey (but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected at a resort & Disney), but the pedicure I had on a previous trip was worth it! DVC Members get a discount on some of the services. We used bell services on both arrival day and departure day. Perfect, perfect, perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c absolutely no problems! Also, had no problems with housekeeping or maintenance. On our first morning, we noticed that the tub in the 2nd bedroom was draining very slowly and with 3 of us trying to shower, it was a slow process! We called maintenance and when we got back from our day at the park, it was all fixed and ready for showers! We came to Disney in December to see the Christmas decorations at the parks and resorts and we were not disappointed! Everything was absolutely beautiful! Overall, family was very pleased with SSR and we would stay here again. However, we also like staying at Boardwalk or Beach Club, because of the direct walking access to both MGM and Epcot.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay, Very Clean!!\u201d", "Author": "Woody's Honda", "ReviewID": "UR11881324", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here from Dec. 9th thru the 14th.

We got our own luggage off Magical Express and headed to checkin. Because we had the one room we put all the bags there, otherwise they'll hold the bags till your room is ready. Keep in mind this resport is huge and I saw too too many people walking around lost and many with bags. Insist on bellman help! be nice but insist, especailly with kids. The food court is fine. There are $7 to $8 flatbread pizzas and pita sandwichs big enought to share. I dont reccomend the refillable cup because its only good at the resort and youre out of there in the parks too much. I thought the sloppy joes, lo mein, tacos salads and bugers at the food courts at All Stars were less gourmet but a way better value. Plan to do only breakfast , fruits and snacks at Saratoga. I like the Paddock area for the pool and close pick up. REMEMBER if youre riding the park transportation home at night there are about 4 stops if you pick the wrong one you can be miles from your room. Tell the driver your room # or building. I spoke with many people with strollers and kids who got lost. If you dont ask ,the driver is no help he'll just announce stop #1, 2 etc. ... The rooms are nice with Patios or balconies and exterior cement walkways very very safe and well lighted. The pull outs are ok not the most comfotable but Ive had worse. maid svc came about 930am. They will deliver your pack and play, clean the room help however they can ,their english is ok at best but they were extemely nice and concerned about everything. Magical Express vouchers come the day befor you leave. You checkout at 11am and again if you dont call for bellman help they wont come and you will drag your bags and kids miles for checkout. We saw one paticualr family doing this and they were furious. They dragged their bags so far and got in the airline check in line at the resort. Give them you bags and voucher and depending on the airline theyll print your boeadring pass right there. We were encouraged to tip the girls checking us in. So this particalar family says I dragged by bags for a mile and you expect a tip for picking them up and moving them 2 feet. Good point! I you check out at 11am and fly home at 5 like I did.

There were 9 of us - my husband and I and our 7 children ranging in age from 18 yrs to 2yrs old. It seems this Disney resort is geared toward folks who don't want a total \"Disney\" atmosphere. For guests who want that, they would probably enjoy staying here. For our family, we missed the \"Disney\" atmosphere which is found at other resorts such as the Boardwalk and Wilderness. It's a nice facility but no different than any non-Disney hotel/resort. The resort is HUGE. We sensed that any issues we had were probably due to the sheer size of this resort. The lobby is surprisingly small, especially for a resort this huge. There is an area off to the side with cartoons on a TV, to keep little ones occupied while a parent checks in. That was nice. Off a hallway there were some sitting areas. The areas outside the lobby were shaded and nice. When we arrived our first day, we headed to the bathrooms off the lobby. Not a \"Disney\" welcome. They were messy with paper towels on the floor, water on the counters, etc. Also small and crowded. The baby changing station is directly opposite the door so babies being changed are in full view of everyone going in and out. We are used to immaculate Disney resorts so this was an odd first impression. There are 3-4 bus stops within the resort itself, so when planning to be somewhere those need to be included in travel times. Our room was very close to a bus stop, within easy walking distance of the main hotel area, and had a nice view of the grounds and Downtown Disney. Our villa was big and fit our family nicely. There was a main bedroom w/king size bed and full bath. Then a living room/ full kitchen area which had a pull out sofa bed. Then an additional bedroom with 2/queen sized beds and full bath. The kitchen was clean and fully stocked with dishware. There was a DVD with the living room TV. When the pull out bed was opened there was no room whatsoever in the living room area, and barely room to squeeze by between the kitchen counter and bed. So, we only pulled the bed out when it was time to use it and folded it up first thing in the morning. Our room was clean but needed a lot of rehab. One of the hall closet folding doors was broken - we found this out when our 2 yr old opened the door and it literally fell out of the tracks. The carpeting in our room was in desperate need of being replaced. It was completely worn, in most spots the pattern was worn through and in one spot it was worn/torn through to the floor. The drawers in two of the dresser units did not open and shut well and in one of them, when we arrived, we found a dried crust of bread. Housekeeping kept our room very nice while we were there. When we called them for extra towels and an extra blanket, they brought them immediately. That was nice. A couple times when we needed to reach the front desk with questions, and called from our cell phones while at a Park, the phone rang and rang and was never picked up. We did the Disney Dining plan and usually ate breakfast at the resort - either at the Artist's Palette or brought it back to our room. The seating there is limited. Breakfast was good. We also bought snacks there on our Dining Plan. For all of our sit down dinners within the parks we made reservations several weeks before our trip, and those worked out *great*. One day we decided to change restaurants and when my husband called to ask, Disney gave us a reservation at another restaurant, no problem. I don't think we would stay at Saratoga Springs again. Maybe if it was the *only* place we could stay. There's just no Disney magic there, which might be fine with some guests but we would prefer more \"Disney\" at our resort. It was cheaper than other resorts, so we told ourselves that was the benefit (saving some $). We are limited to which resorts we can stay at, due to the size of our family, and saving money is always nice.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "beavercreek, ohio", "Title": "\u201cMake it your last resort at Disneyworld\u201d", "Author": "disneyluvr_7", "ReviewID": "UR11052727", "Content": "My husband, daughter and I stayed at Saratoga Springs Resort for a three day weekend in October.

HOWEVER, the sofa bed was a joke and so uncomfortable my adult daughter slept curled uncomfortably on the couch cushions the second night. No roll aways are provided at SS. The cleanliness of the room was definitely not up to Disney standards. We found empty pop bottles behind the patio door curtains, crumbs under the sofa cushions and dirty tissues in the drawers. One lamp shade had what appeared to ketchup smeared all over it! The weather was VERY warm, and we were fortunate to have rented a car, because walking to the pool was not an option. There isn't any parking provided near the pool and activity area except for 30 minute check-in, so we parked illegally. A water main was broken causing the toilets in the main lobby area to be closed....luckily the spa opened its doors for pool guests. The poolside bar was unable to sell any drinks except beer, and they didn't put up a sign notifying guests, so we all stood in line for 15-20 minutes for pop and margaritas, only to be turned away! The food court was ok, but service in the restaurant on the golf course was so abominable we walked out after waiting 20 minutes for a server to notice us. All in all a very disappointing resort.

We most recently stayed there in October, 2007 and for the first time in the Caroseul section (to the left as you go through the entrance). Our stay was in a one bedroom unit - king size bed in the main bedroom with a very comfortable pull out sofa couch in the living room area, and a full although smallish kitchen. Please note that this area of the resort does not have a leisure/quiet pool area (you have to go to the Paddock or Grandstand for a leisure/quiet pool area - about a 10 minute walk at a good pace). The Caroseul section appeared to be the quietest during our trip based on observation of number of cars parked in the lot. It was a very peaceful area of the resort with little activity and had a very nice balcony view out towards Downtown Disney Resorts in the distance with other parts of the resort, fountains etc. in the foreground. We were on the top (4th) floor and had nice view. The elevators were always timely and efficient - we also took the stairs a number of times to get a little bit of exercise in. The room was quite clean and very nicely decorated with all in working order. We had two different neighbours in the lock-off studio portion next door but never heard any noise from their unit. The bus stop was about a 5 minute walk and the Community Hall area a decent 10-15 minute walk at a middling pace. The pool area was busy but not crowded and the Grandstand leisure pool with splash pad area had some light traffic and was quiet enjoyable. The Community Hall has a wide selection of DVDs for free rental by guests at the resort and also lifejackets (for duration of stay) and a number of board games, computer access, crafts etc. There is a medium sized games arcade near the pool area. The one thing that did not impress us was the somewhat indifferent attitude of some of the Community Hall staff for the later kids activities (around 7pm, there were scheduled activities). One night there were not enough kids so after requesting (note had to ask), the staff member put out some crafts items and the kids made up some crafts. Subsequently I then played a board game with some of the kids (including my own) to make things more exciting for them. Another night, my kids were the only ones who showed up for the activity - the staff member basically ignored our sitter and the kids and did not suggest any alternate activities or offer any assistance. We did not dine at The Turf Club but did order counter service food at Artists Palette. There is a good selection of food choices there but the service takes a fair amount of time (almost 15 minutes) to complete so make sure you allocate sufficient time to allow for your order to be completed. Overall, we enjoy staying at Saratoga Springs and would stay there again - the kids find it enjoyable and relaxing and love watching the Disney buses roll buy and we like the muted, warm toned decor and the walking paths throughout the property.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union, NJ", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Comfort\u201d", "Author": "AHayes", "ReviewID": "UR10730996", "Content": "Our family of 4 enjoyed a second stay at Saratoga Springs and still believe it is the most pleasant of the Disney resorts we've tried (Carribean Beach, Coronado Springs, Boardwalk, Old Key West and Port Orleans).

I think that if in every day life you generally choose to take the stairs whenever possible or enjoy walking to the post office for fun you won't mind the short walks to the front desk etc. But if you drive around looking for the closest parking space at the mall and always take the elevator you probably won't appreciate the grounds of this resort. Those walks will seem more burden than pleasure. Since it is a vacation club resort you only have housekeeping services every 4 days. Even then it only includes emptying the trash and fresh towels. They don't make beds or do dishes but we loved the convenience of making breakfast and doing laundry in the room. Last, the bus service is a bit slow. It does take longer to get to places than with other resorts but it is still a convenience and not much of a problem.

Saratoga Springs, along with 5 others, is one of the primary Disney Vacation Club resorts in Orlando. It is the newest one and, like others have posted, it is very, very widespread. But because it is so big, it seemed a lot less crowded and hurried. The grounds are beautiful and well kept, and the staff was friendly. We stayed at a spacious 3 bedroom villa with 2 other families. The decor was one of the nicest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simple, yet elegant colonial charm. It had a bedroom downstairs with a king bed, and 2 bedrooms upstairs, each with 2 double beds. Each bedroom had a full bathroom, and there was a 4th bathroom next to the living room. The kitchen itself was fully equipped with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, sink, cookware, and dinnerware. There was a nice, big dining table, balcony,washer/dryer, dvd player, and cable tv with a gazillion Disney channels. The only problem with the room was a temperamental thermostat. There are essentially 5 sections of Sarasota Springs, ours was in The Springs, which is closest to the main entrance. I liked our location, since the main entrance had the mini-mart, the restaurant, the pick up/drop off for the Magical Express to the airport, and was closest to the boat taking you to Downtown Disney. However, when going to the parks, it is the last stop out of the 5 sections, both going and coming back. This meant that we usually had no seats when going to the parks in the morning. The bus stop order was the Grandstand, the Carousel, Congress Park, the Paddock, and then the Springs. If you stay at Congress Park, it is a brisk walk to Downtown Disney, where there are lots of dining choices. We stayed at the parks most of the day, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the restaurants until the last day. We ate at the Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette for brunch, which is a quick service place, and the food was fine. Their swimming pool was an adequate size with a fun big slide and a little toddler slide. We went for a brief swim, and because the weather was not so nice, it was not crowded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they seem to be a little short on the lounge chairs. There were 2 large hot tubs also. My 2 cents: 1. Eat breakfast in. The kitchenettes at this resort allow you to save by eating breakfast in. They have a mini-market at the Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette near the main entrance, which are expectedly higher than normal prices, but reasonable enough. 2. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at a Disney resort, use the DINING PLAN. This was one discovery that I made this trip that I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done before and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth it. For $43 per adult per \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, you get 1 Quick Service Meal, 1 Snack, and 1 Table Service meal. For kids 3-9 years old, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just $11 per kid, and you get the same things, but from the kids menu. It is a lot of food, especially if you eat at the buffets. The Quick Service meal (entree, dessert, and drink) is like their fast food places, perfect for lunch or dinner. The Table Service Meal (appetizer, entree, dessert, and drink) can be used for their nicer restaurants and character dining restaurants. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best is that tip is also included! You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to use the allotted meals all in one day, you can save them from one day to the next. They are linked to your room key, so even your kids can walk around with their room key and purchase with it. This is a sweet deal and Disney knows it, so starting January 2008, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to offer appetizers with Table Service meals and the tip will not be included. Even so, it is a good deal. 3. Unless you have a car, you have to take the buses when at Disney. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the buses, stay at the Contemporary or Polynesian, which are on the monorail and can take you to Epcot and Magic Kingdom. MGM and Animal Kingdom are only accessible by bus or car.

When you turn into the resort one of the first things you notice is how stunning the grounds are. So colorful and full of wildlife. Truly spectacular. You could spend time just walking around the resort and absolutely love it. The main pool is the best, the rockery and waterslide are brilliant. This is really a picturesque resort everywhere you turn. Artist Pallete is the food court which has a wide variety of different food. Not the same burger and fries that you get everywhere else.

I chose a 2BR/2BA villa (1 king in master, 2 queens in second bedroom). This resort is huge! I was hoping for a villa in the \"Congress Park\" section, the one closest to the Disney Village Marketplace so we could walk there. Unfortunately, there were none available. We were put into the \"Springs\" section, garden view, actually it was a parking lot view. I have to say this was actually a good location. We were right across from the big pool, bus stop, restaurant/store and fairly close to the boat dock that took you to the marketplace and Disney west. We took the bus to the marketplace Saturday night. Took a while because the buses make a few stops throughout the property, so be prepared to ride for a while. We waited for around 30 minutes for the bus to arrive to take us back to the resort. Something you have to learn to live with if you take the Disney transportation. The villa was very nice. We had a handicap room, not out of necessity, that is just what they gave us. To me there is a lot of wasted space. There was a large foyer and tons of closet space. I think that space could have been added to the kitchen/dining/living area which was small. This villa would be perfect for a family with smaller children, they usually don't mind lying on the floor. We found there was not enough seating in the evening for all of us adults. There was a pullout sofa/sleeper that was the size of a love seat and one chair. Off to the side of the living area there was a booth-type dining room table with two small dining chairs. It was small and not really comfortable to sit on and watch TV and chat, good for a quick meal though. After a long hot day in the parks it would have been nice for each of us to have a nice comfy seat!!! This would be a great place for a family to save some money. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans and a trip to one of the local grocery stores could make things easier on the Disney food budget? It was a very nice place, we just wish it had a bit more comfortable seating in the living area... Maybe a loveseat/ sofa combo??? Also if you are staying for a week or so you might want to bring a small supply of dishwasher, dish and laundry soap. They do supply you with a small amount when you check in, but not enough if you are staying for and extended stay. They do offer more for a price but I am sure it would be cheaper to bring your own!

The grounds are beautiful and our room (a one bedroom suite) was both clean, beautiful and very well themed. The room faced a golf course and while none of us are golfers, it made for a very nice and relaxing view. The full-service dining location was nice but the dining room is very small and the menu seemed a bit limited. The quick service area was fine. We stopped there several times for snacks and drinks. While it is pretty big, we never waited in any long lines or had to wait for seats. For recreation, we hit the pools and had a great time there. They were both clean and very well kept up. My dad got a massage at the spa and really enjoyed it. For transportation, you can ride the boats over to Downtown Disney. We did this several times for dinner or just to walk around at night. The boats run regularly and we never had to wait long for one to arrive. The buses to the theme parks also run regularly, but honestly I would recommend driving you own car to the theme parks. Why? Because at the end of the day those buses are loaded down with tons of tired people and cranky crying babies. Your own car will provide a more peaceful end to your day in the parks. All in all, it was a great stay and I've already recommended this resort to lots of my friends. Since the resort is newer, lots of people seem to not know about it.

We had been to Old Keywest Resort three years previous and enjoyed the accomodations as well as the service. This year we stayed at Saratoga Sps which is the \"sister resort\" and newer than Old Keywest. Saratoga Sps is much bigger than Old Keywest and more poorly run. We found the main area and pool of Old Keywest much less crowded and more manageable than Saratoga. The main pool area of Saratoga Sps looked like one huge city pool just crammed full of people...not something to look forward to on vacation. Also, if you needed anything it was hard to obtain it...whether it was a reservation or a new towel for your room. The main switchboard of Disney resorts would contact the front desk of Saratoga Sps resort and maybe, eventually you're request would be granted....very creepy. The parks, it being June, were extremely crowded....to the point where I wondered about the amount of people actually allowed in the parks for safety reasons. I know the Magic Kingdom years ago would allow only so many people in the park, not only for safety but comfort for the masses....now it's a free for all. Example: One day I took my older children to MGM at 9:00 am, we tried to leave the park at 12:30 pm and literally had to fight against a crowd streaming forward. It was shocking how many people were being shoved into the park. And don't be fooled by \"fast pass\". Unless you're devious enough to figure out how to get duplicate \"fast passes\" you're out of luck. We will not be visiting Disney or any resort in that area for a while.

Most trips were less than 20 min drive each way. Great for viewing the firework shows from the resort. Beautiful pool that was not as crowded as other locations.

Of course, this can also be a good thing. :) Other comments... I saw the concern of another reviewer with the bottom floor slider doors. This did not concern us at all.

I was very satisified with the accommodations. While not on scale with the Deluxe resort accommodations, the room was nice and exceptionally clean. It should be noted the accommodations are nicer than moderate resort accommodations. We stayed as a DVC member so the room was not scheduled for cleaning during our stay. It was scheduled for a towel and trash service which was not conducted. That's unfortunate for the cleaning service because there is no tip for no service. I was able to place the trash outside the hotel room door and it was picked up. Plenty of trash bags inside the cans. Our room was in the Carosel building on the second floor facing the bus stop. I thought it might be noisy but it was not. If we did not have a rental car, it would have been very convenient. The buses can take you to the main building next to the Springs bus stop, but it is faster, most times, to walk to the main building. The walk to the main building is about 5-7 minutes. The pool and spa services are terrific. The arcade is great when the kids are tired and hot and need to cool down. The pool was clean and there were games and other fun activities for kids and adults alike. My son especially enjoyed renting movies from the community hall and going back to the hotel room to watch them (a DVD player is included in every room). The resort property is very large. Many times there was a line at the cafeteria, which is smaller than that of the All-Start resorts. Saratoga Springs has at least as many rooms, if not more, than the All-Star resorts. Tables are smaller and not as prolific as with other resorts. The food was kept under warmers so it was sometimes a bit dried out. The registers for checking out/picking up merchandise and grocery are the same as those for food service. We had to consistently wait for counter service on average about 7 minutes. It used to be when you checked in, you could purchase your tickets and make dining reservations at the same time. We had to check in and then go wait in another line for the concierge to make reservations and add tickets to our key to the world. Not horrible but it would have been more efficient to handle everything in one shot. There was one group who was having difficulty with their reservation that required them to bounce back and forth between check-in and concierge. Saratoga Springs now has a second restaurant called the Turf Club Bar & Grill. I found it somewhat annoying some of the menu selections were the same as the menu selections at many other table service dining establishments. This restaurant serves steak and seafood as well as the Shrimp Penne pasta and the Angus Sirloin burger (staples at all table service restaurants). The prime rib was pretty good and the Top Sirloin was marvelous. The table service could have been more efficient though it was nice to have a different choice at the hotel we were staying. I would stay there again, however, it would get a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen. It is not be my first DVC resort choice though it is a very nice property with some wonderful amenites (kitchenette, kitchen & washer/dryer) that are not available at all Disney properties (though they are available at all Disney Vacatation Club properties).", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cReally nice for family of four\u201d", "Author": "arnewman", "ReviewID": "UR8454072", "Content": "We just returned from six nights at the Saratoga Springs. I booked a two bedroom suite (with two bathrooms, kitchen, and washer/dryer) as part of a package through the Walt Disney Travel Company. After I booked, I read some less than stellar reviews here on TripAdvisor, but I must say that our family had a great stay and would recommend it to others on family outings. As has been said in other reviews, the place is quite large. We stayed in the Paddock section with a water view, which is about a ten minute (leisurely) walk across a lake bridge to the main buildings and large pool. There was also a smaller pool right next to our building, so we didn't have to hike if we didn't want to. The Artist's Palette offered decent \"quick service\" meals, and had a good selection of snacks and supplies for the refrigerator. We used the Disney Dining Plan, so the meals were included. The snacks and sundries were a bit on the expensive side, but no more than you might expect from a resort. (There is also a full-service restaurant called the Turf Club...we didn't get to try it. They have also started limited room service delivery of pizza and related items.) I think that getting around is quite reasonable without a car, as we never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a Disney bus. Having said that, we did actually rent a car, since we got a good deal from priceline.com. (As an aside, staying at a Disney property gets you free parking at all the parks.) We did not use the car to go to the Magic Kingdom as you park at the Ticketing and Transportation Center, so you have to take a tram to a monorail to get to the park. As a geographic reference, the Saratoga Springs is right next to the Downtown Disney area. In fact, from most of the property, you can reach Downtown Disney by a ten minute walk, a boat ride, or a five minute drive (including finding a place to park). Now for the room: very spacious and comfortable. King bed in the main bedroom and two queens in the second, plus a pull-out couch. Powerful air conditioning, as would be required of any place in that part of Florida. Minor detractions: sheets and towels were not the highest quality, but were perfectly adequate. Also, limited channel selection on the TV, but balanced by the DVD player in the room (and rentals available at the Artist's Palette). The kitchen was very well equipped - microwave, range, stove, dishwasher, full fridge/freezer, coffee maker. Some other reviews indicated that some staff members were rude and/or not knowledgeable. We did not find this to be the case at all. The staff was always polite and welcoming, and if I was able to stump someone, they always knew who to ask to get the right answer. Some also complained about the housekeeping and condition of the rooms - for us, housekeeping was always prompt, and the room was kept quite clean throughout our stay. (If you are a Disney Vacation Club member, the room gets linens and towels on the fourth day - if you are a \"hotel-type\" guest, then you get serviced each day. One morning, we stayed in late and kept the \"do not disturb\" sign out. The housekeepers called to ask when we'd like the room cleaned, and they held to our requested schedule.) So, while I can see that this might not be the ideal situation for the business traveler, for a family with a young child (or children), I would definitely recommend the Saratoga Springs when visiting Walt Disney World. (I withheld the fifth star basically because of the less-than-fantastic, but really not bad, quality of the sheets and towels. This is a minor inconvenience, but I would expect a bit more for the price we paid. Nevertheless, Saratoga Springs remains high on my list for the next time we visit.)", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDon't Do It!!

I would not stay here again. First, and this is not the fault of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DO NOT go to Orlando in August. It is miserably hot and humid and just unbearable. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people even consider going to the parks this time of year. As for the hotel, there are Pros and Cons: PROS 1. Rooms have a little kitchenette with an (unstocked) fridge, and microwave 2. Rooms have a little sitting area 3. A/C worked well in the room (key since it was hotter than\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.outside) 4. The pool looked nice, although we did not use it. It was very far from our rooms. CONS 1. This resort is ridiculously large. It is impossible to get around without a car, which we did not have. Upon check in they drove us (and our luggage) to our rooms on a little golf cart. However, they would not come get us to take us to the lobby after this. The first day it took us 10 minutes to walk to the lobby in our work clothes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were sweating by the time we got there. After the first day we were smart enough to call for a taxi and ask them to come to our room. 2. Over half of the lightbulbs in my room were blown out. This is a simple maintenance thing that the maids should be checking and fixing. I should not have to call to request this. 3. Although there was a kitchenette, there was no dish soap, so I had no way of washing the dishes I used. 4. Sheets are scratchy, pillows hard, and towels are cheap. Think 1-2 star hotel amenities. 5. The fridge is unstocked, and there is only one little take out sandwich type restaurant (think pool bar) on property. 6. This was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overflow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel for the Swan and Dolphin, however it is a good 10-15 minute drive from these other hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not exactly close. And there is no way to get a bus from one hotel to the other without going to downtown Disney and switching buses. Ridiculous. 7. They charge $9.95 a day for internet access (not wireless). In an age where most hotels offer FREE WIRELESS, this seems very outdated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a case of Disney gauging you for everything they can. 8. They offer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153express\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd checkout, yet they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver receipts until after 8 am the day of checkout. Not helpful if you have an early flight 9. $55 cab ride from airport 10. Ground floor rooms have sliders that just open to the outside - does not feel safe at all. I know the typical Orlando visitor is not a business traveler, so perhaps this hotel would be fine if you were there for pleasure, however, I think I still would have been frustrated with the size of the resort and the difficulty posed with trying to get around, and I did not like the feeling of being on a ground floor room with sliders to the outside - not even to a balcony.

Much to our surprise, our room was ready at 1:00, and the Desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Room: We had (2) Studio rooms.

The beds were extremely comfortable (Sealy Posturepedic Encore 720 Plush mattress) and the pull-out was surprisingly comfortable as well. Each room also had a small table and 2 chairs.

I highly suggest renting a vehicle; the convenience was well worth the added cost. Pool: The resort has (2) pools. A small quiet one and the main pool.

The entertainment group would also do poolside Bingo; one of my daughters won a game and was thrilled with a tinkerbell bank as her prize. Food: There are (2) restaurants on site.

When it began to rain, we visited the arcade where air hockey and basketball was free to counter the poor weather. We had lunch at the Artist's Pallete, which was exactly what you would expect for counter service. When booking this vacation, we debated between two hotel rooms and the villa to accommodate our party. I strongly recommend the villa and Saratoga Springs!

We had been at a non-Disney hotel in the area for a work conference and thought since we'd never been to WDW a Disney hotel would be a great option to experience. We got there prior to check in and the room wasn't ready, so we took off for the parks. We returned around 10pm to check in. Upon entering the room it looked a bit worn, and it smelled like smoke. We thought perhaps it was simply a room that had been closed for awhile so just had an \"unused\" smell that would clear out as we began living in it. We unpacked and went to bed. I had difficulty sleeping because I felt like the linens were permeated with the smell and my husband reported the same experience. Around 2am, we had to call the front desk who sent up fresh linens and told me the room was a non-smoking room. (My hair was taking on the smell of the room and I couldn't stand it anymore.) The person who delivered was very courteous and quick, and then sprayed a lot of deodorizer in the room. The deodorizer gave my husband asthma and we sat out on our balcony until 4am until the room cleared--it was pretty toxic!. This did not fix the issue so we went to front desk immediately the next morning. Desk rep was very quick and professional and offered to have another room reserved for us, and hold another so we could inspect it before taking it. We returned to find she had found a room in the same building, which we found to be in much better condition and smell free. Apparently, the hotel went smoke free June 1st, and all the rooms were to have been \"converted\". ( Our first room was converted in theory only). Although the rest of our experience went well, that first nite put sort of a bad flavor into it. No sleep is not a good foundation to base a quick trip of Disney park-hopping. The buses ran well, although going to so many bus stops on the property was a bit tiresome. We used the laundry room and were very satisfied with the facilities. The main pool seemed over-crowded during peak hours. I'm not sure I would return to this property or not.

The studios are a good size for a family of 4 with young children that are willing to share the pull out sofa. I did not sleep on the sofa but my niece said it was comfortable. My youngest child slept in the pack and play crib. The room was very clean and the kitchenette (sink, small fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker) was stocked with glasses, paper plates and plastic utensils. The bathrooms are average size with the sink outside of the main bathroom. There is a large closet and one wardrobe for your clothes. The room is comfortable and well decorated. There is a pull-out sofa beside the Queen Bed (very comfortable) and a small table with two chairs. The resort itself is very large. We stayed in the buildings just off from the main pool. I thought the main pool was a good size but I could see it seeming small for the size of the resort at a busier time of year. My children enjoyed the waterslide and child's small water slide. The interactive water play area was not a big draw with my kids as they found the water cold. We spent a fair amount of our time on the resort at the one of the children's play grounds near a quiet pool. We were normally the only people there except when someone dropped in to do guest laundry or wait at the bus stop that was also set up near this area. The quiet pool had spitting frog statues that were on the first day we were there and the kids loved them but they were not on the next day. On the third day that we went to this pool area I used the phone in the washroom area and asked the Disney staff if they could turn the frogs on, within five minutes the frogs were spitting water again. We did not get a Disney meal plan but did eat at the Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palette once. It is a counter service restaurant and the food was very good. Just down from the main building are the boats to take you to Downtown Disney and there are all kinds of restaurant options there.

We anticipated huge crowds during a prime spring break week, but the resort is so spread out, that while it was very full, it never once felt overcrowded. The most crowded we felt was in the gym during the morning hours. It's a wonderful gym: plenty of cardio machines (ellipticals, bikes, treadmills and a few step-climbers) and also hammer machines, free weights and plenty of other equipment. I went a few times in the morning and there were 15-20 other people in there at once. It felt full, but I never had to wait more than a minute or two to use a machine I wanted. I went later in the afternoon on a few days, and there was only 1 or 2 other guests at that time. The gym is part of the spa facilities, but there is no charge for its use. We stayed in two rooms, both studios in the Congress Park area. The pool in Congress park was much smaller and simpler than the main pool, but lovely and never crowded. (The main pool is where you'll want to go if you have kids, and there are usually many families there, as well as snacks, bingo, etc.) The rooms were quiet on the inside (although the corridors echoed a lot) and our room was on the ground floor, so we had a small patio with two chairs. The studio rooms will sleep four, but they are pretty small for four adults and one of the beds is a full-size sofa-pullout. (Not nearly as comfortable as a bed, but not aweful and certainly fine for children.) There is a small fridge (but plenty big enough for milk, orange juice and a couple bottles of wine or 2-liter of soda. It's big for a mini-fridge), a microwave, coffee maker and they leave paper plates and bowls. Since this is a vacation club property, housekeeping does not come every day, so be prepared to use your towels more than once and make your own bed. (You can have daily housekeeping for an extra charge). We didn't mind every four days, but did wish we had paper cups instead of washing and re-using the same couple of glass cups and mugs. The resort grounds were beautiful and well kept. We played golf one day at Lake Buena Vista which is right on the same property. The course was short, well maintained and fun for a vacation course. The staff at the course (especially in the pro shop) was not great. Our reservation was not taken as it was booked (we had a reservation for four and a confirmation number). When we arrived we were told they only had us down for one player and the man in the pro shop acted as though we were a major pain in the neck and he was doing us a big favor to try and get us in. I understand confusion happens, but at Disney we pay for (and are accustomed to) a \"No Problem\" attitude. I remembered as we left the pro shop that another reviewer on this site had issues at the club as well, so this must be a common thing. The course was pretty full and we had groups in front and behind us the whole round, but that's common at a busy time so no big deal. The course wraps around Saratoga Springs and Key West resorts. Was fun to see that part of the property. For as much play as the course must get, the greens and tee boxes were in good shape. Just double check your reservation and be ready for less-than-helpful staff. We ate at the Turf Club during our stay and had good service and good food. You pay top dollar for a cheeseburger, but it's a resort. And it really is a very good cheeseburger. The ribs and pasta were good at dinner. Best to have a reservation so you won't have to wait. It's a short walk from Congress Park to Downtown Disney (10 minutes) which was great for other dining options and something different to do. To get to the parks the busses came right to the bus stop at Congress Park (and the other stops at Saratoga Springs) but we could easily get on a bus to the boardwalk or anywhere else by walking to downtown disney. In the main resort building there is a marketplace to get quick food, snacks, drinks and disney souvenirs. Tip: if you buy one of the tall insulated mugs you can refill it for free during your stay. They are $12 but worth it if you just want to have a coke or something to take to the pool with you. We didn't learn this until the last day, so we didn't get full use out of them, but it's a nice mug to take home anyway. Since we had been to the parks manytimes, we just wanted a place to be able to come and relax, enjoy a park for a day or two but spend the rest of the time just laying low and still have great service. This was a super place for that. There was enough to do on property to be entertained, and with such a quick walk to downtown disney we could choose whatever we wanted to eat.

We are not Disney Vacation Club members and we booked directly through Disney. We've stayed at Disney previously at Coronado Springs which I loved as a moderate resort. This is definitely several steps up! Saratoga is Disney's newest property and it is HUGE. Depending on what you are looking for, different areas will appeal to you. We stayed at the SPRINGS. It is across from the restaurants/main pool/grocery store/and fitness-spa. However, there is not a real view and it is a long walk to Downtown Disney (there's a path that you can either walk to DD or there is also a bus AND a boat that goes there from Saratoga). We loved being at the Springs, but if you want a quieter location, there are rooms for those people and if you want a view of the lake/downtown Disney be warned that it is loud, but the view is amazing. Call the hotel directly the week you are to arrive and ask them for your preference. The Un-Official Guide to Disney World points out specific rooms that are the best - so check that out. There are four bus stops scattered around the property so you are always close. In my opinion the only reason to stay on Disney property is the transportation. This hotel is 15 minutes from every park and is even closer to Downtown Disney. Buses start picking people up 2 hours before the parks open (and two hrs after park closes), so you will not miss out on anything relying on Disney transportation. We stayed in a 1-bedroom studio which had a full kitchen (with dishes, pots, everything), dining table which seated four (+ 3 bar stools at the breakfast nook). There was a 2-person hot tub, washer and dryer, master bedroom and a living room with a pull-out couch. there was also a small balcony with two chairs. If you are not a DVC member, you will still get daily maid service as well as dish-soap, and laundry detergent. There is also a safe and pack-n-play in these rooms. Elevators are a little difficult to get to from the rooms, so request a main floor room if you don't do stairs very well. This is a great resort for families or big groups because of these huge rooms (some can be combined together and there are others that are even bigger), but there was just the two of us and I thought it was quiet and romantic. If you need groceries, there is a small little store within the Artist's Palette. They've got cereal, eggs, soup, pizza, cheese, sandwich things, fresh fruit, chips, wine, beer, milk, and juice among other things. They also have Mickey Mac-n-cheese which I love. We had breakfast in the room everyday and got everything we needed at the shop. Saratoga Springs is themed after Victorian upstate NY and has an equestrian theme. The grounds are very pretty and we enjoyed going for walks around the property. However, it is not over-the-top Vegas-style Disney, so if you are looking for that, try a different resort. It is really quiet and even though they are still building one wing of the resort, you won't hear a thing and that wing is so far away from where you'll be you might not even realize there is construction going on. All in all, it was a great trip. We stayed for ten days all at Disney and the Disney parks. Highlight of the trip was the Keys to the Kingdom Tour and the Hoop-de-Doo Review. Finally, I just wanted to mention that we did the Disney Dining Plan. Oh my! You will eat all the time - just like a cruise. It was wonderful. There is no way a person could go hungry with the dining plan. We used two of our meals to do the Hoop-de-doo, Very slick.

The \"suite\" was roomy and had all sorts of amenities: washer drier, jacuzzi, cooker, dishwasher, microwave, fridge- freezer, coffee-maker and a very comfortable spacious bedroom. Only criticism was that though there was plenty of draw space for clothes the closet was extremely small to hang clothes up. We would suggest that when booking you request the top floor as we heard the guests above quite regularly and the carpeting was not good in terms of noise insulation. The high speed internet connection at $10 per day was adequate. The total experience was well orchestrated, the staff pleasant and helpful but don't expect any flexibility with special requests like late check outs. Buses to the theme parks were frequent but we used our rental car. As Disney guests we had free parking and transfer from the parking lots to the park entrance was very efficient. The restaurants at the hotel were Ok if a little uninspired. However there were plenty of options near by and in Downtown Disney ,which could be reached on foot, by bus or car.

Our trip was an extended family trip with a total of 10 people (kids were 5 to 11). We stayed in a grand villa in the congress park section. The resort is spread out but I think that was the idea. I mean the whole saratoga / horse / health thing seems to make sense that they want you to think about health and also you are going to get some exercise. I liked the spead out resort. The exercise facility is rated as the best in Disney. It is sweet. Nice wide walkways to walk around the resort on. The room was beautiful. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was very good. The surround sound system for the TV worked. I brought a few movies so we could have the kids wind down with a DVD in the evening. The location was great. There was always room in the hot tub and usually you were the only person / couple there in the evening. A little idea for you that our group of kids loved. The Grand Villa has a balcony. I bought a paper airplane book that comes with the paper and directions for like 15 different styles of airplane. First they never knew you could fly so many different shaped objects. But second, they played for like 3 hours one night just folding and tossing them off the balcony and then heading downstairs to retreive. The 11 year old was so excited he pretty much coordinated teaching all of the younger ones with how to make them. Immaculate would be a good word to describe the landscaped areas of the resort. The theme pool (High Rock) was perfect for the kids. The slide was great. We only had limited time to play in the pool though because it was go-go-go to see the parks. Congress Park is closest to the Downtown Disney (DD) area. You can walk or take a boat there. We walked around the lake to reach DD several times to shop or eat. The boat ride across the lake to DD was nice but for our room location, the boat ride ended up being the same amount of walking as if we just walked around the lake in the first place. But the kids liked the ride so we did it a few times. I cannot say enough about the irish restaurant in DD (Raglan). I know... my wife said what you just thought, too (Boiled Food?). But I like a nice pint of Guiness and was in the mood to experiment. You're all wrong. My wife even agreed with me that it was the BEST meal we had on the vacation.

It's a vacation in itself. In fact, we only went out to the theme parks 3 of our 5 days there. We had a studio room on a ground floor with a patio and easy access to the quiet pool, laundry and bus top. The resorts perks are a community hall, where you can play ping pong, various video games and do scheduled crafts and activities, great for kids! Also the pool has a great slide and the water temp was perfect. Also, we rented bikes and rode over to Old Key West and along the river there. Very scenic and relaxing. The decor of the rooms and the design of the resort are beautiful. Various birds and waterfowl added to the beauty. A couple of drawbacks are the size of the resort. We were happy with the location of our room, but I could see how some locations would be very inconvenient to geting to the main bldg. to eat or main pool to swim. They do have an internal bus that takes you from area to area in the reort, didn't try this, might be a good option. The only other minor issue was the variety of foods availalbe in the food court. No burgers, fries. They had a chickn strip meal with chips, a few varieties of salads and flatbread pizzas. I like the food but my 11 year old is used to regular pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc. We visited downtown disney quite a lot as the bus stop was right outside our door and then we would take the ferry back. The bus ride on the way back is quite long since they have to make a few stops, so I recommend the water taxi since it goes to Saratoga first then OKW. We never waited more than 10 min for a bus to the parks We had the dining plan and it was worth every penney.

We stayed for 5 nights at the Saratoga Springs resort. The resort was very clean and the people were very nice and helpful. It took us 10 minutes to check in. We had express check out, so our bill was on our door in the morning. Everthing was correct so we just left without having to go to the front desk. The rooms were very spacious and clean. We had a two bedroom villa. It was wonderful not having to go home with a weeks worth of laundry for four people. The cleaning service was offered everyday if we wanted. A basket of towels and toiletries were put out side of our door every morning if needed. The most we ever waited for a bus was 10 minutes. We stayed in the Paddock, I would recomend it highly. We took advantage of the Extra Magic hours offered to the Disney Resort guest and did not wait in any lines longer than 10 - 20 minutes. Since these extra hours were at night we did not have to put up with the heat of the day. During the day we would do the water parks and Disney Quest. The Disney Dining package is wonderful. There is no way you can eat any cheaper than that. We had 1 snack, 1 counter service meal and 1 table service meal a day. You can use them however you want. You can not beat the price!! I have to say this was probably the best Disney Vacation we ever had!!", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windham, Maine", "Title": "\u201cDad, You Shuold Have Been There. . . .\u201d", "Author": "LisaBoubie", "ReviewID": "UR5528852", "Content": "Saratoga Springs is as expected; beautiful, well built, and nice to stroll around. Disney has kept to their typically high level of standards on the grounds of this new resort. Antiques tucked away for viewing in quiet corners, whimsical paintings where we know to hunt for hidden Mickey's and are never disappointed, and a lovely reception building with a great and helpful staff. All in all I really like the Disney Resorts, but while Saratoga Springs is pretty, it's nothing 'special'. The theme doesn't pull you in like Old Key West, or the Wilderness Lodge. I wouldn't be unhappy staying here again, but it is not my first choice when I do. Let me say the staff is the reason I bought my DVC membership. I expect and receive great friendly service consistently from the concierge to the sweepers. I never leave their property unhappy. The pool is nicely decorated. Plenty of lounge chairs and tables, the water slide is fun and the hot springs are cute. There are two hot tobs to relax in, which I highly recommend to get those muscles ready for another day of walking! We rented a one berdroom apartment for four nights. I requested and was given a room on the third floor (the building has a central elevator). It was very nice, impeccably clean with everything you could need to relax and be comfortable. The jacuzzi was used everyday, the shower was great with steaming hot water and a shower massage, in spite of three people using it consecutively. There was even a laundry line to hang delicate items on. I am glad Disney has finally put hair dryers in all their hotel rooms. As usual the one bedroom rental also has a washer and dryer (unfortunately it was very loud so don't plan on washing at night while you sleep) a seperate toilet room, and a fully equipped kitchen The living room had a very comfortable pull out couch, which cannot be closed properly with the linens on, so it was in the way as we were unwilling to commit to remaking it every day after hiking through the hot parks. So we walked around it. There was also a dvd/cd player as well as an oversized TV. Of course the California king bed was large, but I cannot understand why Disney does not choose better linens, it's not as if they have trouble renting out their rooms and they charge and arm and a leg, you don't get maid service everyday so why have sheets that are below the standard of a resort such as this? And what's with the hard foam pillows? I recently stayed at the Omni, now those were sheets and pillow (down)! And they even provided bathrobes. That is my only real complaint. My kid's and I enjoyed eating at the on site 'cafeteria'. The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was good. We did not eat at the bar and grill, but since there is only one kitchen, one would assume the food is the same good quality standard. There are several nearby grocery stores, but I recommend you head for Publix. The gourmet shoppe at the CrossRoads, the place across from the Buena Vista entrance, is ridiculously expensive.", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waldwick, NJ", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful time- Waldwick,NJ\u201d", "Author": "Huggiebear5081", "ReviewID": "UR5495663", "Content": "We belong to DVC and this was the first time we ever booked a three bedroom.

Get to room, smelled like wet dirty socks. Crud all over the tv screen. I immediately called to a maid that was nearby and she was apologetic and told me to call the front desk as she wasn't the one who cleaned the room. Called front desk was told someone would come clean while we were out to dinner, nope didn't happened called front desk when back from dinner explained that we needed another room, was told she could have someone bring the key or that I could come down to the front office and pick up a new key. I drive down and I waited at least 25 mins in line before being waited on then nothing was notated that I even called down to change rooms. Finally get new room get luggage and kids over to new room and it was filthy as well. There were still balloons in the room that other patron must have left behind, finger prints all over the tv screen crap on the counter by sink. For the amount they charge non florida residents 400 plus a night, its a total scam! I was pissed paying the florida resident deal 159.00 a night. The cleanliness and wear and tear in the rooms reminded me of a cheap stay at a 69.99 a night hotel. I would be cautious when staying here. The only good thing about the hotel was the kids enjoyed the slide at the pool, but even that was very crowded no matter what time we ventured over.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Margarita, California", "Title": "\u201cWe love it!\u201d", "Author": "eme1970", "ReviewID": "UR5354470", "Content": "We recently bought into the Disney Vacation Club and this is our \"home resort\".

The room itself, a 2bedroom 2bath was terrific. Spacious, great beds, good views and the washer/dryer was a huge benefit. Internet is $10/day and TV channels are limited to mostly Disney and Disney Owned Networks...really annoying in a nearly $600/night unit...particularly when they greet you with \"Welcome Home\" in the lobby... but not unexpected. Our location was perfect on the property if you like to walk to Downtown Disney instead of taking the boat or a bus. There was a nice quiet pool nearby. Small kids would prefer the main pool locations near the main lobby. The property is really spread out and more units are under construction. Picking the right location for your particular needs at Saratoga is important. The walks around the property can be quite lengthy...no big deal, unless it's raining! and to get to any restaurants or parks you mostly are riding buses. There is a small but really good food counter (Artist's Palette) on the property but getting there from most units on the site is a hassle and we only did it once. Just wasn't worth the hassle of walking there. The store is sparse, but adequate. Disney property bus service left us waiting as long as 35 minutes three different times to get to different parks...but this isn't unique to the Saratoga. We had various problems with the front desk resulting in lengthy check ins and check outs (an hour each even though it was uncrowded) and the luggage pickup was nearly a half hour late on departure. If I didn't keep calling, not sure if they ever would have shown up. And be aware that they do not announce Magical Express from the lobby nor can you see the buses like you can in other Disney hotels. We almost missed the bus because of this... waiting inside for the bus instead of outside in the rain. And the luggage nearly didn't make it on the bus because the porter put it in the wrong location. If my wife hadn't spotted the cart just before the bus left, it would have left without our luggage...so watch your luggage if using Magical Express or other transportation and the bell service at Saratoga. In summary, we probably will return to one of the hotels onsite for future visits even if it means multiple rooms and higher cost for the convenience, amenities and service of a hotel but if you are looking for large spacious and really comfortable accomodations with a washer/dryer and kitchen in a quiet location on Disney property...and want to keep an eye on your kids, then you will enjoy the Saratoga.

The studio was extremely well equipped with a microwave, fridge , dishes and cutlery etc. etc. For the first time ever I did our washing whilst away as there was such a handy launderette at the swimming pool area.

We stayed in a studio, which was perfect for my Husband and I. It was wonderful to wake up and have your first cup of coffee sitting out on your balcony overlooking a peaceful lake!!! Although the hotel isn't far from Downtown Disney, we weren't bothered by any noise, light etc. and in fact we found it beneficial as we could get a bus to the Marketplace at Downtown and have a 10 minute walk back to our accomodation. Very useful if you are going to or from another resort for dinner. My main advice would be: If you are staying in a studio, the kitchens aren't too well equipted. I suggest taking a sharp knife for cutting cheese, etc. and some scissors. For international travellers DO NOT make international calls from your room. The rates aren't advertised and we called the UK twice from our room, only for a few minutes each, and they charged us $50.99 each call. If you want some rest and relaxation by the pool, don't use the main Springs pool, as it gets very crowded, the others are a lot quieter for adults or young families. Don't pre-book your groceries before you go. The selection in the shop is a lot better and much much better value. Finally, may I suggest that you consider taking Disney up on their dining plan. It is great value and after 14 days, we would have spent another $380 if we had paid individually for what we had.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Charleston, WV", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay at Saratoga...still room for improvement\u201d", "Author": "brandyandbrian", "ReviewID": "UR4826616", "Content": "First let me say that Saratoga Springs ia a beautiful, picturesque resort on Disney property. My husband and I stayed in a studio for 4 nights in late March. We were in The Springs which was near the pool and main building. Our rooms were nice, new, and most importantly clean. This trip was just for relaxation (we only went to the parks once) so Saratoga was perfect for this. However if you are doing the park thing everyday, particularly sith smaller kids, you may want to stay elsewhere as Saratoga Springs is a little out of the way. I did a spa paskage one day and must say it was incredible. We are frequent travelers so I have visited many spas and this was truly one of the best (i think it is much better than the one at the Grand Floridian.) Now for what could be improved: 1. Larger beds needed in the studio. The studios only have a double bed and if you are used to a Queen or King, you will notice the smaller size. 2. I agree with previous posters ~ this place needs a full service restaurant. Artist's Palette (the only restaurant on property is counter service. Yes you are close to Downtown Disney, but it would be nice to have a better restaurant at the hotel. This is a large hotel and I guantee the restaurant would always be packed. 3. The restaurant should open before 7:30 a.m., particularly during peak season when the parks open early. 4. Prior to 4:30 p.m. the boats to downtown disney only run every hour and htey should run more frequently. Yes you can walk, but depending where your room is at Saratoga it can be a very long walk (particularly in the heat). Note is you want the shorter walk, request a room in the Congress Park section of the resort. Overall we had a nice stay, and this is a very nice resort.
