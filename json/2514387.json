We chose this hotel because of its location and price. We read reviews and knew that it was an older hotel but didn't think that would be a problem. When we arrived, we were impressed with the staff and the lobby was beautiful. However, our room was really old looking with uncomfortable beds and furniture. In addition the room was very hot and after turning the air conditioner on, it took until the next day to get to a comfortable temperature. And when I say old I mean things like electric sockets being painted over so many times that plugs wouldn't stay plugged in. The bathroom was also very small with no counter at all.

A BIG pro is the location. It is right off of Times Square. Just a couple minutes walk and you are right in the heart of it. Super loction for that area of NY City. The subway is also very close by. Elevators were easy to come by. Queen sized beds - rather than small double beds. They have a transportation desk available if you need a shuttle or airport arrangements as well. Cons: Old. I LOVE old and appreciate old (the old metal doorknobs, furniture, fixtures, etc). But, the carpet could be replaced and most of all, the bedding. The bedspreads were kinda' gross and we took them off of the beds each day immediately upon entering the room. The bathtub was a bit dinged up, I'm assuming from age, but that made it seem dirty. There was a musty smell as well. Also, the bathroom was extremely small and the door to the bathroom was directly across from the door to the closet and right in front of the door to the room. So, we had some door issues getting in and out. WiFi was not included and the information in the room said it was $3.95 for 15 minutes! That was enought to scare me away, but another person in our group said that if you called downstairs they offer a daily rate of $7 per day. That would've been nice to know. The hot water is tricky and will change from hot to lava hot with every flush in the joint. So, just be aware and on your toes to quickly move out of the way when needed. The lobby was nice, but a bit restricted. They have a seating area, which was convenient for our group to meet at, but they are very strict with No food or luggage allowed inside of this area.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all!\u201d", "Author": "PatsyRodriguez", "ReviewID": "UR127299864", "Content": "I was a little leery booking this hotel because of the reviews but because we got such a fantastic rate and we wouldn't be spending very much time in the room we took it.

Prior to arriving, I had originally booked a room with 2 single beds, but emailed a request for 2 double beds and a renovated room. I received an email response that my requests were granted. When we checked in, we were given a room with 2 queen beds - which was a nice surprise. The room was clean, roomy and comfortable despite the age of this hotel. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and provided us plenty with of towels. We ate at the restaurant, Sophia's, which was wonderful. Great food and great service. They have a cafe also which provided take-out - very convenient. If I had one complaint, it was the noise level from the street. We were on the 5th Floor and there was jackhammering in the street below from 12:30 am to 5:00 am. Thank God I brought earplugs. We considered asking for a room on a higher floor, but decided not to move. If I were to stay again, I'd make sure I had a room on a higher floor,. There were plenty of elevators that were fast and convenient. The hotel also has a small gift shop and fitness center.

We have yet to do so upon a visit and have once again seen why we should. The hotel, upon entry was great. The bell men were extremely helpful, the lobby is very well decorated in an art deco theme, and the sitting area is packed with guests. We came to see that the packed with guests were the people waiting for a room, which they didn't have available to us any early than our 3pm sharp check in. We had requested a renovated room, as those were the better quality rooms as we had read in these reviews. We were told one was not ready, but gave us the option to see another room should we want it. We checked it out and it was nothing special and opted to wait. We came back at check in and our renovated room was thus not available, so we were just given any room. If that was the case to begin with, we would've taken any room and were thus discouraged they did not take our request. The room was nothing special, a two bedroom \"suite\". Upon entrance, the only two closests are found as part of the first room. The second room has the only entry to the bathroom. We booked this room as we were told it would be two bathrooms and at that point, were happy to have a room to go back and request anything else. Both rooms had outdated furniture and decor, lamps that did not properly work, but were equipped with flat screen tvs (if that's even a selling point). The bathroom was extremely small, no more than two people could fit in at once, and the water pressure in the shower was high, so it was not the most comfortable bath. The heat seemed to be central, or beyond our control, as we would get extremely hot on the cold days we spent there, thus forced to open up a window to cool down as we got dressed. The overall stay was good, no complaints, as at the end of the day it was a place to sleep and shower. If you're looking for a cheap place near Times Square, we would recommend this location as its right there. For us and what we got, we could've stayed at the chained hotel next door for the same amount and got a better quality room, even if we had to share sleep space.

There's a great bagel place on the way to the subway named Time Square Bagels. Any line in the morning move quickly, but know what you want or you'll get treated like an idiot. Let's be honest though, if you're standing in line with a giant sign/menu in front of you for five minutes, and you don't know what you want, well, you kinda deserve it.

I received an email confirming these exact details the same day which all looked promising, how wrong I was! On arriving at the hotel, I was a little disappointed at how different, or should I say run down, the exterior of the hotel was compared to the pictures on the web and within brochures. Once inside, however, the lobby/reception area was a little better. This feeling soon faded when we began the check in process. We were booked in by the 'assistant manager' who booked us into a double room with a pull out sofabed (I was travelling with my sister and my father) on explaining that this room was unsuitable and on producing the email confirming the booking I had made for a specfic type of room, the assistant manager told me over and over again that the hotel did not operate a policy where the would guarantee a specific room and the member of staff who sent me the email was wrong to do so. On attempting to discuss the situation with the assistant manager, she constantly spoke over me telling me she was trying to explain what the hotel policy was. Not very professional or polite, I thought! The assistant manager then told me that she could give us another room that one of us could stay in - a bit of a compromise we were prepared to make until she said it was going to to cost us $229.00 per night!! Clearly that wasn't happening. On asking, again, to see 'the' manager, the assistant manager went into a back office and reappered five or so mins later when she, in a very unfriendly manner, told me she had a suite with three beds she would move us to, excellent, I thought. Where to start with the 'suite'. The bathroom was awful. The grout between the tiles was black and mouldy, the toilet bowl was situated in such a stupid postion that you had to step over it to get into the bathroom itself. The shower was little more than a warm drip. Not great. The beds were comfortable but the room badly needs redecorated. The carpets were threadbare and the walls were filthy, there was even a bootprint halfway up our wall!! In saying all this however, I must say, we did sleep very well as it was very quite (21st floor) and the bed linen was clean. And now to Cafe Edison. This 'restaurant' is attached to the hotel, I believe it is rented independently but to the average guest, one would presume that it was part of the hotel. We were fortunate enough to only enter this place once. We went for breakfast on Tuesday morning. The first word that springs to mind regarding this place is 'dire'. Service was quick, thankfully, so quick, infact, that my sister's tea cup had not even been cleaned on the outside after another unfortunate patron has drank from it!! After just one bite of my toast, my eyes suddenly locked onto the mouse that ran across the dining room!! We, quite clearly left, immediately, despite the waiter shouting that we had not paid the bill. We never did pay the bill! On complaining to the manager, I have to admit that he dealt with the complaint promptly and he himself was horrified and embarrassed by the mouse situation. Financial compensation was offered to us and accepted by us on check out.

You can also leave your luggage at the hotel after checking out at a very reasonable 50 cents per bag.There is a little shop in the hotel where you can buy snacks, papers and gifts, which we found to be cheaper than the other touristy shops in the area.

It was so small, the bed did barely fit in there and was tiny. The furniture and bed looked so old and tired. And we almost couldn't fit our luggage in the room. We couldn't accept that. The other two times we were here we got much bigger rooms with a much newer interiour. So my wife went back down to the front desk and told the we will not accept this. We booked long ahead, we stayed here before, we will stay for 7 nights and will not accept this room. If not, we want our money back and stay somewhere else. After a few minutes the manager stepped in and....surprisingly there WAS another room available. A lot bigger room with a King-Bed ... the room was more than twice the size of the other one. After that our day was saved and we could enjoy our 7 nights in NYC. The Hotel itself is dated, but the location is, for this price, unbeatable! The room was clean and actually really big (by NYC standard). The bathroom was also a quite dated, but clean enough. And even though the Hotel is so close to Times Square, we had quiet nights here and a really good sleep. We had a good week, after a pretty bad start. It's comfy, it's safe and you just really get great value here. Staff is helpful and nice (not counting the Check-In). We sure would stay again. But just be aware that room sizes and qualities do very much vary obviously. Check your room and, if you're unhappy, insist on getting a better one. Wanna know more about my trips?

This time, however, shall probably likewise be my last one as I have to admit that I no longer find price and product matching. The hotel was worse than ever as to d\u00e9cor and service. Nothing has really happened here since my very first stay way back \u2013 apart from escalating prices! On the positive side you find no better location. The Edison is a few yards from the hustle and bustle of the ever alive Times Square and hence the perfect place to stay if you are in town for sightseeing and theatre. All major theatres are minutes of leisurely strolls away only \u2013 and last minute tickets can be purchased at the booth right on the square at affordable rates. The many sightseeing buses have their regular stops here too - and you can easily walk the short distance to the \u201cmust-see\u201d places such as elegant 5th Avenue, Central Park, Park Ave., the impressive Rockefeller Center with lovely caf\u00e9s, restaurants and shops and fantastic Radio City Music Hall for grand shows and concerts. It\u2019s really difficult to find a much better location, if you are to explore the Big Apple. But \u2013 there is really nothing nice otherwise to be said about the hotel as such. In spite of several refurbishing rounds, it looks still very old and shabby. The regular rooms are tiny \u2013 even compared to European standard \u2013 which says a lot. You can hardly squeeze a double bed with a single side table into the rooms, that seem dark and uninviting. The bathrooms are likewise tiny and look like they have been painted over and over without anyone having removed the old peeled paint prior to. I can really say nothing nice about these rooms apart from it being a place to put your suitcase and drop your head for a bit of sleep. Being in a typical old New York building your view is likewise most likely to be the room across from you and with really nothing to look at and keeping light out. The rooms have no facilities to mention and are lacking security boxes. You need still to go down to the reception and ask for them to store your valuables in a vault \u2013 meaning having to queue additionally up whenever you need any of your stuff or need to open/close your box. Service has never been the big deal at this hotel \u2013 but now there isn\u2019t any at all. We had to wait rather long at the check-in counter to catch the interest of the clerk, who was chatting with his colleagues rather than tending to the guests. No porter was called to help us with our luggage (not a problem for us being European, but pretty odd at an American hotel especially as they have a bell-boy desk\u2026). I\u2019m sorry to say, that it\u2019s sad to see such a hotel with so much potential not caring for neither the property nor its customers.

The location of the hotel is great as its in walking distance to most things to see. After a delayed flight we arrived later than planned to new york and decided that we would get some sleep before exploring the city. On first appearances the room looked ok, maybe a little dated, not the queen bed or refurbished room we had requested but the view made up for this a little. Someone had left the bathroom window open which was making the room quite cold as it was late, when my hsuband tried to close it the window fell out on him in the bathroom - quite a death trap to be honest with potential to seriously hurt yourself or someone passing by on the street below if it fell the opposite way. We were prepared that being so close to times square that there maybe be some noise in the room however we weren't prepared on the noises from the hotel itself - after falling asleep I was woken in fear, in my sleepy daze I thought someone had managed to get into the room while we were alseep and was now crashing around in our bathroom, as my husband went to investigate it turned out to be the heating pipe in the bathroom that ran between floors (I would explain this to sound like someone hitting a scafolding pole repeatedly with a heavy duty spanner), this started off our first sleepless night as it would eventually stop banging after 10 - 15mins and then start again about 20 min's later. We got what sleep we could and in the morning complained and asked for someone to have a look at our room. After explaining the situation to reception the reluctantly sent someone up to have a look, he arrived promptly, looked at it and immediately proceeded to explain that there was nothing he could do as it was the heating pipe for the hotel and it would proceed to make the noise every 30mins as thats what the heating timer was set to and it may make these noises more frequently if it is could outside as it is set to maintain a certain temperature. After complaining further the reception reluctantly changed our room but couldn't understand what all the fuss was about as apparently this is the norm for new york hotels! Room 2 - seemed to be closer to times square as your could hear the police cars clearer starting and stopping their sirens trying to get through the traffic. However we were now woken up our neighbours each time they would run any water (sink, shower or toilet) which would sound like they were in the room with us. Certainly in our own room you wouldn't want to have a wash in the sink or take a shower if your partner was still asleep and wouldn't dare flush the toilet as this would end is an extremely loud vibration and bang after the bowl emptied. In the end we gave up and decided not to continue complaining as the chances of finding a room of good standards in this hotel seem to be slim and although our second room had its problems it was the lesser of two evils. The room keepers are dreadful, the do not understand what the do not disturb signs mean as they would continue to enter the room, on 3 nights they knocked on our door in the early hours of the morning (with the sign on the door) attempting to give us bedding that we hadn't requested and would not appologise when they were told they had the wrong room, one on occasion not even the floor number was correct let alone the room number. Generally the staff are unhelpful, especially the door man how would scowl at you and even go to the extent of walking away from the door without opening it for you when your hands were full with bags etc. The bar was in our opinion exspensive. We tried once to enter the small shop that was reported to have essentials but it was closed. The reception was more often than not unhelpful. Conceirge were helpful enough however I would not suggest getting theatre tickets from them as they are expensive and can be brought cheaper elsewhere. After all the other problems with the hotel I wasn't happy about trying the hotel restaurants and preffered to eat elsewhere. The hotel does offer luggage storage after you check out at a rate of 50c per bag per day however one or two of the bell men will expect a high tip as I was listening to one requesting tips from others storing their luggage.

We were not disappointed with this decision. The Milford is currently a building site and would have meant for an awful stay in NY. In comparison, we found the Edison to be peaceful, relaxing, friendly, clean, and an ideal location. As one of our party has not been keeping great health recently, taking a suite was the ideal decision as it meant he was able to relax in much more comfort. Yes, the room was a little dated but you get what you pay for -if I wanted super luxurious, modern quality I would have gone elsewhere and paid three times the price. That said, the suite was clean, comfortable, the bed was soft, the bathroom well stocked and clean, and we really couldn't find fault. I have read reviews on here of construction work going on - I was not aware of any work going on in the hotel, maybe we were just lucky. Will we back? Oh yes.

(The sales/reservations staff had helped us out in an extremely kind gesture due to changes in our reservations related to a death of a member of the family who was also a long-time Edison patron.) The two room suite worked out fine for the three people in our party, with a sofa bed in one room and a queen bed in the other. The bathrooms at the Edison are not huge but they serve their purpose. The Edison is a New York institution, built in the era of Art Deco. Their lobby is a prime example of spot-on renovation and restoration with New York murals on the walls in the style of the 1930's. It's a classic theatre district hotel. When you choose the Edison, it is not going to be the Ritz Carlton as far as furnishings, but the price is not going to be the Ritz Carlton either!!! The Cafe Edison is my favorite New York breakfast spot - the waitstaff are friendly, fast-paced and pure New York. Sofia's, a restaurant and bar in the hotel, offers great cocktails and conversation. The crowd seems to be a mix of locals (some who work in the nearby theatres) and tourists. The Edison's location is prime. You can be in Sofia's at 7:45 PM and stil make any 8:00 PM curtain in the theatre district by walking there.

Our room was huge and seemed very nice. It overlooked the Barrymore theatre roof and looked into some offices and apartments but was not too intrusive. Even at 14 floors, if you are a light sleeper, you'll struggle to get any shut eye due to the noise from traffic horns, sirens and party people out having a good time. The bathroom was adequate for our needs but was a bit dated. The lobby areas are very nice and there always seemed to be plenty of staff on hand for any queries you may have.

My only warning would be in terms of the beds, which can range from very comfortable to very hard depending which room you get. Our first night proved to be less-than-comfortable as we got a hard-bed room, and had difficulty figuring out how to cool off the room. We reported our concerns to the front desk staff and they were very helpful and apologetic, offering to show me several rooms they had available to see if there might be a room with softer beds. We found one that fit the bill, and spent the final two nights there sleeping comfortably. They also gave us the first night free due to our concerns with the room discomfort, which was nice. My advice is to sit or lay down on the bed when you check into the room before unpacking, to make sure you have a room with a comfortable bed. Some of the rooms have been recently renovated, but some of them have hard beds too. We also requested a room facing away from the street on a higher floor, and weren't bothered by any street noise. There's also plenty of elevators, so we never had to wait long for one. There are computers available for guests to use for a charge, but not as expensive as some other hotels I've stayed at.

One very positive aspect of this room (the first of two we stayed in during this visit) was the shower in the bathroom. Our experience with hotel showers is generally not good, and we didn't expect much this time, but were very pleasantly surprised with the excellent water pressure, as well as the height of the shower on the tub wall. My wife and I are both tall, and the shower was a wonderful treat after a day of walking the streets of New York. We had our 16th floor room for one night, and then checked out so that we could re-check in under a different reservation when the rest of our family joined us. Our second room was on the 5th floor and was much larger, and had obviously been renovated. Shower was just as good there, too, though!

I do not know if all rooms are arranged as suites, or if you have to reserve it. I did have the option of a 'regular room' or 'delux'. I chose delux because it was just an extra $10 per night.

Sheets were clean and no signs of tiny livestock (on us or linens) older oversized closet (walk-in is a stretch) nice size however the anti-theft hanger system is a pain if you travel with your own hangers. Bathroom was the same vintage as the beautiful lobby although not as well maintained. No Bar Fridge (although, their web site says I will have to leave a credit card to use the fridge or the phone) and no WI-FI without the $9.95 per day charge. Disappointed that I couldn't check with home in Canada without extra charges in roaming fees, rooms phone charges or Internet access. Our view was awful however, I have no doubt there are worse views and you are staying in Manhatten so just what view do you expect for what you are paying? 2) The Hotel: It's New Years Eve in NYC, they have one ice machine in the entire hotel (really!?) and it's broken. So not impressed. The lobby? it is a work of art and I so wished the rest of the hotel lived up to its promise. I know they are trying to keep up the renovation work and I know it is not easy to get everything done as quickly as people want, they could be a little more honest with their web site and show what they offer today. Not what they will offer in the future (renovated rooms) or what they offered many years ago (the views from their rooftop of Times Square which have been blocked for years). 3) The Location: A 5 minute walk from times Square when we were there for New Years Eve was a huge bonus. Theatres all around, and most a very short walk, first rate for that advantage. 5 - 10 minutes down 46th takes you into Restaurant Row, choose your cuisine and price range and you will find it, many Zagat rated. 4) The attached Coffee/Breakfast shop. Is a downtown city, breakfast eatery. It's fast, cheap and average. If you want the Waldorf go there and pay $25 for Eggs Benedict not $9.95. One warning, like much of NYC the gratuity is included so watch your tipping. 5) The concierge staff: A complete waste of time, tried to recommend Midtown Cigars when I was looking for Nat Sherman, not in the same league. Couldn't do anything for theatre tickets other than rack prices or tell me to stand in line. Like most mid-line hotels with Concierge they are nothing but glorified information desks. Not the Concierge of past who knew everything about a city and where to get anything, and I mean anything.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cI had a great time for my first time in NY and this hotel made the difference\u201d", "Author": "cdanielle504", "ReviewID": "UR122437664", "Content": "I stayed in this very prime location for New Years Eve for Times Square.

Many Times Sq. hotels can brad about a great location and even good pricing but the one thing this hotel has over the others is the fantastic service.

We never waited more than 4 or 5 minutes at the front desk and usually did not have to wait at all.. We were always greeted with a smile and helpful attitude. The hotel has plenty of staff during busy times. When we asked for extra linens - they were delivered to our room in about five minutes. We felt very secure as there is always at least one security person at the elevators on the ground floor. We witnessed two guards stop a group of young men from entering the elevators because they did not have room keys.. There is a nice little cafe next door - decent prices and good food. A great deli, one door away. It's a 30-second walk to the center of Times Square and TKTS.and only about 7 minutes to even the furthest B'way theatre (most are much closer - including two or three on the same block) The corridors are a bit threadbare but the room we stayed in had recently been renovated. It was a suite with two rooms, one queen bed and one sofa sleeper. I dread the sofa sleepers but this one looked nearly brand new and was very comfortable. We were allowed to check in at noon, although the stated check-in time was 3pm. We were also allowed a late check in and checked our bags in the lobby for only fifty cents per bag. An efficient crew of 3 bellmen made sure there was no wait to speak of to either check or retrieve bags. Heat worked very well and the Edison has the deepest bathtubs in Midtown. We love this hotel.

The doors were original which added a nice touch, but the bathroom had been completely updated.

Does New York City not have public health inspectors?\u201d", "Author": "VBSLondon", "ReviewID": "UR121728252", "Content": "Without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, outside of India. This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by \"new reviewers\", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed \"damage limitation department\". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully \"third time lucky\", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of \"ventilation hole\" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at \"Delta\", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the \"1 review\" brigade that posts rave reviews.

Please note that the hotel is getting renovated.. Rome wasn't built in a day so not all rooms have been refurbished yet! At frst we were given a room where the fittings & decor were slightly older and had seen better days and a few powerpoints weren't working and we made a simple phonecall to reception requesting a room change. We were met at reception by a very lovely woman named Erica! This woman looks and sounds like J-Lo! She was very polite and amazingly helpful and sorted out a room for us that was refurbished and even accompanied us to the room to make sure we were happy with the result! Security is this hotel is awesome! No-one is allowed in the lifts unless they have a room key and this is checked by 2-3 big & burly security guards as you enter the lift area!

Of course not - silly .... closer inspection showed that the curtains were not actually on a rail but had been screwed directly through the fabric into the wall. Someone had obviously tried to close them (as one would) and ripped them away from their fix. Dirty nets, dead bugs and a mouldy bathroom added to the 'interest' of this room.

If you are looking for the greatest hotel in the history of hotels, don't book here.

It is a minutes walk from four Subway staions which will take you everywhere. You are 15 seconds from times square. about ten minutes slow walk from central park, a 5 minute subway ride from theempire state, what more could you possibly want?? Please bear in mind it is not the Hilton where you would pay for one night what you would get a week in here. I booked this through a package deal and got it very cheap. The second i arrived at the airport, 23rd September i think, there was a 5.9 earthquake in virginia, yet despite the fact that the hotel staff probably had to do safety checks of things like the boiler systems and gas tanks and whatnot, we got checked in straight away into to our decent sized airconditioned room with a TV, Bath/Shower and everything else we needed. The only thing it didn't have that could have been useful was a fridge. however we just used the air-con for that. our stay in the hotel was delightful, with no problems. then, the day before we were set to go home, a HURRICANE roaring up the east coast caused all of the flights to be cancelled. So after a ridiculous amount of time trying to get through the travel agants, insurance people and booking agents, they sent an email to the hotel extending our stay, (as we had to remain in NYC for another 6 days!!!! (which isnt really a bad thing :) )) when we went down to the desk the manager came to see us personally and extended our stay at no extra charge to us. We were even offered a bigger room which we declined as all of our stuff was already unpacked in our room. Despite the several setbacks to the trip, the hotel made it as comfortable as possible, and gave us advice on what to do should it be bad (which forunatley for Manhattan, it wasn't.) which was nice as we had no idea what we should do in a hurricane or earthquake. The restaurant and the deli on either side of the hotel served low priced very nice food and drinks, ( a beer costing 3 -4 dollars as opposed to the 8-15 in bars and other restaurants.) And, they stayed ipen during the Hurricane for patrons of the hotel. The location, the room and the staff made our stay excellent, and helped turn a really quite scary experience (as although the hurricane turned out to not affect Manhattan, no body really knew what was going to happen, ourselves especially) into a really memorable trip, and our room on the 12th floor of the Edison hotel is a major part of that. I know this review isnt really relevant to people who are looking to book a trip, i am simply saying that the hotel helped to make our extended holiday really really great.

Out of our 5 night stay in the US, we stayed here for 1 night, went to Boston for 2 night's then returned here for 2 more night's. On arrival on the 1st October, the receptionist was friendly and professional enough and was really helpful. We went to our room on the 9th floor and as soon as the lift door opened and saw the decor I knew it wasn't as good as the website made it out to be. We got to our room and it was dull and dreary and looked like it could do with decorating. Like a previous comment on here has said, the sockets were not very safe. Our view was of a parking lot and the room felt cold because it had no natural sunlight. We thought maybe that because we were only staying for 1 night, we may get a better room when we returned. We arrived back at The Edison on the 4th October. When I went to reception, I knew we were early for check in and thought that we may have to wait for our room, so was quite prepared to put bags into left luggage and go out for a while. The man on reception was miserable. He informed me we were to early for check in, demanded to see a voucher from the travel agent, wanted a passport and a credit card and said all this without using the word PLEASE!!!! There was a room ready and sadly it was no better than the first one we had. If anything it was smaller, the bathroom was like a cupboard and again the socket's were a bit dodgy. Our view this time was of the hotel's air conditioning unit, which was going all night and on the last night there, my wife was woken at 4.30 by someone bagging on the pipes. The one plus, security by the lift's would not let you passed without a room key, which didn't alway's work. I had to return to reception to get the key's re-booted to be able to get in.

It is not fun to use valuable holiday time in New York travelling to a closed ishockeystadium in stead of watching a preseason ishockeygame. One of the ladies at the booking desk was unkind and unwilling to upgrade one of our rooms. We asked when booking these rooms that we wanted separate beds in one of the rooms. We wanted to swith from one small \"grandlit\" bed to separate beds for our adult kids. That was NOT possible, but at least we got a room with enough space to place a rollerbed, so the brother and sister did not need to share the same bed and bed-sheets! The Edison Cafe is a rather sad cafe.... The day we visited the cafe they had the health authorities on visit. That visit resulted in many courses not allowed to serve. And that they told us after waiting aprox 30 min for the food. The only positive with this hotel must be the location. aprox 100 yards from Times Square is brilliant.

Check in was extremely quick and we were provided with the key to our room. The room was a deluxe double room.

As a result, they allocated us a newly refurbished room with views of Times Square. The room was very big and spacious as far as hotel rooms are concerned. The living area was big with a sofa and chair. There was a TV and the wardrobe was also a good size. The bathroom was clean and tidy. Some people might call the decor \"old\" however, this is a hotel with a fifties theme to it so the decor is new, however, is in a fifties style. I had read some reviews about bed bugs at hotels in New York, but i can guarantee there were none of these in our room. All hotel rooms were undergoing renovation.

The reception desk is very helpful and there is a dedicated information desk which is manned; we used this to ask where certain shops were and to get advice on restaurants. This was fantastic and if you don\u2019t already have a map, they will provide you with one. The hotel has a large seating area which can be used when you are waiting to be picked up to go home- they don\u2019t allow suitcases or luggage in this area but there is a manned secure cloakroom to store your luggage on your last day once you have checked out, there is a small fee but well worth it. I think it was $2 per item. The hotel does have a cafe where you can get breakfast/lunch; however, the prices were quite high; although they generally were in that area of the city. We ended up having McDonalds breakfast a few days. Overall the hotel was excellent. Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re not going to New York to sit in your luxurious hotel room, you\u2019re going to explore the amazing city and the hotel is just a place to get your head down. While in New York, try to avoid being stopped by the salespeople in Times Square trying to sell you tickets to a comedy club. We made the mistake of stopping for the first one; they are very polite but they do tend to push you into buying tickets; we didn't on the basis we can see a comedy show at home and wanted to make the most of our time in NY seeing the sights. I would definitely recommend doing the following while in NY: 1. Seeing the statue of liberty. This is quite a way from the hotel and costs around $30 in a cab. There are several different trips: you can take the Staten Island ferry: this will go around the statue or you can take the Liberty Cruise and this will drop you off on Ellis Island. We opted for this. You get off at Ellis Island and can walk around the statue of liberty. It is amazing. The island is not too big but has a Cafe and a shop and amazing views off the city skyline. The minimum stay on the island is around 45 minutes, and then the ferry will return you to the Mainland. You can also choose to go up the statue into the crown. Be aware, tickets sell out for this quickly so it\u2019s best to book in advance. 2. Go to Top of The Rock. The Rockefeller centre is amazing and i must say has must better views than the Empire State. We went up around Midday and the views were fantastic. You can see the whole of Central Park and beyond and a bonus us you can actually see the Empire State. 3. Empire State Building. It is worth going up the empire state, it is totally different to the Rockefeller Centre. We went up here at the night. Be warned, it gets cold and windy up there in the winter months so wrap up warm. Views at night are great. 4. Central Park. This is a must. The park is huge so we took a ride on a rickshaw and were given a 45 minute tour of the park, stopping at Strawberry fields (the John Lennon memorial) and also at the \"Friends Fountain\". The mark was amazing and the drivers generally have fantastic knowledge of the park and tell you all about its history. The ride was $100 for 45 minutes but you do have to barter with the drivers or you could end up paying more. 5. Fifth Ave. If shopping is your thing, fifth ave is the place to go. It\u2019s riddled with designer shops. FAO Schwartz is fab if you have children, full of toys and the children can play on the giant piano similar to the one from \"Big\" the movie. Tiffany\u2019s is also on Fifth Ave, i have one word for this: AMAZING. Watch out though, there are no prices displayed so it\u2019s worth asking before committing to buy as things don\u2019t come cheap. There is an array of shops here and we used a full afternoon and evening exploring. The shops are generally open until around 8pm. 6. Ground Zero. This is no longer an awful scene of carnage and rubble; this is now the site of a new tower of hope. It is close to the Statue of Liberty ferry so we combined the Liberty trip with this. It\u2019s very humbling to see. Across the way there is a shop called Century 21, this is stocks designer clothes at high street prices. If you\u2019re willing to have a rummage you can get some great deals. Abercrombie and Fitch are also not far away. 7. Underground. No trip to NYC would be complete without going on the underground to grand central station. It\u2019s very quick and easy to buy tickets but if you are unsure there are people around to help. Grand Central station is amazing, definitely worth a visit. There are many many more things to do in NYC but one thing i would recommend is to plan your trips. This will ensure you get the most out of your time and manage to fit everything in. Restaurant wise, we ate at Hard rock Cafe in Times Square a few times, this was lovely but there is usually a wait of around an hour for a table. Food is amazing and portions are huge. Price is like eating at somewhere like Frankie and Bennies or TGI's in the UK so average really. We also used a small steak house and a pizza and salad bar which were equally as nice. The food is the most expensive thing in NYC so always best to look out for offers as you can end up getting stung with the bill, and there is then a service charge on top. New Yorkers do generally get tipped 15% minimum. Once more thing, don\u2019t get in a black private taxi, you will get ripped off. Always use the yellow cabs. Overall we had an amazing time, it was the trip of a lifetime, but oh boy, it\u2019s none stop and very tiring but worth it by far.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEven the location couldn't make up for this!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ACTW", "ReviewID": "UR117599441", "Content": "I was told when I booked this hotel that it was a three star... ha! I arrived to see a pleasant bell boy in a uniform that I am sure was once white, he was helpful so I dismissed my first niggle!

I took the lift/elavator to the sixth floor to greeted by the most disgusting smell on the corridor. I hoped the room wasn't as bad, it wasn't thank god, until you opened the walk in cupboard - I couldn't hang my clothes in there! The room was a good size with a modern TV, shame the decor was not as modern (I think it may have been modern in the 70's!) I also think the 70's was possibly the last time it was cleaned! The top cover on the bed was dirty - I took this off straight away, there were hair grips all over the floor clearly meaning it hadn't been hoovered, there were long black hairs stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom, pubic hairs in the draw and writing on the mirror in the bathroom. I was upset it wasn't what I had received in other three star hotels in NYC. In fact it was that unclean I didn't unpack! Outside there was lots of noise, workmen (which I know can't be helped) and the binmen were outside very late - I think I slept with one eye open! I decided I would let the management know about the uncleanliness the following morning. However, at quarter to eight on our first morning I heard a suitcase been wheeled along the corridor, it stopped outside the door and someone used a keycard to get in our room, not once but about four times even though I was shouting 'hello'. Luckily it was still deadbolted from the night so they realsied we were in there, but really checking out your room while you are in there - not good - what if it had been the middle of the day and with that I quickly got ready and checked into another hotel for the following two nights in New York.

In July we were one of the many that had no air-conditioning or hot water- for three full days. It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that it took two full days before they finally came clean and posted a sign in the elevator as to what was going on. At first it was \"we will send someone right up to look at the unit\" then it was \"the power company is forcing us to hold back.\" There were about three different stories in all and the air conditioning and hot water was always going to return either by eight o'clock that night or the next morning.

Still, the hotel is right on Times Square and even with no heat or air conditioning, moldy bathrooms, and tired furniture (Neither time has the room looked ANYTHING like the ones on the web-site) I still considered it a good deal. Despite two disaster filled stays, I was even looking at returning there in December. (Awful conditions or not- it was a great price for the location and I always felt safe.) However, I just checked out their \"new\" web-site and \"new\" rates and about fell over- I had to immediately come here and warn people not to spend that kind of money on this dump! Oh my word- I would have died if I had spent that kind of money for the caliber of stays we had, and I CERTAINLY will not be spending that kind of money to stay there in the future. If you can get a room for a cheap rate and don't mind it being a bit rough- go for it.

The beds are standard and we slept well ( no pillow top mattress etc ) the bedding was clean and changed daily ..and no bed bugs ( a selling feature as well for us ) ..The towels were clean and we always had enough for the three of us . The room could have used up dates our air condtioner worked well .(thank Goodness) it was 108 degrees when we were there. The people working at the hotel were nice . There is security 24 hours a day and they stand at the elevators and make you show a guest key before you can go up ..Nice catch ..The cafe we had our included breakfast in was like a 1960,s cafe its no frills but the service was fast and the food was good ..The people who work there work very hard and were always friendly ..Would I stay there again ,I would recommend it for thoses who want times sq area for sure and are not into luxury hotels ..just clean and basic .. for those who like pillotop mattress, 400plus thread count sheets and duvets and new decor ..no this is not for you ..But its a great bang for you buck .

This hotel seems to be very popular with international tourists and tour groups from Europe. As always, I will provide the Pros & Cons for this hotel. Pros: The hotel is right in the heart of Times Square. There are many hotels in NYC who have \"Times Square\" as part of their name but they can be 10 blocks away sometimes and when you venture that far away from Times Square late at night, it can be a bit scary. All NYC hotels are expensive and you will find this hotel much cheaper than most that are anywhere near Times Square. With taxes, I paid around $235. Ok, you now have the only two reasons to stay at this place which are location & price. Cons: The lobby is ok but the rooms are very small. I realize that most international people reading this may not be familiar with this reference, but the inside of the room and bed remind me of a Cheap Motel 6. The bed was very uncomfortable and needed replaced, the windows did not insulate much from all the street noise below even though I was on the 18th floor. The worst part which prompted me to review them on Trip Advisor is the amount of Mold that was growing on the wall of the shower. There is no excuse for any hotel to have that and the entire wall was covered with it. Disgusting! I heard people complaining that their air conditioning was not working in their room as well. My worked fairly well but I had to leave it on maximum the entire time I was there just to keep it reasonably cool. Overall: I am not suggesting that nobody should stay here. The pros for some people might outweigh the cons so I will leave it up to your personal preference. I had to go on the hotel website to pay my $10 for internet service and the hotel room pictures they show are laughable as they are the furthest from what my room looked like as they could be. Maybe they have a suite or two in the hotel that looks like that but I have never seen that either time I stayed there. New York is a must see city and I love going there.

It was my very first flight and in a moment of madness decided to visit New York: the place of my dreams. We had reviewed many hotels on the net and had viewed Times Square through the live-earth cam. Because we had no experience of staying at hotels outside the UK, we chose the Edison because it looked and sounded ideal for our holiday; proximity to Times Square and Broadway. The arrangements were made through Expedia and we flew with Continental Airlines: I will not go into the personal fear and anxiety that the flight cost me. We actually met the pilot while we were waiting to board at Edinburgh. I was silently weeping into my husband\u2019s shoulder at the time. The pilot assured me that he would deliver us safely to New York. Jim and I have nothing but the highest praise for the Edison Hotel and all the staff that we came into contact with on our first and this past stay. I could run out of superlatives; kindness, courtesy, good humour and nothing was too much trouble. The concierge, reception and the security men were so helpful and attentive. Jim and I enjoyed our little chats by the elevator bank when we returned from our latest adventure. Especially on the occasion of having been kissed by Robin Williams after watching his magnificent performance. The trip this year was my retirement present to myself and to my hero, husband and navigator, Jim. We chose the Edison again because we knew that we would be welcomed as valued guests. We are now back home in Scotland but we are still buzzing with the romance and thrill of it all. Everything about the holiday, every minute of every day, was an exciting revelation to us. We had managed to extend our holiday by one more day than last year, but it all went by so quickly. However, we did manage to pack in four plays (you can maybe imagine how it felt when we saw and actually spoke to such amazing actors from T/V and the movies) Stomp and two films, as well as many landmark locations. I could carry on indefinitely as New York has captured our imagination and our hearts. I would just like to say how much I admired the plumbing . One quick flush and no noisy tank filling up. Just one little thing to mention, which is not a criticism: this year we did not have a chest of drawers in our room and we had to keep most of our clothes in the cases. Looking on the bright side, it did keep them nice and flat: we also loved the wide screen television and the high level of housekeeping.

We weren't planning on spending much time in our room, only to sleep and shower, as we were to be sightseeing (and shopping). When we checked in we were asked whether we had a preference to be on a lower or higher floor, we chose higher and were given a corner room on their top floor - floor 22. It was a clean fair sized room, with a medium sized bathroom (even though the bath was a tad grubby) but the shower was very powerful. We had slight views of Times Square from one window and out of the other was the side of another hotel (so we kept that curtain shut!). The bed was clean and comfy and gave us a great sleep at the end of an exhausting day! It was quite noisy at night - but you are in New York and seconds away from Times Square so it is expected!! I would definately return to this hotel, the room was exactly what we wanted. We did not go to their bar or restaurant so cannot comment on it. I was pleased that everytime we returned to the hotel we had to show the security guard our key card to get on the lift, its good to see some efforts are made towards guests safety. On our last day, check out was 12 and we wanted to leave our bags at the hotel whilst we went out for the day.

It is so easy staying in Times Square - lots of tacky souvenir shopping which let's face it, we all have to do a bit of! Teeming with cafes, bars & restaurants, plus it's the best place to get around from (& perhaps more importantly, back to!) - whether you're walking (fairly central for uptown & downtown) and nearly all the buses and all the subway go to or via Times Square! The hotel itself is a bit old fashioned - art deco style - not my taste and the furniture could do with updating in the rooms but it was clean and spacious - there were 2 adults & 2 teens in our room with 2 double beds & there was still enough room to move about. We didn't have a safe in our room but there is free safety deposit at reception available 24/7 which we made good use of - at all times of the day. We didn't eat in the hotel but some of our group tried breakfast and weren't too impressed but it didn't matter as there was a tasty deli next door but one to the hotel and a few more steps & you were spoilt for choice! With all the shopping in the area you probably wouldn't bother with the hotel shop - but do have a look - it was actually pretty reasonable & I got a couple of things in there cheaper than in nearby shops! We stayed 4 nights which I think is the minimum you should have for New York, especially if you've not been before (we'd been once before but still filled our time) - most tour operators seem to offer a 3 night package but that's hard going, I'd really recommend an extra one or 2 nights to really get the best from your trip!

Our check in, despite arriving quite late was very smooth and we were allocated a room on a higher floor as requested. All staff from the doorman to desk and security were polite and very helpful. We had a family room with two queen beds, it was spacious and very clean and had a great view of times square as we were on the back of the hotel. The room was serviced every day with clean towels and sheets provided. The first night we did struggle with noise from what appears to be a heating system at the back of the hotel but after that it didn't bother us at all. The hotel in general despite being busy was very quiet from a noise perspective. I would recommend the Edison Diner for breakfast , great choice and very reasonable, might even see an odd celebrity or two as we did !! We didn't eat in the restaurant as there is a vast amount of diners and restaurants close by, be aware that being in the theatre district they all get very busy before and after shows. I could highly recommend the Triecolori Italian next door to the hotel, fabulous food and great service. As a base for your trip to NYC I don't think you could beat the Edison for value for money, it may be in the process of a refurbishment and yes a lick of paint on some of the corridors wouldn't hurt but it was clean and staff were excellent. Would definately return in the future. If travelling to NYC for a few nights take a look at the New York pass , saved us a fortune on location visits and tours.

My daughter and I were on the fourth floor for the first night. We could not sleep very well because the hot water heating system of the hotel was clanging an banging all night long. In the morning, I requested to move and again mentioned the double/queen reservation we paid for. We were told we could move to another twin room if we moved right away as there were no double/queen rooms available- I had to go wake up my daughter to move. The second twin room was on the tenth floor and was perfectly fine. Very clean with comfortable beds. My husband and son were on the ninth floor and were fine with their room. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and liked that the doormen were diligent with checking for room keys to get on the elevator. Please check out Danny's Deli next door. Very inexpensive and good breakfasts and deli sandwiches. We ate there almost every day. My only complaint was that the hotel did not honor our reservation. I do have to say that the company called the hotel after our move to the higher floor and discussed the issue and told us to check back with the desk. By this time, I had talked to the people at the desk twice about the situation and we were comfortably settled in our twin rooms. So, we decided to stay put.

The TV was a little old but did the job. The room was equipped with hair-dryer, iron and ironing board. All you need really. No mini-bar though. The bar downstairs \"Rum House\" is a great place to hang out with good service. A small kiosk and an ATM is in the house also, which is great. The bed was ok. Nothing more to say about.

No such place, right? Wrong. Not only have we discovered a hotel that offers all of the above we've discovered one that has history, charm and character\u2026called Hotel Edison. Driving by, even walking by, you may not notice it. Although it's smack dab in the middle of Times Square, it's tucked away on a side street -- 228 West 47th Street to be exact -- just off Broadway. And even though it houses more than 800 rooms, its fa\u00e7ade is amazingly deceptive. Sandwiched between an expensive W Hotel and a clothing store, it's barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. The depth of deception is dizzying. The monstrous building is nearly a city block in diameter but because of the way it was built in 1929, it snakes its way backwards and upwards hiding its bulk between neighboring buildings. As a result, rooms offer more peace and quiet than one might expect from the traditionally noisy 24-hour New York chaos, especially in the heart of Times Square.

As anyone who lives in the Northeast knows, a treacherous ice storm was predicted for 2/1 into 2/2. The Sunday before the performance we decided to investigate our hotel options online. The Edison Hotel was listed as being in the Times Square area with a great rate. We figured...what the heck...it's only one night! When we arrived at NYC's Penn Station, we hoofed it to the hotel. When we spotted the Edison, we couldn't believe our eyes! The doorman welcomed us and check-in was a breeze! This hotel retains much of the elegance of the art nouveau era in its common areas downstairs. It is obvious that they are working hard on gradual updates. True, the rooms are dated, but are certainly clean and adequate. An added bonus to us was finding that Restaurant Row was right outside our door. Literally! We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at The French Quarter and then breakfast the following morning at the Edison Cafe. The cafe was a little pricey, but it's NY and remember, there was an ice storm outside. The food was nothing to rave about, but we were thrilled to have such convenience on a lousy day! At theatre time, we packed up and walked a block to the theatre! Our experience at the Edison made us commit to a yearly event - next time it will be two nights, two shows and two dinners!

The bathroom you could hardly turn around in I turned on the tap at the sink and for about 6 minutes the water was dark brown!!!! I rang down to front desk and got our room changed. Again the room was small the wall paper was hanging off the walls and there was mould over the bathroom tiles, we changed rooms again this time to a larger room again this was dirty there was hair on he bedding, crumbs on the floor along with a hair band on the floor and a bath which hardly had any enamel left on it, I went down to reception again i felt awful complaining but none of the rooms were decent I have never been fussy but this was really bad. The lady on reception desk was very helpful and changed our room this time to a suite, which was clean and decent. We settled ourselves in and got to sleep that was until there was really loud banging noises coming from the bathroom turns out it was old piping for the water and heating. This wasnt really a problem we are both heavy sleepers and we were hardly in our room as we had so much to see and do. Boxing day we had a lot of snow and our flight on which was meant to be on the 28th december got cancelled. We had only reserved our room up until the 28th so we rang reception who told us that we would have to move rooms and check out to check back in this was fine so we packed our things and headed down to reception.

He informed us that there was a room available but nothing available for new years eve!!!! the earliest flight for us to leave was the 1st January!!

I heard all the reviews about how close it was but I didn't realize it was literally steps from times square! I know we were probably there during the cheapest time of the year but regardless, $119.00 a night in that location is unbelievable! You can pretty much walk anywhere and if not there's subways on 50th, 44th & 42nd streets. The room size was very spacious for the two of us. We ended up staying in both an outdated room and a updated one and they were both clean. The lobby was very nice and decorated beautifully for christmas. Checking in and out was a breeze! In fact, we were checking out after our two night stay and thought we should tell them about a small ceiling leak in our room that may become a big problem if it wasn't fixed quickly. Well, the girl at the desk asked if it caused us any damage and we said no, she then went on to tell us that she was taking a night off for the inconvience. At first 8 thought she was kidding because we were really just telling them for their benefit. Later that day we decided to take advantage of the savings and stay another night. When checked in again, another girl was so kind to give us the AAA discount which we don't have, which made the room $109 that night. Anyhow, I highly recommend this hotel and already have to my friends. Also, just a few more suggestions....don't get sucked into spending a ridiculous amount of money to the chain restaurants in time square! If you just walk down to 8th ave and take a look around at menu's, you'll find good food at reasonable prices. Also, restaurant row is on 46th st and they always seem to have specials during the day. We got a giant delicious burger, fries and a bud light draft for $6.95. I can't even find that back at home.

Yes, it is an old hotel, but cosy, warm and very friendly. We were on the 17th floor and yes, our room was small.....but what do you want.....the lights of TimesSq can be seen when you look out your window!!! Room was cosy for two, bathroom was spotless, and very clean and the room was cleaned every morning. It is sooooooo close to Times Sq, restaurants, pubs, EVERYTHING!! :) For me, Im glad I listened to my spouse to not cancel as it is perfect for a short trip to NY! :) As for bed bugs, I came very prepared as that was my main concern but thankfully there were none. Once I got to NY, I noticed that every Duane Reade/Billboards/papers have advertisements and remedies for bed bugs as it is a city problem, not just as Edison hotel problem. Friends of mine stayed in a 4* hotel during August and they were there so dont let it put you off the Edison.

The room was quite small and the beds were extremely hard. The bathroom was only large enough for one person, which made it difficult for 4 girls to get ready. We purchased some cupcakes to share with the 4 of us, so we asked the hotel cafe if we could borrow a knife to cut them. We explained we were staying there, showed our room key, and they still would not allow it unless we ate there at that time. The security guards were also quite rude and abrupt.

This has a great location since it is 1/2 block from Times Square and the bus stops for the tour buses. Our interactions with the hotel staff were all positive and they were helpful in providing the safety deposit box services at the main desk. We gave the room a 3 rating because of its size. It might be comparable to an inside cabin on a cruise ship with a window. This room would be OK for one, but is tight for two adults. We gave a 3 on sleep quality because the mattress was old and firm. The hotel was clean given its age. We would recommend Sophias, the restaurant attached to the hotel. The genre of the restaurant is Italian. We also used precautions for bed bugs. We placed our luggage on the luggage stand, the ironing board and the desk. Clean clothes were kept in zip lock bags in the luggage and we had no signs of bed bugs upon our return home. You can get to the hotel from JFK by taking the Air Train to Jamaica Center. From there, take the E subway train to 50th street. Walk towards 47th Street on 8th Avenue and turn left on 47th. The Edison will be about 1/2 block on your right. Be sure to have luggage with good wheels. You can return to the airport the same way. For the return, exit the main door to your left and turn right on 8th avenue. Turn Right on 50th street to enter the subway for the E train. BE AWARE that after you go through the turn styles, you will need to go down one more level for the E train on the stairway located to the right of the turn styles. On the return trip to JFK, you will exit at the SUTPHIN street stop, NOT the Jamaica Center stop. We felt safe on the subways during the day. The cost for this method of travel is $7.25 as of 10/10/10 ($5 for air train and $2.25 for subway). If you are able to lift your luggage over the turn styles, this is may be a cheaper alternative to the shuttles and taxis.

Btw, you also can store your luggage for a while (when check-in or check-out) for only 50ct. a piece. Let's face it: Of course some parts should be renovated. And yes, the bathrooms are quite old and run-down. It is only basic equipped. But this Hotel really gets you the best value. It's really affordable, the rooms are big enough (I've seen smaller ones in this town...it's NY), the staff was really friendly and helpful and the LOCATION is just almost unbeatable. It IS unbeatable if you consider what you pay for this place. And it just felt perfectly safe all the time. You reach Times Square within seconds, it's literally just around the corner! And so are several subway station, which brings you anywhere in NY in a couple of minutes. We had our room on the 22nd floor and it was really quiet up there. Didn't really hear anything from neighbours or from the street. In the end we were really happy. I've been in this town several times.

On checking in at reception I found the staff to be rude and uninterested in dealing with me there were two gentlemen manning reception each as discourteous as the other. We eventually got allocated a room on the 19th floor and off we went. On exciting the elevator we were met with a grubby looking corridor and the doors to the rooms we passed including ours all looked badly in need of painting and dirty as did the whole corridor. We entered our room and I was instantly shocked at how small it was and how grubby it looked, upon inspection we found it had not been cleaned the bins in the bathroom and main room had not been emptied, sweet wrappers under the bed and the carpet was filthy. The bed was not a proper bed just a mattress on a rolling frame, on the plus side it had been made, there were cables running all around and across the room coming from overloaded sockets that looked very unsafe, and the heater was hanging off the wall. All the furniture in the room looked grubby and the tv stand was broken. I wouldn\u2019t say I have the highest of standards or easily put off by a bit of grime, however this was a bridge to far. I attended reception and asked to be moved as the room was awful and unclean the gent on reception (same one who booked me in) told me he knew the room was not the best but he could do nothing and if I wanted to move would have to ask again tomorrow. I was at this point tired, hungry and losing patience and on advice from my wife left it. As we only had that night and the following night to put up with we tidied the room ourselves, made sure we left nothing plugged in, that would have been hard as there were no free sockets and we had to unplug a lamp to charge phones etc. Also the towels are paper thin and the carpet was so bad you could not walk on it barefoot after a shower. On the plus side we encountered no bed bugs and the reception area looked nice, also the bar attached to the hotel was friendly with a great barman, however this is closing at the end of September.

The shower was okay, but low pressure. Oh, and no free internet access. I believe it was $10 per 24-hours. Overall, I would stay here again ... in fact, i'm planning another trip to NYC in December.

And it did not disappoint. The location is really fantastic. Next to Times Square, very close to 5 train lines, and a street full of restaurants serving great food. There was also a Starbucks around the corner with free WIFI. The hotel is obviously quite old, as can be seen from the decor and building structures. But it's well kept. In terms of the room, it was small but clean. It's not as spacious as a room in a 5-star hotel, but they managed to provide a dresser, armchair and a TV, alongside a queensize bed. There was also a closet. So it was a comfortable albeit small room. The bathroom was decent, with provisions of shampoo and soap. Areas of improvement: 1. The air-conditioning. Not quite the kind you can tweak with numbers, and even at it's coolest, the room still felt a little warm at times in the hot summer. If you're the kind that feels hot easily, or likes to sleep in cold conditions, it may not be sufficient for you. 2. There wasn't a fridge or a safe. We ended up cooling our drinks with ice and an ice box bucket (available on the 2nd floor). 3. The temperature in the shower would fluctuate from time to time and the water pressure was a little low. 4. The mattress was a little soft, which is not great when you've been walking for hours and need to rest your back well. 5. The view was bad. We were on the 4th floor and looked out into a parking garage and the back of the next building was very close to us. But apart from the air-conditioning, I think it was generally good value for money, considering I only paid US$186 a night (at wotif.com). For that price, I don't expect a 5-star room and amenities.

Stayed for 3 nights. Clean and roomy enough for family of four with young kids which included luggage, toys, pillows, umbrella strollers and favorite stuffed animal. Service was quick and efficient. The bathroom is older and there is mildew on walls and ceiling - no ceiling fans to circulate the damp air. Water temp would constantly change so you showered quickly! No air conditioning in hallways and elevators so it`s pretty stuffy. Did not hear the neighbours but we could hear the elevator`s bell. Toilets are quite powerful! Beds were okay, Melatonin helped for sleep! Kuddos for housekeeping as my son had an accident and wet the bed... They had everything cleaned up very quickly. The hotel store is the pits.. looks like more of a storage area as it`s tiny and everything is crammed in there. Went to get some sodas and I stubbed my little toe on a case of soda on the floor along the wall. Lobby is neat and old-fashioned. Security did there thing and responds well with a hello. Had 2 breakfasts at the Edison Cafe. Waiters are older and kind of grumpy but the portions were normal-sized and prices were moderate. Be careful as the tip is already accounted for in the bill! We got caught with that one the first time we went... The umbrella-strollers were a life saver for us for our 6 and 4 year olds as you can pretty much walk everywhere but the kids get tired. Took the subway which was safe and quite exciting for the kids. All in all, we would go again. Travelling with little ones makes you lower your expectations of how much you can do but the kids managed quite a lot. Did manage to hit Time Square, Central Park and the Zoo, Staten Island Ferry to view Statue of Liberty, walked Wall St., 9/11 site, Dylan`s Candy Store, FAO Schwartz, Toy`s R Us, Nintendo World, Top of the Rock, 5th Avenue..

The hotel however needs a great deal of money spent on it. The best thing about it is the lobby which is clean and art deco in style. Despite what I had read on here I didn't find the rooms too small, it had a desk, chest of drawers and 2 side tables and was plenty big enough for the small amount of time we spent in the room. The room was just incredibly dated and quite tatty looking, it was ok for a short trip and as we're used to staying in hostels we can manage with varying levels of decor but if you are looking for somewhere to stay for a romantic break or a place to take your mum I wouldn't recommend it. The shower had parts of tiles missing and around the plug the bath had lost it's colour so was showing rusty brown underneath. The shower dripped constantly but this wasn't the worst thing, when ever anyone used the taps the pipes would scream and rubble, this was particularly unpleasant at 6.30am.

When entering the room i was ready for a bug infested pit covered in cobwebs and cockroaches but the room was tidy and was clean. In some of the other reviews it was said that the rooms were not clean and were dated,which i do agree, but they did have notices up saying that they were in the process of renovating the level. We had a room facing the street and it could get a bit noisy but that is the charm of staying in a city like New York and something which excited us. The proximity to Times Square was second to none and this is probably the Hotels best atribute(only 50 yards away) and right in the centre of the Theatre District.

When I checked in, I asked for a room not near the elevators - and I was assured this it was not. In relaity, it was directly across from the elevators - there wasn't a room closer! The room wasn't ready, but the charged to check luggage until it was ready. No coffee maker, no free wifi (many hotels in Times Square offer these plus free cont. bkfst).", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cThe Pits...........\u201d", "Author": "chs231chs", "ReviewID": "UR50755280", "Content": "Lousy hotel--awful staff--stay away from unless you do not care about the money you spend!

Sure, the bathroom was small, but there was ample hot water and again, very clean with change of towels each day etc. We were at the hotel for 4 nights and situated on the third floor at the back of the hotel...can't quite remember the room #, but think it was 323 or 333. The first night we were so tired from the flight, we slept soundly. Second night, we became aware of the air conditioning fans outside our window...were a little noisy but bearable. By the 4th night, it was unbelievable...the noise was incredible. We called front desk who told us they had nowhere to move us to as the hotel was fully booked and they would send some Engineers up to look at the problem. Two Engineers came up and were horrified at the noise emanating from these fans. They managed to decrease the noise considerably and it was bearable for us to sleep - luckily we had earplugs with us- and the hotel advised they would halve the room rate for that night. The bar at the hotel was excellent as was the small cafe there which we attended one morning for breakfast. The souvenir shop was good value with a great range of small gifts. The staff on the Concierge & Transportation Desks were excellent, giving us instructions on finding the closest Catholic Church and organizing transport to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal where we were catching a cruise from.

I am a frequent traveler and have never seen the kind of attitude the reception staff had. They were rude, never said please, thank you or smiled. They barked short little answers to any questions we had. They would not look up when a guest approached the desk but waited until we said, excuse me\u2026\u2026. The security \u201cperson\u201d who was in front of the elevators always seemed to be more interested in talking to someone than checking out who was coming or going.

No hotel should ever allow staff to behave this way to guests. Guests pay for the privilege of staying at these hotels. The staff of the Edison behaved as though they were bestowing a favor upon us by allowing us to be at the hotel. It was a disgusting experience. I did not see anyone tip any staff except the bellboys who were truly decent and courteous. No gifts or tips were offered to any front desk staff. I did not wonder why. The rooms were OK, but nothing spectacular and nothing like in the website. Cleanliness was not on the top of the list. Carpets had a line of stains, like wine or blood, the bathroom was so small, mold on the tiles in the tub, bathroom med cabinet was missing one mirror, the inner shelf which was constantly visible was rusted and disgusting. There was a very poor job of caulking around the tub, a partial caulking around the base of the sink \u2013 there was a gaping hole there. Everything in that bathroom looked in disarray, old and unattended. And we got the renovated room! I can only imagine what the rest of the rooms looked like.

So to get down to the nitty gritty all I can say is that the rooms were clean on arrival and were attended daily, if you hang your dirty towels up they will not be relaced -so put them on bathroom floor when used and they will be replaced, There was hardly any street noise to be heard once inside the room so had a peaceful nights sleep - so raring to go next day ! The lobby clerk will not let you access the lifts to your room if you do not have a room key so keep it handy ( I found this comforting as we were 5 females and thought this to be a great security asset). The location is second to none - about 20 yards from Times Square and the tickets booth for theatre tickets. We had a fantastic trip to New York and would stay in this hotel again without hesitation. We paid $310 per night for a combo room for the 5 of us and found this a fantastic price , the only thng to be aware of is that there is 4 different types of taxes to be added to your room bill per night so keep a little extra aside to pay for this. The combo room was 2 inter-connecting rooms that shared 1 bathroom, as there were 5 of us we requested a rollaway bed for the 5th person as it was 1 double bed per room , the second room without the bathroom had small sitting area there so you could relax. There is a deli just outside the hotel called Danny's that has a fantastic range of hot and cold food that you can either take up to your room or eat in the Deli ( there were some smokers in my group so each morning as they had the morning fix they would bring coffee and b/fast back with them ) On the whole a fantastic place to put your head down while visiting the City that never sleeps.

Thankfully the stay was no worse than the last time ( 5 yrs ago). As has been said many times before on Tripadvisor, if you want to stay somewhere nice in midtown you need to pay through the nose for it. Even then, the rooms are usually small and the staff are not very friendly. (friend of mine paid $350 per night in the Hudson, lovely room but no room to swing a cat). Thats why the Edison is pretty good for the location, just off Times Square. The room we were in was a standard twin, it didn't have a view except across onto the wall of the building next door and yes the room could of used some modernising. The bathroom especially was dated but the shower, although antiquated, had a really good pressure and there was never a shortage of hot water regardless of the time of day. I've stayed in many luxury hotels where they spend thousands on fancy bathrooms but can't manage to produce hot water when you actually want it. Therefore, i'd rather have a hot shower in an old bathroom than a cold shower in a brand new one!! The tiredness of the decor and furnishings shouldn't be mistaken for dirtyness - the room was actually very clean - I dropped something down behind the dresser the TV sat on and when I pulled it out to get the item back, I expected to find the usual layer of dust from the chamber maid not cleaning the \"out of sight\" areas, however the skirting and carpet were both dust free so obviously the room had been given a thorough cleaning recently. The sheets were changed once during our four night stay and the towels were changed daily, so can't complain about that. The only thing we did notice is that either it was the room or the hotel, but the power seemed to drop off for a fraction of a second from time to time - for example the radio alarm reset itself and I had to re-programme the time. Also, the TV flickered a few times and reset itself back onto the Hotel Welcome Channel. It wasn't an issue (unless you had set the alarm for your wake up call) and it wasn't really annoying, just peculiar. Also, since I first stayed there, I would say the staff are definately politer than before, with the exception of the girls on the concierge and transport desks - they were both as good as hopeless and needed some basic training in customer service. The security guys that check you have your keycard before getting into the lifts (especially at night), were all very friendly and were always chatty about what you'd been doing that day / night. All in all, anywhere else in the world i'd say this hotel is overpriced and not worth it, but unfortunately as everywhere in New York is overpriced, I would say for the location and the general amenities in the hotel then this hotel is definately not bad value for money.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burbank, CA", "Title": "\u201cNear everything\u201d", "Author": "pinkycats", "ReviewID": "UR42917441", "Content": "The Edison ,while not a Luxury hotel is just fine for the price.

You can walk out the front door and be in Times Square in one minute. This property is owned by an Eastern European (Polish family, I believe) and is one of the few remaining family-owned properties in NYC. I expect one of the big chains will purchase it in time. Due to the Eastern European influence, the hotel attracts loads of Europeans. The hotel is Art Deco and built in the 1920's or 30's. There is always renovation going on and, if you're very lucky, will get a newly-renovated room. If not, you will get something that looks tired and dated. Even with the renovations, the bathrooms still look old and they did nothing to them. The tile grout in the floor and shower is often dirty and moldy. If you plan on doing nothing but using this as a staging area, it's a great price. If you're looking for luxury and location, find another hotel.

I found all staff members to be very friendly and helpful. 4 - The shower was powerful and we always had plenty hot water - although in the evening it did take about 5mins to come through. Cons: 1 - The bedding may have been changed daily but our carpet was not hoovered once (any we were there for 5 nights) 2 - The TV didn't work properly, when switched on it would stay on for about 5mins then the lose signal and not come on again for up to 20mins - this was worse at night than in the morning. 3 - The decor of the room was terrible, there is a leaflet in reception showing rooms but our room was nothing like the pictures and looked as though it had not been decorated since the hotel was built. The corridors reminded me and my husband of the hotel in The Shinning and if a small boy on a bike or creepy looking twin girls appeared in front of us we wouldn't have been surprised! 4 - The only electrical socket int he room we could use was hanging off the wall and the only way we could get the power to flow was to put the plug into the socket and then push our suitcase in front to keep the plug and socket in place. 5 - The bathroom (although clean) had no form of ventilation meaning it filled with steam immediately, if you kept the door open the bedroom would get steamy even with the air conditioning unit at full power. 6 - No tea or coffee making facilities Overall the hotel was fine for all the time we were in it but you dont want to be dreading going back to your hotel after a long day in the city. If you dont care what your hotel looks like and dont mind wondering when the last time your room was cleaned then this place will be fine otherwise DONT STAY HERE.

Rooms New York is an expensive place to stay, and Midtown is the worst as you are paying for location, but \u00a3125 a night for this place was depressing, all the more so as this was a good rate. The positives are that the room was a reasonable size but we had a corner room, which made ours bigger than the average, others we glimpsed looked pokey. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the main room appeared to be clean. However, the carpet had seen better days, it was old, worn and poorly fitted (creased at the edges and coming away from the skirting boards in places).

The bathroom was small, old and had been repeatedly and poorly patched up (e.g. a pipe that had been painted and subsequently started peeling was wrapped in a 'decorative' wire mesh). On first inspection, the bath appeared to be exceptionally dirty around the plug hole. Inspection showed that the marks on the bath were pitting on the surface of the tub that couldn't be cleaned away. Some toiletries were provided but I wouldn't have liked to be relying on them as they were cheap and nasty sachets that weren't sufficient for two people. Everyone will tell you that money spent on a nice hotel in New York is wasted, and I have to agree. We could have paid \u00a3100 a night more for somewhere like the Library hotel, which I imagine would be a pleasure to stay in, but we were staying for 5 nights and you can do a lot of other things with \u00a3500! We did spend a minimal amount of time in the hotel room and while definately not a pleasure, it didn't do me any harm. Food The hotel is attached to what I suppose what would be called a diner. It\u2019s a large room, which has some prominent Art Deco features on the ceiling that the hotel sells itself on, however, the actual seating area is retro and not in an Art Deco way. We ate here for breakfast each morning. It was busy, but it never took longer than a few minutes to get a table. Breakfast was typically around $15 for two and consisted of fruit juice, tea/coffee and pancakes/waffles. The quality was fine, for breakfast, however we didn't eat any other meals there - the dinner menu was unappealing and we were looking for something nicer in the evenings. Value for money In comparison to other cities, I would say the quality of the room and the price represented poor value for money. However, it's New York and having researched the other hotels in that \"nothing fancy, 3*\" range, I would say the rate and hotel represented reasonable value.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location in New York\u201d", "Author": "chocaholicmanc", "ReviewID": "UR38678087", "Content": "The Edison was in such a fantastic area of New York.

The size of the bathroom was okay, not a lot of room for your stuff, but we just used the table in the room. We had a walk in closet, so plenty of room for our clothes and to store our luggage. The location was absolutely perfect! Walk out of the lobby on the 47th Street side and look your right. You can see the TKS booth. Look to your left and see the theatre where Rock of Ages is playing. Go out on the 46th street side and look to your left. There is the theater for the Little Mermaid (until Aug. 30) and straight ahead is In the Heights. SOOO Close to everything. Additionally, if you go out 46th street side and go to the right, that is restaurant row. Walk 2-3 blocks and you will see all kinds of food choices. The Gray Line bus tour is also right at the end of the block. You can walk to the Empire State Building (15 min), Rockefeller Center (10 min), Time Square (1 min), Pier 84 (Circle line cruises, 15-20 min), Subway (2-5 min) Our package included breakfast in the cafe. You get your choice of eggs (fried or scrambled) & bacon, pancakes or french toast. We had all three and all were delicious and plentiful. We did ask for a refrigerator prior to going to this hotel. We were told that we could only get one if there was a medical purpose. There are no ice machines, so if you plan on having drinks in your room, you might want to bring a small cooler. My husband put our drinks right in front of the air conditioner and put the curtains around them for insulation. He called it our refrigerator. It worked out just fine and was a joke throughout the vacation. Other than check-in and check-out, we had no reason to interact with the staff. We did not experience any problems, so no need to contact anyone. We did not have extra charges on our bill. My ONLY complaint is that the beds were hard. The first night I noticed, the second and third I was too tired to care! The bathroom did not have ventiltaion and we had some condensation on the walls and ceiling. At one point water dripped on me, but I just dried the area around me. Please remember that this is an old hotel and it is not perfect. If you want to spend $300, go to the Marriott around the corner. If you want just as good of a location for $150, then keep an open mind and spend your extra money on theater tickets or a great meal!

You can take the subway @ the times square stop if you like to go to the Statue Liberty. (Train number 1, South Ferry stop) After seeing the Statue of Liberty walk three block north to Ground Zero(Visit the fire station across from Ground Zero, Engine 10 and Ladder 10).

We had a great two-bedroom mini-suite with separating doors for privacy for us and for wife's cousin. Price was right because we could reserve room so early. Arriving to hotel was pleasant. There were doorman who helped us with our luggage. Reception was also very easy. Everything was correct with our reservation and smile was on with receptionist. We also got help with luggage all the way to the room. Rooms were ok, not luxurious and not bad. Old but very clean and well maintained. Carpets were living their last remaining years. Otherwise everything worked, hair dryer, TVs, remotes and heaters. Heaters almost too well. Weather outside happened to be coldest since and heaters were giving their best. Bathroom was also old and small but again very clean. Bathtub had same rust stains under faucets but otherwise spotless. Hot water didn't run out and bathroom was warm but amazingly dry place after showers. Towel supply was good and rooms were cleaned every day. A BIG Thanks to cleaners. Views from rooms were not anything special. Windows were looking over roof tops over the narrow streets. Hotel is not a skyscraper so other buildings block the views. Nights were peaceful. Only once we woke up in the middle on the night with a banging noice. I looked out and saw some workers below us, building a tin roof and hammering it, at 2 o'clock in the morning! We were also not near the elevators so no noices from there. And enough elevators there were. You didn't have to wait for too long. Noices from Times Square didn't reach us or didn't bother. On the other hand Times Square is right there on the corner, half block from hotel door. You are so close to everything you need, restaurants, shop, bars and theaters. One theater is right across the street. Subway station is also near. Hotels own restaurant/bar Cafe Edison was a nice place. Food was ok, we tested it on one morning for breakfast. Usually we had breakfast and lunch out in the city. I think this hotel is suitable for those who need a place to change clothes and sleep between shopping and Broadway shows and dining out. But it's not too old place just to stay in, if you just need a rest for a change. One thing about NYC in January or in winter overall. Make sure you have enough warm clothes to wear. We are from Finland, Europe and we are used to having cold winters but it wasn't anything in comparison to this what we experienced in January. Cold wind from North with cold Atlantic ocean together is mix to be aware of. It can give you frostbites if you're not prepared. Ask the doudle-decker guide if heater is working.

The bathroom was on the small side but hey we were there to see new york not the bathroom. We had a side window view on to broadway as we were at back of building. The lobby of the hotel was wonderful with art deco murals and christmas tree in the middle. The diner/cafe in the hotel has good service and excellent selection for breakfast and the eggs benedict was great. We did venture into the Rumhouse bar which was ok nothing special but with hotel prices.

They had no problem letting us check in and we went to our room to drop off our bags. The front desk staff was courteous and polite. The maid was in the hall and directed us to our room. Every time we saw her she was very nice as well. Our room was on the 21st floor. We had a double (although my partners 6 feet legs hung over the end of the bed). The room was small, but adequate. It appeared clean and the carpet appeared new (or just really clean). There were only 2 pillows in the room, but we called room service and they brought some up right away. The bath was clean as well and small, but adequate. The shower was very good (hot water with lots of pressure). The lobby paintings were beautiful and with a little updating (some of the couches have run out of time) the place would be amazing. It is one block off Time Square and close to all the theatres. There is a little diner located next to the lobby that had a decent breakfast. We also ate dinner there and mine was ok, but the hamburger for my partner wasnt cooked enough. We sent it back and they fixed it though. Overall, for not having to leave the hotel/lobby area, the food was good for the price. Its not as bad as some of the reviews on here make it out to be.

After reading some of the reviews beforehand, I have to say we too were apprehensive, but we were very pleasantly surprised. With the exception of one guy, the staff were all pleasant and courteous. The lobby and lounge are beautiful with many art deco features. The lounge had a massive Christmas tree right in the centre of it which was stunning. The sofas in the lounge were large and overstuffed and, if I'm honest, a bit threadbare in places but to me it just sort of added to the whole character of the place. There is a small shop just next to the lounge area which sells just about anything you can think of ... t-shirts, candy, cold drinks, medicines ... it's just crammed with goodies and we found their prices very comparative with other souvenir shops around Times Square. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the fourth floor. It was very quiet, more than adequate in size, VERY clean and it had a brilliant walk in closet to store all our bargains from Woodbury Common in. I didn't think the bathroom was that small and certainly not a lot smaller than any bathroom you would find in a modern U.K. home. The only disadvantage with being on the fourth floor was the lifts (or elevators) were more often than not full to bursting by the time they arrived at our floor in the morning, but it wasn't too much hassel as we just used the stairs. We never ate breakfast in the hotel as the queue was always backed up into the lobby of the hotel. We went to Danny's, a deli next door which was fantastic. The food is freshly made, tasty and very reasonable. We did have dinner in the hotel restaurant just once, the special set menu was a bit uninspiring and the waiter overbearing but the food was okay. The location of the hotel is perfect for a first trip to New York or for returning visitors. It is close to Times Square and Broadway, the Rockafeller Centre, the subway and just four blocks from the Port Authority Terminal where you can catch a coach to Woodbury Common, a must for any visitor.

After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we were a little apprehensive before our trip. However, we had a fantastic stay at the Edison. Our room was on the 14th floor and it was quite large with a handy hallway and closet (great for storing shopping bags). The bathroom was quite small (as i imagine most are) but was clean and looked new. Considering the hotel is in Times Square, it wasn't noisy at night. (just the odd siren and horn honking which is usual). Would have liked a better view, but you cant have everything!! The lobby was nice with a nice seating area and the Piano bar was how you would imagine an authentic american bar. We only popped in there once for a quick drink, but had we had more time we would have probably gone again. Sofias italian restaurant adjoins the back of the hotel, again, we didnt have chance to go in, but it looked really nice and busy. We sampled the Edison cafe one morning, not overly keen on the breakfasts. We discovered Dannys (just a couple doors away from front of hotel) which does the most amazing all day cuisine. They have a breakfast run, then it all changes for lunch and then dinner. Lovely full breakfasts, or fresh fruit, bagels, just everything. We were gutted we had only discovered it on the last day and we had walked past it about 50 times!!. As for the location of the hotel WOW!!! Walk to the end of the street and you are in Times Square. Walk out the back entrance and you are in Times Square. Just fab!! So convenient after a day out to drop bags off, and go out again. Also,in the evenings, you could go elsewhere, then come back and go out again to Times Square. One bit of advice though, if you go to the Marriott revolving bar (come out of back of hotel and enter Marriott) do not go for the evening buffet. The food is awful and not worth the money. But it is nice to go for a drink there as the bar revolves 360 degrees 48 floors high so you see all of NYC! Try Bubba Gumps in Times Square. Fun dining experience. This was our second trip to NY, so we didnt really do all the sights again, mainly shopping although we did walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and back again ( a total must as the views of Manhattan on the way back are breathtaking especially at sunset, also try Grimaldis pizza place under the bridge on the Brrooklyn side) and we went to Central Park again which is just gorgeous. The top of 5th Avenue by Central Park and Tiffanys, Plaza Hotel etc is just proper NYC, just like in the films. Went to Woodbury Common this time, got some great bargains. Stayed at the Belvedere Hotel last time which was just as good so would recommend either hotel. Please dont worry about staying at the Edison, it is totally fine and a great price (unless they have some dodgy rooms which we didnt stay in). Christmas time in New York is just magical.

The hotel itself is very old and in my opinion could do with a complete overhaul as the whole place is very dingy and grimy looking--a very unfriendly lobby greets you when you arrive along with equally unfriendly,cold reception staff.We were staying on the 6th floor and the lift came in handy and i have to say this was very efficient and fast although some times we took the stairs on the way down as you could wait 20 minutes until a lift stopped where you could squeeze in.The corridor was dull and dingy also and then on entering the room this was was even darker and was a bit foisty smelling (room 647).The room was very small all the drawers creaked or squeaked when opened,the 1 electric socket available had dodgy connections as it only worked when it felt like it and to save risking an electric shock-it was best not to use it.There were 2 lamps in the room that had to be on all the time you were in as the room was so dark as the window looked onto a brick wall.The waterworks in the bathroom were not up to much --the hot water was intermittent and a cold shower is not very desirable in October. The one decent thing was the maid service,they came each day we were there and were very friendly. Downstairs there is a cafe for breakfast--reasonably priced but not sure if my husband became ill from the poached egg that he ate in the morning(it seemed undercooked to me) and its a bit like a cattle market--your second course arrives before you have finished the first.

The rooms include colour tv, iron, ironing board and hair dryer in bathroom. We later discovered that the only rooms that look like the pics on the website are a few on the 2nd floor apparently.

The bathroom was also very very clean - just a bit in need of some care (basin had a little crack and grouting round bath needed re-doing) but they were only minor things. Another criticism was the size of the rooms - but we found them to be quite adequate for what time you spend there. As everyone has said - location was all. So close to Times Square (bit noisy at night - but earplugs work well) and right in the Broadway district.

I rang the hotel reception when we arriived to ask if there was possibilty of a kettle or microwave and I was happy to pay more for it. But they advised they did not offer this service and it was bad luck and it was our problem, we should have been more organised. They advised that the hot water was good enough, but every morning we would let it run for about 15 minutes before the hot water would kick in and then you did not need to run the cold tap either to have a shower. I then asked where our cot was and they told me to ring housekeeping, after 3 phonecalls and 2hrs later our cot arrived with no blankets and just a sheet. I also asked reception about our bathroom light as we could not find a light in our bathroom... They advised that every room was different and we would have to work it out for ourselves... after 2 days of darkness, we realised we had found our light switch, but the light did not work unless you shake the fitting... so that worked out... After talking to reception originally, we did not bother them as every time we talked to them about something that involved customer service it was a problem.

We decided on the Edison because of it's close proximity to Broadway, Times Square and many other attractions including shopping.

I was very surprised at the speed of the lifts when I first got into them, so you're not wasting any of your precious holiday time. The Edison is right in the heart of Times Square which is the best place to be if it's your first time in New York. When you exit the hotel by the main entrance and turn right you are only a few yards away from Times Square and when you turn left when you exit the hotel you are only two streets away from Hells Kitchen. The staff are polite and helpful and there is 24 hour housekeeping just in case you need it, which I did and they were very prompt. You may be asked by a member of staff for to show your room key just before you get into the lift which I found really good as it was reassuring that no one who wasn't meant to be there was going to gain access to any of the floors. After checking out you can leave your luggage in a secure area for only 50c if your flight isn't until late. Some reviews on this hotel had me quite worried but when we arrived at the hotel my worries were banished as we had a great time. I was lucky enough to holiday in New York for my birthday along with my partner and two friends and we had an absolute ball in New York. Some day I hope to visit New York again and if I do I will certainly be staying at the Edison. I have already recommended this hotel to everyone that I have told about my stay in NY and a couple of them are booking for next year.

He gave us another key and went we went back upstairs - this time the key didn't work at all so we went back down again. We calmly told him what the situation was and that so far, we were very disappointed in our experience - it was very frustrating. He (the Manager!) told us that THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER HOTELS IN THE CITY AND IF WE DIDN'T LIKE IT WE COULD GO STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! Oh my! We were furious after that and would have stayed somewhere else, but what good would that do us when we'd have been the one to lose the money we already spent on the booking and he'd have gotten away with acting so awful? He didn't even issue an apology for the poor service, raised his voice at us, and was incredibly condescending. A quality, customer-oriented hotel would have offered a warm apology and probably comp'ed us a free breakfast or something just as a nice gesture - instead we got a manager with attitude. Additionally, the room smelled awful and was dirty... even the walls in the hallway looked dirty. Do yourself a favor and AVOID this hotel - spend a few dollars more and stay somewhere where the hotel is clean and the staff is competent.

First of all, the location is really great. It's right in Times Square and very convenient to a lot of sites. We had a AAA rate of $215/night for a deluxe room, which included a king bed and pull-out sofa. The room was actually pretty large by New York standards. If we had wanted to bring sleeping bags or Aerobeds, we could have easily fit four people in the room. This room is obviously made for three or four people but they tell you that you can only have two in the room so we didn't tell them our son was with us and booked it for two. My main complaint was that it was noisy (I'm a light sleeper). We were on the 7th floor and could hear a lot of noise from the street. It almost sounded as if the windows were open, but they weren't and they looked new so I don't know why it was like this. But I turned the fan on at night for white noise and that helped a lot. Also, the water in the bathroom would turn freezing cold and scalding hot in an instant. It was impossible to regulate it. I had it set so it was almost cold so that when the hot came on it wouldn't burn me. It was annoying but not so bad that I wouldn't stay there again.

It may not be pure luxury but for the price we paid I thought it was fab and I didnt see one single hotel in the whole week that was in a better location for 1st time visitors than The Edison. Staff were all helpful when required and we found all that we needed right there. It has a cafe attached, a small piano bar to rest your weary feet and end the night with a much needed glass of wine, a large reception, very helpful concierge desk, travel arrangement desk (with very able but slightly abrupt arranger), loads of public telephones and a back entrance which takes you straight out to the TCKT booth for the cheap broadway show tickets and a nice Italian. Rooms were fine - clean, bigger than I expected having heard they are all tiny in NY and plenty of mirrors for 2 females who need one each. Bed was comfy enough although we were so tired at night I could have slept on the floor, bathroom was fine and shower really powerful. Clean towels were provided every day and the maids tidied up after us every day. New York itself was truly fab. We did all the usual sights and loved them all. Went to see 2 shows which were great - Legally Blonde and Chicago (girl who played Roxie was brilliant) - and shopped until the credit cards would let us go no further. We went the bus tour on the first morning and the tour guide told us to get to grips with the subway as it was so cheap ($25 for a weekly ticket) and really fast. We were a bit aprehensive at first but found it to be totally safe and by Day 2 we were completely unfazed. There are subway stations on almost every street corner. Loved the buzz of Chinatown - were there 3 times - and also found Ellis Island very moving. If you are only going to go up either the Rockerfeller Centre or the Empire State then my tip would be the RC. Much better views and you can see the Empire State and also Central Park - you cant believe how huge it is in the middle of all the concrete. The view is also uninterupted as it is clear perspex all round intead of wire fencing. Visit Ellens Stardust Cafe just up the road from the hotel on 7th Avenue. Typical American diner but with singing waiters and waitresses. We were in for breakfast one morning and they were up on the tables singing at 9am nd we were in one night after a show and they were still there. Great atmosphere and the food is pretty good.

The thing about the Edison is that the rooms are very different sizes, layouts. Only two people in our forty-some people group didn't like their room...only because they got twin beds instead of queen beds...jeez, they weren't even sleeping together. The Edison accommodated them by changing their room anyway. We had a double queen, very clean, bright and attractive. The bathroom was very small but we managed. My basic complaint was that the lobby, which is nice looking, very art-deco, had some gold-covered cloth sofas and chairs that looked like someone had died on them....ewwww. Dirty, stained, gross. I thought that was shameful and that they should replace them. I wouldn't even sit on them. The cafe is nice, they really work hard and the breakfasts are great.

I was a bit achy when I woke up in the morning, but it went away fast...and I must admit I slept like a rock.

We had a room (838) with twin beds which I can't fault, I did request a newly renovated room and wasn't sure if it was or not but everything seemed fairly new.

Bathroom was always clean and although a little rusty around the plug there was no faults with the shower temperature and pressure was fine. A view of a brick wall but you could just about see Times Sq if you stuck your head out far enough to the side ;) The hotels main TV channel (about the hotel) wished 'Mr B' happy birthday on the leap year, which was also my birthday. My friend asked reception if they could put me on there, to which they said they would try and that 'Mr B' was the owner. Unfortunately we missed the channel that night but the receptionist asked me if I'd had a nice birthday when we checked out so I can only assume they wished me happy birthday on there! Location was brilliant. Cafe Edison was nice for breakfast but a wait if you are up late. Quick service and very cheap. Deli next door great for by the lb food and drinks. Back entrance of the hotel opposite the TKTS office, try here for broadway tickets before going to the shows box office. Starbucks opposite hotel on corner.

We had a nice stay overall. The only glitch was being given the wrong size (smaller) room, which the hotel switched for us after we returned from shopping. The first room was small, with two twin beds and a large bathroom. Our regular room was spacious with two double beds, but the tiniest bathoom I've ever seen in NYC hotels and apartments. This was more amusing than anything else. Some items of note: This hotel is not for you if you don't like noise. Times Square is pretty noisy (as well illustrated by the many Kosovars celebrating their independence Sunday morning). The Edison also hosts many large groups. There were several sizable student groups from the UK while we were there. While it is not a basic amenities hotel, it's not anywhere near luxurious either.

We arrived at the hotel after a nice relaxing Limo ride from the airport. It was close to the cost of a taxi so we thought what the heck we are on vacation!!! We were able to check in right away even tho it was only noon. The first room we were given had a window that would not close all the way. Being December we wanted a window that closed compleatly so we went back down to the front desk. They said they would send a maintenace man up to fix the window. Within 5 minutes we had a repair man in our room. He decided he was unable to fix the window. We headed back down to the desk and we were immediately given a room on the 8th floor- no problem. The rooms were small but clean and that is all we were concerned about. We had a room with a queen size bed and a couch. The bathroom was small. The only problem we had with the bathroom was we had a non working hairdryer. We didnt call to get a new one because it wasnt a big concern of ours We ate breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel one morning which had VERY resonable prices.We did try to go to breakfast at a restraunt in Times Square but the omelettes were 18 dollars each so we opted for Starbucks instead. There is a small deli type store we found on our last night. We heard they had good sandwiches, fruit, etc at good prices.

Certain channels on the TV were not working. At one point, the power went out! Housekeeping was horrible as well. I had to call twice for housekeeping to bring me a hair dryer because the one in the bathroom was not working.

There are six cars and we never had to wait more than a minute, even at busy times when the first might be full another would be along quickly. There was 24 hour security guard near the elevators... in the morning security seemed lax, but in the evening without exception room key-cards needed to be shown to get by. We didn't eat in the on site restaurants. For morning coffee and quick meals we used the 24hour deli two doors down. It was fantastic, prices were reasonable and the food was good. Full deli, hot and cold food bar including soups, salads, fresh fruits, entrees and side dishes. Mornings they made eggs and omelets to order.

The windows were dirty, the curtains were torn and everything in the room looked very well used - including small holes in the sheets.

I was also concerned about the security in the lobby area as there seemed to be quite a few odd people 'hanging about' that were not there last time I stayed. I used the public phone booth near the concierge\u2019s desk one afternoon and was concerned about someone potentially pick pocketing things from my handbag.

We have two boys aged 13 and 11. We stayed at the Edison Hotel, near Broadway/Times Square -an excellent location. I loved it as there are many original art deco features, although it is a little shabby in places. Four in one room was stressful at times, with nowhere to let off steam and the problem of varying sleep hours. The hotel's facility of renting movies helped ease some of the stress. We arrived early evening - late to us with the five hour delay - and found everything a bit hectic at first. It wasn't helped by the 11 year old crashing out and being fully alert by 4 the next morning. However, we came to enjoy walking down Broadway and looking at the shops and sights - Toys R Us has a great ferris wheel that the 11 year old liked but 13 year old not impressed by. We are not used to the Americam system of 'room only' and it was difficult to find somewhere for each meal that suited everyone. There is a cafe joined to the hotel, that seemed OK, and a great deli next door. But for us parents, who wanted more than cardboard plates and plastic cutlery, we did not manage to find anywhere mid-market, with decent food that included options our fussy children would consider. Activity-wise, we did a tour on the first day that took in most of the major sites and the Staten Island ferry - this was a great success with a personable guide. Second day was up the Rock for fantastic views over the city - all enjoyed and recommended. We also did Central Park, which was good as it was a fabulous day but boys surprisingly bored by it. Third day was a Circle Line cruise around Manhattan - again boys not impressed, weather had changed for the worse and we had a feeling that three days would have been enough! However, fourth day we took the subway and walked over Brooklyn Bridge, which everyone enjoyed, and spent time at South St Seaport pier and museum - again something for everyone here. I think we all appreciate having visited and familiarising ourselves with the sights, the road system, the subway and all the other things that make New York and I think three days would have been enough to see what we wanted to.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delmont, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in New York\u201d", "Author": "jjf15626", "ReviewID": "UR8605284", "Content": "We came to see Grease at Brooks Atkinson theater (just half a block down the street) for our 32nd anniversary.

This room was tiny (and from talking to others was the normal size) you could barely fit a suitcase either size of bed which was supposed to be a double but was a lot smaller, in the bathroom the sink was cracked and there was mould growing in the cracks, we were both devastated this hotel was a joke, we couldnt stay there it was just a tacky joke, we decided to find a new hotel in the morning we were so upset we walked the streets of new york to about 6am then my wife had to lye down. Anyway we got a great hotel just behind the edison (the Marriott marquis -a lot more expensive but worth every penny), after a day or two my wife noticed a lump on the back of her leg and it kept getting larger eventually we had to go and see a doctor- it was a bed bite or so the doctor thought and it obviously came from the edison (from talking to people around times square it did not have a good reputation for hygeine). So to end this review- Dont even think of staying there you will regret it, it smells, is tacky and everything said on its website couldnt be further from the truth.

Bit dark, bit tired, small, (terms used before in these reviews)..but hey its just a place to lay your head (we told ourselves). Oh and the AC made more noise than a Brass Band.....just a place to lay...etc., Jet lag hadnt quite kicked in but the thought of being back in NYC and so close to Times Square, wash a rush....so we unpacked and went of to get reacquainted. We managed to burn up several hours more before we returned to the room for some sleep......ahhhh...just a place to lay your head...... Quite a comfy bed...got the extra pillows (a must on arrival ask for them) ...a warm humid evening/night, during which I thought I felt something land on my neck....oh dear.......and then suddenly my wife screamed.....COCKROACH!!!!!....ugh...(pictures available on request). Not a great moment...it was BIG RED and very UGLY.....having \"stunned\" it I realized it may not be alone...and what was that that had landed on my neck? A call down to the reception (5am) and the guy down there said it would probably be about 10am before anything could be done....not very happy with that response I went down to see him in person.....wife still hysterical in the room. Must admit we got a new room within 20 minutes (even though \"sorry we are full, no rooms to change to\") Room 2018....and moved straight away................your waiting now are'nt you?.....what was that room like?..........FANTASTIC.....BRILLIANT.....SUPERB....a reasonably sized room, nice and recent decor with a great view (look down and left straight to Times Square) We have no other complaints about the hotel other than the obvious....but hey it was only a place to lay........oops sorry. Staff and amenities were great, the Edison Cafe (attached to the hotel) has a more traditional style......its Pure New York....staff work their butts off...food is plentiful and cooked however you prefer. There is also a Deli/Cafe a few steps from Edison -New Diamond CAFE - a good standard option within easy reach....handy for a coffee to take up to your room whilst you get ready for the next round of holidaying. Location is another obvious plus....out of the Main Entrance doors turn right...walk for 2 minutes..and you are there, right in the Heart of Times Square. All usual \"must do\" tourist attractions are within an easy walking distance, for those that are able, if not there is plenty of public transport and the hotel has its transport desk that can always help you make any special arrangements. Another handy tip: Go to the Time Warner building, just off the Columbus Circle, adjacent to Central Park...go into the basement and feast yourself on the wonderful array of foods which are available...salad bar/deli set up is heaven....pick whatever you like from a vast range of tastes and styles...go and get it weighed in at one of the forty odd checkouts and pop over the road to Central Park for a picnic...so romantic Finally (if you have managed to read this far...HIYA!!!)..we WOULD stay at the Edison again even with the night visitor event in our minds...we felt secure and looked after in there, the location is excellent and at reasonable rate (safety deposit box access from the front desk.....which is NO charge) all seemed to be run very efficiently.

I booked it because of its proximity to the place where I was working during the week. I had stayed at the Pennsylvania Hotel nearer Macy's last time I had come to New York for business and had been a bit disappointed with it, as the decor was old-fashioned, the rooms looked a bit run down and the lobby was always crowded, so this time I decided to try the Edison, as it looked more modern and advertised a nice bar in the lobby, which I thought would be a nice place to go after a long day at work. However, it was almost identical to the Pennsylvania - very old-fashioned, unmatching decor in the rooms and a crowded lobby, so I guess this is typical for this part of New York at the 3-star price range. The rooms were cleaned daily, but on the evening I arrived I found rubbish in the bathroom bin and a used towel hanging from the shelf, although the bed was made, so I got the feeling someone had used the room after the maid had cleaned it, which didn't give me a good opening impression. For the rest of my stay, though, the room was cleaned daily and the towels were changed daily. The shower in the bathroom was a bit hit and miss - the water was either freezing cold or scalding hot and gave no warning when the temperature was going to change! The bathroom was quite small and there was nowhere to hang a handtowel, except from the shelf over the basin. I tried to watch the TV in the room on my first night there and couldn't get the remote control to change channels. I reported it the next morning and when I came back to the room that evening the TV had been left on (I assume to show me it had been fixed). The room itself was a decent size for one person - there was an armchair and a desk, as well as a double bed. There was also a telephone and an alarm clock in the room and a hairdryer in the bathroom. The worse thing about the room was the noise from the street - it's near Times Square after all! Sounds of traffic, horns, sirens, thumping music, etc go throughout the night, but if you close the window and switch on the air conditioning it drowns out the worst of the noise. The bar, which sounded really nice on the website, was a tiny pub-like area with some mediocre entertainment - it was always crowded, so I had to go outside the hotel to get a drink. As the hotel is in a tourist area there are lots of places to get something to eat, but they are mainly chain restaurants and burger bars and I always went over to 9th Avenue for a meal, as there are lots of independent restaurants there where the locals go. The hotel also has a restaurant and diner attached to it - I didn't eat here, as I found a more authentic one on 9th Avenue that I went to everyday (The Westway Diner) - huge portions, reasonable prices. Despite the number of people staying in the hotel, I didn't have to wait too long to check in or check out. The lobby just beyond the reception desk has a seating area and is a nice place to sit if you are meeting someone. It is beautifully decorated in art deco style, but it does get very crowded. There are several lifts, so I never had to wait long to get into one, but I was a bit concerned about security, as, although there was a notice telling you to show your room key to a security guard who sat near the lifts, I rarely saw a guard there and even when there was one, he never asked to see my card. The corridors are very long and when there is no one else about, it can be a bit creepy walking back to your room from the lift. The worst thing, from a business point of view, is that there is no business area with computers where you can access the internet. I think you can access the internet in your room if you have a lap top, but I didn't have a lap top with me and would have found an internet room really useful.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cWill never stay here again\u201d", "Author": "ALloyd", "ReviewID": "UR8209661", "Content": "I have stayed in quite a few hotels, but this has been the worse by far.

I realize that $230 for a double room is inexpensive by NYC standards, but, when I pay that much money, I am not amused by inconveniences and discomforts.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "kiwitraveller55", "ReviewID": "UR7990129", "Content": "Our friends recently stayed at this hotel in Times Square and said it was great and exceptionally well located to Times Square. They were right. It is right in Times square so be prepared for staying in the horn tooting, siren screaming capital of the world. It is singularly the noisiest place I have ever stayed. Aside from that it is a hotel designed in the Art Deco period. Unfortunately they have done nothing to it since. Our room was not cleaned very thoroughly (hairs and rubbish all over the bathroom floor) The bed linen looked like it had been slept in (and not by us!) The room had a very unpleasant odour. The bath taps ran continuosly and no one was interested in repairing them. The rooms were tired and run down. The hotel staff were surly and very uninterested in providing any level of decent service. The hot and colds taps in the shower ran like a symphony orchestra - hot one second and cold the next. The best I can say about this hotel is it's location in Times square. They have a cafe attached which is cheap for breakfast, or so it seems until they start adding on the taxes and compulsory \"gratuities\" (which runs between 15-20%) In fact all they do is double the tax. We noted a lot of places in New York add a complusory tip into your bill and then expect you to tip on top of that. So they are double dipping a lot of the time. The subway is the quickest transportation on Manhattan Island. Although not as good as the London tubes they are reasonably quick and have lots of destinations. A single ride is $2 per person and you can purchase a 'Metrocard' in 4,10,20 etc denominations. You can use one card for two or more people (you just hand it over to them and they swipe it through again). You can't do that with the 'Oyster' card in London. Unfortunately it is difficult to find any maps of the various different lines in the tube stations themselves so try and get a map from one of the tourist centres. Otherwise you may find it a little frustrating trying to work out where you should be. By water the cheapest and most efficient travel was via Water Taxi and using their \"hop-on-hop-off\" system. It goes quite close to the Statue of Liberty so you can get some decent photos. However it does not stop on the Island like some tour boats do. Electronics are very reasonable for Kiwis to buy. Expect to barter HARD and make sure you know what the price of the same item is at home. We found that on average you could buy the product for 1/3 of the ticketed price. Our best dinner was in Greenwich Village/Soho. The people and the restaurants are very eclectic and although very busy - nothing like Times Square. We likened moving around (actualy shuffling) in Times Square to the end of a football match. Only it never eases up except on a Sunday morning.

Check in was very busy when we arrived but we were taken care very promptly and efficiently. Our room on the fourteenth floor was well above the street noise. The bathroom was outdated but it served its purpose. The room was very clean and we never had a problem with towel supplies or anything else. Unlike alot of people on this site, I am happy as long as things are clean and work. Heck, you are in New York, who hangs out at their hotel? The location is fantastic as it is quite literally steps from Times Square. We arrived at night and didn't really know where we were at as we got there. After checking in at around 10 pm we went for a walk and we came around the corner and Bam! there it was, Times Square lit up and crazy busy. The Rum House was a great place to unwind after a busy day, quiet with a bit of thirty's charm. The Cafe Edison was a great place to start the day as breakfast was cheap, plentiful and super fast service. Service in New York was so good everywhere and fast. Where I live pizza delivery can take two hours and Tim Horton line ups are 20-30 mins.(Tim Hortons are Canadian Starbucks but better) so maybe it just seemed fast to what I'm used to. The Grayline tours office is only a block away and I highly recommend the tours except maybe the Brooklyn part. The deli next door, as you've read here, is pretty good too. Our only regret was that we saw one Broadway show (The Producers incredible!) and not more. We will stay here again as the price, location and service is so outstanding.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Lovely Rooms, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "philandcarys", "ReviewID": "UR7179684", "Content": "I'd read a few reviews and was expecting much of the Hotel Edison but was very pleasantly suprised.

When we were taken down to our room it was slightly cleaner! It also seemed that dodgy that we actually used to wish each other good luck and we'd hopefully see you in the morning as we went to our seperate rooms! When it came to going to sleep - we were staying at the front of the hotel and there was a lovely man who liked to spray clean the pavement outside at 1 o clock every night!! (It is not a quiet spray cleaner!) I think maybe they need to invest in some thick double glazing or something because by the third night of no sleep i could quite happily of opened the window and dropped our wardrobe on the 'lovely spray cleaners' head!! The lucky other couple were right by the lifts as well, i would request to be moved if you get put there as your dreams will be full of, 'Ding, Ding!' otherwise. Obviously that would depend on you actually getting to sleep! Now i am not a snob, i have stayed in some very dodgy B&B's in blackpool etc but I just really need sleep! On the whole, i suppose we did get what we paid for, but i would just like to advise other people who need at least 4 hours sleep that it is worth paying a bit more to stay somewhere else a bit further out.

Let's face it... It doesn't have a pool, etc., but who the heck goes to NYC to swim?! This is definitely a budget hotel, but if you're anything like me, you just need a place to keep your luggage and to sleep. So if it's clean and safe, then it's good.

The lobby is an excellent place to just chill out... and the 24-hour deli next door is a lifesaver! Fresh, yummy muffins and French Toast, as well as a grill with hamburgers, etc. and a salad bar. But the best part of the hotel is the location. Why stay somewhere 10-15 miles away and commute each day to the city when you can stay 1/2 block away from Times Square? I went to quite a few theaters to see Broadway shows, and in fancy shoes I was still able to walk to every single one of them without my feet aching. Now that's location!

I realized that it is a tough time to get a room in NYC. So, I remembered the Edison - I called the property directly spoke to a delighful reservationist who informed me that they did have a room for me and the rate was $165.00 plus taxes. I reserved the room immediately. By the way several dotcoms had the the same room for $399.00 - sometimes its wise to call the property yourself. You could save yourself a lot of money, in addition the dot.coms want payment in full at the time you book - when you book with the hotel they hold the room for you with your credit card and you don't pay until you check out. Remember with any hotel, if you pre-pay with a dotcom they already have your money and any complaint you may have, may not be treated the same as it would if your reservation was booked with the hotel directly. I walked into the hotel lobby at 11am, checked in and went directly to my room on the 6th floor. Our room was fine - two queen beds, TV etc. Ok the bathroom is small, but I'm not planning on doing any ballroom dancing in a bathroom. There was plenty of room to do bathroom things. The room was clean, well heated and adequately appointed. As others have said, if you go to New York to sit in a hotel room, there's something wrong. Again, as in other reviews I have written, let's keep it in perspective (I can't believe the review where the Edison was compared to The Bellagio in Las Vegas - how ludicrous!) Keep in mind the Edison is a very high traffic hotel and there is a lot a wear and tear - they just do not renovate as much as the others. In the hotels that charge $400-600 a night ,they do so because they are constantly replacing and doing the cosmetic makeovers to keep people from whining. This costs money and it is reflected in your room rate. I'd much rather pay less have a decor a few years old and still have the cleanliness - this is what you get at the Edison. And yes, The Edison is very conveniently located in Midtown Manhatten with access on 46th and 47th Streets - just a few shorts steps will put you in Times Square or on Restaurant Row or at your favorite theater.

However, when I went to the bathroom and lifted the toilet seat, the toilet had not been flushed after a prior use \u2013 and I am not saying the water color was not clear. I called the front desk who sent a maintenance man to the room with a plunger. He flushed the toilet and asked, what my problem was since the toilet was working. I said that the room had obviously not been cleaned and could they send someone up to clean the room and the bathroom. His response, the cleaning staff was off duty. I asked to change rooms, but was told no rooms were available. I was grossed out from that point, did not sleep much that night and checked out early in the morning to return to my office.

We knew from the reviews not to expect much. It is a huge hotel with 900 rooms. The lobby is old but beautiful. We stayed in a double room at the 17th floor. The room was really small, but we expected that. It was nicer than we expected, and had a window overlooking the street, so it was not dark. The bathroom was fine, small, but we didn\u2019t need more. It was cleaned daily, and the towels and sheets were changed daily too. It was a little worn out, but not enough to create any problems. A great advantage is Edison cafe in the lobby. We had a -no breakfast included- reservation and Edison cafe solved this problem. We paid extra of course, but it was really cheap and breakfast was quite good! The cafe room is also nicely decorated, reminded us of hotels we see on old American movies. The greatest advantage of all is, of course, the hotel\u2019s location. It is a two minute walk from Times Square, close to the subway station, and in walking distance from most of the sights (Top of the Rock, Grand Central Station, 5th Avenue, ESB). Also, if you are interested in TKTS booth for Broadway tickets the hotel\u2019s back door leads exactly there!! If you are looking for a luxury stay and up-scaled accommodation Edison probably isn\u2019t the case. But if you are travelers who visit New York and want to explore the city, don\u2019t intend to spend a lot of time in the hotel, and prefer to spend your money in sightseeing, eating, Museums, Broadway shows, then Edison is great for you! You can save money to put it in better use, and still don\u2019t regret staying there.

I came to New York in May with my wife for 6 nights. We booked this months in advance and specifically asked for a quiet room on a high floor as we appreciate that New York is not exactly quiet. On arrival the foyer seemed quite nice but the receptionist didn't seem to have any notes of our requests (including a room upgrade as it was our anniversary). We asked for a high floor and were taken to a room on a high lever but it was opposite the lifts so obviously wouldn't be quiet. We were offered a room on the 8th floor which we pointed out was fairly low so were then taken to a room which I think was on the 23rd floor which was literally the very farthest room from the lift which we thought would be ok. By this time were tired & hungy so dumped our cases into what looked like a small room and went for a bite to eat. It was only when we came back and had a look around that we saw what a disgusting, filthy room we had been put in! The room was very very small, the carpets were soiled & stained and the bedding was like something out of Porridge (a UK sitcom based in a prison!). To top it all off there was an enourmous metal heating pipe running up the side of the building which was right outside of our window and gave a constant humming noise. We decided to stay there that night as it was late and look elsewhere in the morning. I slept on the sheets as I didn't even want to get in the bed and spent the night itching from I hate to think what. The next day I went to reception and said that we were leaving (he didn't look like it was the first time anyone had said this) and he told us to contact Expedia for a refund as the hotel does not issue refunds. We went to the Novotel nearby which was excellent - see review - and eventually received a refund from the hotel for the nights we didn't stay there - at least there's some credit to them there.

Before heading there, I read reviews of the Edison Hotel here on TripAdvisor. I had already booked my hotel (without having first checked TripAdvisor), so the negative comments here had me a bit scared that I was going to end up in a 'dump'. Of course, I was only in one room (a single for $170/night), and can't comment on all of their rooms, but I have to say it was perfectly clean, didn't seem \"old\" or \"musty\". I wouldn't say it's the greatest hotel I've ever been in, but I didn't expect more than an average hotel for the price (keeping in mind that this is NYC, the $170/night price isn't top-of-the-line). I saw at least one review where the people complained about the maid service bothering them on check-out day (check-out time is 1pm, but the maid kept bothering them starting at 10am). I was there two nights, and was out LATE each night. I put the \"Do not disturb\" sign there both nights. The first morning, I actually didn't leave the room until about 2pm. The second morning, I was checking out, and left the room at about 1pm. I heard NO knocks on the door either morning - the maid staff actually *paid attention* to the \"do not disturb\" sign - something very rare, IMO. Oh, as others have mentioned, the 24-hour deli next door makes great sandwiches - especially nice when you're heading back to the hotel at 4:30am after a night of partying! - Paul", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stevens Point", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "auntienofun", "ReviewID": "UR5236519", "Content": "Just got back from a 4 night stay at the edison last week.

Yes, depending on the room you go for a standard room is pretty small but if you're hear for a weekend you should just be crashing in it so no worries there. I would recommend upgrading to a mini suite if you have the ability. They are much bigger (especially those on the 18th floor) and you get a sofa and lots more natural light. I don't know about you but when I came to NY on holiday I wanted to get a real sense of the place and the Edison helps to do that: what you see is what you get, just like the whole City. I highly recommend both the bar (think its called the Rum House - great atmosphere and perfect for a pit stop either pres or apres your evening's activities) and also the deli/coffee shop attached to the hotel. The food is GREAT and the service is again very New York-y. (For any Sx & The City Fans this is where Carrie went after she got rained on outside the Guggenheim and then went for some soup - she was sat at the coffee shop bar and got talking to some loony old lady who put lithium on her ice cream). True, there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms (like all other Brits this is a big deal) but I've never seen these in any American hotel!

There was a lady playing piano and singing. The guy at the bar was excellent - very attentive and pleasant. Being there on the run up to Christmas, the bar was decorated beautifully and it reminded me a bit of Santa's Grotto - lovely! They have an excellent gift shop where the staff were friendly and helpful. The goods on sale were very fairly priced in comparison to shops outside. Negative comments? If anything, yeah maybe the hallways could do with a lick of paint but we weren't staying in the hallways were we? No, we didn't have tea and coffee in our room but we only ever drink it in other hotels because it's there. Did we miss it? Not a jot. After a day exploring the absolutely wonderful city of New York, the last thing we wanted was to drink coffee - all we wanted to do was drift off to sleep in our clean, comfortable bed. Hopefully, we will go back to New York one day because it is an experience we will never forget - we wouldn't hesitate in booking ourselves into the Edison Hotel again. I can't think of anything that other hotels could offer us over and above the Edison. If you are thinking about booking there then take my advice - ignore the negative reviews unless you are really, really, really, really, really, really fussy!!!!", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester,England", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4155508", "Content": "Wow what a location,2 minute walk right in to the heart of times square!We stayed at the Edison from the 17th nov to 21st,the hotel was average but clean,we had fresh towels and bedding every day,but like in one of the other reviews,who goes to New York to sit in the hotel room,I mean all the wonderful sights to see,the great people,oh and did I mention the shopping!!What an experience we had,my husband,son(who's 12),2 friends and I.Bit cold but who cares when your in such a great place as New York.We will most deffinatly be going back sometime in the near future AND be staying at the Edison.P.s there's a great deli next door,they do a mean breakfast to get you started in the morning and all the different flavours of coffee Mmm.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilkes-Barre, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Clean Room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4153349", "Content": "I had to travel to NYC on short notice for a business trip.

For the most part, the pictures of the rooms were accurate, however the bathrooms are quite small and the showers/bathtubs are a little old. Bring your own hairdryer as there are none supplied in the rooms, and if you need an iron, housekeeping will bring one by for use only for an hour. I would also recommend that if you are acustomed to using the hotel products (such as shampoo and conditioner), that you bring your own bottles. The products supplied by the hotel are small sachets and wouldn't last if you are in a group of more than two. There are no self serve ice machines or pop machines in the hotel either. We ordered ice one night and had it brought up to our room by a bellboy. We did have a bit of a problem the last night we were staying at the hotel. We had initially opened up the window in our room the first day we arrived, (which was quite easy, and it was quite obvious that the windows had been replaced since the 20's) and when we did that, the window pane came out of the track, falling towards us. Luckily we caught the window and slid it back into the track. We had informed the front desk of the issue with the window and they said they would take care of it. Our last night in the room, we came back to the suite and when we opened up the door, the window fell right out of the track, hitting the AC vent, smashing glass all over the floor, and in my suitcase which was unfortunately positioned underneath it. We had immediate service from the maintenance in the hotel and were moved to another room immediately- which was great service, but we would have rather waited, as the window was replaced before we had re-packed our suitcases and the floor merely needed vacumming. The one great thing about this hotel is the location. Times Square is located less than a city block away and there is a great strip of pubs/lounges the other block away. We walked to many of the tourist destinations and there are great restaurants located nearby. An atm is also located at the convenience store next to the hotel and there is a small gift shop within the hotel itself that has a few drinks, t-shirts, key chains etc. For my first trip to NYC, staying at the Hotel Edison was part of the experience.

Less than 2 minutes, just had to sign the form and the bell hop brought everything up to the room. We had a newly rennovated room with a double bed, a night stand a desk, a chair and a good size tv. The room looked exactly like the picture because it was remodeled. The room next to ours was not remodeled and it looked like it was from the 70's. It had everything the same as ours, just older style. People complained because there was not enough plugs, it is an old hotel. There was three outlets in the room plus the bathroom. If thats not enough and you need alot bring an extension cord. I had my laptop a curling iron, a blow dryer two phone chargers and an iron. and it was completely fine for us. It's literally a second from times square. Very convient location, as everyone else says. Great shops and food around it. Room service was great. I called for towels not even 2 minutes later they brought me a bunch, same with an iron. I guess the people who don't like this hotel are looking for a 5 star in a 3 star budget. The value was great, and i will definately plan a trip there again. Just make sure to ask for a newly renovated room. They do hold the bags after you check out. It's 50 cents a bag for as long as you need. Who cares it 50 cents, everything else in NY is expensive so i don't know why another review complained it costs 2 dollars to store 4 bags? prolly the cheapest thing there. Check out was easier than checking in. Just give them the room keys and your all set. This hotel is a deal, we visited the other hotels, near it such as the wellington which is the same money and it was gross. The bathroom in our room was small, but had a full size tub, a medicine cabinet, a toliet towel racks, and the sink. It has all the basics.

I can now understand why they need to keep fit, this really is the city that never sleeps. There is so much to see and do that you will need all the energy you've got to keep up. Above all take a sensible pair of shoes or trainers, you really will need them, and don't bother packing too much stuff, it's a very casual city so jeans and t-shirts are all you need. Take an extra bag for all the shopping you'll do, we had to buy one as we had so much stuff. and don't leave the shopping until the last minute otherwise you won't have enough time to buy all the things you want.

The room size varies with accommodation type our friends had a twin room which was larger than our double but had a more cramped bathroom, theirs had two armchairs and a coffee table ours one chair no table both had large TV\u2019s the housekeeping was excellent with ample clean linen etc. As mentioned in other reviews no kettles, a blow for the Brits it must be our nesting instinct, but no problem all you need to do is scoot downstairs out the door turn right and into the 24hr Deli choose one of many flavours of coffee or a good old Lipton\u2019s yellow label and shoot back to your room in less time than it takes a kettle to boil. Whilst there you can also bring back some gorgeous fresh fruit or hot snacks from the huge range they sell in the Deli; the hotel has no problem with you taking snacks to your room so fill your boots (obviously this is a mission for your manservant AKA husband). Having said that we did not see much of the rooms we were out and about. The location is fantastic just fall out the door into Times Square/Broadway the subway is close by and you can either buy a 7 day travel card for $24 or pay $2 per journey as you please. To be honest most things can be reached on foot, (Grand Central 10mins, Empire State 20mins etc.), which allows you to see the sites and sounds, mostly car horns and emergency vehicle sirens with which they obviously train hard to see who can get the most variety of sounds out of, presumably whilst eating donuts. Eating is interesting as the portions are generally huge in the touristy eateries so we opted to share which worked better. We found the food quality variable, like anywhere I guess, but can recommend the following restaurants Pasta Lovers, 142 West 49th St. tasty food, nice d\u00e9cor reasonable prices and Russo\u2019s in the Sheraton 790 7th Avenue at 51St. where we had an excellent after show meal. Show wise we saw the Phantom of the Opera which was great the tickets were $20 to about $100 we had $55 ones and the view was good. The locals seem to treat the theatre a bit more like a cinema with people entering mid performance and the Spanish speakers seem to feel the need to constantly talk throughout a performance but hey it all adds to the experience.

Unbelievably close to all the major shows, shopping and general turist attractions, the Edison is ideal for when - after a long day and night of being out and about - all you want to do is get to the hotel without much hassle. Our room was pretty close to being perfect. Yes the bathroom isn't very big and not particular glamourous, but it's clean with fresh towels every day. The room, which also was also cleaned and tidied up every day, was really big. It did in fact have two double beds in there. Some of my family was less lucky with their rooms but my personal experience of the Edison was pretty close to being perfect. The breakfast cafe makes excellent pancakes but i'd stay away from their sausages as their rather... ahem... interesting. The bar on the ground floor is really nice too.

My problems were... the shower would vary temperatures. Become scalding hot one second and too cool the next. Looks like old plumbing, nothing's modern about the place. There were no hairdryers. Sure you can call for one, which I did, but you were warned that you could only keep it for an hour if you used it! For cryin out loud, it's JUST a hairdryer. Just remember to take one w/you if you stay here, it's not worth the inconvenience! Oh there's no iron either! I thought the beds were extremely hard! But of course if you're like me, you'll have exhausted yourself in NYC, it's such an incredible place, you won't really notice. I ate bfst at the Edison restaurant, and it was a little disappointing. The service is slow and they don't take credit cards. The reason I stayed here and while I'll probably stay again? My company insists we stay within a budget of 175.00/N. That's hard to do in NYC, and getting harder as we approach the summer tourist season. So there aren't a lot of options. I\"m just glad to have a private bathroom, and no rats or roaches.

We were staying on the third floor, and at about 11pm the night-club beneath the hotel kicked off. The music was very loud in the room (seriously - very loud indeed)... and it went on until nearly 4am! Apart from that, the room was basic, but adequate - clean, with comfortable beds.

The waiters and waitresses were not friendly at all, the food was below average and the restaurant didn't make a clean impression at all. We didn't try out the restaurant in the hotel ( entrance on 46th street). I'd like to finish my review with this statement: When you stay at the Edison hotel, you are in the middle of New York, a step away from a ticket-discount-office for all the broadway productions which are to be seen, only a second away form busstops, next to restaurants, coffeeshops, at ten minutes walk from Rockefeller-center, at twentyfive minutes walk from Macy's and the Empire State building, briefly : you are right in the middle of the Big Apple.. and at a VERY REASONABLE PRICE!

We had to wait a bit to check in, but once we were, the bellhop showed up to our room: third floor facing 47th street. The location is amazing. Walking to the corner of Broadway and 47th, you're right in Time Square. Our room was what I thought as large, especially after reading reviews about other hotels in our budget-area. It didn't click until after we got back home, but the room could have been a bit larger because it was a corner room. Everything was super clean. Being on the 47th side, we did hear a lot of noise all night, especially when the building across the street cleaned their sidewalks at 1130pm. But, by the second night, we all slept through the noises. We never heard our neighbors or anything in the hall. Our bathroom was clean. The shower had a continuous drip, but it wasn't bothersome. It took awhile for hot water to come, but I'm guessing it was because of the cold weather. We utilized the bellhops: The second day we asked for help to the subway, and were given great directions. The last night, we asked Joe, one of the bellhops, about a place for dinner. The place he recommended was amazing, as well as college-budget-friendly.

My girlfriend had stayed there before but i was a little trepidatious having read some of the earlier TripAdvisor reviews. However one should always listen to one's girlfriend! I was very pleasantly surprised. The check in process was smooth and efficient. We had a room on the twelfth floor. One of the most stressful parts of going to a hotel is wondering what the room will be like when the door is first unlocked but we were very pleased. It was a spacious twin bedded room with a large TV that actually worked and had good picture quality, (hey i like watching TV!). The bathroom, decorated in grey tiling was small but clean with a good supply of towels and amenity products. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets clean. There was a large dresser with a good amount of drawer space. The wardrobe was a bit basic but it had a sufficient number of hangers and was fine. Our room overlooked the Barrymore Theatre. During the night there was very little to no noise outside the hotel which for New York is quite an achievement. The air conditioner worked on all the settings and was quiet. Overall for our room I would give it 9 out of 10. Very good indeed. We breakfasted each morning at the Cafe Edison which is just off the hotel lobby. The food was reasonably priced with a good choice of menu. Service was quick and friendly and the food was well cooked. It is obviously a popular breakfast destination for locals too. It has quite a history too, with it's Broadway connections displayed by posters and pictures. One is also dining in good company; there was a recent picture of Chelsea Clinton with the restaurant manager! Overall I would give the Cafe, an 8 out of 10. Before venturing out for the evening we had a drink at the hotel's bar, the Rum House (?). Drinks were very cheap during Happy Hour. The service was brisk and friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. On one of the evenings there was a lady piano player/singer with a very good voice. They also serve cappucino and espresso's for those in need of something warming but non alcoholic! The lobby at the Edison is fantastic Art Deco and very comfortable. The staff in the hotel shop were all very friendly and one of them \"loved our English accents\" which is always great to hear! It is free to open a safety deposit box although there is a $50 fine if you lose the key. I admit I had a few frantic moments searching for my key so beware. It can be easy to mislay. The Edison has a great location. As other reviewers have stated, turn right and you are in Times Square! The Subway is just across the street by the Olive Garden restaurant although it is not well signposted. It is 49th Street on the R Line. It also saves you the walk to 42nd Street/Times Square which is the next stop down the line anyway. Don't forget to buy a one day fun pass Metrocard for $7. Excellent value for money. So, our overall verdict on the hotel is 9 out of ten. Well done the Edison!!! No plaudits alas for SuperShuttle. It took us two and a quarter hours to get to JFK from our hotel, picking people up along the way. We drove past/through Times Square three times!! Nerves were getting frayed by myself and fellow passengers as we risked missing our flights. Next time we would buy a return ticket on the New York Transport Service Shuttle bus which includes return transfer to Grand Central Station from the Edison and then a bus directly to JFK non stop.

We had requested 5 rooms all on the same floor - one for each of the chaperones and 3 for groupings of the kids. We were on 4 different floors. The first rooms they showed us were way too small to sleep more than 1 or 2 kids in. We had to persist very hard to get them to find appropriate rooms. My room was a single, which is another way to say it was a closet with a bed. When they first brought me up to my room (a bellman HAS TO lead you to your room), the room was a mess. Not only was it dirty, but had what looked like aspirins everywhere! The worst is yet to come. My first night I heard some noises in the radiator in the room, despite it not being on. My fears were confirmed when the second day I returned from a busy day to find that a large rodent had invaded my travel bag and ate most of a wrapped protein bar inside the bag. When I told management, they seemed unconcerned but volunteered to move me to another floor. The first room was unsatisfactory so they offered another, informing me that it was a handicapped room. Good luck to a handicapped guest who stays there. There were only two electric outlets so they had strew numerous extension cords all over the floor for the lamps, etc. The handicapped bathroom had a large pipe that extended from the ceiling to floor near the sink that must have been for hot water or the radiator as the I almost burned myself when I tried to turn on the light switch nearby.

I certainly didn't want my bare feet or even socked feet touching that carpet. The lock on the door appeared to have been tampered with at one time and never fixed. It was so loose, that I had to make several attempts to even get the swipe card to work. I felt that both restaurants were lousy. The Fettucini Alfredo at Sofia's was awful and the breakfast I had at the cafe' was cold. Not one time did any of the waiters at either place come back and ask how the meal was. All they did was slap the check down on the table and leave. Expedia is making a big mistake by advertising this as a 3 star hotel on their web-site. Won't trust them again.

We recently spent 8 nights at this hotel and I cant honestly say that I was overly impressed. The impressive part is as other reviews have indicated you leave the front door of the lobby and you are literally in times square which is great and the rooms are clean, however if you intend on having a quiet stay this is not the place for you! We were checked in on the 6th floor right next to the elevators which you could hear going up and down the wall. Although this is noise you get use to we were paying a fairly top dollar rate in Australian dollars and that is a noise I dont think you should have to put up with. Then over two nights starting at 11 pm till 1pm jackhammering started outside and yes you can hear this as loud as a bell six floors up . We contacted security but he couldn't hear it from the front of the hotel however this noise was coming from a side street which our room faced. We then asked to be moved and with the hotel full they moved us to the 3rd floor in a different part of the hotel which was no better as from 12pm you could hear thumping from drums and guitar playing and some singing. This noise started again at 7am on Sunday morning so if you need a wake up call rest assured the guitar will provide an adequate one for you! I am unsure whether this noise came from the bar lounge within the hotel or a club near by. You are however within a couple of minutes walking distance from the gray line sightseeing office where you can redeem your internet bookings or make bookings. We spent alot of time eating from the FANTASTIC ''Food Imporium\" where they have bread rolls ,cold meats. cakes of all descriptions, hot chickens and hot buffet style meals to take away. This was located in the street to the left as you leave the Edison Lobby then turn right at the traffic lights and walk up a couple of streets you can't miss it! The Cafe Edison is WONDERFUL. You are able to get anything from breakfast cerial to evening baked dinners which they change nightly. The cafe is always really busy from hotel guests and walkins from the street. For 12.95 you get half chicken ,vegetables, potato or chips,soup and your choice of beverage. We stayed in New York two years ago and stayed at the Howard Johnson Plaza a couple of streets down from the Edison and had a great stay. The only reason we didn't return there was reviewers had reported bed bugs since our stay. The lobby of the hotel is Lovely and takes you back to the deco style of Radio City Music Hall.

Of the 5 hotels we stayed in, the Edison was by far and away the worst hotel. Don't get me wrong it has a great location practically on Times Square but the hotel itself and the service was appalling. We were checked in by a desk clerk with practically no customer service skills. He barely acknowledged us and kept muttering \"This is ridiculous\" to himself about 4 times as he was apparently having to deal with some other problems at the time. He then handed the room key to the bell guy and said nothing to us like room number or enjoy your stay or anything. The bell guy took us up to our room. (The bell guys are great as I think some other reviewers have said). We were on the 6th floor with the most ridiculously noisy air conditioning going on from a nearby building. We asked to be moved and ended up 2 (?!) rooms down in a slightly quieter room (as the hotel was supposedly full). With no other option we tried to spend the night there and despite a few drinks to help sleep and earplugs we still kept getting woken by the noise. The next day we were moved to a room on the 19th floor which was the size of most other hotel bathrooms (but quieter). Never once did we get apologies, not to mention for the times the room cards stopped working. The hotel is in desperate need of a refurb. The power points are plain dangerous.

My girlfriend and I visited NYC to enjoy the Broadway shows (which were fabulous!) and to take in all the sights and sounds (visit dates - August 19 - 24, 2004). We had a wonderful visit! We were put into a hotel room with two twin beds...the room was so small that I could not open my suitcase on the floor...I had to put it on my bed to open it. However, the room was very clean and quiet. We asked for a room on a higher floor (10th floor), and you could not hear any traffic noise or other guests. The elevators are very FAST, due to a recent renovation, taking literally seconds to go from the lobby to the 10th floor. The hotel staff was friendly enough, and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING. Three Broadway theatres are right next to the hotel. If you want tickets for a show, go to the TKTS tent in Times Square, which is just a block away. The first night, we checked into our room around 7:20 PM; went to the TKTS tent and bought tickets at 50% off for \"Beauty and the Beast\", then went to the 8 PM show! (It was playing in the theatre next door to the hotel). Lots of restaurants, nightclubs and bars near the hotel. We walked everywhere...we did not even need a taxi. I would definitely stay at the Edison again. I much prefer it to the cold, sterile environments of the nearby Marriott and the Hilton Times Square. The little coffee shop at the Edison is delightful! It is the hotel's former ballroom, and has a domed ceiling and what appears to be original artwork. We had a delicious and very reasonable breakfast in the little cafe, which was cozy and beautiful.

It could barely fit the 2 beds in it and it was completely not what was shown to us on hotels. Thus begins the battle with the hotel. After we were given the runaround for about a half an hour we were given another room. We arrived at the second room with our luggage and to our disbelief there was only 1 bed. We quickly argued with the desk to give us the room we were promised or at least a better room with 2 beds. We left our luggage in the 2nd room and headed off to the show we were now late for. When we got back we picked up the key for our 3rd room. We went to the second room to pick up our luggage and saw that there were 4 gigantic dead cockroaches on the bathroom floor. We took our luggage and ran to the lobby. The man at the desk, Steve, finally got ahold of the manager.

It was beautiful! Anyways, the info desk was more than helpfull and everything was much more than a rated 2 star hotel. I think that they are trying to renovate the hotel and make it more worthy, cuz i would rate the hotel 4 stars... seriously! the location is more than perfect with the lovely morning breakfast place near called cafe EuropeAn, and with the club downstairs and the one a few feet down the block!

What a lovely surprise when I arrived at this hotel. The Hotel is older but well maintained. Kind of an artsy Deco style. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean with nice furnishings. Cafe had the greatest food and the lounge was very lively at night. Being so close to Time Square is a very convenient aspect--close to walking everywhere in Midtown. I would highly recommend this hotel and will try to stay there on my next trip.", "Date": "April 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Kate_Cold", "ReviewID": "UR1775304", "Content": "Myself & my partner stayed here for 3 nights 18th - 20th March and found this hotel perfect for our needs. It's literally a stones throw from Times Square & within easy walking distance of Central Park and all midtown areas. We were pleasantly suprised by the room... although relatively small it was clean & comfortable with a daily maid service bringing fresh towels. We were on the 21st floor so experienced no noise from street level. If I was to visit NYC again I would definitely use this hotel & therefore recommend it as a great tourist hotel.", "Date": "April 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haddonfield, NJ", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat the location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1726098", "Content": "We've just returned from a weekend in NYC staying at the Edison.

The Edison is a great value for theater lovers. The walk to almost all the theaters is 5 minutes or less. I booked the room online and requested a non-smoking room on a high floor. We checked in about 1 pm on Saturday and the room was ready and very clean and just as I had requested. True, the bathrooms are small and you have to bring a hair dryer (or request one from housekeeping). I travel to NYC once a year for pleasure and this is the first hotel I can recall in the Times Square area that is quiet. We slept like babies with no street noise at all. The beds were very comfortable. I recommend the Edison as a good choice for a moderately priced tourist hotel for theater goers. As a plus, you are literally steps from the TKTS booth in Times Square. Also, the Cafe Edison has a great, cheap breakfast. Eggs, choice of meat, potatoes and toast for under $6. That includes coffee and juice, as well.", "Date": "March 8, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Edison Hotel Times Square", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93437-Reviews-Edison_Hotel_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$232 - $355*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">228 West 47th Street</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Between 8th Avenue and Broadway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10036</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514387", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/24/7a/247ad546128b2104380a6e3e287b5ccf3large.jpg"}}
