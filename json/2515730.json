My experience was better: my room was clean, equipment worked (although it took me 15 minutes to get the TV channel I wanted because no matter what I hit on the remote, it kept advertising pay per view movies), and I had no real problems. It seemed noisier than average, and parking spaces were quite tight. The free breakfast had Comfort Inn's usual range of foods, though the eggs and sausage were a bit below par; the breakfast room is huge, and constantly busy but there was almost always room, and the food kept coming.Front desk staff was a little brusque but not unpleasant--I would say the hotel, which is large, was understaffed. It's kind of a factory, big place, heavy traffic,move 'em in, move 'em out, lots of families. There are not a lot of restaurants nearby, and the recommendations from the front desk were mostly chains. But the good points are worth noting: it is cheap (about $70 a night) and convenient to many attractions as well as to the interstates.If you're looking for a great hotel, forget it.

We did the advance purchase. We read the reviews for this hotel(due to booking error) after we booked and thought that well most of the bad reviews were last year and it seemed that they were trying to turn things around. Additionally we were not aware there were two hotels on the same street so when I initially did my research it was on the other hotel and when we finally booked it we booked for this one instead of the other in error.We payed around 99.00 a night for a room with a queen bed and a bunk bed for our two kids. The room as previous guest stated had a very musty smell. The carpet color was hard to really decipher and had several variations showing. The bathroom was very dirty. The door had chipped and cracked paint. If you looked up while running water in the sink there was a space which had an outlet and a strip that was dirt riddled. The shower curtain was filthy. The bathroom sink water ran constantly and could not be turned off. When I enquired about a resolve I was told that they would speak with the manager and call me back. We waited about 2 hours and we had to go because we had tickets to a show. When we returned the problem had not been fixed and when we called back the new person now had no knowledge of our complaint and stated that they were probably working on it and would get back to me when they returned. At the point I deemed it useless to complain about anything else as their would be no resolve. We tried to spend as less time as possible in the room. The bathtub had a chip and the tile was clearly dirty with years of caked on dirt. We wore our flip flops in the shower and my children were not permitted to walk bare foot anywhere in the room. The hair dryer was missing the wire part that covers the barrel and if you were not careful you coould burn yourself. The hair dryer was also rusted. I always bring Lysol and febreeze when I travel and a few other cleaning items. I spent a couple of hours cleaning this room since it was spring break other hotels in the area were booked. The bunk beds were unleveled and the sheets on one of the beds were dirty. Good thing I brought my own. The dishes in the kitchen area were also dirty. I would not have used them anyway. My son spilled juice on the old brown blanket that was under the comforter and it was purple and they just made the bed up and did not change it. You could clearly see there was a stain. The coffee pot was also filthy as well as the tray that everything set on. The refrigerator had an offensive odor whenever you opened it. The chairs at the table were broken and had holes. The Queen bed comforter had a holes in it and the sheets had some old black stains. The room was very small you lose space due to them putting in a bunk bed. A kitchen chair width is the distance from the queen bed to the bunk bed. the chair touched my bed and the bunk bed. So the rooms were very small. There were various types of stains on the walls, baseboards, and ceilings throughout the room. I agree with the other quest who stated not a deluxe room. The \" breakfast buffet\" is housed in a room that appears to be the size of one of their hotel rooms. The food on one day was powdered eggs, bacon, cereals, boiled, eggs, yogurt, coffee, pastry, toast, juice, and coffee. They had on dish of eggs and bacon they would put out for the masses of people. The lady would bring out the bacon and then go back to get the eggs by the time she came back the bacon was all gone. I also watched the same lady go and stick her hand in the trash because it was full then open the door and remove the eggs from the microwave and come out and serve them. I also watched her then change the trash then go over and fill up the cereal containers. All done without gloves. There were two ladies one wore gloves one did not. The waffle area was a nightmare. The machine was always empty and the area was a mess. It took over 1 1/2 to actually have a complete breakfast due to the way they brought out the microwave foods. I did not eat any of the pastries but some other guest were complaining that the pastry tasted stale. The overall set up has to be a health hazzard as far as how the food is prepared and served I would honestly say that there was a motel 6 and some other 1 star rated hotels that cost about 39.00 per night I would not pay $39.00 a night to stay here. I have always liked Comfort Inn and Suites but due to my stay at this one. I WILL NEVER EVER CHOSE A COMFORT INN HOTEL AGAIN. Any chain like Comfort Inn that would allow this Hotel to represent them is not a place I would stay. If I had the option of rating this hotel with a 0 star it would have received that rating. This place in the bottom of the bucket more like a motel not a hotel.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Makawao, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cBig Bang for your Buck\u201d", "Author": "MauiRanger", "ReviewID": "UR126450742", "Content": "We stayed one night at the Comfort Inn & Suites on our way back from a 10 day trip just prior to going back to Hawaii and had a very good experience. Some of the positives of this hotel are: 1. The front desk workers are marvelous. They were fast, friendly, and very helpful to anything we needed. Check-in and check-out was a breeze and they took the time out to talk with me and answer some \"tourist\" questions that I had. 2. The rooms were in excellent condition. I hear other reviewers crying about how old the rooms are. To me, the rooms were in great condition especially when you consider the price. If you want custom decor, fancy carpet, a luxurious bathroom, etc. then shell out the dough and go to a 4+ star hotel. 3. Parking was only $8 per day. We payed $22/day (for 3 days) at the DoubleTree downtown which was very difficult to do being that we were hotel guests. Some people talk about lack of parking space or location of parking, but we found the parking adequate. Unless each room gets their own stall, you can't expect a prime spot all the time. 4.The location is in the Hotel Circle area. Very convenient to get on and off of the freeways. The outside automobile noise was non-existent once you went inside the room. It's also a stone throw's away from the Mission Valley and Fashion Valley Malls. There are also ton's of stores and eateries in the area. Some of the things that could have been better were: 1. Breakfast was like a madhouse - People were everywhere and the food ran out quickly. It was amazing watching some of the guests take food and eat. You would think as though it was their last meal on earth. When things are free you notice some level of class goes down the drain but I guess that's human nature. A big downer was that breakfast wait staff were not too friendly and NONE of them were smiling. I've read a recent review saying that the breakfast staff seemed overwhelmed and that is very accurate. They looked like they weren't enjoying their jobs. Since the breakfast area is so small, we took our food back to our room as there were no open seats available. Having a complimentary breakfast is such a breath of fresh air and we really appreciated it. Maybe a bigger room and a friendlier breakfast staff (it's hard to look at long faces so early) would've made our morning. 2. Noise from rooms - We stayed on St. Patricks Day and there seemed to be various high school and college groups in the hotel. One thing we didn't like was that the noise level (after 11 p.m.) was not policed better. It would be nice if a security staff member come around after hours to maintain the noise level in on the floors. There were kids running around chasing each other in and out of rooms on our floor. As we walked pass other rooms on our floor, the loud laughing and screaming were very audible. We were glad that they weren't our neighbors for the night. All in all, we had a great experience at the hotel. The staff's friendliness and professionalism made our stay comfortable. We definitely would stay here again and recommend it to our friends.

I asked her about the old style outside rooms and she commented that they were 'grandfathered in' with Comfort Inn's as the owner bought this property and converted it. We were given a family suite on the lower level of the hotel, but there were not any parking spots left by our room so we had to park on the other side of the building. We got to the room and there was a kitchenette in the room which consisted of a very old table that was re-screwed together several times from being broken. The bathroom was not very clean and the rooms were very noisy! The fridge was very noisy and so were the neighbors. The first morning we went to breakfast around 8am and went thru the line and got eggs, sausage, coffee, juice and rolls. I got ready to return to the line and found that there was no food out and that there was a huge line. The breakfast area is very small and does not seat very many people. The waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and nobody was there to wipe tables or anything let alone prepare food. This was by far the worst Comfort Inn that I have ever stayed at! The 2nd night we were able to park by our room, but the breakfast was worse the 2nd day. We went earlier, but they were out of sausage, out of bacon and had just a little bit of eggs and a few sweet rolls and muffins out. For an advertised \"hot breakfast buffet\" it was very pitiful! I would not recommend staying if eating breakfast is important to you. The first night we had coffee packets in our room, the 2nd night we didn't. Guess you only get one per stay!

I am pleased to state that it seems that some of the complaints or issues addressed last September seems to be corrected; however, some new issues have come up which I hope management now realizes and hopefully correct. First, the good news: The defrosted waffles (erroneous stated as pancakes) has been replaced by freshly (self)made ones, and even included a 'Flavor of the Day' batter (would be good to have a sign so we know WHAT it is!), in addition to the Original recipe. It seemed that the entire breakfast has been upgraded, more selections, and much better than before, and for that, we do commend management in attempting to rectify deficiencies. We did notice that there was no cocoa or hot chocolate, which was eliminated. Room was very good for the price that we paid. However ... a couple of things in the room (1420) that were awry were: Dripping faucet in wash basin; surprised that the maid did not report this (embarrassed to say that I forgot to report it when I checked out). When turning on the handle/knob for shower, it's always been my experience that turning clockwise (left) is for Hot water and turning to the right is for Cold water - it is reversed here, but not sure if this is an anomaly or deliberate. Air conditioner/heater was extremely noisy when going on and kept me up at night; had to finally turn it off in order to sleep! I am hoping it is just this ONE room, as I did not have problems of this nature last time I was here. Finally, the $8 charged for parking still bugs me. Should not need this, as hotel is NOT in a downtown area; I realize that it is in Hotel Circle, but some of the other hotels in that area do not charge for parking. Wonder why Comfort Inn feels the need to charge - besides the obvious \"making money\".

When booking at the counter, I had some trouble using a coupon code which apparently only works when you call in a reservation so the girl behind the counter let me use her cell phone even though she was about to finish her shift. Service overall was superb. The location is average. I mean, it's not exactly close to San Diego attractions like Balboa Park, 5th Avenue, the waterfront, etc. but it's in the same boat as a gazillion other hotels which are located along Hotel Circle Road. (Hotel Circle Rd. N and Hotel Circle Rd. S. are on opposite sides of a major highway so if you have a car, there's easy access to the rest of the city... otherwise, not so much.) Speaking of location... There is a Comfort Suites hotel right on the other side of the highway (on Hotel Circle NORTH) that is less nice and more expensive so make sure you know to go to this one. When I called the 1-888 number for Choice Hotels and wanted to book this place, they by mistake almost confirmed me for the OTHER hotel... I didn't notice until they told me the price which was almost double! So watch out. The room itself was spacious, as was the bathroom but I think that's because we got the handicapped room (even though we didn't need or request it). I'm not sure how other rooms in the hotel compare. Beds were comfy and TV worked fine. Parking is $5 per car, so that's not bad. The breakfast at this hotel is amazing compared to other budget hotels we've stayed at. Beverages: several kinds of coffees and teas, cappuccino machine with 2 or 3 types, hot chocolate, 4 different kinds of juice, water, 2% milk & skim milk. Food: Oakmeal, 2 or 3 kinds of cereal, waffles with syrup, scrambled eggs, muffins, cookies, boiled whole eggs, toast with butter or cream cheese and honey and several types of jam, sausages, english muffins, ...and more (can't remember everything). UNFORTUNATELY, we slept in and most of that food was already gone by the time we got there after 9am (breakfast runs from 6:30 to 9:30am). A lot of people were packing food to go, which wasn't very nice... but we still managed to get a decent breakfast. There's an outdoor pool which looked quite pleasant and well maintained.

The rooms are accessed from the outdoors, with parking spots in front of the rooms (for an additional $5 fee). The room smelled fine, with no bad noticeable smells. It was dated and definitely could use new bed spread covers, drapes and carpet, but the sheets were clean and the bed was comfortable. The separate bathroom includes a toilet and tub/shower combo and it was very small, but manageable and clean. The sink is on the outside in the main sleeping/sitting area.

I checked two different rooms, in both floors: same smell. I can\u2019t imagine how it could be in summer, but in mid-October it was strong enough to make me think about moving elsewhere after the first night. We ended up staying three nights, because travelling with a baby means powerful an demanding logistics. Turning the AC on helped with the smell during the day while we were not in the room. These rooms are simply not ventilated! Besides that and the 5 dollar parking charge, an acceptable place overall, slightly expensive for what it is. THE GOOD: - Correctly sized room with a big standard TV (not many channels, and just one for kids) and two queen beds, no refrigerator no microwave oven, coffee machine. Shower head, bathtub and water temperature OK. - Two ice machines, both on the first floor. - WiFi Internet connection worked well inside the room - Room was overall clean (but I\u2019m not the guy looking for bed bugs in every hotel room anyway) - Average American continental breakfast buffet (toasts, bagels, waffles to be made by guest, cereals, cupcakes, pastries, cream cheese, ham, boiled eggs (very cold, direct from the fridge, probably made the day before). Coffee, milk, good orange and apple juice. No cheese, ham, bacon, or scrambled eggs. Machine made hot chocolate (too sweet to ne drinked) - House keeping was OK (last day they forgot to leave towels in the room) - Friendly front desk staff - Italian restaurant next door (was closed at 8 PM on Thursday), and some other places to eat down the street (5-10 minute walk) - Good location, close to Sea World, Balboa Park, Old Town, Airport (of course you need a car, unlike the Days Inn Motel on the same street, there\u2019s no complimentary shuttle). Only hotels in the neighbourhood, if you need groceries there\u2019s a small store down the street. - Did not use the pool, but it\u2019s heated THE BAD - Sink outside the bathroom (Why do they do that?) - Annoying 5 dollar parking charge (first time in my life and I\u2019m well travelled) - Checked in on Thursday for a three night and was told the price was 69, but on the bill the charges for Friday and Saturday were 89. I know this is normal, but they should have told me before they swiped my credit card. Would not have paid 89 if I had more time to look for a place to stay and certainly not if I has checked the room before. - Breakfast fruit (apples and oranges) as seen on the big LED screen on the street, showed up only for the weekend - A/C too loud, impossible to sleep while it\u2019s on, fortunately weather was kind of cold and we did not need it.

Our trip was based on Sea World. We got a room with 2 queen beds. We got our room for $85/night with AAA. Our travel group included my dad and my brother and sister (both 17). We thought that the hotel was great. The room, shower, and beds were clean. I recommend to definitely try to get a room on the second floor, because at night the car's headlights go through the 1st floor room windows. Also, you want to get a room towards the back. The hotel was only three miles (5 minutes via freeway) away from SeaWorld and only 5-10 minutes away from Old Town. After reading the previous reviews and about the breakfast and actually attending it, I have this to say: If you get there between 6:30am and 7:15am then there will not be a crowd and you can easily make your waffle and toast your bagel/bread. If you get there any later, expect to wait because it gets crowded and especially when the hotel is completely booked. The waffle maker becomes a disaster when people make more than one waffle and a line begins to form. The trick for the bagel toasting, is to put it in the toaster and then put in in the movable toaster rack. We did not eat dinner at Ricky's Diner, because it was closed due to the massive egg recall. However, I do recommend going to Old Town and eat in the area where it is closed off to cars. There are a lot of neat little shops. The pool was OK. If you have kids then it is great because it is very family friendly. It is packed at night because everyone leaves their rooms by day and comes back at night. The only problems that I had with the hotel was that there were no recycling bins. Also, the pillows were about half the size of a normal standard pillow. The $5 parking charge was not great but at a budget hotel then it is fine. The parking lot was a little crowed, but you just have to deal with it and carefully park your car. The hotel is across the street from the freeway but it is not directly next to it like the other Comfort Inn in the same general area. Don't expect a Ritz Carlton/ Hilton/ Shearton when you book this hotel.

Since I know PL only guarantees double occupancy, I called well in advance to request two beds. This is almost always granted by other hotels. When I arrived, I again asked the front desk person if it was possible to get two beds. He said NOTHING to me, just kept clicking away on his keyboard. He handed me the keys and pointed the way to the room. He gave me a king room. The AC was awful, you'd freeze with the AC or die with just the fan. No happy medium could be found. The breakfast was a joke. The hotel was sold out, so the breakfast room was packed, with only two waffle makers. There weren't any indications of how people should line up for the various foods. The workers would instruct people in Spanish where to line up, but if you weren't bilingual, you could be waiting in the wrong line for 10-20 minutes. Cappucino/ hot chocolate machine was down the whole 4 days we stayed there. Since they had hot water, you'd think they'd supply hot chocolate packets, right. Nope. Housekeeping came at 4:30 pm every day. After a full day of sightseeing with small kids, we expected to come back to a clean room. Alas, no. We had to leave right as the kids started to rest, so the room could be made up. Very often as we were driving through the parking lot, some housekeepers would be strolling down the middle of the road, not moving over to the side for the guests to pass by. One morning we got a call at 7:30am from the \"front desk\" saying there was a computer glich and I needed to give them my credit card info again. I told them I'd be down in a little while, but then they said it must be done immediately and I could give them the info over the phone. I knew it was fishy, and when I went to the front desk, there were a bunch of other people saying they received similar calls. Obviously, the hotel can't stop crank callers, but they didn't offer an apology either. The $5 a night for parking is another pain, especially when a letter at the front desk says it's the cheapest parking in the area. Many of the hotels in Hotel Circle DO NOT CHARGE for parking, so I think FREE is cheaper than $ 5. The TV volume on the regular channels was way lower than the Hotel channel, so you'd have to crank the volume when watching TV, then when you turned it on again, it defaulted to the Hotel channel and it would be blaring!

We were tired after a long drive in from Yuma, and wanted dinner, so I didn't address it right away. Big mistake. The following morning, I wrote on the notepad (on the night stand) that is needed to be cleaned. When I returned, the notepad and pen were gone, but the wad of gum was still there! We also killed 6 large crickets in our room (only slightly less horrifying than cockroaches). We also found a small bug in the bedding on the 3rd day which may or may not have been a bedbug (no other signs of bedbugs were found) and we changed rooms immediately. Other than the insects, the beds were comfortant, except that the 2 rooms we were in didn't have proper standard size pillows. Instead, the hotel uses small throw cushion size ones, which I did not like. I know this isn't a fancy place, but come on! Even a fleabag motel has proper pillows. The bathroom sink is in the living area, separate from the toilet/tub/shower. All I could think was how often is that door knob cleaned?!? The towels were fine, about what I expected, and the toiletries were replaced when we ran out. As mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel is \"flyered\" daily. Menus for a pizza and a Mexican restaurant were shoved through the door every evening. This actually gave me a good scare the first night because before the flyer was totally shoved through it sounded like someone was trying to \"jimmy\" (pick ) the lock with a credit card or something. I don't know if there is any legal recourse to stop this, but I suggest the hotel try to do something to put a stop to this. The photo of the free breakfast on the hotel's site, and on the sign in front of the hotel of the are totally inaccurrate. I would go as far as to say it's false advertising but hey!

In fact the location itself was great. Just 5 minutes from the Fashion Valley shopping centre and a few minutes or less from the freeway entry/exits. However, our room was behind the front/roadside reception/room building and set far enough not to hear any roadside noise. The reception staff were efficient and seemed friendly enough. The room itself had a decent little kitchen and dining table (which was the main reason my gf and I chose the Comfort Inn) and the place was actually pleasant to stay in - reasonably modern, not overly cramped, nice bathroom. All the Comfort Inns have free wireless internet which is great when travelling and planning etc. It was pretty hot in San Diego at the time and while the room had a very efficient aircon it unfortunately was too noisy to leave on during the night even at the lowest setting. We instead max. the aircon to chill the room and then turned it off - but still slightly uncomfortable (this was the same as for the LA Comfort Inn). The place was chocka full of guests at the time (a couple of soccer teams) so the breakfast room was a bit like the freeway at 7am (not quite bumper to bumper but busy). I imagine some people would love the breakfast offering - muffins, pastries, waffle maker, cereal, juices, coffees teas, apples and oranges, boiled eggs but I'm a bit more into slightly healthier fare so I would have preferred more fruit and muesli. Still can't complain much as I think its a pretty good selection for most.

I had the smallest single room I have ever seen-- and I travel a LOT, including overseas. It was $150. Preposterous. Front desk said the sign was incorrect but the manager hadn't changed it.

Their \"breakfast buffet\" was a \"carbohydrate buffet\", absolutely jam packed with so many people and so loud that we couldn't stand it. Not even oatmeal, just cold cereals, some fruit, some mass-packaged, very average pastries, and hard boiled eggs. No thanks. (Photo on site is inaccurate.) Stayed three nights and never ate there. No way. Fine for families with lots of kids who don't care, but not grown-ups. And it was deafeningly loud, and nearly impossible to move around in because of the massive crowd. Terrible.

Lots of \"questionable\" types staying there (tattoos, missing teeth, lots of smoking cigarettes early morning-- make your own conclusions.

Parking spaces-- if you can find one (something like $5 extra a night) are VERY close together. Be ready for door dings. And due to the clientele, I was concerned with break-ins. 5.

We were traveling with extended family on a limited budget. None of us planned on using the hotel room for anything other than showers and sleep and we did not want to spend lots of money on a fancy name. In many respects we were pleasantly surprised by what we found. The hotel is older, but the rooms had received some attention in the not distant past. We were there with about forty football teams attending a football tournament. When we saw them at check-in I wanted to run in the opposite direction. We never heard them at all. This old concrete block building absorbed noise, and we never heard a voice or a footstep even though we were on the bottom floor next to the stairs. The staff was also attentive and quick to call supervisors if the kids got rowdy. The swimming pool area was clean, and the grandchildren enjoyed it enormously. This hotel enjoys an excellent location with easy on and off ramps. There is nothing much available in terms of food or entertainment within walking distance, but it is California where no one walks anywhere anyway. The breakfast was a great attempt at providing something nice. They offered waffles which you could make yourself, hard boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, a huge assortment of pastries, bagels and a variety of breads to toast yourself as well as juice, milk, tea and coffee. The hotel also offered wireless internet in the guest rooms, which we really appreciated. Now the negatives: The floor did not appear to be overly dirty, but it was filthy. The soles of our feet were black. We bathed the babies and they ran to their beds, and in that short journey we had to wash their feet again. It was unpleasant walking about on the floor because we knew it was dirty. The breakfast was great in concept, but in practice it was a dismal failure. It was like they planned to provide space for fifty people and 300 actually showed up. The space available was completely inadequate to the demands of the guests. The first morning we were lucky enough to grab a small table so we had a place for plates, and somewhere for the little ones to sit. There were two waffle makers and a line of 40 people. In addition, the little football kids knew nothing about making waffles and they slowed the process down enormously. The following three days we went to the breakfast room and collected a few things to bring back to the room - mainly bagels and fruit. It was, however, such an ordeal that on our final two days we just went out to breakfast negating the financial advantage of having breakfast provided with the price of the room. The guest laundry facilities were also completely inadequate for the number of rooms. We waited hours to use the washer and dryer and other guests were not responsible about watching their own laundry making everything even more difficult in terms of time. I thought that the hotel was fine for what it was - an aging hotel trying to keep pace with the 21st Century. If I had paid $70/night I would have even felt OK about the breakfast situation. At $100/night I felt that the hotel was over-priced. If you stay here my advice is to give up the luxury of sleeping in on vacation and arrive at the breakfast room when it opens, or give up on breakfast completely, and try to bring enough clothing so it is not necessary to visit the laundry, and take socks to wear on your feet which you can just throw away when you leave.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cA friendly hotel and good value\u201d", "Author": "imagumby", "ReviewID": "UR31677353", "Content": "Spent 3 nights here late May 09.

Normally, that isn't a big deal (it was only $5), but the parking was very tight and I had to park far away from the room. Also, the main page of Comfort Inns website even states that there is free parking. To make matters even worse, there was no easy or direct was to get from the car/lobby area to the room. I had to walk all the way around the building because the pool was closed. On a non-holiday weekend, this place would probably be better and it wasn't too bad overall.

I like the fact that they seem to have round the clock faciliites personnel - they were out in their golf carts all the time, and responded to every request immediately. There were lots of families at the hotel, apparently visiting the local attractions. Nevertheless, we always found a nice table at the breakfast buffet. There was a lot of variety, but I would not consider it special. They have waffles, danish and juices, but the only healthy food were hard boiled eggs, apples, oranges and raisin bran cereal. I wish they included some whole grains, such as bran muffins or oatmeal. Fortunately, we had brought our own cereal and other items. This being said, the employees kept the buffet filled and the tables clean all the time. It was a busy yet very clean and inviting environment. The grounds are kept immaculate, and the pool/jacuzzi area is very nice. They even have two barbecue grills there for guests. At other locations around the premises, you can find vending machines with drinks and snacks, ice machines, and a well-lit guest laundry. There is no fitness center, but guests can use the one at a sister hotel down the street. One of our family members used it twice, and reported it to be very nice.

Location: From the is property, one can easily access I-8 , I-5 and I-15. Seaworld, San Diego Zoo, and the Airport are all quick drives. The property is backed by a steep hill/cliff and is somewhat separated from the freeway, so road noise is minimal, especially at the back of the property. 2. Breakfast: With 3 hungry boys, the breakfast was a real cost savings for us. Yes, it is crowded. Yes, there isn't any bacon and eggs. Oh well. There were 2 waffle stations, the pastries varied daily, fresh fruit was available, hot and cold cereal choices, coffee, juices, boiled eggs, etc. 3. The room was clean and comfortable - nothing fancy. There was no sign of bugs, or mold, or mold odor (could be the time of year, it wasn't too hot yet). Our room was on the top floor, back end of the building, so it was very quiet. 4. Staff: Pleasant and helpful.

The desk staff also helped with airline ticket printing and answering tourist info questions. So what were the cons? Not many. Parking spots are tight - especially if you have a larger vehicle (thank goodness for sliding doors on the van!) Pool was decidely chilly - then again we are from Canada where hotel pools are generally indoors and heated... New mattresses arrived on site the day before we left - just our luck! We ate at the Tickled Trout restaurant (twice) at the Ramada next door. The boys (11,8 and 5) loved it.

It was basic but comfortable. The biggest problem was the TV. It had an issue where it would not switch to regular channels and instead just kept playing the \"pay per view\" options over and over. And the kicker, is the damn TV wouldn't turn off. Neither the remote or the button on the TV itself wouldn't turn the TV off. So we were stuck listening to commercials for sometimes up to 20 minutes before one of the buttons would finally work to turn it off. I called the front desk to ask for assistance. They said they would send someone but 20 minutes later no one had shown up. By then the TV started acting properly again. The breakfast was o.k. Lots of muffins, danishes and cereals. There was a big line up for the waffle maker. Lots of kids everywhere too. The had warnings in the room about not leaving things open because of possible break ins. They also warned about people putting pizza flyer's under the door and to stay away from them because its people making pizza in their garage without regulations.
