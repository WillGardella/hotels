Best, they compensated by providing a free weekend night voucher, which we used two nights later. Since we were a family of four, Bridget, manager of the Wall St CQ, booked us a suite at Midtown. Since our arrival (and despite the free night), Kevin Chan and Stephen provided the best personalized service.

Also, for taxis, you'll want to go to Fifth or Sixth avenues as 45th is not a two-way street and most of the taxis are prowling the avenues for fares. Also note that my taxi from Penn Station dropped me off at the corner of 45th & Sixth Ave., giving me a bit of a walk, though I did opt for this to reduce stress for all concerned.

The midtown location is very convenient to both Penn and Grand Central Stations, Times Square, Broadway. Rockefeller Center and just about anywhere in Midtown.

In short, it's just ok. The lobby is very small and you check yourself in and out. They had a guy there to take your luggage but that's about it. Nobody helps you in and out the doors, there's no real concierge, and nobody to help you hail a taxi if you have your hands full. We arrived very early and they kept our bags for free while we went out and about. We could have checked in early for an extra $30. The room itself was very small with a double bed. The bathroom is also very small and the sliding door doesn't connect to anything at the bottom, so you don't get very much privacy in the bathroom. We didn't have an iron in our room and had to ask twice for one to be delivered to our room. The bed was pretty hard but we were so tired that we didn't notice much. There's a desk in the room and free wi-fi, which we didn't use. You have to go to the ice machine on the 2nd floor to get an ice bucket but nobody tells you that. We discovered it on our own. They do offer free bottled water on every other floor. They heavily advertise the Terrace bar and restaurant as a perk for both Club Quarters and the Jewel, which is 2 doors down and a sister hotel. However, on our first night, we were told the bar was closed for a private party. The second night, a Saturday, the bar closed at 10 pm. So, it's not much of an amenity if you just want to have a night cap. The hotel is across the street from Rockefeller Center and on the same block as Radio City, so it's in a convenient spot if that's what you're looking for. Upon checking out, we found that they had charged us $15 a day for an extra person. We booked the room initially for 2 people. We were told when we checked out that the room we booked was for 1 person only. At $279/nt and with an extra person fee and an early check-in charge, this hotel seems to be milking travelers. There are better deals and better hotels to be had in Midtown West. Earlier this year I stayed at the Royalton and loved it. I still recommend it over Club Quarters.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sharon, MA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient Location, But....\u201d", "Author": "DGandSAG", "ReviewID": "UR121812675", "Content": "We stayed at the Club Quarters because of its location in Midtown Manhattan, just a short walk from our business meetings. Although the hotel was conveniently located, it left a lot to be desired. On the plus side, the common areas on the main floor were very attractive and spacious high-ceilinged rooms. The sitting room near the front desk had plenty of comfortable, old-fashioned chairs placed right near floor plugs where it was easy to plug in our laptop and phone and do some work in relative peace and quiet. The breakfast room next to it had plenty of room for private chats at the well-spaced tables. The cold buffet breakfast ($13.95 per person, including tax and tip) was perfectly adequate but nothing special and not a real value. Although we didn't sample the hot breakfast buffet, it also didn't seem to be anything special. Our room was smallish and not as well-equipped as we might have imagined for a \"business\" hotel room. Reading lights by the bed were fine but lighting in the rest of the room was fairly dim. Although the bed itself seemed fairly new and was nicely modern in style, it also was somewhat lumpy and the pillows were soft, not firm. There was only a small area for hanging clothes near the entry door, but no armoire or closet. Also, the bathroom was on the small side and the toilet didn't always flush properly. One definite caution about this hotel: like many places in New York, garbage pick-up lasts for a good while on the street below -- and in this case, even eight floors above the street, the noise lasted for nearly an hour and kept us wide awake between 3:00 and 4:00 AM. The \"gym\" in the basement was limited, to say the least -- just a treadmill, some medicine balls, a few mats, some candy machines, and that was about it. We were told that the room will be expanded in the near future, but for us, it was a disappointment -- we were expecting a whole lot more. While we could have had a more complete workout at a nearby club, we just didn't feel like going outside the hotel in the cold weather and buying a $15 day pass to use those facilities. Finally, service here was inconsistent. On the plus side, the person who checked us in was friendly and eager to please, but on the down side, the night crew didn't bring us an extra blanket as we'd requested, and when they finally showed up nearly 90 minutes later and banged on our door, we'd already gone to sleep. So, unfortunately, this was not a place that we'd run back to anytime soon; we'd rather stay somewhere else on our next trip and have a more enjoyable visit.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, New York", "Title": "\u201cImpressed\u201d", "Author": "Bigkahuna10", "ReviewID": "UR121744834", "Content": "I read so many bad reviews for this property and I am not sure why.

If you are looking for hotel-style amenities and want people to \"serve\" you and a full concierge, CQ is not for you. What CQ is: a well-maintained building with rooms that are clean, functional and appointed with the basics. This particular room had a queen sized bed, two small nightstands, a small chair, desk/chair, flat screen TV, coffee maker, alarm clock and a small closet which would hold a couple of small suitcases and enough hanging space for coats, etc. Bathroom was clean and big enough -- shower stall (no tub) with plenty of hot water and pressure. They give you a small bottle of shampoo, bars of face/hand soap and lotion. The elevators were always prompt - you need to use your key card to get them to work. The room was quiet but without any view - who cares, though, if you are out and about all day and return after dark. The lobby area is very nice, plenty of chairs to lounge in while you are waiting for others, and a computer area. Also with a small bar with limited operating hours. The front desk staff are pleasant and efficient - greeting you with a smile. They will also store your luggage upon check-out which is helpful if you aren't leaving until later in the day. There is a restaurant downstairs which serves continental breakfast on weekends for $11, but there are enough other places within walking distance to get breakfast. This CQ is close to both the bus and train stations for those who are traveling light. You can easily walk to Times Square and the theater district or subway stops. Lots of shopping on Madison Avenue. There is a 24-hour Duane Reade around the corner, if you forgot something or a Jack's variety/discount store right across the street. The \"Little Italy\" pizza place across the street serves up a pretty decent slice if you want a quick snack.

My only main gripe was that the bathroom door had no locks. It was a sliding door - to save space ofcourse but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have a lock. Other than that everything else was great. It was very quiet in the lobby as well as inside the room (though you can hear the garbage truck come after midnight and might bother you if you are light sleeper - but again, you would expect such things in a big city). But the location of the hotel was just fabulous. Near to Times Sqaure, walking distance to Radio City Music hall, close to 5th avenue etc. We happened to be there during brazil day and the avenue of americas was just wild with a huge crowd partying with road side shops etc. Lots of dining options nearby and quite a few deli shops next to the hotel for that morning coffee and breakfast. The hotel does give free coffee and more importantly free bottled water (which was a precious thing if sightseeing NYC on a warm day like we did during the 2011 Labor day). Overall, I would recommend this place for those who want a nice place close to Times Square (and all the activity) and just come to the room at night to get some rest before heading out again.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cA good deal in a good location\u201d", "Author": "SGECHAMPION", "ReviewID": "UR119875468", "Content": "This was our second time at a Club Quarters (CG) in NYC.

The location can hardly be beat; the hotel is near Grand Central, within two blocks of several subway lines, and a short stroll to Times Square. Our check-in and check-out were super efficient, while the wait for the two elevators was always long. Our room on the 12th floor was small, but more than sufficient for us; who spends a lot of time in a hotel room in NYC when there is so much going on? The bed was comfortable, a bit on the hard side. The bathroom was clean, but we thought the shower pressure was dismal; maybe it was because we were on the 12th of 13 floors. Wireless internet was slow and service sporadic; I wanted to follow a European soccer game online, but gave up after a while. A Starbucks and several delis are nearby, so we opted not to have breakfast at CQ. We checked out the breakfast buffet and felt it was not too \"comprehensive\".

Good: Value and Location. Close to everywhere you want to go to in mid-town and for the price, it is excellent value no doubt. BAD: My PA booked here for 2 weeks due to its location and value. I work for a big organisation and travel for work all the time and I have never encountered a hotel that appears not to care at all about its business client - I am making this statement as thinking about it, if it's not taking care of their business clients, I dread to think how they treat their other clients! 1st Flaw: When I checked in, they said they were overbooked and said if I don't mind going to a small room, which happened to be a tiny box room with no windows. OK - I don't mind this that much to be honest as when I go backpacking I stay at hostels, but I am here for business and you do expect some level of standard. 2nd Flaw: The next day I was given another room as promised, but when I went into the room, there is a note waiting on the table effectively saying \"Welcome, this room may be noisy so here's some complimentary ear plugs to help you sleep\"!. I have NEVER in my 7 years of business travel encountered anything like this. I attach a picture of the note here as I am sure many people would think I am lying or exaggerating. 3rd Flaw: Tried to charge me an extra night without putting it on the Invoice- The next day I asked if I could change rooms as it was noisy and I found it difficult to sleep and they said there was nothing they can do as there's no other rooms available. So I arranged to stay at another hotel and when I spoke to someone on the phone, they confirmed I can check out without being charged. When I checked out they didn't charge me as promised....... Guess what when I checked my credit card the week after? They charged an extra night without even bothering to call or email me or my PA! Lucky that I check my credit card. I find this very sneaky and unprofessional of them. In summary, I would have given them 1 star but for the location and value (it is actually very cheap), but I think if they don't even provide basic common sense level of treatment of service for business travellers, what chance would individual non-business travellers have?", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cSo Glad I Didn't Pay For This Trip Myself\u201d", "Author": "TickyTackyM", "ReviewID": "UR119150934", "Content": "Very small room reeking of cigarettes.

Was really disappointed. Firstly, I should say that my expectations of a hotel when away on business in NYC are relatively basic. I want a hotel in midtown and clean room that I'm happy to be in (or at least not depressed by) with a comfortable bed for a good night's sleep. Pretty much the only other thing I want is breakfast that I can grab fairly quickly on my way to the office. The quality of the rooms here are below par. Furniture is ageing and needs updating, and oddly missing things like a wardrobe - a small open hanging rail in the corner instead, which would be fine in a roadside motel but not my home for a week when away on business. Shower room was tiny, but it was just me in the room so not a big deal. Cleanliness in the room was just okay - surfaces were clean but it needed a deep clean including the corners of the carpet. The shower room could have been cleaner - the shelves hadn't been wiped - but it wasn't so bad. One of the other killers for me was location. Not the general location as it is in a good midtown spot between Times Square and 5th Ave, but the micro-location was the big problem. I had a room at the front and at about 3.30 in the morning a loud refuse truck stops outside to take away the previous day's rubbish from the large hotel next door, whose rear-end is close to the front of this place. The noise is very loud indeed and went on for about half an hour. After this happened for the second night I moved rooms to the back, but be warned that if you do stay here, avoid rooms at the front. I can only really judge other service standards by the food. Firstly breakfast - I ate breakfast for three of my six days here. It was not good - no mean feat when there were only three of us in the dining room. The waiter stayed in the kitchen and didn't come out! I had to poke my head around the door after waiting so long to see if I could get served. This is really not very good when all I wanted was a basic standard of service e.g. get a pot of coffee. At the times he did appear (I can't recall if it was the same person each day or different people) everything was just too slow. The other food experience was room service. Jeesh - do not order food in the evening from the room service menu. My food was really not nice. The experience wasn't helped by it coming with throwaway plastic cutlery, which I guess tells you what you need to know about how seriously they take room service. However, you can (like in many hotels in Manhattan) order delivery from local restaurants so if you want food in your room then do this. The reason I can't really judge other service standards is I didn't get any. I'm not trying to be clever here - the only other times would have been check-in/check-out and the staff on the desk point you to self-service check-in machines to do the job. Great for an airport but for a hotel? Still - I checked in/out okay so I don't really have a beef towards the machine. However, after a long flight a bit of service goes a long way. This does matter when away on business (or it does to me, anyway) as I want a bit of a warm welcome from the place I'm staying when away from home and my family. My overall judgement is that this place needs to do one of two things. Either a full-on facelift to bring it up to standards of at least a reasonably good quality business hotel, which it is falling woefully short of right now. Or, change the branding and 'offer' to a basic place to stay for people on a budget but want to stay in midtown. This is not a hotel catering to the business traveller. I would only recommend it if you're on a budget and can calibrate your expectations down - particularly regarding budget if like some posters on here you can find a really cheap discounted deal on a travel website.

Was it spectacular? No, not even close. But we had proper expectations, and were not disappointed. I see from its web site that Club Quarters talks about \"being a member\" but this was never something that came up for us. We booked through a large travel web site (the one with the gnome) and got the room for $146 per night. For a hotel just two blocks from the heart of Times Square, this is a pretty darn good deal. The hotel is unassuming from the outside, and has a small but attractive lobby. The street it is on is quiet (on 45th between 5 & 6th). We heard no traffic noise from our 9th floor window overlooking 45th st. As I said, a couple of avenues west and we were on Times Square. Two blocks north and we were at the Diamond District and Radio City, St. patricks and 30 Rock were just a block or two north of that. A location just one block or so more west and north would have been $100 a night more. So unless you object to even the most minimal walking, the location is great if you're in town for some theatre. We were also quite close to the NY Public library and Bryant Park. Our room was small...big surprise. In case you weren't aware, hotel rooms in NYC are small. Yes, you can pay some serious money and get more typically sized rooms...but as I said, we had realistic expectations. Our little room contained a queen bed, and extra chair, a small desk, a rod for hanging clothes (no closet) and a small bedroom with a shower but no tub. HOWEVER, the design was very tasteful (especially in the bathroom, nice fixtures and a great frosted glass door) and the room was very clean. We spent a grand total of perhaps 5 waking hours in the room and perhaps 13 sleeping hours...and we really didn't need more from our room than a place for our stuff and a comfortable night's sleep. If you're traveling with a family, no doubt you would have been cramped where we were. But the room, while not exactly spa-style romantic, was actually quite a nice place to return to after a LONG day wandering around the greatest city on Earth! (And the AC, which is provided by a window unit, actually worked well and was quiet!! That might be a first for a window unit in a hotel.) There is a continental breakfast (which is NOT free...what hotels in NYC provide FREE meals???), and a fairly dressy looking restaurant...but we did not avail ourselves and I cannot comment. Cons: the TV in the room is 20 inches and hangs over the desk, a fair distance from the bed, where you are likely to be trying to watch it. Again, for a quick stay, it was fine for having the news on in the background. But if you'd try to watch a whole movie or TV show, it would have felt small. The bathroom works great for ONE person, but is simply too tiny for two people to share a sink or mirror. Front desk service was impersonal, but not annoyingly so. They were responsive, but not exactly overjoyed either. HOWEVER, when we called for our luggage that they'd been holding for us on our last afternoon, it took a full 10 minutes for it to arrive. THAT was annoying, because we needed to get to the airport. They have an ice machine and free bottled water...but ONLY at the basement level, in their tiny workout room.

There is free wifi, chilled bottled water, tea and coffee, which we thought was a bonusd. Easy check in/check out. Reception staff helpful. We asked for two extra pillows and they were brought to the room within 10 mins, which i thought was good.

Free & unlimited bottled water, with a cool dispensing machine. I selected this hotel b/c it had a mini-gym. Which I used the next morning. Thy gym was small but enough for an enjoyable workout, also free water & extra towels. During my stay I requested extra towles, which arrived within that hour. I requested a cot for a friend, which was free. I had asked for a late check-out, which they said would be an extra $35. I thought it was odd for a free cot, and a charged late check out.

Nice soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. Small window with not much of a view. The television was very small and there was no channel guide. Also no pay per view movies. Very strange set up with the television. Never did quite figure it out. Not like any hotel cable television I've ever experienced. Housekeeping was quite good and were the only staff there that I found to be friendly. Virtually ignored by the rest of the staff the entire time. Very strange experience in that regard.

The rooms themselves were fairly clean, however, the maids aren't too thorough, as I found empty bottles under the bed that did not belong to us. The bathrooms looked decent and swept.

For the most part, the staff were friendly, though, we didn't need to call them about anything in particular. I needed some salt at 3:00 AM and a staff member went to get some for me. There was a woman who works at the front desk who kept complaining about this or that every time we saw her. It had nothing to do with us, but I found that this was very unprofessional to be whining all the time in front of guests. The day we checked out, a lady came into the lobby wanting to meet one of the guests of their hotel. She asked if she could please use their phone at the desk to contact her and let her know she was waiting in the lobby. The same whining woman rolled her eyes and gave her an extremely dirty look, and proceeded to walk away from the counter to stand near the steps where we were also standing.

The bathroom, as mentioned, is tiny. There isn't enough shelf/counter space for two women to adequately spread out. Plenty of linens though and we had no problem with hot water. We were less than 10 minutes to the theater and the restaurants where we had made reservations, which was helpful on the terribly rainy nights. You can walk to just about anywhere of interest and subways are nearby as well. The room was average size and clean, except for a stain on one of the comforters. One elevator was out of service, and the tiny (barely holds two people with luggage) second elevator was constantly in use, so we waited a lot to get to the 8th floor. There is free WiFi throughout and free use of the computers in the lounge, with printers for printing your boarding passes, etc. I found the front desk staff to be friendly but didn't really go out of their way for anything. When I had trouble hailing a cab to LGA, they offered their car service for $60 but would not call me a cab. I did finally hail a cab which cost $31 total on a Sunday evening. I'd stay here again only to save money, but wouldn't recommend it at full price to either business or leisure travelers. I've stayed in more agreeable hotels in NYC.

Maybe it's just me or people don't truly understand the purpose of this website which is to share information about your experience and not your expectations. These are my top five things I look for when booking a hotel: 1. Cleanliness 2. Location 3. Cost 4. Service 5. Amenities Starting from the bottom, this hotel is slim on amenities. They have a fitness room with 4 pieces of equipment, but offer you complimentary bottle water. However, I'm not going to NY to work out and I'll get enough of that by walking up and down Broadway and 5th Avenue. There are no doormen, bellhops or a concierge desk, but they will provide you with information and you can do it, find it and get it yourself. Service - Automatic check-in. You don't even need to speak to the staff to get your room keys and check into your room. Yeah, they will hold your luguage after you check out if you have a late flight and they also offer late check-out at a small fee ($35) till 3pm. There is a dining hall that serves breakfast and dinner. Elevators are slow and small. For the health-minded, there is always the stairs. Cost - Very reasonable considering the location and in line with other hotel in its class. Location - 2 blocks from Broadway and 1 block from 5th Avenue and surrounded by plenty of small stores for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a little shopping. Most Important - Very, Very clean. When I opened to door, I was very pleased with the contemporary design and how clean the rooms were. We had a diplomat suite with 4 adults and we had plenty of room to manuver. The rooms came with plasma tvs a small refrigerator (clean) and microwave (didn't use). No Iron or board was provided, but I'm sure if asked they would have provided. Bathrooms were on the small size, but clean and modern. I'm not sure why people are concerned about the size of the bathroom as long it has a toilet, sink and shower, I don't know what else you need. BTW, the doors on the bathroom are sliding doors so you don't have the problem of the door hitting the toilet. With the diplomat suite you get 2 full bathrooms and 2 rooms. If your trip to NY is strictly to sightsee and do some shopping, then the majority of your time not spent inside the room.

This time, we stayed at Club Quarters Midtown as the price was very affordable fo NYC standards and the location is very ideal. We were pleasantly satisfied with the finishings and overall look. Free fresh fruit at the front desk is a nice touch. Our room was small but not Tokyo-uncomfortable. Bathroom was clean. Bed was comfy too. Service is quite hit and miss. Don't expect 3-4 star hotel service. Their staff seem to have been trained only for the business crowd. You will be greeted with \"check-in at the kiosk please.\" Be sure to have your confirmation number or your check-in will not be swift. We did encounter a few really nice staff members, but they seem to be above standards there. I do not recommend the buffet breakfast as it is a sparse selection and pastries do not seem fresh. It's also quite overpriced and in the midtown area there are many many alternatives for a quality bite grab. If you are flying red-eye, note that they have an early-arrival option. This is good, but only if you know about it in advance unlike us. Most hotels allow for red-eye arrivals if you've booked for the preceding night as well. If you were to follow the same method with CQ, their computer system (many things automated at CQ) will consider you as a no-show and give up your room and charge you for one night. As you can expect with overly automated places, the charges from this required a lot of man-hours to resolve. Their management did not return any of my 5 voicemails, all of which were polite in tone (the front desk staff tried to help as much as possible and was understanding). On one attempt to reach management, I actually got her live. Imagine my delight. However, when I explained who I was, she said \"hold on\" and transferred me to her own voicemail! Had to deal with my credit card company instead to finally resolve erroneous charges. Additionally, we think our bose QC2 headphones were taken out of our room. We had left it by the desk in the room, but didn't see it when packing up. Unfortunately, we only realized they were missing when we wanted to use them the next day and had already checked out. The front desk tried to be helpful, and even checked the room even though someone else had already checked in. If you can manage to avoid out-of-the-norm transactions, keep your valuables safe, and not require too much service, I think CQ could be a good experience.

First experience (DC) was great. This one didn't meet expectations. Location was good (except, as others noted, 45th street between 5th and 6th leaves a little something to be desired, re: cleanliness, etc.), internet access in lounge was great, and for the most part, staff were friendly and tried to be helpful. But, there were problems, too. When I entered my room (double bed, room size of single college dorm room), I immediately noticed an odor, musty, but smelled most like urine. However, I realized it was coming mostly from HVAC system, so probably not urine. Anyway, it was unpleasant, so after a few minutes, I called front desk, who said they would send someone up. After an hour, no one came up, and I went downstairs, as I was having difficulty overriding the thermostat (was reading 72, but room was quite cold). They took care of that immediately. I also noted that the bathroom wasn't as clean as it could be (sink had some residue I wiped down myself, for example). My next problem came later that night. When I attempted to fall asleep, I kept being woken up by an occassional chirping noise (outside somewhere). I kept heat on for warmth and to try to drown out the chirping, but in regulating the temp, the automatic HVAC system kept turning itself off and kicking back on - VERY NOISILY. In addition to its kicking on, it regularly produced other loud banging noises. So, throughout the ENTIRE night, every time I was almost asleep, I would get woken up either by a chirping or by the HVAC banging / kicking on. It was AWFUL! Worst night sleep I can remember . When I left in the morning, I noticed that the chirping was actually coming from the open stairwell outside of my room (many rooms are off the stairwell, on multiple floors). I think it must have been a smoke alarm needing a new battery. I notified the front desk of the chirping and noisy HVAC system (and my resulting awful night's sleep) on my way out.

It took me a while to figure out the thermostat -- what looked like one when I entered must not have been, because while it said 72 degrees, I quickly realized I was freezing, and I finally figured out I had to manually work the radiator. When it came to trying to sleep at night, it was a bit of a nightmare -- for one thing, every time the heat came on, it came on with a huge rush of sound, which woke me up every time. Then, every time someone uses the bathroom, the flush is heard throughout the system. Finally, if you are on lower floors (I was on the 4th floor), be ready for the garbage trucks that come at odd hours of the night -- the windows must not be sealed in a way to cut out the sounds.

My training was located on 34th Street & 5th Ave. So the Club Quarter's walk was not too far away from 34th Street. Though in the thick of winter is could be brutal. The locations excellent, near Times Square, walkable to Rockefeller Center. I even walked to Central Park twice. I saw couple of shows during my free time...Chicago and Hot Feet. There are several Duane Reade stores nearby for quick refreshment or personal care items. Plenty of food places too. The rooms very small and simple. The only smaller room I was in was in Tokyo, Japan. And this was bigger but not by much. The room was clean. The bath area was clean but could use some work. The cleaning staff did a very good job. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room or there is more than one person...it's could be cramped. Club Quarters features automatic checkin and checkout using your Credit Card. So there is little interaction with the staff, good thing because some of them were not very helpful and not very friendly. I had to wait a bit for my prearranged towncar driver, he showed up at the wrong place...hmm.... My biggest complaint was my room was near an elevator and it had loudest and most annoying ringing sound whenever it reached a floor. I should have asked to be moved...but it was too tired from walking all over the city after my training class. I actually used some earplugs...so my advice is not be in room near an elevator. I think if you can get a great rate and don't plan to spend much time in your room, don't need a lot of assistance then this place is alright because of the location, but after several more trips to the City, I'd know of other places to stay now.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga Springs, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Tiny Elevators\u201d", "Author": "wrldtrvlng", "ReviewID": "UR5575088", "Content": "My wife and I recently returned from our first anniversary weekend in NYC, where we stayed at Club Quarters Midtown. After reading the mixed bag of reviews for this location, we were somewhat apprehensive. However, we never spend more than sleeping/resting time in any hotel we stay in, and I think that makes a difference. We arrived well before check-in time, and had no problems storing our baggage at the hotel while we wandered around the city all morning/afternoon. When we finally did check in it was a quick, no-nonsense process. We were lucky enough to get a penthouse room with a queen bed, and a nice view of the street below. Our bags were indeed waiting for us in our room as they promised. This is where I will put in the disclaimer about the staff - if you are looking for big bright smiles and people falling over themselves to help you, do not book at this location. They answered our questions, and that was it. We barely even got a smirk. Fortunately, we aren't looking to be pampered - just for a clean, air conditioned room to sleep and shower in, and that is what we got. The room was in great condition, everything was clean, and the A/C worked wonderfully (although it took a little while to cool off when we arrived). The bed was very comfortable, and I loved the flat screen LCD tv that was attached to our wall. They do provide irons/ironing boards and hair dryers. However, they may be located in a closet next to the elevator. I guess this has something to do with the fact that they cater only to employees of member businesses during the week. I will warn you that if you are the least bit claustrophobic in regular sized elevators, you may want to take the stairs at this location. They can really only fit 3 people comfortably, and there is no A/C so it can get very hot coming down from the 12th floor. They also stop erratically. It is very odd. All my wife could think of when she rode it was \"what if it breaks down?\" Overall we had a pleasant stay at this hotel, and would most likely stay here again simply because the location on 45th street is unbeatable. You are three blocks away from all the hustle and bustle of TImes Square, theatres, and the subway - a great place to have home base.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PHILADELPHIA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "FRANKRAFFA", "ReviewID": "UR5557791", "Content": "I was at the hotel as a guest of a NYC company.

That is literally two avenues away from Times Sqaure and three avenues from Grand Central Station. The room was very comfortable. It was very clean and modern. The air-conditioning was superior and the bathroom was very modern and clean. The only problem was that there was no safe in the room and no refrigerator. Ice was available if you traveled down to the basement. No ice machines on each floor as in a typical hotel. The hotel lobby is not flashy. It is very simple, however there is a beautiful lounge/parlor with free internet access (and printing) and a bar and dining room. Weekend services seemed to be curtailed(no coffee in the lobby in the a.m. and no meals on the weekends). I had to go across the street for breakfast. However, there was a buffet(continental) -fruit/juice(but no COFFEE) in the a.m on Saturday morning($8 additional).

The bathroom was fine. Just a big walkin shower, small vanity, and toilet. The shower was a little bit moldy but not terrible. The air conditioner was very loud but I like the sound of a fan to sleep so it was OK for me. If you're a light sleeper you might want earplugs. There was also a bit of noise from the corridor doors closing in the early morning. There was absolutely no view at all. But I just needed the room for a place to sleep and take a shower so it was fine. There are lots of places nearby to get food and Times Square is just a couple of blocks away. The location really is ideal. I don't understand the people who complained about all of the Asian people in the neighborhood. It's NYC, the most polyglot place in the world so of course you will see all sorts of people. I couldn't get the wireless internet to work, but they have two terminals in the lounge that you can use.
