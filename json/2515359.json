I bet they have a running bet as to who gets closer to the time it takes for the haggard guests to call. \"Sorry sir nothing else is available.\" Oh really? You have 100% occupancy tonight? What a way to treat their guests. What really leads me to believe that they are purposely antagonizing their guests for having the nerve to purchase a discounted night in their fine establishment is that the room is large enough for another bed along with the king size bed that is there. There is a spot left barren where a bed could be fitted. Also the room lighting overhead was track lighting with about 12 fixtures at about 50 watts each so if you had the lights on it was like a Hollywood stage. Also if you take the steps down from the second floor you are bound to exit through the back of the kitchen and through the restaurant. Shouldn't exits be more clearly marked?

We thought it offered good value. The Warwick is within a couple blocks walking distance of shopping in downtown Seattle and the rooms were nice and pretty clean (the bathroom tap had obviously been missed in the cleaning by the look of all the water spots). I also noticed the veneer on the bottom of the bathroom door was split and coming away from the wood (it looked like it may have withstood a \"flood\" or two) and the fixtures were a bit outdated but all this is easily forgiven considering the dollars saved bought us a lovely lunch at a nearby Tom Douglas restaurant. One last note, \"valet\" parking was included in our room package but when we arrived (via a circular route because of all the one-way streets) we were told that, no, their \"valet\" parking is where you park the car yourself in a garage around the corner (which we just passed trying to get to the front of the hotel) and then had to drive another 4 blocks around (because of the one way streets) to \"valet\" park our own car. Really? They should state that the cost of parking is included, rather than \"valet\" parking. Lastly, checkout the following morning was a dream. The service we received was excellent.

Since Friday was a holiday, Clipper put on a noon sailing, which turned into a 11:30 sailing and I got to spend more time in Seattle. After a slow, nice, about 30 minute walk from Clipper terminal to the Warwick, I was greeted by two pleasant and professional young ladies at the front desk and was quickly assigned my room and given my pass card. I already knew that I would be on the smoking (9th) floor, (I am a non smoker but spend a lot of time around smokers) as it was the only one left when I booked. The room was quite spacious, and had a lovely view of the Space Needle. There was a slight smoking odor when I opened the door, but that quickly disappeared. The room was very clean, TV was in a nice cabinet, which was very strong as I bumped into it a few times in the dark. A very large comfortable king size bed, which i got lots of sleep on. A very nice writing desk, which I used quite a bit. A small refrigerator, which kept my pop very cold and a nice coffee maker. In the closet was a small safe, an ironing board and iron. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo, with a regular shower head and a wand shower head. The hotel has ice machines on several different floors, soda/snack machines on the B floor. Also on the B floor is the exercise room containing free weights, modern work out machines, (sorry I don't know the names of the machines), 3.6 foot deep pool/hot tube combo, and a sauna, which I all used, and enjoyed. Major transportation stops are within 4 blocks of the hotel. Public transit is second to none in this city, and I sure did not miss my vehicle for getting around. This hotel may be old, but she is solid. I was in the corner room with two streets outside my windows, and when I went to bed, there was very little noise, and I slept like a baby. My room was warm and comfortable. The ladies at the front desk cheerfully programed my wake up calls for both days and they were right on time. The hotel also has a nice restaurant, which I will review in more detail in the restaurant section. There are tons of restaurants within a 15 minute walk, Ralph's grocery/wine store across the street (serves very good chili), an older cinema across the street (which I plan to go to next time).

The rooms are comfortable and well equipped with nice glasses to drink from and plenty of them. I have no complaints about anything having to do with the room. My main complaint is the horrible room service food (not the guy who actually brought it up, he was very nice). We ordered breakfast in our room both mornings (Sunday and Monday) and the food was not only bland, badly cooked, and cold but both mornings they messed up the order. The last morning I ordered one of their special omelets that comes with mushrooms and cheese and my omelet came without the cheese! That's ridiculous! They did offer to make me a new one but as I had to catch a plane I didn't have a time so I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Because there are so many great restaurants in the area I'm sure you can find another place to eat breakfast, but if you're on a schedule and don't have time to spend leisurely finding a good breakfast joint, you're going to have to suffer through the room service.

The bed and room were clean and comfortable, although the sheets were greyed/dingy with age (a shame - how much do sheets cost and how often do they replace them???) Location was great, within walking distance of most attractions, shopping, eating and bars - but can be kind of difficult with people with walking disabilities (I have bad knees and it was rather painful for me, especially with the HILLS - Seattle is VERY HILLY in lots of areas). My husband had no trouble at all walking all over the place (he 'scouted' out the area). The staff was very friendly and helpful, esp. the consigner (sp?). Our room was eye level with the parking garage; we asked to be moved - was granted the request but the room was on a lower level and the noise level would have been terrible at night (the view was much better, though), but we opted for 'quiet' instead of 'view' and stayed where we were. Seattle is a beautiful city, but it's hilly and it's filled with a lot of weirdo's and freaks of all ages, and I'm not just talking about the homeless - which there were plenty of them, also. Occupy Seattle was going on when we were there, and they were all tattooed, pierced, weird dressed, dirty/nasty drudge/dred locked, grungy-looking young people, and we have young adult kids ourselves, in addition to other young people in our city, so we KNOW what 'weird' looks like. As soon as we entered downtown Seattle, we saw an \u2018Occupy Seattle\u2019 person sitting in a pretty, flowered/treed area, smoking a cigarette and holding a handmade sign that read: \u201cKill Wall Street\u201d and had a skull and bones sign drawn on it. Not a very pleasant \u2018welcoming\u2019 to Seattle, I thought. There was also a huge paddy wagon (VERY large van) and tons of policemen at the main gathering site of the protesters, which was downtown in the main shopping district. Seattle IS a nice place, but it\u2019s a shame there are so many weirdos around. Hopefully the protesters will move on by the time future visitors visit this lovely city. This hotel is o.k. if you\u2019re on a budget and have no trouble walking, and IF you get a good rate \u2013 we got it for $99, so we couldn\u2019t pass it up. I didn't rate this hotel very high because there's no reason why hotels have dingy/grey looking sheets - it lowers one's opinions about the place, even if the room itself is very clean.

It\u2019s within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping district and right next door to the Jazz Alley.

The lighting was good and the bed was very comfortable. The marble sink and tub surround are very nice.

The room was acceptable and clean, very much a typical room I would stay in, we weren't here to stay in the room all weekend. Even got a corner room (on 6th floor) that had a view of downtown and of the space needle. Cleaning staff always said \"Hi\" to me when they could have easily ignored me. Even though we could have stayed closer to the more active part of downtown, I didn't want to pay the higher price and had no problem walking the 4 or so blocks to get to some of tourist spots or the public transportation hubs (we did not rent a car). This area of diowntown seemed very quite compared to just a few blocks south, wasn't much activity around or people walking around when we were there, but I always felt safe. I checked out on the morning of the game, but the front desk still allowed me to check in my luggage with them so I didn't have to take it with me to the game. I was vey appreciative of that. Not renting a car probably saved me $200 in car rental and parking fee's, but we did have to walk and take busses/train, which was pretty simple since I had researched it well, but would have been much more difficult if I had not.

We had a beautiful view of the Space Needle, a nice comfy bed, a big & clean bathroom, and everything you could really want for a stay. We had a small couch and we prefer one big chair but it worked-out fine. It was nice and cool out this evening so we opened our balcony and let the breeze blow-in. We took a nap and then walked to Ralph\u2019s \u2013 literally across the street \u2013 and got some deli sandwiches (good) and soda. Ralph\u2019s also sells wine, chips, grocery items, etc but they are quite expensive. We paid $14 for two sandwiches, a yogurt for breakfast the next morning ($3.99 just for that) and a fountain soda. It was worth it for the convenience to the hotel. Ralph\u2019s is open until 2am, btw. We slept well, no noise, despite the area. The ice machine was just one floor down, no problem. There is obvious remodeling going on in the hotel because you could see some of it marked off and smell the new paint but it did nothing to dampen our stay.

That is, we didn't choose the place terribly carefully. My wife needed a certain corporate rate for a business trip, she brought the family, we didn't do as much research as we otherwise might for a business-plus-pleasure-bring-the-family trip. First impressions count for a lot, and the Warwick really bit the big one here. I've never stayed anywhere so militant about its check in time, particularly one so slack as 3:00 p.m. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at 11:30 a.m. or so. No room available. We were told to check back in two hours. We came back at 2:15 or so and had to sit until 3:01 to get our room. The front desk staff were not only unconcerned, but barely masked their mild amusement at our inconvenience. The lobby was full of people in the same situation. The lobby was small and beat up, and managed to look like a refugee camp for much of the time we were there. Slow elevators aggravated the conditions. After the abysmal welcome, the mediocre room was rather refreshing. But the plumbing was poor. The faucets mustered barely a trickle, and the tub drain was slow. The TV was a traditional 4:3 job, placed rather low in a console so you can't see it well in the bed, kind of hidden behind your feet. We were on the 5th floor, facing a bus stop, which was hugely noisy. It was as if the room acoustics were tuned to the bus engines. They start running at about 5 a.m. during the week; mercifully later on the weekend. That said. The location is excellent. Convenient to convention center, Pike Place market, waterfront, Seattle Center, and surrounded by worthy restaurants. The bar in the hotel isn't bad. An upscale market across the street gets you all you need (except fresh bread) at nearly any hour. There's a refridgerator in the room. The Cinerama across the street has a cool retro look to it, and there's a view of the Space needle. The street scene is fun to watch. Beyond the few rotten apples at the front desk, the bell and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Consistent with the late check-in time, the noon check-out time is rather generous. The pool/whirlpool is fine for a quick dip, and the gym looked O.K., too. We got the sense that the Warwick does a high-volume tourist business associated with the cruise ship terminals not far away. I suppose the hotel is appropriate for that market; a place to crash before embarking on a cruise or making an airport connection with perhaps a few hours to see a bit of Seattle's sights. The Warwick is definitely not a business class hotel, but perhaps it's unfair to hold it to that standard. Whatever the application, there are no doubt much better places to stay in Seattle. At the right price (a very low one), I would not discourage someone from staying at the Warwick.

We travelled from Vancouver to Seattle by car with our 7 year old son. WE got room 609 which worried me as it was by the elevators but that was not a problem. We had a room on the 6th floor and although they assured me over the phone (while I reserved,) that it was a NON VIEW room (we paid a very reasonable price and were expecting nothing) we had a view of the Space Needle (wee photo from our room)! While we reserved over the phone they guy on the line said \"You are aware this is a non view room???\" IF that was a non view room, Im impressed! WE loved looking at the space needle at night. Cool! The room was moderately decorated and very clean. Lots of pillows! Carpets looked brand new. Bathroom was standard and had a kick-butt blowdryer for my long hair. A few hotels near the Warwick were double the price per night and I imagine they were top of the line. This place was great for what we needed it for. The beds were a little soft for my back but the place was spotless and comfy. The noise. Ok, so you are in Seattle in the middle of the city. You will hear sirens, trucks etc. Bring earplugs and you will be just fine. If you are not a light sleeper, the noises are not that bad. If you want complete quiet, go camping in a forest. The location was great. We walked everywhere (with our 7 year old)....the space needle, the market, shopping..... and he never complained that it was \"too far\". The location of the Warwick is great. The restaurant in the hotel was pricey but good for breakfast. There is a funky deli/market across the street where were would get drinks and cool pastries from. We enjoyed the pool. Again, the complaints on here are silly. You want an olympic sized pool in the heart of Seattle? The pool was nice and warm and clean and I could stay in the hot tub while my son swam because they were adjacent. It was a nice place to go unwind after a day of sightseeing. IF you need to do some hard core laps then it would be too small but for a soak and a small swim it is great. The gym was small too but it was being used and the people in it were sweating and getting a work out. We didnt like that we had to pay $27 a day for parking. That, in my opinion, made the hotel more expensive than they told us it would be. Wondering if all hotels charge for parking?? Liked the free internet in the lobby computer room to quickly check my emails post of facebook :) I would definatley stay at the Warwick again.

View was just spectacular from the room. However, important to note - the Warwick puts a $50 hold on your card for incidentials. I objected and got locked out of the TV, internet & minibar. Not that I care for the minibar and decided that a netbook was just too heavy to haul around versus a complimentary business center in the hotel to check e-mail, but would have been nice to check KING & KIRO when I got up to see the weather report for Seafair. Did though appreciate the complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee & AC outlet for my camera battery charger. You'll see that in one of the pictures I submitted to this review.

The country breakfast was great value for money and helped me power through a hot and happily loud Seafair Saturday. Oh and a word about Seattle and transportation... I am disabled w/o enough income for taxis to chaffeur me around everywhere without some mass transit help. On that note: I walked about 3 blocks 4th & Pine for a great conduit at the Westlake Sound Transit light rail station to major attractions like King Street Station, the stadiums, SeaTac Airport, the Museum of Flight, & the next Seafair in 2012. You may need a taxi connection from the light rail conduit - I would recommend Yellow Cab of Seattle (Warwick has the #) or if you have street addresses instead of just destinations then Sitia may work out as well as a backup.

My room was very clean, especially the bed and bathroom area. And I am fussy about these things. The hotel is just on the edge of downtown, 3 minutes walk to Macy's, 10 Minutes to Pike St. Market. The \"Downtown Airporter\" express bus service to SEA-TAC Intl. stops at the hotel (on 3rd. Ave.) every 30 Minutes - perfect and at 11$ much cheaper than the cabs at $45.

So, location is not a factor. This weekend we booked at the last minute and couldn't get in at any of our normal hotels, so booked a night at the Warwick because the price appeared right and the reviews were good. I am not picky. I am actually quite content to stay at a decent Motel 6. However, this was one of my worst lodging experiences, and I have done a lot of traveling. Let me preface the review by stating that you can have a worse experience by staying at hotels/motels for half the price. I just expect that an establishment that charges for rooms starting in the mid-100s will have a few things right. OK, here is what I liked: - The location was fine. It was right within a few blocks of pretty much everything downtown. - The ambience was good. It is a nice-looking older hotel. - The room was sized a bit on the smallish side, but more or less as expected. - The price was good (though better value can be had downtown at other hotels). - When I booked online, I was given a dollar amount with tax. This is EXACTLY what appeared on my bill. This is usually not the case. - The deal we got included parking (which can be a big deal in downtown Seattle). That's a good thing because parking there is $27 a day. Here is what I didn't like: - Check-in was rough. I had booked online through Warwick's own website, but it took 15-20 minutes and a phone call to the reservations manager for them to find our reservation. Not a huge deal. I realize these things happen. - Internet access was an additional $11 per day. Frankly, I would have rather them charge $11 more for the room and throw in internet access for free. Paying extra for internet access didn't sit well with me for a hotel of this sort. - The TV had about 8-10 local channels, and that was all. Anything else was extra. I have seen this before, but usually only in a low-end hotel/motel. - They put us on the third floor (very near the street noise), about 15 feet from the elevator, and right next to an adjoining room with a screaming baby. OK, I get that they were near full capacity, but we couldn't have had a much worse room. - I am not a light sleeper, but hardly slept all night from the street noise. The sound insulation of the windows near street-level needs to be upgraded. We found very little sound difference whether the window was opened or closed - and it is a noisy street. - Both of our beds had a strange short fitted sheet that didn't cover the whole bed. This left our feet to rest directly on the mattress. Very odd. - After finally getting to sleep, housekeeping showed up very early and woke us up. - Under the light of day, I found red stains here and there (on the curtain, mattress, etc.) At first, these appeared as blood, but I realized they were ink or paint. Still, not pleasant to find. I have spent about 200 nights in hotels and motels, and can count the experiences I consider negative on one hand. This was one of them. The hotel itself was OK. I think that the experience may largely depend on the room selection. We got a terrible room, but I don't have the impression that all rooms were that bad.

So, it might be better to spend a bit more and get a Space needle view room. Otherwise as you check in you might want to ask for a room on level 7 or above.

No mini-bar but a refrigerator if you want to keep some food in there. Walking distance to pretty much everything unless you are lazy. And if you are lazy, there is always a cab waiting in front of the hotel for a 5 bucks ride to Space Needle. They charge $11 for using the internet (24 hours period).

It cost us approximately $20 for the ticket but I think that could possibly have been a two day pass! Whatever it was it was excellent value as the tour takes you all around Seattle and if you have limited time like we did then it is a good idea to do this! You can also jump off the bus at the designated stops to explore that area further if you wish at no extra cost when getting back on later. Also if you turn right out of the hotel and left onto 4th then right again at Virginia Street and carry on walking it takes you right to the sea front and to Pike Place Market - the walk takes approx 10 - 15 mins but it's really nice - especially if you are fortunate to get hot weather like we did! On our return from sightseeing we took advantage of the free swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil and the facility is really well maintained. There are towels down there and chairs where you can just relax. It was also very secluded so it felt like your own personal space which was fantastic! There was also a gym facility however we didnt use that but from the outside it looked ok. Finally on check-out the receptionist (a different one) was very friendly and helpful making checkout easy. Also the night before I had wanted to send a postcard home however the first receptionist's knowledge of where I could buy a stamp/post my card was very very minimal. Upon checkout the new receptionist was very helpful in advising me they would take care of the postage of my card for the charge of $1 and also offered me some complimentary postcards advertising Seattle and The Warwick with free postage that they would sort out for me... needless to say I took advantage of this and sent quite a few home to various members of my friends and family!! Overall I had a lovely experience and would definitely go back again if I was ever over in Seattle.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville", "Title": "\u201cSpring Break in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Kentuckygirl_7", "ReviewID": "UR33886277", "Content": "We stayed for four nights last April 2009.

It was situated very well between many key attractions (Pikes Market, all upscale shopping and Space needle were both within walking distance). We had a great view of Space Needle from our room and although there was no breakfast at the hotel there was an awesome doughnut place that was fun, unique, reasonable and right by the hotel. There is also a grocery directly across the street. The most unexpected bonus was the Cinerama across the street. It is the only one left in the U.S. and it was such a nice treat for our family. It played first run movies, but we saw Little Shop of Horrors. It is not to be missed and I would recommend it to anyone going to Seattle. We don't see movies on vacation but the experience of this one is not to be missed. The only consideration is the Ladies shelter located a couple blocks away. We were never approached or anything but we did see a few aimless women hanging around the grocery store directly across the street..again, not a problem but should be mentioned.

My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest, noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there, Sept. 12th, the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm, then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise), request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star, nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean, bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican. The bellman - Joe, at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast, it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there, it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials.

The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle. The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling.

He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay! He gave us directions & even advised us on portion sizes. The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful & unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude. We enquired about other breakfast restaurants, whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings. The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups & glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out. We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents. Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant. The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to places, but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey. We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill. When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it.

Looked through the reviews here and prices of places on expedia previous to travelling from Vancouver and this place looked to be the best value, and it was. We got an even better rate with our Automobile Association membership (AAA or CAA). It was $132/night including all taxes - about a $20 saving over their already reasonable rate (IMO). Parking is an additional $27 but they didn't charge us for this. Basically we were looking for an upgrade to a motel and wanted an indoor pool and hot tub, and wanted to be in the heart of the city. This was it, with pros and cons. We could have stayed at a Quality Inn (1/1/2 stars) for $80/night, or The Sheraton (4 stars) for $210/night. Wasn't drawn to either for reasons of amenities and price respectively. Overall, the biggest pro is what you get more than you pay for IMO: Service well beyond a motel; nice indoor pool and hot tub (you'll find few of these in downtown Seattle), work-out room, newspaper at your door in the morning and invoice slipped under your door on the day you check out, friendly staff, easy early check-in upon our request, a very nice bar - we popped in for a martini - and restaurant which looked nicely run with French flair. Bathrooms are granite and quite clean, although a tad worn. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle. One outstanding feature is the proximity to everything, and this is what we wanted. We walked to everywhere over the 2 days we were downtown. EMP - which was outstanding - is within \"Seattle Centre\" as is the Science Centre and the Space Needle. The Science Centre is a must for those with kids; much bigger than Vancouver's Science World with more to do. We also walked to Pike Place Market, and to several restaurants and downtown stores close by. Also, about 3 blocks away from the Warwick is a great jazz bar called \"Tula's\" and the area of town (Belltown) has got great character while still being downtown and extremely convenient. Downtown stores were also an easy walk. We walked to Seattle centre, spent the day, then took the monorail (3 minutes ride) to downtown, then walked back to the hotel. A great day. Cons: Only two, but one worth noting for sure. Our room was on the 6th floor of about 25 floors(?) but much too noisy through the night. Not constant traffic, but intermittent busses made things tough. Our kids had no problem sleeping, but I awoke at 4:30 AM and checked our our window to see if it was open, which it wasn't. Next time, I will request a room much higher up which the check-out clerk said was the way to go. One other con was the beds were too small for me (with my wife). Maybe they were doubles(?); fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. Again, I'll request this next time. Tour tips: Forget the Space Needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. Not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket. EMP- Same price as the Needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. Hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. Fabulous for kids or those who are into this. We thought our kids might get bored. They didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. Can't say enough about it. Science Centre: Again, great value and if you're from Vancouver and have a Science World membership, you get in free. But even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more. Restaurants: Of course lots in the area, and we loved the Thai food places. Parking; Hotel parking is $27/day and is actually a pretty good deal for central downtown. That gets you parking for your stay and until 5 PM the day you check-out. Very convenient and we didn't bother hunting for a cheaper deal - what would we get elsewhere - $20/day - so why bother? Besides, they forgot to charge us for the parking upon check-in - we didn't notice until check-out and they just said \"It's on us\" when we checked out. Very nice. Overall, a very positive experience and we love Seattle. We're happy that we didn't pay the extra for the Sheraton, or go to the Quality Inn for not a lot less. We'd go back to the Warwick with a definite note to advise the staff upon reservation that we are \"sensitive\" to street noise, and to place us accordingly - upper floor - which I'm sure they will do.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "olympia, wa", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a rennovation\u201d", "Author": "elyette", "ReviewID": "UR14083410", "Content": "I am glad I got a discount.

Oh, and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation. The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room, and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single, came back from my conference, and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering.

Based on other reviews, I wasn't sure how the hotel would hold up to our expectations; happily, it did. I gave it a \"5\" because, for the price, there is absolutely nothing more I could have asked for or expected. We arrived in the city by car (crystal clear directions and super easy to get to hotel from I-5 - being a country girl, I'm a little nervous driving my stick shift on Seattle's crowded streets and hills) at 12:30pm. Called the desk from the garage to see if we could check in - No, not yet, but the room would be available at 1:30pm, but we could stay parked in the garage. - Great - At check in a while later the clerk was quick, polite and offered us a map of downtown, some attractions literature and a coupon to Macy's. Another employee walking by, recognized our name (he's the guy I spoke with earlier) and welcomed us and told us he had us in a nice room. Sure enough! when we got to the 14th floor, we had a killer view of the space needle dead in front of us, Lake Washington was off to the right and the Sound off to the left - wow, nice view from our little Juliette balcony! We were in a double/double and if was furnished nicely and clean. And gobs of pillows! - nice touch! After exploring the malls, market and the city, we headed to the pool. While it is true that it is small, I liked that about it - not \"dungeon - y\" at all, like another reviewer mentioned. The hot tub was hot and the pool water warm enough. The next morning the girls wanted to get in another swim and I wanted to get in some cardio. Nicely enough, the exercise room is adjacent to the pool and seperated by an all-glass wall. So I got in my 30 minutes of bike riding, all while being able to keep an eyeball on the girls in the pool - nice! An employee caught the elevator with us on the way out of the pool area in the morning and asked the girls how the pool was, they commented that it was nice and even warmer today than yesterday. The man replied something like - Great, I turned up the heat a bit from yesterday - and off he went into the lobby. It is refreshing to see people care about their jobs. Also, maybe because the hotel is unpretenious and makes you feel welcome, the other guests I spoke with at the pool and weight room were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their stay, as well. At check out, they allowed us to keep the car in the garage until 5pm...another REALLY nice touch! So the Warwick far exceeded my expectations, especially since I booked in at the AAA rate (104) !! Parking was $27 - which is expected for downtown and I got FULL use of it from 12:30 one day to 5pm the next.

I am probably writing this review because I left an item in our hotel room. I was really worried because I didn't know if I'd be able to get it back. (If you must know it's my childhood pillow). At any rate, the hotel contacted my husband to let him know that they had my pillow and wanted to know where to send it.!!! They sent my pillow and I can now rest easy! The beds were comfortable, and we had a pretty decent view of the city. So, I'd say the room was about a 4 out of 5. It's in a really good location, about 3 blocks to Pikes Peak, 4 blocks to the actual waterfront, and 6 blocks from the Space Needle. So you're definitely in walking distance to some major tourist attractions.

(It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk). However, those are the only positives. The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in. As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed. The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot. My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these \"balconies\", which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on , the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew. We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell. Anyway...I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep. Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort. The Warwick charges $23, (I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day. By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more.

Only one problem with the stay. We were on the 8th floor, with a great view of the Space Needle. Late on Saturday night, the entire floor suddenly erupted in one huge party. The noise was incredible, as a large group of young people (not sure if they were high school or college age) were running up and down the hall, in and out of rooms with doors slamming, knocking on doors - including ours - and yelling and throwing things from the balcony to the street below.

I'm not sure what a hotel can do in this situation - maybe some hotel owners or managers could explain what the policy is? One of the problems was apparently that there were several floors where the same thing was happening, and the hotel security was overwhelmed. The front desk clerk told me that as long as the guests were in their rooms, they were 'following hotel noise policy', which doesn't seem reasonable to me, if correct. In this case, it was more than simple rowdiness or high energy. I heard a voice from the next balcony saying 'Hey, don't -- on those people on the street!'! As well, when we finally did get a new room, the route to the elevator was blocked with a mass of people - on the floor, couples making out against the walls, people running up and down the hallways etc. Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts on this? Or, if you're a parent of someone who was on a school trip to Seattle over the Columbus Day weekend, and your child was staying at the Warwick, you might want to ask some pointed questions!

The complimentary shuttle is for a 2 mile radius and is free drop off, no pick up, but they did take us to the Pyramid Brewery one night which is right next to Safeco Field. I'm not sure if that's more than 2 miles away, but for us it definitely wasn't walking distance. That was very convenient. The restaurant I'm sure is overpriced, however, they had happy hour specials that we took advantage of each of the two nights we stayed there. I think it was $3 draft beers (large glasses and lots of variety and loca lmicrobrews), and buy two tapas selections and get the 3rd for free. They also had $1 off all well drinks. The tapas were reasonably priced and pretty filling, i was very surprised. They were also pretty creative, very tasty. The bed was far from luxurious. Actually, i didn't sleep under the covers just because of how the bedding looked. The blanket under the bed spread was ripped and looked as thought it had been there since the hotel was built and the sheets were all wrinkled. Not the best end to a honeymoon and not very romantic. They also did not vacuum the room when housekeeping came (we had to wait outside at 4:30pm for housekeeping to finish, so good thing the bar had those happy hour specials). We're not slobs, but we did leave some crumbs on the dark flooring from some chips that were still there and stepped on when we got back to our room. The only thing I would really want is a microwave in the room, we only had a small refrigerator.

Well, that was false. In order to see the needle, you had to stand in the corner and look at it or open the slider to see it. It was ok though. We read some reviews about the pool being kind of dingy and dark, but nice once you were in the water. So we tried it out. It is in the basement, but the elevator takes you right there. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench of chlorine. It smelled so bad. We decided to muddle through and went in the pool. The temp was nice, but we then opted for the spa.

I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient. The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few problems worth mentioning. We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony. My husband smokes, but I do not, and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room. If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human. We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony, especially with the balcony door closed. Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor. This floor is where the public meeting rooms and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located. We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view. We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor. No Space Needle, no view. This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms. The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era \"cans\" (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed. It felt like starring in your very own \"intimate film\". The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed. The traffic noise was incredibly loud, and hotel construction noise started very early. Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day. We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated. The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up, and we had a nice Space Needle view. The bed was comfortable, the amenities average. We liked the in-room refrigerator. There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel. Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend, but I would take care if staying during the week. Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet). I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay. We did not use the pool or jacuzzi. As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort. However, we liked the bar quite a bit. Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere. We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience. There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle, but the food was OK and we had a nice time. The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations. The lobby fireplace added a cheerful, cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing. I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle.

I had made our reservations well in advance in order to secure a special group rate for our company's partygoers. The reservations agent that I spoke with was pleasant, thorough, and helpful - he made sure that I understood what I would need to know about my reservation. Our first discrepancy occurred upon arrival. I had researched, at the Warwick's own website, the cost of overnight parking - it stated that it was $21.00 effective March 1, 2005. When we arrived, however, the parking attendant informed us that it was $18.00 and that we could add it to our bill. Upon check-in, this information changed again and we were instead informed that parking was indeed $21.00. Honestly, I believe that both amounts are ridiculously overpriced, especially considering that other hotel guests paid much more for their reservations and still had to pay this outrageous parking fee. Regardless, I disregarded the discrepancy and signed my bill. I wasn't going to cause a stink over $3.00. The bill was the second discrepancy of the afternoon - our company was given a group rate of $79.00 per night, however, my check-in information stated that it was $75.00. I shrugged this off as well, figuring that it made up for the miscommunication with regards to the cost of parking. The room itself was lovely. We were pleased with its setup and cleanliness and I really admired the furniture. While a fan in the bathroom would have been nice, it was easily overlooked once we opened the curtains and looked out onto the city - what a great view! Upon check-out the next morning, we again met with inconsistencies. Our bill was slid under the door of our room prior to our departure, so I reviewed it for accuracy. Suddenly the room rate was $79.00 again! While this was the rate that I had expected to pay, I was a little annoyed with the constant miscommunication. Not only that, but there were others from my company staying at the Warwick also - they had also mentioned checking in at a rate of $75.00. When my husband and I arrived at the front desk to check out (for some reason, video checkout would not work for our room), I mentioned these discrepancies to the front desk clerk. I made it clear, or so I thought, that I wasn't worried about the small amount of money that these miscommunications involved ($7.00, all told), but that I wanted someone to know what had happened. I wasn't even able to get out that I knew others that had been advised $75.00 at check-in that may be, well, more vocal than I was being. The desk clerk seemed clearly put out by this information and gave me short, quick answers to my questions. He informed me that the garage attendents were still having trouble remembering that their rate had changed and that the company party rate was $79.00. I explained to him again that I was okay with paying $79.00, but wanted him to realize that the paperwork provided at check-in stated $75.00. Honestly, he huffed and puffed and then took $4.00 off my bill. Really? I didn't care about the money. I just wanted him, or anyone, to know that people were being misinformed. My husband, who is quick to tell me when I'm getting overbearing and pushy (aren't all husbands good for that?), agreed that I had not done anything of the sort when speaking with the desk clerk.

We had traveled by Amtrak from Sacramento and then took the Clipper to Victoria for a couple of days. It was a magical vacation...all public transportation and walking to our destinations. Our room had one whole wall of windows that faced the Space Needle. (There was a sliding door that opened onto the balcony...weird) The room was small, but so cozy. The staff was wonderful. They have 24 hour shuttle service and we enjoyed talking with the drivers. We had dinner one night and it was great, the waitress had a strong French accent (something we don't hear often in CA) Beautiful food presentation, We easily walked to the Market. The Mall was great, with Monorail stop so convenient. Street entertainers were wonderful,and we were delighted to find real stores open on Sunday. We bought bento (box) lunches at the sandwich shop near the hotel and took them on the train, It was the best vacation ever..so glad that my daughter told us to stay at the Warwick. later I remembered that I had stayed at a Warwick hotel in Denver and enjoyed that too.", "Date": "February 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201cWill be back.....\u201d", "Author": "Arewethereyet???", "ReviewID": "UR3100658", "Content": "Stayed the weekend of January 28th at the Warwick Hotel.Booked the day before and was told all I could get was a smoking King size on the city side.I told them that my preference would be a king size non-smoking on the Space Needle side away from the elevators as I had read here.When we arrived we discovered that our room was as requested.We were greeted by the concierge who was very helpful.The room was average size and the bed was comfortable.The wife loved the tub and the marble tiles in the bathroom.The room was very clean.We had a package that they advertised on their website which was $150 per night tax included , parking, and breakfast in the restaurant (which was very good).All hotels in Seattle charge anywhere from 15-25 dollars a night for parking.The location is great we walked to the Pike Place Market ,the Harbour front,the convention centre area at night for dinner.There were lots of people walking about and we had no safety concerns.Ralph's grocery market /Deli is next door and open till 2AM for food or snacks.", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location, Nice View\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2977202", "Content": "The room was nice, Location was good, View was wonderful....

We found the hotel no problem, the location is great and although the hotel looks somewhat shabby from the outside it's really quite elegant inside. What made our stay here particularly nice was the fact that we were given a room with a view of the space needle. The floor-to-ceiling window opened fully and we were able to enjoy the view with the sea air too! At night the view was spectacular. Staff were friendly and helpful, the cocktail bar is great and we enjoyed our stay here. Two quibbles: 1. The price - this is not a cheap hotel and with state tax and room occupancy tax it was one of the more pricey hotels we stayed at. If you're not on a budget it's worth it. 2. The lobby area is small and at the weekend was extremely busy with lots of people standing around seemingly at a loss.", "Date": "December 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201ccould have been better.....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2818540", "Content": "Well for those who read trip advisor reviews, I hope you will pay close attention to this one. We stayed recently at the Warwick Seattle, for a few nights before continuing our Pacific Northwest journey to British Columbia. We booked through Clipper Vacations, the price was right, and we were told we would really like this hotel. From the moment we walked in there was a definite charm to it; cozy older lobby with a fireplace, 4 clocks from different major cities (I like this feature) and a concierge desk. At the front desk we were greated by a very cold and young front desk agent . No formal greeting no nothing, but a straight and matronly face (we were surprised as she must have been under 20). We asked her not to put us near the elevator in a room number ending in a 6. (We read this on trip advisor). She put us in roon number ending in 8. We went up to the room and this room was right next to the elevator. I immediately marched back down, and asked her to switch the room. (she did without any apology) She moved us 4 doors down. We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room, and we tried to adjust the heat, it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes, and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor, so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room , they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white, reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim, I guess to save money. The hotel is not in the greatest area and beware of seedy people around there. Brasserie Margaux was terrific and the grocery street across the street (ralph's) is great. I do not think I would stay at the Warwick again.", "Date": "November 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent stay !!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2771689", "Content": "We stayed here 27th Sep-30th Sep and had a fantastic stay.
