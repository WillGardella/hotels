It was a different experience staying in a condo instead of a hotel. We slept with the windows open; enjoyed the balcony...not being cooped up inside all the time. The 24 hr pools and hot tubs are a big plus. The grounds were immaculate. The staff was incredible! The shuttles to and from the strip were great...even tho since Holiday Inn took over the property they have cut some of the shuttles. There is NO shuttle to the grocery store now...a big disappointment to us. What you can buy onsite is limited and pricey. The food at the bar and grill was excellent...and suppertime hours there would be even better as they close at 5p.m. We wish they had 3 bedroom units...or at least a 2 bedroom with 2 queen beds in one of the bedrooms instead of a king.

We did use these to come back in the evenings. only downer on these are most shuttles finish at about 11.30 for some may be a bit early but taxi from strip only cost's approx $6 so thats easily an affordable option.

We had a two bedroom/two bath with sleeper sofa for myself, husband, and best friend and then a one bedroom/one bath for my mother and her friend. Because we are timeshare owners and we like to experience the amenties of each resort under our parent company, we did take advantage of everything that Desert Club had to offer. Location - Sits right behind Imperial Palace and allows you to walk through the garage/back entrances of any of the casinos sitting next to Imperial. Like others have said, Vegas blocks are long and personally I don't like to walk but this was really close to me. Did I walk it? No, because of issues with my foot. So if you don't walk it and don't catch a shuttle it is a $5 to have them drop you off in the middle of Imperial Casino. Shuttles - The best service that Desert Club could ever offer! Having that shuttle schedule was awesome and soooo convenient! All of my family could go and come as they pleased and we knew what time to expect them back depending on how long they said they were going to stay. It really made me feel better (security wise) knowing that they were going straight from the resort to the casinos. My Best Friend rarely ventures out without me when we are out of town but she fest secure enough to catch these on her own. For the grocery store run/Freemont Experience etc. these spots fill up VERY FAST. Basically they told us that we shouldve signed up when we checked in! Why they wouldn't take another shuttle is beyond me..I know enough people wouldve signed up for two shuttles. We lucked out and got a spot on the grocery run but Freemont ended up costing us $20 going AND coming back. One hour is the grocery store limit and it just didnt seem like enough. Be wise and split your list amongst whoever you take with you AND DO take someone. The store that they take you too if wayyyy cheaper than going to Albertson's on your own (its closer but not cheaper). Pool/Grounds/In House Store/Restaurant - The pool was awesome. It looked so inviting that we got in a few times during the day when the sun was out (it was very cold in November but not so bad). The grounds are well kept and I always saw the staff hard at work. The in-house store is very expensive so you have to weigh your needs and wants or manage without something until making it onto the strip or the weekly grocery trip. Their new restaurant was pretty good...we tried the pizzas, sweets, frito pie, and nachos from there and all of them were good. Pizza was hit and miss...first try was good...second time was alright but not as good as the first. The Room/Customer Service - The rooms were awesome. As far as the design that everyone else describes...just about ALL of the resorts that we have been to have that huge tub and sink in the main room. If you tell the resort ahead of time that you need a lower floor they can accomodate you...we didn't and they still helped us out by putting us on the 2nd floor and also they put both of my rooms up front near the main entrance. We didnt find it at all noisy as our view was right in the middle of the street that leads into Imperial. The kitchen was really handy as we cooked our WHOLE Thanksgiving meal in there and all ate together. I do with that there was also a DVD player for the bedrooms as they only have a few good channels. Maid service came during the middle of the week and I don't know about anyone else's service, but she would not enter/clean the room until we got there and we got in really late that week. Don't know if this is policy or not, but it could be another benefit security wise..that in room safe can only protect so much. Front office staff was very helpful and we called more than a few times.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorba Linda, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cNice ladies weekend away!\u201d", "Author": "Jaime P", "ReviewID": "UR125623841", "Content": "Four ladies stayed in a 2 bedroom at the Desert Club to celebrate my Mom's Birthday.

Let's get one thing out-of-the-way first. Yes, this is a timeshare. If you come here and accept discounts or other free products, you may be subjected to an annoying and potentially pressure packed timeshare presentation. If that's not for you, then don't accept the perk. But I have little empathy for people that accept the perk and then complain about the presentation after-the-fact. The location of this condo is pretty good. While it is located just one block off the strip, blocks in Vegas are huge. It is behind Imperial Palace but will take approximately 15 minutes to walk to the strip. Because of the bend in the strip near this location if you are attending a conference at the Sands convention Center then this is a really nice location. You can walk to the Sands convention Center in a little over 10 minutes. The grounds are very nice and maintained well. You walk around on the interior of the complex which consists of multiple buildings that are three stories in height. The grass and shrubs are well-maintained and we found the paths to be well lit. There are nicely done pools as well as areas to grill. Our unit had an exterior patio with tables and chairs as well. Parking seemed abundant though it did appear that the resort was lightly I can pied when we were here. Every parking space is covered with an overhead sun shield structure which was a nice touch to keep the hot desert sun off the interior of your cars during the summer months. The complex is surrounded by fencing with only one way in and out and that path has 24-hour guard service. There is free Wi-Fi on the complex and we found the signal inside our unit to be very strong and very fast. We did not use a lot of the resort amenities or any of the activities so we can't comment on those. Now onto the unit itself. We found the unit to be well-equipped, in good working condition, and very nicely furnished. You walk immediately into a small living room that has a sofa and a single chair. There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall above a gas fireplace. In the same area, there is a small four-person kitchen table with a few extra chairs as well as two barstools at an L-shaped kitchen bar that also serves as part of the kitchen countertops. There are two bedrooms, both of which also have large flatscreen TVs mounted to the wall as well as large walk-in closets for both. This was a nice feature to keep all of your luggage completely out-of-the-way and to hang up all of your clothes. Our only disappointment was that the second bedroom had a single queen size bed in it instead of two separate twin beds as is common at many timeshares. This means that a family with two kids will either have to try to get the two kids to sleep in the same bed or put one on the sleeper sofa in the living room. The master bathroom is not separated from the master bedroom it is part of the same large room except for the toilet which is in a separate small space behind door. The master bath tub is massive. It is literally approximately 7' x 4' in size and you step into the tub to take a shower from the single showerhead. If you and your partner in the master bedroom happen to have different schedules then the lights from the bathroom sink will shine directly on the bed where the other partner is attempting to sleep. The bathtub is completely impractical after you get over your initial wow moment of seeing the size of it. The problem is that the water heater is not even close to being adequately sized to fill the tub. After a long day on the strip we thought it would be great to relax in the tub. After sitting in it and turning on the hot water we could get water only to the height of about halfway up our leg before we ran out of hot water. This is a completely ridiculous design. The second bath has a shower only, no tub. All things considered, we enjoyed out stay here and would return.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cNice updated condos.\u201d", "Author": "kellykk", "ReviewID": "UR124907792", "Content": "We had used RCI to exchange in for a 2 bedroom condo for a one week stay in August of 2010.

We love the fact that this resort keeps all five of its outdoor pools heated through the winter months and that they are open 24 hours. The grounds are beautifully maintained with pleasant staff offering their pleasant wishes for the day. They will also offer you a ride to the front entrance on one of their golf carts if you're staying in one of the buildings at the back of the resort. Staying at this resort is very convenient if you want the action of the strip, but want to stay away from the smoke and noise of the casinos as it's only a 10 minute walk which puts you right in the middle of the strip. They now offer quite a few shuttles that run throughout the day from the front entrance that will take you to different casinos if you don't feel like walking or if you don't have a vehicle of your own. We were put into a nicely renovated room which boasted new furniture and appliances. The king size bed is incredibly comfortable which has a flat screen t.v. on the wall at the foot of the bed. The bathroom is off of the bedroom and it has the absolute largest Roman bathtub that we have ever seen. The housekeepers came in every day and brought fresh towels and replenished the supplies. We only had two complaints about our unit. The first one being that the carpets were filthy dirty. You would think with a newly renovated unit that the least they could do about the carpets is to shampoo them. You couldn't see that they were dirty because of the colour, but our white socks and the bottom of our feet were black not too long after walking around on them. I guess that's why they supply slippers to use while you're there. Our second complaint is that the hide-a-bed was a very poor quality although it was new. Our two girls slept on this and you didn't even have to lay on it to feel the srpings coming through the thin mattress. So we folded our thick bedspread off of our king bed into four and put that under the mattress pad. This did help, but in the future I would get a room with a second bed in it instead. I would not recommend anyone having to sleep on this poor quality mattress. I can't imagine adults sharing a room and two of them having to sleep on the hide-a-bed. I'm sure that they wouldn't get any rest at all. All in all we definitly recommend staying at the Desert Club and we will stay there time and time again as long as they offer the same great rate.

Anxiety dissipated as we opened the door to find a small but perfect one-bedroom apartment immaculately maintained and beautifully furnished. The living room had a huge sofa, a big flat screen TV and a fire place(!). The kitchen was a full one and ready to use, although we attempted little cooking at \"home.\" The bedroom had a flat screen TV and a very comfortable king bed. The bathroom was luxuriously outfitted. We had a small balcony (not much view -- overlooking parking), with (surprise) an adjacent washer/dryer room and even complimentary detergent. The grounds were very well-maintained, although we had little spare time to utilize the pools or other amenities. The complex is one mega-bloc from the Strip, which we walked a couple of times...it is not a scenic hike past parking lots, building sites and the backside of Strip hotels...and late at night we took taxis.

The furniture was green vinyl with huge rips in the upholstery. The cabinetry was 1970ish laminate with rose colored, tired Formica countertops. The carpet was dirty in appearance and shabby. The mattresses hadn't been replaced in a LONG while. For 4 nights, I slept at a 22 degree slant, rolling to the middle of the bed. One of the towels I used had (what appeared to be) dirty footprints. The gas pilot light in the fireplace was on all the time and REALLY noisy. The Contact paper in the cupboards was all peeling. I could go on. You get the picture. Sure, the location is nice.

Although very old but working and it was really nice to have this stuff in the middle of a long trip thru US. Rooms were very quite is aircon is turned off and acceptable if it is on. So I would say It was pretty comfortable for us. On the second day I found a source of a very strange annoying sound - they forgot to replace battery in the smoke detector. It happens. Anyway, for the money we paid - I would say rooms were very good. Shabby but good. As for location - it is very close to the Strip - like 10 minutes walk. Or they offer shuttle service to three main points of the Strip. Or you can take a cab for $5-10. Just be aware it may take an hour before you order a car and it arrives. If you're going somewhere to the far ends of the strip (to the Stratosphere for example) - it is better to take monorail as station locatied just in 7 minutes walk towards the Strip. Hotel offers no breakfast and has sole fast-food-style-restaurant on it's property. Actually it is not bad, pool-side etc. But I would recommed to eat somewhere else if you have time. The worst thing was front desk service. Normally I don't need anything from front desk but map. This time I decided to try to save some time and asked few very simple things like \"how much monorail costs and what time it closes\", \"what time Stratosphere closes\", \"can you recommend me a place to start exploring the city with\" etc. They've failed them all. The answer was like \"you can find the map in that brochure... it is all there\". I failed to order a taxi by phone from my room - \"you have to go to the front entrance and ask bellboy to call it for you\". I did. \"taxi will be in 20 minutes\". Came in 45. \"we are not very busy hotel and taxies sometimes ignore us\". Checking out took us an hour. Reception \"specialist\" had no skills to operate simple calculator (no kidding) so she had to ask senior specialist to explain why bills look that strange. Turned out they charged first night for both rooms to one credit card and then charged second card in full for three nights+some security payment and first card for three nights too.

We visit the property twice a year for a few days at a time. We have watched it grow from renovated apartments behind the Flamingo Casino into the jewel that it has become. Not a diamond mind you, but a beautiful jewel just the same. About a block and a half away from the Las Vegas \"strip\" Desert Club is close enough to the action to be able to get there by walking if desired, but far away enough to feel as though you are in some oasis in the desert. It boasts several pools (all with a different theme), activities for kids and adults alike (bingo for prizes and other games for the children), a gym with a treadmill, elliptical machine, stationary bike and a few essential weight machines, and a dry sauna in the men's and women's bathrooms of the fitness area (it would have been better to have one big co-ed sauna....it was weird when my fiance and I each went alone into a sauna). The rooms are really what is the best part of the entire club. This is what I look forward to after my long drive from Phoenix or from Lake Tahoe. It is spacious to say the least. I have never been dissapointed with any of the rooms of the current resort. Every one is very good. This last time we stayed in a room that had less than desirable views (parking lot), but we really did not care. The view inside was just fine for us. Each room (and I mean EACH ROOM: every bedroom in the unit and the living room) has a large TV. We have been lucky enough to have had flat screens every time we visited in the last few years, but I know that this is not the case for every unit...you might get a large tube tv inside of a wooden console with fake ivy on top. There is a full kitchen in every unit which I use every morning to fix breakfast. Speaking of food, there is now a little market on site where you can buy a few groceries for a very high premium markup. You can also go to the major grocery store in their shuttle...but you have to \"sign up\" for that and it is only one day a week. So if you have no car and you are not there during the shuttle day, then you just have to figure it out for yourself. That was a big thumbs down for us. Also, the on-site market really needs to learn how to stock smaller items for visitors...why would someone buy a full-size bottle of olive oil for a week or less? And what is the deal with the coffee for sale when you can brew the free coffee in the room? This should be a free offering in the lobby!!! Along with water and other refreshments for weary travelers waiting in line (take note Desert Club!!). All that aside, I do love the bedrooms. There were little details and needs that I really like: walk-in closet in the master (big enough for my fiance and me to put our clothes and shoes!) \"black-out\" curtains on the windows for times when you just want to sleep-in, a HUGE bathtub in the master, hairdryer, a LOT of space for things in the bathroom, extra towels galore, a big, very comfy bed, a full washer and dryer in a separate little room complete with ironing board, iron, a little bit of detergent and a small organizing area (nice! Came in very handy), and every appliance you could need (and if they don't have it, I bet they could find it for you!) OK..so here is the real downside and why I have given this resort 4 stars and not five.... THE SHUTTLES: In short, the shuttle situation is pretty bad. They give you a little sheet with all the drop-off and pick up times at the casinos they go to. And if you are one minute late, they are gone and you have to wait 2 or more hours for the next one. I have seen only 3 shuttles in operation for the resort and TWO of those are employed to shuttle people around the resort only! So that means there is ONE shuttle operating to shuttle people to the casinos. I remember the days when the shuttles for this resort were much more prolific in their offerings. Gone are those days....and don't even get me started on the grocery shuttle...We were once left stranded at the resort by a shuttle because it had filled up and had a taxi called. My iPhone was stollen from that taxi soon after we were dropped off and it most likely would not have happened had I left the phone in the shuttle. Plus, the taxi ride from the resort to Mandalay Bay where our convention was cost us $18!! Besides the abismal shuttle situation, I do love this resort and I enjoy returning time and time again!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location, service is not a priority\u201d", "Author": "Justsayin2010", "ReviewID": "UR119719636", "Content": "We traded our time share to stay at Summer Bay.

Just look west from the Desert Club and the Imperial Palace, Bellagio, and the Venetian are pleasant sights to look at (without the grimy cigarette smoke). As a matter of fact, it was easier to access these resorts by driving the back way in rather from Las Vegas Blvd. Check-in was a breeze. Friendly staff greet you at the entrance and guide you through the locations of the FIVE pools within the resort. Each pool has a theme to them and are small enough to keep a watchful eye on your children (if you happen to bring them). Three of the pool locations have propane gas barbeques. You are probably thinking the bbq grills are nasty with burnt on left-over from somebody else's party. You would be wrong (I know because I checked with a fine tooth comb). The grills were extremely clean as well as the utensils they keep below the grills. The depth of the pools are from three to six feet so families with small children will find the pools an enjoyable luxury. The pools are also open 24 hours!!! The main pool (just behind the lobby) also has a small restaurant serving sandwiches, pizza, salads, burgers, and drinks from 7am to 10pm (11pm on the weekends). Good food and reasonable prices too. Now the room...once again we were very pleasantly surprised!!! The Desert Club may have once been (or still is) a timeshare property. Because of the economic downturn, I think the rooms are now rented on a daily basis. The one bedroom suite had a Full Kitchen with all necessary utensils and plates (full size refrigerator too), the living room was cozy with a fireplace and large flat screen TV, a balcony that has a separate room containing the ironing board and washer/dryer (no coins necessary), a european-sized bedroom with a comfortable queen bed and large screen TV, a HUGE bath/shower that could probably fit a family of four comfortably, and a walk-in closet with a wall mounted safe. The living room also contains a DVD player and AM/FM/CD/MP3 player. Planning a trip to Las Vegas for a week or longer and have small children??? The Summer Bay Desert Club Resort is a location you should definitely look in to. Don't think you will find a resort on the strip that contains a full kitchen in their rooms like the Desert Club. You can forego eating out at expensive restaurants by cooking healthy meals for the family right from your room. Save the money for other necessities like gambling to supplement you child(ren)'s college fund(s)!!! Skip walking through other resorts' casinos and coming out smelling like an ashtray. No slot machines or craps tables here. As mentioned earlier, the Desert Club is just east of the Strip but close enough to see all of the large resorts on Las Vegas Boulevard. However, the area is much quieter and gives you the chance to relax (your true reason to visit Las Vegas, right?) I would definitely recommend the Summer Bay Desert Club Resort.

Mind you, they're not horrible, but not luxury by any means. See my pictures. And for the price you pay to be so close to the strip, can you really complain? If you think you might luck into one of the nice owner's units with the flat screen TVs and granite countertops, you won't, so get your expectations straight. We had to be moved from the first one they put us in because it smelled so bad. The second one was much better, clean, but really worn out. If you want a nicer unit, find an owner who is renting and get it from them, if you don't mind what you see in my pictures, go ahead and rent from their website. It's a lot easier and honestly, once we got used to the idea that we weren't getting the upgraded units we saw online, we were fine with ours.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cReunion Trip with old friends\u201d", "Author": "5_Star_Linda", "ReviewID": "UR118274516", "Content": "Great location, walking distance to the strip via the Imperial Palace seemed very close.

The stay got off to a very bumpy start when I found out that (a) the wireless internet, which I desperately needed for my trip, was supposedly not working, and (b) the destinations on the shuttle schedule posted on Summer Bay's website had changed and shuttle frequency had been cut in half. But as it turned out, the wireless internet worked fine for my entire stay, even though I was told at the front desk that I probably wouldn't be able to access it and that I should use the wireless at the Westin a couple blocks away. The changes to the shuttle schedule (which still haven't been reflected in the schedule shown on the resort's website as of this writing) were still a pain--I hadn't rented a car because I thought I could rely on the shuttle to take me right to my conference hotel--but I did alright with some cabs and a few scorching one-block walks. I got over my frustration with the front desk very quickly once I saw the room itself. I got one of the \"rental units,\" which are not as nice as the timeshare \"owner's units,\" though I believe they have the same floorplan. They certainly have the same gigantic bathtubs, a nice and surprising amenity. The room was a bit worn (as I understood the rental units to be), but it was clean, and you can't argue with the room's size or amenities. A room like this would go for hundreds of dollars if it were one block to the west. A good size bed, full kitchen, patio, two TVs, DVD player, walk-in closet, etc. I bought groceries before I came (though they have a weekend shuttle to another grocery store) and saved a ton by using the room's kitchen. I even did laundry with the washer and dryer connected to my room through the patio. In a city where you can hardly take a breath without paying a fee, the amenities in my room felt like a secret weapon. Construction appears to be finished here. The pool at the front of the resort had just opened, and though it's not Mandalay Bay, it's a nice feature to have. It's also one of five pools at the resort, so you never have to go far to take a dip. The small grocery store next to the pool was complete but not yet open when I stayed there. Though I didn't use the shuttles as I had intended, I still took advantage of them when coming back to the resort at night. I don't think I would recommend staying here for business if you need to get work done during your stay. Others had expressed that the WiFi is spotty, though I didn't have this problem. The resort's business center is small -- it's made up of two computers and an older printer that's functional but not suitable for high-quality printing (I went to a Kinko's that's not too far from the resort). But for the other 95% of people going to Las Vegas, this is a very solid place to stay. The resort is a terrific budget option for couples or families that would like to be near the Strip but not right on it. You can be pretty self-sufficient here, a rarity in this town. Even though it's a block away from the Strip, the resort was an oasis of quiet.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay!!\u201d", "Author": "BudgetGirl101", "ReviewID": "UR118014737", "Content": "We just got back from a 8 day vacation in Vegas.

We stayed the first two nights in a 2 bedroom first floor condo that was very nice. We then had more guests coming so we moved to a one bedroom (that had been remodled and was a great price) first floor. This was basically the same just smaller but the one plus was that there was a HUGE 2 person soaking tub in the bathroom. No jets but Super nice and was very relaxing. We then moved back into the 2 bedroom to finish off the vaca. The pools are nice because they never were really crowded and we used the BBQs 2 times.

I booked this months ago through Touchdown Interline agents as I work for an airline. We arrived a day late as our flight was full so we had to come via LAX the next day. By the time we drove there after a slight detour to Hollywood to see the sign, it was around 19:30 and we were tired as we had been up at 6am UK time and it was now 03:30am the next day in UK. We just wanted to get in and sleep. Unfortunately reception was manned by what appeared to be 3 trainees and a couple of regular staff. We got the trainee. He seemed to think we had only booked 1 week but we had booked 2. Once he established that it had come through as 2 seperate weeks via RCI he assured us we would not need to change rooms and that the booking was continuous. He asked us if we prefered ground or top floor. We asked for a quiet room on the top floor. We ended in 8-306 which although it had a view of the car park vs the pool was quiet The appartment was fully equiped with most things you would need. However the only thing you get for the oven, is a cookie tray. I would advise anyone who normally uses an oven for things like oven chips, potato wedges, chicken kiev to bring a high sided metal tray with them as there is nothing suitable for cooking in the oven. Otherwise fat spills onto the oven base which then burns and fills the whole room with smoke Also bring a decent scouring pad. The pans are alluminium and if you try and brown any meat in them it sticks to the pan. They provide a flimsy plastic scouring pad that wont get any stains off. There were plenty of sunbeds but none of them have shade. However there are two or three tables per pool with 4 chairs and they have a shade. The pool never got so busy we could not find a bed. We did get the odd rowdy lot who decided to bring their own massive speaker and laptop to entertain us all with music in the 2nd week. We swithced pools (as there are 5) The pool areas very kept clean and there were plenty of towels. The pool by the clubhouse is missing quite a few tiles, but perhaps they are waiting for low season to drain the pool and repair it. Our daughter used the kids club for a couple of days and really enjoyed it, making a few projects like a piggy bank and oven mit. Apparantly Lauren & Eddie were fab !!! There was a free shuttle to Von's but they have a wierd rule they don't tell you about on their website that only two people per room can go due to space. There was no way we were leaving our young daughter alone, so luckily we got permission to have 3 people that day,although it was a battle as the concierge girl did not want to know and we had to get the bell boy to sort it (which he did via radio) When we got the bus there were too many people and the driver had to ask people to get off. One lady said she had been trying to get on for 3 days as it was full. Can't comment on that, but you would think they could run a couple of busses if it gets that busy. We were not too impressed by the driver. He was young, dark hair and I think he thought he was cool blasting out the radio and having a party. On the way back he made a great show of fanning out $1 & $5 bills in the ashtray. He then pumped up the music and set off. A few yards into the journey there was shouting from the back, we could not here due to the loud music, but after more yelling it turned out the back door was open. He had to stop the bus in the middle of the road, get out and go and close it. The drivers dropped you outside your block and we tipped him. The hotel also does shuttles to New York, Ballys, Venetian and the Freemont Experience. We only used the New York & Venetian. But we had the same guy a couple more times. Now not everyone tips and plenty of people got off without tipping. We did not tip him after one trip and he seemed a bit sarcastic as we got off the bus. Again we had the disco, this time early evening back from New York. Luckliy he seemed to work days, and in the second week we started going out in the evenings so we did not come accross him again. The other drivers did not seem so \"tip orientated\". They were all polite and helpful, but did not seem upset if you did not tip them. They seemed to be content with the fact they had a job and were earning a wage. We did tip but not every single journey as usually you got the same guy on the return leg anyway. Our favourite was Tony. He was really friendly and very informative about Las Vegas and the sights. We did not get the room service. Having arrived a day late the room was then cleaned the day after our arrival (which would have been our 3rd day). On the 8th day were were woken by a knock at the door. The chambermaid was enquiring why we were not out of the room. We explained we still had a week to go, Not content with this answer she came back later trying to evict us. I went to reception and explained she wanted us out. The booking was still in two seperate weeks, hence the chambermaid wanting us out. We were well into our 2nd week and the sheets had not been changed + the room had not been serviced since day 3. I asked reception if a service was due and was told tomorrow. The maid did come but did not change the sheets. I again rang reception and asked if normally they changed the sheets in the 2nd week and was told yes. So they had to get the maid back. I can only assume she still thought it was our first week. I did not find the bed as comfortable as a unit we had in Florida. The matress protector was attached to the bed on each corner by elastic and it kept coming loose and all the sheets would then ruck up. To be honest we sheet seemed to small. Normally there is plenty to tuck in top and sides but you either had lots at the side and none at the top or visa versa due to the shape of the sheet. The room bedroom itself was large enough and had enough drawers + a walk in wardrobe. The main room again was adequate in size. The property seemed very well maintained, staff would say hello as they came across you. Each pool had a bbq area with two gas bbq's. We made good use of these due to the nice weather (we are now back in UK - And yes it is raining again). Again the staff seemed to clean these, if not every day, then every couple.

WiFi has recently been installed in the buildings, and it is one of the strongest connections I've experienced in all of my travels. i stream hulu as well as if I were at home. Congrats to the resort of getting this difficult point right. We got a two bedroom unit facing the parking lot. I like it this way since it means that it's more quiet. I don't know how much the unit lets out for, but there was a significant number of young (early 20s) ppl. I'm not old myself but am just used to resorts where my husband and I are one of the few young couples. At one point the unit downstairs had a party going on, but they got quiet before it got too late. People have mentioned security...yes, it is lax. This made my MIL uncomfortable, but I figure it's not a big deal. The resort is a 10-15 walk to the Strip. I don't mind walking, b/c I don't glam up for the casinos like most of the ladies I see. So it's easy for me to walk in flip flops and sneakers. If you do like to strut, then I recommend the shuttle. It does not have the most frequent schedule though, so you might have to consider a taxi. We rented a car, b/c Vegas is a lot more than the Strip. I'm very happy with the resort.

After allowing WAY too many people onto the shuttle, once we were all seated and ready to go, the driver announced that only 20 could fit and that about 5 people would have to get off the shuttle, this separated our group (we volunteered) and when one of our party stepped off the shuttle, telling the driver clearly, \"I'll be right back, I've got to get the room key from my friend.\", the driver promptly closed the door behind him and drove away. We were shocked! Once we arrived at the hotel, the last group on the shuttle told the driver they thought it was the shuttle to Rio. (something he should have ascertained BEFORE driving away.)

It is really beautiful and when the clubhouse opens it will be even better. Yes, this is an older resort but the upkeep is tremendous. I was in an owner suite because of RCI exchange, but I hear that the rentals are nice as well. My suite looked just like the nice one on the website photos. I got a handicap suite to get in sooner and didn't really have use for the enormous tub that comes in the regular ones. Besides, it put me on the first floor and the master shower was really nice with the removable shower head. The hall bath had a rain shower. The living room had 55 inch flat panel tv while the bedrooms had 42 inch flat sacreens on the walls. We rented a car and visited the Grand Canyon, Lake Mead, and Hoover Dam as well as other hotels and Freemont street. We also took advantage of the complimentary shuttle a few times. The shuttle works perfect. The activities for the kids were great and the activty staff was great. One morning they were outside cleaning our windows; I was impressed. The property was kept very clean and the workers were doing a great job. We used three of the pools and they were all pretty decent. They were open 24hrs but we used them during the day and late evenings, and they were kept clean and organized. I did use the barbecue grill one time and it went okay. Hawaiian Night was a great show of Hula dancers and fire eaters Tuesday evening and the mid-day pool party on Thursday was alot of fun. The bed in the master bedroom sunk in pretty bad on one side and we let the staff know at check out. Sleeping was not unbearable and hopefully they will fix that issue. The only other issue was the phone was not working. I used our cell phones so it wasn't a problem. If they charge to make local calls I would not use it anyway. The internet was not working because of the phones, but when I called the front desk I was given the access to the internet via staff access so I commend the staff member for that. This place is located a long block behind Harrahs and the Flamingo. You could walk it within 15 minutes, but if you moniter the shuttle times you can get further down the strip and faster to one of the stops (Venetian, Bally's, or New York New York). Go to Downtown Las Vegas to Fremont Experience to truly enjoy your visit. The shuttle goes there. Also , it goes to the grocery store.

We are RCI time share owners, but did NOT make this reservation through our timeshare company. We only needed a few nights, so we went on-line and used \"Book-it\". ~~While all the units have the same floor plan, there are two vastly DIFFERENT levels of accomodation at Summer Bay. If you rent online (ie: Expedia, Orbitz, Book-It, etc.) - expect an older, dated unit. If you are okay with a trip back to the 80's and a hodge podge of well worn furnishings & decorating styles, their rental units will meet your needs. They have @ 150 rental units. (There are over 500 units on this property) ~~Don't be fooled by the lovely photos the resort posts on-line! When we asked the front desk, they explained that they have TIME-SHARE units and RENTAL units. They explained that on-line booking sites do not guarantee what the rooms will look like. The only way to get one of those updated timeshare units is to pay $50 more per night. ~~ One of the biggest drawbacks was the constant hum of the outdoor air conditioning units. Since the property was initially condos/apartments, each unit has a separate air conditioner. From our unit, with all the AC always running, there was never really any sense of quiet. Made me wish I was in a high rise to avoid the noise! ~~ While not far from \"the strip\" - we were advised by the staff not to walk from the resort to the strip at night. Seems an area they call the \"desert\" (currently undeveloped land between the resort & the strip) is known for homeless folks sleeping there at night. ~~ The fitness center was quite small - eary in the morning folks lined up for machines. There were no free weights. ~~AGAIN----- BEWARE of the two different worlds of Summer Bay. If you are a time share trade-in, seems you are okay.

The resort is somewhat close to the strip and it is in walking distance. The shuttles were very convenient and the staff very accommodating. The staff that rode around in golf carts always offered you a ride if you were walking. Best attractions or restaurants nearby: I always go to the George Wallace show, which is outstanding and we rented a car and went to LA for the day. That was somewhat tiring, but I truly enjoyed myself. We've been coming to Summer Bay for the last few years, but this is the 1st time we were very unhappy with the condo we had. The condo itself was beautiful, the decor and furnishing were excellent. The problem we had was the design. The shower and sink were in the bedroom, but it did not have an enclosure (19-201), therefore if one of us wanted to sleep in you could not do it if the other one wanted to take a shower or perform normal hygiene. This was unbelievable! I just think what if you had children running around and you wanted to take a shower/bath, where would you disrobe? You would have to put the kids in a completely different room and hope they did not come back in the bedroom while you were undress, getting out the shower/bath, drying off, etc. I don\u2019t know who design the room, but it\u2019s horrible. We arrived in the evening therefore by the time we reached the room, we did not have the energy to go all the way back to the welcome center to change rooms. At least when I go again I know what type of room I do not want. This is the one thing that ruined our vacation, but we dealt with it. The mini golf course is a joke - six holes and right next to the pool. All the land the resort has they can build a better mini golf course. One other thing: we rented a car through the concierge but the concierge should provide more information without you trying to pull it from her. The concierge took our information then told us a shuttle from the rental car place would pick us up to get the car. That was it. So I ask her if there was a deposit, she said yes. I then had to ask her how much, she said if you use a debit card it would be about $350. So I said OK. If I did not ask she would not have given me that information. What she didn\u2019t tell us was if you use a debit card the car rental place would also pull a credit report. We did not know this until we got there. It was OK, but what if it wasn\u2019t? The concierge should be required to give out this vital information. I really enjoyed the gym, sauna, hot tub and the dance performance they had one evening. I\u2019ll be glad when all the construction is completed so we can get something to eat on the grounds without going elsewhere. I rated my experience as a 4, but my complaints above stopped me from rating it a 5. I\u2019ve been here previously so I know things are not always the same.

I chose it because the reviews were much less scary than the hotels on the strip in our price range. After booking I continued to read more reviews and started to get a little worried, but all of those worries were for nothing. Here's the play by play: We flew in at 7:30am and Check-In time wasn't until 4pm, but we decided to try our luck. After picking up our rental car we arrived at Summer Bay about 8:30am. We had no trouble finding the entrance, or temporary front desk, and barely noticed the construction at the front of the complex. At the front desk, they told us they had a room ready for us, no problem. I tried to hint around, hoping to get an upgrade to an owner suite, mentioned our anniversary, then flat out asked if they were booked up. She said they were full. Oh well, can't blame a gal for trying! We got to our room (Building 3, 207) and loved it from the moment we walked in. Spacious living room and kitchen, nice big king size bed, and huge garden tub. Everything was clean, and, despite a little bit of wear on the couch, very welcoming. This was a One Bedroom rental, so there was just a small two person table in the kitchen, and 'old-style (read:non-flat-screen) TVs. Worked for us, who goes to Vegas to watch TV?!? However, all the remotes were missing batteries, one call to the front desk and that was fixed. I've read complaints on these reviews about not enough towels, and not enough, and too small pillows. There were plenty of each, with extras under the sink and in the closet. Check out my pictures to see the room, and the great view from the balcony. We did visit the concierge, and she was helpful, though we didn't end up going to any shows. We also used the free shuttle, which was great! They pick up at the back of the property, so it was a little walk from where we were, but I think a golf cart went by and offered a ride everytime. The shuttle always picked up and dropped off right on time. And remember it's FREE, so even though we had a rental car, we used the shuttle so we didn't have to worry about parking. The times were very convenient, and the drivers all very pleasant. The grounds are beautiful. We walked around once, and probably didn't see half of it. The pool closest to us was under construction, and we didn't have much time so we didn't swim. The only very, very minor complaint I have is, we didn't get maid service (our choice) so I asked for an extra packet of coffee for our second morning, and they wouldn't give it to me. Like I said, very minor! The free popcorn at the front desk totally made up for it!

This property is 3 storied and does NOT have lifts which was a big consideration for us as I have a mobility problem and stairs are a nightmare for me. In addition the hotel is located a bit further away from the Strip than the others that were also available. We chose this one because it sounded niver and indeed it was. I emailed the hotel direct and requested a ground floor room and also asked the same question from our Timeshare group. Needless to say, we didnt get one!!! But, after checking things out they managed to find us one. However, it overlooked a car park which I also wasnt happy about so I requested to move rooms. Eventually, this went ahead but we had to wait till 4pm till all the Check-in/out had gone through. The Check-in process itself was a bit of a nightmare as the power had been off for quite a while and they had to do everything manually. Plus they were still operating out of a couple of the units as the main Reception still hadnt opened and the front of the hotel was still blocked off. In fact, when we arrived, the taxi driver dropped us off out the front and we would've had to walk a very long way to get around the back entrance except that one of the shuttles appeared and picked us up. The unit itself was very nice - very clean, comfy bed, nice kitchen (if you wanted to cook :) They provide a very good shuttle service to various points on the Strip both to drop off and pick up - very convenient. Also a daily service to the local store to get groceries (except Sundays) and the store even gives you a good discount. My only complaint was that there was very little shade around the pools and spas to the point that we didnt use them as it was so hot. They need to consider this and put in more daybeds and umberellas or shade trees. They had popcorn free of charge available in the main building which was a nice touch. As with most Timeshares there were various activities available but nothing that interested us.

Since we were five people in a family, we wanted the home-like environment of a timeshare/family suite-style lodging. From the pictures on the website, Summer Bay looked like what we wanted. So much for a picture being worth a thousand words. Location: The location was ideal, just two (largish) blocks off the strip on Koval Avenue. It was trivial to get to most of the places on the Strip you would want to go to. Plenty of parking (due to it being a large establishment, and that there were many, MANY empty rooms there) as well. There was construction that required a detour from the \"real\" entrance that Google Maps or Mapquest will lead you to--the entrance is temporarily BEHIND the establishment, off of a side street from Koval. This is due to construction work on the facility. Room. The room was spacious, with a full kitchen, a laundry room with large-capacity washer and dryer (good, as I had to wash my clothes for a business trip I was going to from the vacation), and two bedrooms and a living room with balcony. The establishment was a bit dated, with older furnishings, and a carpet that has seen better days. Also, the A/C made the smaller bedroom and the living room absolutely frigid, while the master bedroom barely got below 80 degrees throughout our stay. They really need to fix that--we dodged a bullet in that the weather never got above 95 degrees, but you'd be baking otherwise. Amenities: My kids really liked the pool, which was a short walk from the room. However, the dust from all the work found its way into the room, unfortunately. Also, the the wifi internet access was free. This was good, as I'd be even more upset that it didn't work any of the days we were staying there. The conversation went like this with the front desk: \"I can't get onto the internet or get a code from the automated system.\" \"Yes, we know-they're working on it.\" \"When will it be fixed?\" \"We don't know.\" Not cool, especially nowadays when nearly everyone brings a laptop or tablet along. Housekeeping does the minimum to keep the room livable. They're very miserly with the towels and extra pillows (don't know why--more than half of the rooms were empty, so it isn't like they don't have some spares!!). Bring your own extra blankets or pillows if you need such things. Price: You can always get a deal to stay here--the price was decent. Conclusion: If you don't need internet, extras, or are generally an undemanding traveler looking to stay a few days in Vegas on the (relatively) cheap, Summer Bay Las Vegas Desert Club wil do.

I was attending an event at the Sands Expo and wanted to be as close as possible. My first reservation was at the Venetian for $525 because the Venetian is attached to the Sands. I heard about Summer Bay and found out it is the same walking distance from the Venetian rooms for much less money. My two nights at Summer Bay cost $240. My room was a two bedroom owners unit that was absolutely beautiful. (I heard the \"renter unit\" was not as nicely decorated but same layout) It was on the 2nd floor, no elevators here but the climb was not bad at all. The rooms had every single amenity you would find at home. We were only there for the weekend so we didn't do any cooking. If I was staying longer and if my whole family was with me, I would have stocked the full size fridge and saved some cash by eating in. Free wi-fi. Yes, you have to log in each day but it takes like two minutes. The walk to the front of the Sands Expo took about 10-15 minutes. Had the back doors of The Sands been open, the walk would have taken less than 5 minutes. Yes, there was a lot of construction going on but I knew that when booking. There is a guard at the entrance who will not allow you to drive in unless you show your parking pass. I liked that I could park my car and be in my room in a couple of minutes. Not like the big hotels where it takes 15 minutes to get to your room after you park. The pool was nice, there are three pools (one was closed during construction). Service at the front desk was average. If you are in Vegas to party or you want to walk everywhere on the strip this is not the place for you. This is for you if you are with family or friends and want to stay in the same room. If you are staying for 3 or more days this is a great way to save money on food and lodging. The room I stayed in was large and comfortable and I will stay here again.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, California", "Title": "\u201cDONT EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY\u201d", "Author": "misleaded", "ReviewID": "UR110648408", "Content": "I signed to buy a membership in January 2011.

You have 3 options to get to the road. 1) Taxi - Your fee will be $4.70 just to get to the front gate of the hotel 2) You can get a ride on a golf cart to the front of the hotel. Unfortunately it was often difficult to get a ride. Nobody was available to drive the carts. If you arrive late at night just try to flag down the security guard at the front. You simply have to walk back to the hotel because the golf cart person simply does not show up. Additionally we had bad experiences with drivers making us feel uncomfortable about how much we tipped them. 3) Walk -- It's a pretty long walk to the front of the hotel through an industrial section of town.

We spent three weeks in the US in total - starting and ending in Vegas. We stayed at the Venetian for the first three days, and the Summer Bay resort for the final three. Of the two, despite being far cheaper, and a couple of blocks from the strip - we much preferred our stay at the Summer Bay. You can relax and enjoy yourself without feeling that you are missing out on something (as the 'in your face' strip can sometimes make you feel). It was not all good news of course (it never is !). There is building work going on at present (due to be completed in July 2011 they told us) at the front of the development, which means you have to follow a long divertion around to the back of the complex to gain access. I wish the reception staff would have told us at the start of the stay that if you ask the security guard who is on patrol on a night where the building works are taking place - he will ring for a golf buggy to come and pick you up and bring you round. In three days we certainly kept fit !! The building work will only impact you if you're in a block close to the work - ask about that when you book. The rooms are great - really spacious. They have a kitchen, small dining room, lounge, large bedroom with walk in wardrobe and the biggest bath we saw anywhere in the US (two people can lie in it side by side - excellent !). Some of the furniture (settee etc) were a bit tatty, but overall it was a really quiet, comfortable place to stay. The facilities at Summer Bay are good. There are four pools (a larger one also being built right now) with plenty of towels and recliners, a gym (free to use for guests - no free weights but two running machines, a stepper, bike and others) and a games room. The grounds staff are very helpful - but the concierge was quite the opposite - go elsewhere for the best deals on tours and attractions.

Although situated a long block behind the center strip hotels, I have walked to Harrah\u2019s within ten minutes from departing the main entrance. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing so after sunset, however. The units have a spacious layout with an abundance of closet and drawer space; something I have not seen often in my years of travel. The units have a maximum occupancy of six; that number can comfortably stay at this resort. Summer Bay has one of the best housekeeping services I have experienced while staying at timeshares. All appliances are newer and in excellent working order. Large, mounted, flat screen televisions are a fantastic touch. If you\u2019re a light sleeper, I do recommend requesting a second floor unit. The employees do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant one. I attempted to use one of the grills on two separate occasions. Both times I needed assistance getting the gas grill started. I called the front desk and within three minutes someone was there to the rescue. I used the transportation service on my previous stay here and the shuttle drivers are fantastic. The schedule service takes you to various locations on the strip, downtown and a grocery store. It would be nice to have an on-call driver (for a set fee, of course) to pick up after 11:30pm which is around the time of the last return trip to Summer Bay. I had the unfortunate experience of an irate, verbally abusive, cab driver who, at 1am, did not care to take two women the short distance to the resort from the Flamingo Hotel. It was one of the most frightening experiences I have had in life; when we attempted to get out immediately, he refused to release the door locking mechanism. (He was reported to his supervisor.) Over the summer, I sent e-mails to the resort suggesting an on-call driver and relayed my experience, but have not received a reply to date. I think most guests wouldn\u2019t mind paying extra to avoid the hassle. This trip, I rented a vehicle, which is something I usually do not do when vacationing in Vegas. There is ample complimentary parking at the resort; most spaces have carport coverings. This trip, I utilized one of the swimming pools; small, but a nice layout. Considering there are clusters of pools, hot tubs and chaise lounges in the courtyard of 3-5 low rise buildings, it was not overly crowded and fairly quiet. The scheduled activities were plentiful; I watched a classic movie. Snacks were provided, the setting was comfortable and the TV was large. There was only one other guest, but the resort did not cancel the movie due to low attendance. That was very much appreciated. Great staff, well-kept resort, responsible guests, very nice, comfortable units.

Here are the positives and negatives of our overall experience. PROS: *Great quiet and convenient location, directly behind Harrah's Casino (10 min. walk). *Our 1 bedroom suite was clean, comfortable and had a wonderful spa bath. *We stayed for free using a certificate we received when purchasing our timeshare *Great shuttle service to the supermarket and downtown (Freemont Street). CONS: *We waited 33 minutes to be checked into our rooms! *We were told that check out was at 11:00a.m. when making our reservations in Jan. and then we were surprised that we actually had to check out at 10:00a.m. *The check in time was at 4:00p.m., so be warned. *When we purchased our timeshare, they said that the construction would be finished by Nov. 2010 but it was still ongoing when we arrived. *An associate who checked us in said that she would give us some paperwork we requested in a few minutes. We waited 5 minutes and went back inside and she had left without giving us what we requested. **The condition of our free stay stipulated that we had to attend a 90 minute presentation from 11:00~12:30. This was not a problem but my husband and I were extremely frustrated and agitated that the presentation lasted from 11:00~1:25!! That was 2.5 hrs. of high pressure sales that tried to convince us to upgrade to a 2 bedroom because this deal wouldn't last..........yadda, yadda, yadda. *Also, during the check in process the group ahead of us were a group of parents and chaperones. They had requested that their suites be located next to each other since they had many minors. For whatever reason, Summerbay dropped the ball on this and placed their suites very far away from each other. The clients were not too happy and said they would contact management to complain. Overall, the stay was pleasant and the ammenities were nice. However, they need to train their staff how to deal more professionally and efficiently with the public.

The evening we arrived we were a little concerned upon first impression of the resort since you are entering through the front gate, that was still being worked on as part of the renovations and the first building we saw is what I think will be the new welcome center which also is still being finished. The woman working security that night was friend and stopped the cab to verify we were on the list for check in which made us feel secure that not anyone could drive into the property. They presently have the registration area in a couple of the units in Building 1 but I can understand this is only a temp location. It was a little confsusing at first since the door we entered brought us to someone who I think was more for setting sales tours but we were directed to the back bedroom that was set up as the registration area. Moe was working that night and he is very friendly and made check in a breeze for us. We were off quickly with our keys in hand. Outside building 1 was the pick up spot for the shuttle service which is under the covered areas for the parking spaces as you see around the property. Also in this area they had golf carts waiting to help people get to their room if they did not have a vehicle. The drive loaded our bags into the cart and we jumped in where he took us to our unit, Building 8 rm 109 and helped carry our bags to the door and ensured the lights were turned on and the temp settings were correct. The units were very clean and well laid out. We were told that the resort was a housing community at one time, so the layout of the rooms is designed as such. The bed was lovely but I do wish the had more pillows. The bathroom had the largest tub I've ever seen in a resort bathroom. The living room and kitchen area was very spacious and the fire place was a nice touch. The pool areas and BBQ's we're located just outside out unit and made for wasy access which was nice. I did try to use the BBQ's twice but I found them to be a great disapointment. They were difficult to get lit and never did reach a cooking tempature to my liking. There were times I had the setting as high as I could and I could still hold my hand over the grill and it would feel warm at best. Both times I tried to BBQ i ened up finishing off by using the cook top in the unit. Also we did find the noise from the unit above to be a concern as well. You can hear people walking or using the showers quite easily. Also the person above us the first 2 days liked to play crappy rap music fairly loudly in the evenings, but once they left it was enjoyable the remaining time there at the resort. Every morning you would see the maintance staff cleaning the BBQ's, pool area and common areas around the unit which was nice to see. These people work really hard. The best aspect is the shuttle service, it really is the best in Vegas. The free shuttle ran on time all the time and you could count on them to leave to the strip on time and be at the pickup spots on time. Also while checking in we mentioned to Moe that we were there for our Honeymoon, as my wife and I married the day before while in Vegas for our planned wedding. The next day after we checked in, a wonderful basket was delivered to our unit with a note of congrats from Moe and the Staff. This was a lovely surprise and truly increased our satisfaction in the level of service by the staff.

The toilet is in it's own little room off the bathroom. Tub was absolutely HUGE. It could easily fit 3 average size adults!!

Pillows were the worst I have slept on, bring your own. Front desk staff never did send anyone to fix out fireplace until the last day when i cornered a maintenance man myself.

Although the decor is somewhat dated, everything was clean and comfortable enough. The construction at the entrance was a nonissue for us as our room was near the back of the complex, and we had a rental car so had no need to use the shuttle. But...the noise was a major problem. The walls are paper thin and the pool and hot tub were just below our 3rd level room. (There are multiple little \"pods\", each complete with their own little pool and clubhouse in the center) I could hear our neighbor's conversations and television next door well in to the night on our first night there. Then for the rest of the week, I knew that our new neighbors got in the shower every morning promptly at 7 a.m. when they turned on the squeaky nozzle - it was like an unwanted alarm clock for me after being kept up late the night before by folks outside my window. The pool and hot tub down below were open 24 hours and are heated. So though the temps were only in the 50s, the hot tub was often utilized and occupied well in to the middle of the night by drinking and loud talking/laughing occupants. One night out of desperation for some sleep, I opened my window at 2:30 a.m. and yelled down to the people in the hot tub to \"please stop yelling so that people up here could get some sleep.\" I finally got my first and only good night's sleep after a week on our last night there. So because of the noise issues, I could not recommend this condo except for those people who either are going to stay out all night anyway, or have the ability to sleep through just about anything.

For a three-person room, the place had a fully functional kitchenette, one king-sized bed, a fold out bed/couch, two flat-screen TVs, a working fireplace, and a decent bathroom. They were clean, and everything looked new; we likely got one of the newly remodeled rooms, and we sure aren't complaining. It was quite nice hearing silence when we went to sleep, versus the hubbub that was still out there on the Strip. Definitely comfortable, great facilities, and the location is not detrimentally far away from the strip. In addition, service was nice (we got daily custodial service), and the staff was pretty friendly, even when we had to check in very late at night. All in all, I highly recommend the location, as long as you don't mind being away from the Strip for a while. There are daily buses that leave from the resort to the Strip, so there is available transportation for those that don't want to brave traffic on the Strip itself.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cgreat customer service, nice suites\u201d", "Author": "amandawillis", "ReviewID": "UR94175134", "Content": "Very pleased with pricing, location and accomadations.

I am a frequent guest at Mandalay Bay and Monte Carlo, have stayed at the Wyndham Grand Desert Resorts, and just recently purchased a 2 bedroom timeshare at the HGVC Flamingo. I had not heard much about this place, so my expectations were not high. Upon my arrival, yes, there was construction in the front (and I've been told it will be done by March 2011). Check in was smooth and I got a ground floor room next to the pool (Unit 8-105). The room itself was renovated, had large flatscreen TVs, granite countertops, a huge bathtub, and all the amenities of home (and some I wish I had at home like the automically timed fireplace). The grounds were clean, the staff was friendly, and I found out that all the pools throughout the resort are heated - pretty awesome. I had to leave after 4 nights but after experiencing this place I decided to buy a 2 bedroom week timeshare at the Summer Bay Club on ebay. I prefer this place over Wyndham and the spaciousness and apartment style options make it more attractive than the strip hotels. Overall, I love my timeshare at the HGVC Flamingo because of the strip location, the access to all the Flamingo pools, and the excellent Hilton timeshare exchange program. However, the Summer Bay timeshare program is more flexible (you can break up your 7 nights for multiple trips). I also like the fact that the rooms are only steps away from the parking lot and that it has frequent shuttle service. If you frequently travel to Vegas, it is a good timeshare to own (personally I would buy resale to save a lot of cash). Also, as I rented from an existing timeshare owner, I got a renovated unit (I'm told that all the owner units are renovated and the separate \"rental suites\" are not). There are solid deals on this place (to both buy and rent) on ebay (just take the standard ebay precautions if you go this route).

They return you to your unit in this rather large resort which is really nice after you have walked The Strip for hours! There is a \"grocery store\" run every morning at 8:30 so you can get whatever you need at the local Safeway (Von's). You have an hour to shop and are returned to your unit. The shuttle driver will even help you with your bags. Be sure to give at least a small tip - the drivers are so worth it! We had a one-bedroom unit not facing the pool. It was much quieter and we actually could see the hotels on The Strip from our balcony. The unit was newly redecorated and was beautifully stocked with everything you could possibly need for a relaxing stay. We did not participate in any of the resort activities but know there were plenty offered. The pools (there are 4 or 5) were beautiful with ample seating, tables with umbrellas and nice gas grills available. A couple of tips: Ellis Island is about a ten-minute walk from the resort. There is no shuttle service to it. It's an old and small casino with several great restaurants and ATMs with the lowest fees in Vegas. It was a great place to eat on our first night in Vegas after a long flight. Use the shuttle to the Flamingo Casino as it is the shortest distance from the resort and will put you right in the middle of The Strip. Shuttle runs every hour on the 45 and takes about 5 minutes. It's GREAT! The resort is still waiting for the completion of their new clubhouse that will have a small store, ATMs, a larger pool and fitness center. Definite progress is finally being made and it looks like it will be finished by early next year. Construction in the area is not an inconvenience - just don't be surprised by the entrance to the resort as it is part of the construction. It'll be fabulous when finished. Other good places to eat on somewhat of a budget - California Pizza Kitchen in the Mirage; Cheesecake Factory at the far end of The Forum at Caesars; and Grand Lux in The Venetian. Also in the Venetian there is a wonderful authentic Italian restaurant on the canal that has a $20 3-course lunch that is to die for. In The Wynn right beyond the entrance to their shopping area there is a wonderful inexpensive place for lunch that serves deli sandwiches and pizza but the bonus there is the outside seating that's along a series of beautiful waterfalls with lush tropical planting - really nice.

We do not own a timeshare, we just found many great reviews on tripadvisor and other sites so we chose to do a weekly rental. Check-in was a breeze, Rokishia was an expert and a conscientious professional. We requested a 3rd floor room with a balcony overlooking the pool. We received exactly that. Beware - the pools are open 24 hours and this is Las Vegas, we had some 4am partygoers on occasion and you will hear them unless you have earplugs. Didn't bother me much, I just snored a little louder to compensate for it. :) My wife had a different perspective, but she did ask for the room by the pool. As far as the room goes, generally very clean and as advertised but with some cheap effects. It should be noted that I called to inquire about an upgrade to a recently renovated room and I was told that would be an additional $50 per night. Considering we were quoted about $95 per night averaged, this would have been a significant addition even though at $145 a night it would have still been a bargain. I did not discuss a room upgrade at check-in. Cheap effects in the room? This is being rather nit-picky, but these would be the flaws I saw, if you will - 1. cheesy dishwasher - it was VERY noisy and the detergent dispenser door did not open once while we were there and we used it on a daily basis 2. old-school TV's - we heard about the flat screen HD's but they were not in our room (my point was that who gives a hoot?, we're in Vegas, baby!) 3. the icemaker in our freezer was broken and it took a slew of people to finally replace it 4. pillows on the bed were the size of couch throw-pillows 5. the vent in the master bath restroom automatically turned on when you turned on the light switch and it was as loud as a lawnmower - which would positively wake up the person that was not getting up to pee 6. the shower stall in the smaller bathroom was aged and permanently soiled plus the temperature of the water was terribly inconsistent, frequently switching from hot to cold and back Now that I covered the bad - everything else with the room was great! Large, mostly very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was a blessing to have. We did not use the washer/dryer. The master bath had a ridiculously gigantic bathtub. It was so large it was gawdy. But it was kind of fun to take a shower, you could dance and spin in there if you wanted to. The closets were many and very large. My one design complaint would be that there is no door separating the shower/sink area from the bedroom in the master bedroom. Daily room service was adequate. The pool was great, although on some days it looked like the filtration system wasn't exactly running well. One day the bins of clean towels were empty and I called the operator to let them know. We then watched as three different staff members looked into the bins and walked away. The fourth eventually restocked the towels about an hour later. I did not use the hot tub, it was 103 degrees one day we were there. Dry heat - baloney. There is music at the pool, but our sound system wasn't working too well, you could just barely hear it. We used the next pool over which had some good tunes playing. There were two large and nice stainless BBQ grills outside the pool. One would not light. A maintenance guy happened to be near me one day so I mentioned it to him. It was never fixed. The grill was a great option to have. We grilled some chicken and hot dogs on a few occasions. Leading me to... The shuttle service is a fantastic perk. The shuttle to the Von's grocery store at 8:30am gets packed and you have to sign up for that one and the shuttle to Fremont St in advance. I think they need to organize the shuttle system a little bit, there were almost always more people than the shuttle could handle. Perhaps they could hand out tickets for each ride? I know that it would require a lot of management. Overall, it works, just not so smoothly every time. There is an arcade and game room which we stopped by to check out. It has a couple of decent pool tables, but we didn't play. I would highly recommend staying at Summer Bay Resorts. The location is a brief walk away from the strip and after a while, you may find that a welcome respite.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAnts in my pants!\u201d", "Author": "Hergules", "ReviewID": "UR80960438", "Content": "OK The Good - Great rooms, 4-star layouts, new & clean The Bad - Had ants in my bed the first night (switched rooms the next day) - They neglected to mention that the hotel is under renovation and major construction is ongoing - No business center (due to renovations - I was counting on this feature) - On my day of departure, they lost my luggage (they gave it to another guest....

Our unit was located on the third floor in building eleven overlooking the pool. Our condo consisted of two bedrooms with king size beds, full equipped kitchen, two full bathrooms, living room, dining area, laundry room with full washer/dryer and balcony. Other amenities included a gas fireplace, DVD player, three large flat screen TV\u2019s, storage area off the balcony, closet organizers/drawers in each walk-in closet, in-wall safe and an abundance amount of storage space. Whoever designed this condo did a great job. The color scheme and d\u00e9cor flowed beautifully from one room to the next. I was really impressed that every detail was carefully thought out and not overly done. The furniture was comfortable, unit was well maintained/clean, layout was great and spacious. I was extremely impressed how meticulously organized everything was. The housekeeping staff really takes pride making sure that everything is in the right place and just so. Construction - The resort does have construction going on in front but that didn\u2019t affect our stay. Once completed, it will be really nice. Check-In \u2013 We arrived a few hours early and were able to check-in immediately. There was a line but it moved quickly and efficiently. Since we were assigned a B unit, I asked what units were available at that time. Only one by the pool but luckily it was on the third floor which I hoped for. I was a little hesitant since the pools were opened 24 hours but I didn\u2019t want to drop to a smaller unit with a parking lot view. Since my husband I like to sit outside we preferred the pool unit and hoped for the best. Staff - The staff was amazing and everyone that we dealt with was friendly and accommodating. Their goal was to make sure that you were enjoying your vacation and having a positive experience at the resort. A special thanks to Carla (Customer Care Dept.) who spent a significant amount of time answering my questions prior to our stay. Everyone was great but Carla was exceptional. She went above and beyond her duties and I\u2019m very grateful for all of her help/time. Thanks Carla!!! Pool - The pool was clean and peaceful during the day. No matter what time we went, we were able to obtain a table/chairs with umbrella. At night, however, was a different story. Three nights we had people at the pool partying. The first night I called security around 5am since after two hours I got fed up. Yes its Vegas, yes people want to have fun but there\u2019s a limit. Security did arrive within minutes, it quieted down but the party animals got even and all six of them let out a huge scream before leaving the pool area at 6am. Needless to say we didn\u2019t sleep well. The party crew was back on Saturday and Sunday night so we ended up wearing ear plugs to bed. During the week around 1am there was more yelling going on and this time it was a family with kids. They were running around the pool, jumping in, yelling back/forth to each other, tossing a ball back/forth and were wild. The hopes of sitting on the balcony at night to unwind from the day were impossible. Having the pools open 24 hours is a huge mistake. The units that have a pool view are close to the pool area and if you get a rowdy bunch of people, you aren\u2019t going to sleep well. Since the buildings are in clusters, each with a pool, the noise echoes throughout the area. The resorts on the Strip close their pools at night and I think the same should be done here or by 10pm the latest. Grounds \u2013 Very well maintained, nice landscaping and clean. Shuttle - One of the main reasons for staying at this resort was the shuttle service. Taxis are very expensive and since we liked going to the Strip during different times of the day/night this suited us. The drivers are on time so make sure you arrive early at the pick-up location. Once they load up, they are gone and don\u2019t wait. Also if there is a line you may have to wait for a back-up shuttle. We experienced this a few times during our stay and luckily got on the first shuttle. One night the driver contacted the resort and requested for a back-up shuttle ASAP since there was a long line of people at the Flamingo. He informed the guests that due to safety reasons, you were not allowed to stand in the shuttle. The second time the driver let everyone on. People were standing (including kids) from the very back of the shuttle to the door. To me this was very dangerous especially since the driver had to make two sharp turns from the Flamingo back to the resort. Even though he proceeded with extra caution anything could have happened. Walking To The Strip - You are within ten to fifteen minutes of the Strip depending on how fast you walk and what route you take. If you plan on walking back at night take Flamingo Road to Koval Lane. It\u2019s well lit and safer. The other streets that are closer to the resort aren\u2019t well lit, homeless people may be lurking and you need to proceed with caution. Timeshare Presentation - Prior to us leaving for Las Vegas we received a call at home asking to attend a breakfast on Saturday morning for a timeshare presentation. The conversation started with confirming our reservations but then the sales pitch began. I indicated that I didn\u2019t want to commit to anything prior to the vacation and wanted to speak to my husband first. The saleswoman said that she would contact me on Thursday around dinner time. I informed her to not call late since we had to get up at 2am the following day. She called our house four times on Thursday up to 9pm our time. That really annoyed me. My husband had to work late and I didn\u2019t get home until late due to a last minute situation. I understand the timeshare presentation since we\u2019ve gone through that many times during vacation but to obtain calls prior to us leaving\u2026 I was not pleased. Of course we received a call in our unit very early Saturday morning but I didn\u2019t bother answering the phone. Even with some issues we still enjoyed staying at Summer Bay and I would go back in the future.

We drove from Tucson and had no problem finding the resort. Even though some front end construction was going on it was not a distraction. We parked a good size van under the covered parking and did not have to drive once while in Vegas. We opted for a room on the 3rd floor and we had a great view of the pool from the covered patio area. The room was amazing, when we first walked thru we thought the second bedroom was actually the master suite because it was so nice! The entire two bedroom unit was furnished and decorated very upscale. There is LCD t.v.s in each bedroom plus of course, the living room. The kitchen had every possible appliance you could want. There were IPOD docking stations in each of the rooms and WIFI as well. The master bedroom had a giant bathtub/shower so definitely throw your bath stuff into your luggage! Everyone slept very well and comfortable including my 16 year old who slept on the couch. It is a pull out but he slept on the couch itself which he found to be more comfortable. The resort offers a very extensive shuttle service which takes you to major stops on the strip, Freemont street and the supermarket. Once we were dropped off at the Flamingo, which is closest stop, we bought monorail tickets ($12 each) which takes you to each end of the strip with 7 or so stops in between. We only had to cab it three times costing us less than $30. The resort shuttle was always there for drop off and pick up. Pool is open 24 hours although crowded during the day, night was very quiet. The staff was accomodating and when we checked in she gave us a preference to 2nd or 3rd floor and offered us the pool view which was also by the arcade, which she thought my 3 teenage boys would like. After searching the internet for show tickets to Le Reve we ended up calling the concierge at the resort we found the least expensive tickets ($97 for premium seating) offered. The show was amazing...different review... Oh yea, the location of Summer Bay Resorts was about a half mile off the strip, probably half way between Stratosphere and MGM. Excellent location. So if you happen to miss the resort shuttle times to take you back, you just get off the monorail at Flamingo and it is about a $5.50 cab ride to resort. (or less) The only downside to any of this was we could only stay from Friday to Sunday...we were unable to use the entire week.

We had been told that we might be able to check in early, but they couldn't tell us over the phone whether our place was ready. Annoying, but unavoidable. I stood in line for about twenty minutes to \"check in\" but I was not given keys (not really checking in, then, right?). I was told I would be called when our two bedroom unit was ready. Check in was at 4, so when 3:30 came around and no one had called me, I called them. I was told they had called when the unit was ready. Lie. I had no \"missed calls\" on my cell phone. We went to the resort and I then had to stand in line for ANOTHER twenty minutes to get our keys. There, I was told they had gotten too busy to call me. I was fuming. Of course they were busy. I waited in line twice for a LONG time EACH time. I knew they were busy! They, too, knew they were busy; so why tell me they will call? Why tell me to come in to find out if our unit was ready? Why not just tell me, \"Ma'am, we're sorry, but check in is at 4.\" I would have preferred that IMMEASURABLY compared to the wasted time we spent trying to get into the condo early. It wasn't just the 40 minutes spent in line, but also the three hours that we spent trying to stay close to the resort so that we would be able to go there quickly and get settled when it was available. However, when I saw the condo, I quickly calmed down, and I can honestly say that checking in was the only real frustration we had all week. About a week prior to our arrival, I had requested a pool-side room on the first floor, and that was exaclty what we got. It was newly remodeled and clean. It was exaclty what I saw in someone else's review pictures. One of the reasons we chose Summer Bay was because of the 24 hour pool, and we loved it! I was afraid we sacrificed quiet for convenience, but I was surprised how quiet it was. Even when people were swimming and being loud at 2 or 3 in the morning, we heard nothing in the bedrooms. (We were swimming with them and thought we would be disturbed by them when we went in, but happily, we couldn't even tell they were out there.) One negative thing about the pool was that it was cloudy at times. Another negative was that all guests didn't keep their long hair in ponytails, so frequently we fished stray hairs out of the water. Gross, but not that big of a deal. A better filter could have solved both problems, I think. The last negative about the pool was that the chemicals gave four out of six of us sores on the bottom of our feet. The four who spent a lot of time in the pool had places on the bottom of their toes where the skin was wearing away. Some were red, others actually bled. I can only figure the chemicals caused it. My youngest, a two year old, and I were the only ones not affected, but I assume that was because we didn't spend almost all day every day in the pool. My three older boys just put Band-Aids on the affected toes and continued to swim. Typical boys, not fazed at all. We had our car, so we loved the shaded parking spaces. When Summer Bay got more guests, we sometimes had to park farther away and in the sun, but most of the time, we were only a short distance from our door. This made taking in groceries very convenient! (Of course, the full kitchen made USING the groceries even more convenient. :) The golf cart and shuttle service looked good, but I was glad we had our car, mostly because of the kids. We didn't have our rooftop carrier on, fortunately; otherwise, we wouldn't have fit under the car port. The entrance construction detracted slightly from our stay, but we were in building 19, so we didn't see any of it from our \"pod\". The main pool is going to be spectacular when it's done. Someone in another review complained that the walk to the Strip was 20 minutes and looked like a war zone. The block (yes, only one block) was fenced off and undeveloped, but it wasn't a \"war zone\" and it took us (with four kids, one of whom was a slow-walking six year old) only 10 minutes to get to the Flamingo. We belong to a vacation club, so we knew not to expect maid service daily. What's the big deal about making your own bed on vacation? I would rather do that instead of looking at the mess and hoping the maid comes soon. (Then again, I also prefer to be able to clean as we go anyway. I love having a broom and vacuum to keep the place tidy. With four boys, lots of things fall on the floor.) We didn't really need her when she came mid-week, but it was nice to get the floors washed. The washer and dryer in the unit were wonderful, and I used them daily. Knowing these were there, I was able to pack lightly on clothes, which was nice. All things considered, we loved our stay so much that we extended it by one day (taking a three day drive and turning it into a two day drive). We probably would have extended out stay even more days, but my husband absolutely had to be at work Monday morning. Once the construction is done, it will truly be the PERFECT place to stay (if you don't want to be on the Strip). We loved it, and if we ever go back to Vegas, we will stay at Summer Bay. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Request a remodeled room. Pay the extra if you have to; it's worth it. (Vacation club or time-share owners always get the remodeled units.) 2. Request to be near the workout room if that matters to you. It's open 24 hours. It's okay for a vacation place. It's not the gym, but it's good enough. 3. Get Summer Bay's comprehensive list of things to do in Vegas. They have a list of free things to do as well as a list of \"not free\" activities. Both lists are helpful and accurate. We stayed very busy without ever stepping in a casino to gamble (we spent a lot of time walking through them, though!) 4. Go to Hoover Dam. The Generator Tour was great, and the Dam Tour was better (but kids 8 and under aren't permitted because of their size and the potential for them to fall through a few small openings). The tours are pricey, but worth it. 5. Eat as many meals at Ellis Island as you can. What they save on decor, they more than make up for in portions and taste. Their specials are delicious and ridiculously inexpensive. It's just down the street from Summer Bay (on Kovol). Don't be turned off by how seedy it looks. 6. If you have young kids, make room to pack the double stroller. Our 14 year old was able to do all the walking with no problem, but our 10 year old and 6 year old would have appreciated taking turns in the open seat of our double stroller if we had had it. As it was, only the 2 year old got a free ride in the umbrella stroller. 7. Pack dark shoes/sandals/flip-flops. The streets are filthy and our shoes quickly looked disgusting with all the walking we were doing. (Only the \"baby\" had white gym shoes when we left because he was always riding in stroller.) 8. If you don't have a car, get the three day pass to the Monorail. Between that and the shuttle you will get anywhere easily. 9. Don't waste your money on the gondola ride at the Venetian. It was short and the gondolier never stopped talking, giving tourism advice. It was much more fun to watch from the bridge.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Federal Way, WA", "Title": "\u201cDon't Let the Construction Bother You\u201d", "Author": "Fromak", "ReviewID": "UR71341261", "Content": "Stayed there for one night while on a trip through the Southwest.

The unit was one of their rental units so it did not have the upgrades that many reviewers talked about, but it was exteremely clean and very comfortable. We decided to drive to the casinos rather than take the shuttle. If you drive a couple blocks north on Koval, you can park in the Harrah's or Venetian's parking garages and have easy access to Harrah's, Venetian, Treasure Island, Mirage, and other casinos in the area.

There are complimentary shuttles that run pretty frequently and drop you off at 3 different points on the strip. I believe the stops are the Tropicana, Flamingo, and Stratosphere/Circus Circus. The shuttles were never late, and saved us a fortune on taxis! If you don't want to walk to the front of the building where the shuttles you are, you can call for a bellman, and they will take you to the front. They always came quickly when we called, sometimes only 2 or 3 minutes after we hung up the phone! There is complimentary coffee available, which we had every morning before getting on the shuttle!

I heard they are still building a sandwich shop ?and sundries-type store on the property, that will be really nice to have when completed. We spent our nights at O'Shea's and the Carnaval Bar.

The Welcome pack in your room does explain that cleaners dont come every day and only come half way through your stay. We were there for 6 days and expected the cleaner to come on the third day. Instead she came on the 4th day while we were having our lunch. She couldnt speak any english so I had to show her a pile of towels so we could have some fresh ones.

My husband and I, had flown my parents out for a 5 day trip for some gambling, golf, and lounging poolside. We were looking for a place not in a casino, that had at least 2 bedrooms and 2 baths that we could make a few meals in. My husband stumbled across Summer Bay on the internet of course. we paid $774.00 USD. We checked in on Monday and out on Saturday morning. Check-in was fairly simple. We actually were able to check in fairly early (noon), as we had to unload our stuff then go to the airport and pick up my parents. The lady helping us was nice and gave a room on the second floor. My parents are smokers, so I asked for a 1st floor room, so they wouldn't have to runup and down the stairs for a smoke. She said no problem and gave us a 1st floor room. They do hold a $100 security deposit on a credit card, which is understandable. Another guest who was checking in, didn't like the idea, and was arguing with the staff about it. Whlle walking back out from the registration desk, we were asked to participate in their time share pitch. We signed up as they offered a $100.00 gift card and show tickets, but more on that later. Our 2 bedroom place was pretty spacious. The bedrooms were on opposite ends of the \"condo\" it had a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, and stove, along with a washer and dryer. The internet ad advertised plasma tv's, but we had standard 27 inch tv's in each bedroom and one in the living room. Basic dishes and pots and pans were provided. They beds were fairly comfortable. The furniture in the living room was torn up a little. They was a small patio, with a table and plastic chairs. The outside table had a huge burn hole in the center of it. My husband took pictures of everything. No one came to the room to do a walk through with us. The \"master\" bedroom had a huge bathtub in it. 4 people could easily sit in it. but the tub had a weird color to it, they made it hard to tell if it was clean. The other bathroom was a little scarier. It was just a shower unit. The door on the shower was gross. It looked as if it was pulled from another apartment and the mold was painted over and re-hung in this bathroom. A vacuum and broom were provided in the place for clean up. I wished they would have had a swiffer wet jet or something similar. they did come in every day and refresh towels and start the dishwasher for you, if you needed it. They also did a quick clean up of the bathrooms. The pool and hot tub were a 1 minute walk away from our room. They were both very clean. Towels were provided there. It wasn't over crowded at any of the times we were there. Water was decent in the pool and hot in the hot tub. We did attend the time share presentation. The lady who was our salesperson, was from Mexico. She spoke English fairly well, but we still had trouble understanding some of her pronounciations. The presentation took about 1 and 1/2 hours. We had the opportunity to tour the new condos on the property. They were much nicer looking and had all of the ammenities shown on the website. We said no after the presentation, and only had to say no to one more sales person after our original lady. We received the $100 Visa gift card and a packet of coupons from the front desk. Here's a list of what I didn't like. Noise! The 1st morning the garbage dumpsters were picked up at 6am and it sounded as if they were right outside the window. Another morning, the workers were shoveling stones/gravel right outside our bedroom window, for what seemed like an hour. I ran the dishwasher one night after we went to bed. It was loud! I recommend turning it on, only if you aren't in the room. The hot water took forever to get hot in our shower. There were several times, that I didn't even turn the cold faucet on, because the water was luke warm. We didn't have both showers going at the same time, and we kept shower times down to a minimum. Pillows. There were 3 for each bed. But, everyone in our group is a pillow hog, and needs at least 3 per person. (we brought a couple from home). The sliding door to the patio. It seemed to weigh 1,000 pounds and took two hands to push or pull it. The screen was also torn. Luckily it seemed there weren't many bugs. Things I liked. There was a guard at the main entrance every time we came in or out of the property. The washer and dryer was really nice. They also provided soap and dryer sheets. The kitchen, we were able to have breakfast in our pajamas and take our time to get ready for the day. Grills, there are gas grills around the property. We took advantage of it and had steaks one night. It wasn't bad for the money, after seeing the new condos, obviously I would much rather have stayed in one of those.

It\u2019s obvious it was an \u201cINSIDE JOB\u201d but the security guards and Summer Bay Management were not very helpful and they didn\u2019t seem to care. The security manager did print out a log of entry times into my room and there were a lot of suspicious entry times. But the security manager didn\u2019t take it to the next level to see what was going on and didn\u2019t seem to care. The security manager also told me that a 3rd person received a key on the 2nd day of our stay. That was odd because I never went to the office after I checked-in. And when I questioned the security guy about the issuance of the 3rd key he didn\u2019t seem to care. The day after my room was broken into I set some boobie traps in the room before we went out. When we returned all the boobie traps were broken and it appeared there was someone checking our SAFE every time we exited our room. I was TERRIFIED the last 3 nights I stayed in Summer Bay. I stayed at Summer Bay as part of a military timeshare package (AFVC). Yes, I served my country for 20 years and got this great benefit to stay at Summer Bay for only $329 for an entire week.

How can you go wrong? Maybe we had the luck of the draw. Upon arrival we did see a bit of construction (messy front entrance-not appealing to some) but so what. It is just to make things better for everyone. Checked in at noon. No problem. They gave us our room # and I asked (nicely) to see a map of the property. I knew from TA that the pools were open 24 hrs so we didn't want over the pool. I asked if we could have Bldg 10, second floor and was it updated? They said yes,yes, and yes. They gave us a pass to use if we were walking in and out as the gate to property as security 24 hours. If you come in a cab they question you...which is fine by me. Just security for me. We were told Expedia, Air Canada ect get the rooms not upgraded. So we were lucky. From what I could see it wouldn't make that much difference. The layout is the same. OK, at check in they give you a layout of property, shuttle times, and tell you if you need to go from your room to front of property to call and they send down a golf car to pick you up. We didn't need this but if you have any mobility problems it would be great. Kitchen: - Walk into room...hum, awesome! Not big...not as big as I expected. But great. The usual, fridge (ice-maker), stove, over stove microwave, dishwasher, baking bowls, pot and pans, oven mitts and a starter pack...coffee ect. The beautiful glass table and chairs are a bit to big for the kitchen especially to get into the fridge. You could just push to side a bit. The fridge kept our oj, beer and ice cream just the right temp. Call for a number for wireless internet. Living Room: Open to kitchen, sofa probably a pull out but didn't check. It was comfie. Fireplace...why not, it is Vegas. They do have restrictions on when it can be turned on, time of year and so on. Maybe Nov-May, don't quote me here, forget what I read about it in the manual in living room. I must say it was one of the most detailed resort manual I have ever had in a room. SHOOT, almost forgot...Hugh flat screen, Hubbie loved it. The sound system (radio) was great. I am not very techinal but is was so clear. We often just had music playing. DVD player as well. Closet: Walk-in, quite a few hangers, place to store luggage, 4 draws, and a on the wall safe,it held my netbook and several other things. Bathroom: Toilet separate, one sink, lots of towels, toilet paper ect. once I found them, open doors under the sink...there they are. The hand soap and shampoos are VERY scented so if you have any allergies to scent...be careful. We thought the TV was big...nothing compared to the but. It was HUGH. No jets, that is ok. It is very long and very very wide. Bedroom: Big...king bed. Two night stands. Alarm clock. Two windows, nicely draped. Oh, guess what...ANOTHER big flat screen. I don't think we even turned it on. Balcony: Small but functional. We could see Harrahs, Wynn ect from it. One table, 2 chairs. I think the two bedrooms have a bigger balcony. I did see larger ones but never asked. It is a smoke free room property. You use the balcony if you smoke. Washer/Dryer: So neat. Full size in a room off your balcony. Iron and ironing board. Starter pack included. Pools: Gated entrance to pool. Right now there is 4. They are not big but do the job. Each pool has a great hot tub. Timer for the hot tub is on the wall by the bathrooms, I don't think alot of people know this. They place pools in each quarter section so you don't have far to walk. First pool we went to one day was full so went to the next pool, maybe 5minute walk. All have bathrooms and towels. You put your towel in laundry basket when you leave the pool. New towels are in a bench type seat. Grocery Shopping: Every morning at 8:30 sharp...I think every day of the week...be 10 minutes early...they take you to Vons grocery store and pick you up in 1 hrs time- sharp. Beer, wine, bread, deli, cookies, lots of ice cream, water, fruit...hours gone. Now, you could cook all your meals but we want breakfast and maybe lunch, so that is what we bought. Shuttle: To many,many places on the strip. Times and places are posted on a schedule you can put in your purse. They go to Freemont street, drop you off anf pick you up in 4hrs time. Final Note: Found the pools quiet but didn't go around them at night time. Probably forgot much...but this place has it all for us early mid 50 couple, can't wait to go back. It is a time-share property. We were asked on check-in if we would like to do the tour and be offered $100.00. We said no thank-you and never heard any more about it. This is our 3rd time to Vegas. Have never stayed on strip. We like coming back to quiet time and like a room with space, fridge, balcony and coffee pot and a great price. I couldn't find a negative...unless leaving counts.

The condo was very well laid out and extremely clean. We had a 2 BR, (both rooms had king beds & a pullout couch in LR) Walk in closets, 2 BA unit in building 21 on the 3rd floor. This building was at the far end of the resort, less than a five minute walk to the front desk or you could call the shuttle anytime to pick you up. The unit had a nice balcony, 3 TV's, DVR player, fully equipped kitchen & washer and dryer. The baths were stocked with soap, shampoo and conditioner. The kitchen had dishwashing detergent, plenty of paper towels, laundry detergent, salt & pepper and a starter pack of coffee. The maid came by mid week and replenished everything. We did not mind being on the 3rd floor but there is no elevator so ask for 1st floor if stairs are a problem. Our building had wireless service and we used out laptops and ITouch no problem. Our location had a pool very close and also an outside and inside hot tub. The pool was very clean and one thing I really liked was that it got sun all day. I have been some places where the buildings block the sun for most of the day. There were 2 grills outside the pool area and we cooked out twice. Plenty of places to sit outside. The front entrance is under construction (no work done while we were there) and doesn't look great but you only pass thru on your way in and out. Who really cares? We did do a tour and were told that the reason no work is being done is because some work was done over a water main and things have to be reconfigured before they can move forward. I would not want a room looking over the construction area but for the right price I could get past it. The tour was informative and took about 2 hours. The sales rep we had was good and did not pressure us, just asked us to listen with an open mind. They gave us a $100 visa card and Summer Bay at the desk gave us a bunch of coupons for shows, ( I think most of those deals we could have got anywhere without doing a tour) The shuttle service at the resort was excellent. The drivers were very friendly and accomodating. The shuttles ran from around 9am till midnight. We usually walked one way and took the shuttle the other way. It is less than a 10 minute walk to Harrah's, sidewalk most of the way. I reccomend not wearing heels and you will be fine, it is fairly well lit. All the staff we met were very friendly. One time we did not get picked up at our building on schedule and the golf cart driver who did pick us up, grabbed a shuttle bus and brought us to our destinantion. That is good service. The pool area was always very clean and there were plenty of towels at all times. The pool and hot tubs are open 24 hours which is great. When the work gets done here we probably won't be able to exchange, as it will be fully booked at all times. I would go back again if I had the chance. It was nice to be a short walk from the casinos and not feel pressured to gamble at all times. Being steps from a pool was a huge plus. Everything we needed was close by. We rented a car for the week but didn't really need it. We drove to Zion Canyon one day and that was spectacular. If we did not take that trip I would not have gotten a car. the shuttle service from the airport is easier than taking a shuttle to the rental area to pick up a car.

At check in I got the info packet with the instructions for the wifi, which they warn can be spotty but I had no problems. Also they give you there shuttle schedule. The shuttles take you to the strip, grocery store, and Fremont Street. I had a car, but they did have golf carts to take you to your building or to the shuttle stop if you needed one. As I said I was on the 3rd floor and they have no elevators, but it's only 3 floors. The condo was amazing! As I said I was in a 2 bedroom, but since my friends had to back out at the last minute I was in it alone. There was a LCD tv in the living room (52\"), and 1 in each bedroom (42\"). The one in the living room is over the fireplace, which since it was cold and raining I did use and it was a nice touch. Next to the fireplace was a basket with bedroom slippers for you. The kitchen was big with modern appliances. The dining room had a small table with 4 chairs around it, but also 2 extra chairs beside it. The bedrooms were big and the closets in each room were walk ins. The bathrooms had showers with the big showerheads and lots of pressure. In the master bedroom there was a big sunken tub. 4 people could probably fit. The condo also had a balcony with a table and 2 chairs. There is no smoking in the condo, but the give you an ashtray for the balcony, plus a receptacle for you butts. I had a view of the pool area from my balcony. The pool has 24 hour access, a hot tub, and shuffleboard court. On the outside of the pool was a picnic area with a big gas grill, tables and little huts for shade.

The next thing I would caution you against is that the resort pictures online look NOTHING like the actual resort. It is what the resort \"will\" look like when it is completed. Right now, hardly any pools are open and they are all tiny. There are no covered cabana-looking structures as pictured. There's an abundance of construction equipment and non-paved roads. I understand that Vegas is often under construction, but we never saw anything being worked on and we were there both on a weekend and weekdays. We were given two room keys and of course only one worked. The room was nice; however, the beds were uncomfortable and the sheets were a rough, low thread count that didn't feel pleasant on the skin. Additionally, upon check-in, we were given an inventory sheet and asked to verify the count on ALL of the linens, glasses, dishes, utensils, appliances, etc. and compare it with what housekeeping said we had. This took almost 20 minutes and we found numerous discrepencies that we probably would have been charged for if we didn't catch them right away. (When did vacation become work?)

Chunky dirt mountains as tall as a tree, exposed pipes, excavation machines, gaping holes in the ground... wow!!! There was a security station with a guard inside and he asked us what we needed and then he directed us to the check in. This place was obviously an old apartment that was in the process of being remodeled.. so the check in was like the rental office. Check in's at 4 p.m. so we waited. There was a small area in and out to wait, the bellman was willing to store our bags and there was free popcorn. Our attitudes were very skeptical and I had the feeling I had been tricked and deceived... it was boiling. All those feelings went away when we opened the door to our room. Beautiful livingroom with a flat screen tv, fireplace, dvd player, stereo.. kitchen fully upgraded with granite counters, black appliances, fully stocked with pans & dishes, dining room, separate bedroom with a flat screen, walk in closet, bathroom with a huge jacuzzi tube, separate water closet.. patio with a laundry room.. stocked with vacuum, washer & dryer, iron, laundry basket and even the Tide & Downey! It was great! There is also a spa on the premises, but I didn't get a chance to indulge. There was a shuttle that came every hour on the half hour and also a shuttle to the grocery store, outlet malls and other places of interest. The golf cart could be called to pick you up and take you to the front of the complex to catch the shuttle or to catch a cab. This resort was VERY quiet, a lot of seniors... come to think of it, we were the only younger people there and I am 30, my hubby is 40. My only few little complaints was the construction, fitness facility wasn't complete and the rental car place they refer you to are crooks. Get on line and rent from Fox.. they are the cheapest.

Be careful when you book this trip because their Internet site photos are not what the resort really looks like. When we arrived by taxi there were tractors in front of the resort, and the main pool with what was suppose to be a waterfall had a chain link fence around it. It was very hot, and the air-conditioning in the main reception area which is another condo, wasn't working properly. The taxi driver was told to put our luggage under a patio umbrella by some lawn chairs in front of the building. After we registered, there wasn't anyone around to take our luggage to our condo which was quite a distance to walk in the heat. When we finally found our condo, our key would not open the door - so we had to go back to the main (condo) which is a make-shift office, for another key that did work. It was quite a hassle. The condo was very small, but nice and clean. There were two flat screened TV's, but the one in the bedroom was too close to the bed. The air-conditioning in the condo would not shut off and ran the entire night. It was very noisy. In the morning, I called the front desk and was told someone would take a look at it. After another night of little sleep because of the loud air-conditioner, I was assured that someone would take a look at it that day. When we returned in the evening, a message said the conditioner was fine. Since it continued to run, we turned it off and opened the patio door for air in the late evening when it cooled down. The grounds were torn up. We went for a swim in the only pool that was open and there were two patio umbrellas to provide shade which were unfortunately taken. We complained that there wasn't any shampoo or coffee in our condo. We were told they would bring some --------------- they never did. My friend and I got really disgusted with the noise, lack of shade at the only pool that was open, and the construction. We were so unhappy we left after only staying 3 nights. We checked into Harrahs and were much happier with their facilities. This was a major disappointment. Perhaps when the \"resort\" is completed it will be nicer.

(Maintenance came to fix our microwave 10 minutes after calling\u2014even though it was about 1 AM!). Our two BR unit was nicely furnished and looked recently renovated. I\u2019d rate it a 9 out of 10. Grounds nicely manacured and floral. An hourly shuttle service takes you to various locations on the strip or you can simply walk to the nearest Hotel (Harrah's) in about 12 minutes. Golf carts will shoosh you around the resort if you call, but it was small enough to walk in. It was certainly quiet if that's what you came to LV for. Cons. No curb appeal at all. The front area is a construction eyesore of half chewed demolished buildings and dusty pavement (but oddly, there was not much actual construction activity while we were there). The \u2018resort\u2019 is actually a recently converted residential condo cluster of some 600 units. We\u2019re told that the resort had been across the street but was bought and demolished by a nearby big hotel and SB took over and renovated these residential condos. Thus, sitting between this new resort and the strip is one LONG block of desolate no-man\u2019s-land: fenced in dust and debris, some employee parking, scrub weeds. Big plans for development we\u2019re told, but no construction as of yet. (The economy?) We walked to the strip day and night (Harrah\u2019s) numerous times, feeling no unease, but when it\u2019s 107 degrees and an ugly nothing, you might want to wait for the shuttle--if it's going where you want at that time--plan well. There is no gym, no club house, no spa, no consistently functioning internet, and no welcome activities. They do their best to back fill (in-room spa treatments, for example), but it\u2019s simply an apartment you\u2019re getting--not a resort. Lacking a finished office area, all the check-in and other resort services are handled in converted guest rooms\u2014cramped and un-inviting. The shuttle goes to different spots at different times and is often too small for the number of passengers. There is only one shuttle per day to Von\u2019s supermarket. The three pleasant pools/hot tubs are nestled among groups of condo buildings but are small and un-interesting (but were uncrowded). Remember, these were apartment pools, not luxurious hotel or resort pools. (But their proximity and fences would be ideal for families with young children.) The construction sign says \u201cGold Crown Rating\u201d (an RCI standard of excellence) but it is not. A Summer Bay internal \u201cCrown Club\u201d is in the making, which will allow SB owners to get into the other 9 or so SB properties (Missouri, Tennessee, Florida\u2026) Bottom line: If you can snag a 2-BR $249 RCI last-minute RCI special here it\u2019s a comfortable, if a bit out of the way, place to nest for the Las Vegas strip experience. Shuttles (common everywhere in LV) make up somewhat for the heat and distance. If you\u2019re spending many hundreds, however, look at discount packages at strip hotels. The older properties start at $39/nite. You\u2019ll only get a cheap room, but you\u2019ll be in the thick of the action. In 2010 there should be some relief from the dust and lack of facilities.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201ca good place for a relaxing vacation (only a few inconveniences)\u201d", "Author": "lnj4boogie", "ReviewID": "UR38482695", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at summer bay August 10-16, 2009. I had been to Vegas the previous Nov, and was switched to Tahiti Village because the Summer Bay grounds weren't done, so I was interested to see the renovations. We got there late the night of the 10th,taking the $12 round trip shuttle from the airport (dont take a cab folks not worth it). Check itnwas uneventful, except it was at check in that they told us the internet was out and wasn't expected to be turned back on until the 14th. It was at this point we signed up for the shuttle to the grocery store at 8:00am the next morning. We were in room 13204. Beautiful apartment, huge tub,king size bed two flat screens and all of the kitchen utensils you need including blender, toaster, microwave, full stove with oven, full washer dryer, broom, vaccum, dishwashing liquid, washing powder, paper towels. We took the shuttle to the strip. Keep in mind the shuttle runs every half hour but to diferent hotels on the strip. The strip is close enough to walk to but I'd suggest only doing so in the day time. A cab to the mandalay bay cost us about $17 (far south of the strip) to Harrahs it cost $5) day 2 got up took shuttle to grocery and brought a ridiculous amount of food. We were back to the apartment by 10. day 2&3 we didn't leave the grounds, but sat by the pool which is equipped with shower, and towels, so no need to bring one from your hotel room. the pool is minimally shaded but nice and goes to about 6 feet deep. There is a little putting green attached to the pool and they played some nice reggae music.... if it wasn't for all the sand I would have thought I was in the carribbean. Cleaning crew comes in on your 3rd day of stay to refresh your linens and apartment. day 4 our toaster broke and we were promplty brought a working one.the ac cut out, called a maintenance guy and he fixed it within the hour. Our tv went out for about an hour and there was still no internet. day 5 we took the 11:00 am free shuttle to the outlets came back about 3 (4 hours) we passed on the massuse to come to our room and opted to get a massage at the Imperial Palace. day 6 we left the flat (sadly saying goodbye) one of the grounds crew took us to the front with luggage and all. So all in all then place has a few kinks (construction, no club house or gym built yet, internet and TV going out because of construction) but I'd highly recommend it if your looking for a home like relaxing environment in Vegas.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "moomoonz", "ReviewID": "UR38130262", "Content": "Very cheap, great staff, tidy and attractive room.

My husband and I booked on Expedia and paid about $100 a night including taxes. This is a fantastic deal! They do NOT charge for overnight parking, they do NOT charge the standard LV resort fee or any other rip off fees that you WILL encounter at the other resorts. But if you do book through Expedia... make sure you call Expedia for the local resort phone number. The number provided on the Expedia website and confirmation is a corporate number and if you don't call during office hours you are not able to reach anyone. ;) We called ahead to inform them of our late check in and were pleased with their welcoming customer service. We were happy to be greeted by the 24 hour guard at the gate and directed to the check in rooms. At this point they have 2 rooms set up for check in as their main reception/clubhouse area is under construction. We were greeted several times by the friendly staff and check in was simple. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom unit as the 1 bedrooms were full. We were also given a helpful welcome packet that contained maps and information that we found useful during our stay. The resort itself is an apartment complex. The units are large enough to live in! Our unit had 2 bedrooms (both with TV's), 2 bathrooms, a large walk in closet, a decent size living room area (with another TV), a dinning area with table seating for 6, a full kitchen (dishes, blender, microwave, full refrig. ect), a laundry room (washer, dryer, iron, full ironing board, and detergent) and a nice size balcony with a table and chairs. My husband loved the giant bathtub as it was big enough for 2. I loved their mango soap, lotion and shampoo. It's perfect for an extended stay, 2 couples and/or a family with children. I was told that most of the units are time share units and others are reserved for Expedia, Hotwire and other Internet bookings. Our room has decent standard decor and was clean. We noticed that the time share rooms were the posh rooms. They had modern decor and flat screen TV's. So when looking at the pictures... you can expect the less attractive rooms. We were only slightly disappointed. The grounds are well maintained and quiet. We spent time at the pool closest to our room. The pools are not overcrowded like every other LV pool I've been to. I believe that 4 of the 5 pools were open so there were options. The main pool looks beautiful but was not open due to the clubhouse construction. We were told that they plan to complete construction by October. They do not have food on site but offer a free shuttle to the grocery store and many other LV locations. We drove so we just went out and bought our own food and drinks to stock the kitchen. There are also many nice restaurants near by. They do offer a room service menu which I assume is delivery from somewhere near by. We were not interested. The resort location is a short walk from the strip. From the resort we walked about 1 city block on a road between 2 vacant lots. From there you are in a parking garage area with access to the strip. Or from the parking garage you can grab the metro rail for $5 a trip or $13 day pass. We did NOT want to stay on the strip. We did NOT want to walk through a casino every time we left the hotel or returned. We did NOT want to be surrounded by noise, lights and drunk people all the time. Summer Bay was our Oasis. My husband and I have been to Vegas more times than we can count. This was by far the most relaxing and enjoyable trip. For the first time ever we actually look forward to our next Vegas stay. I assure you that we book at Summer Bay for our next trip.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cA real Las Vegas winner !\u201d", "Author": "BargainBuyer", "ReviewID": "UR35754476", "Content": "This was probably one of the nicest time share resorts we have been to. Our one bedroom unit was lovely and clean and newly renovated. It was a little smaller than some of the units we had been in, but was perfect for two adults and a small family. I think it would be a tight fit for four adults. The resort is only a few miles from the airport and is easy to locate. You may hear planes flying overhead occasionally. That would probably be true at almost any location on or near the strip as the airport is so close. Arriving at the gated resort, a security guard checked our name on a list and directed us to the office. The \u201cfront desk\u201d is a small, crowded (and warm the day we were there) room that was filled with people when we arrived. (The front desk is to be moved to a different location once construction is complete.) We had to wait on line in the hall. The line moved at a reasonable pace. When our turn came, the attendant was pleasant and professional. When I asked for a room in a quiet location away from the construction areas, he offered me three choices and pointed them out on a map of the large facility. We chose a unit away from potential noise of the (open 24 hours) pool. Our one bedroom unit was on the second floor of building 2 which turned out to be a very convenient location. We had absolutely no problem with construction noise, or with sounds from the units above and below us. After check-in we had to proceed across the hall to receive our parking pass and \u201cwelcome gift.\u201d We were politely asked if we would like to attend a time share sales presentation and we said no. Our welcome gift was actually pretty nice, containing granola bars and health and beauty aid samples. There was ample parking available in front of the units. We dragged our bags up the stairs (NOTE: the buildings range up to three floors and none have elevators). The front door opened into a living room on the left and a kitchen on the right. The living room featured a 50 inch flat screen tv across from a sleeper couch. There was a cocktail table and end table with a lamp. All of the rooms were nicely furnished with plants and paintings and decorative mirrors and dark (cherry or mahogany) wooden furniture. A large entertainment unit with a DVD player inside and a stereo unit on top with iPod dock was adjacent to the tv. There was also a fireplace with a granite border which matched the granite in the kitchen and bathroom. It also had a large ceiling fan. To the left of the living room was a small outdoor patio with table and two chairs. A door off the patio led to a utility room which contained a full sized washer and dryer with samples of detergent and dryer sheets. It also had a full size vacuum, laundry basket, broom and dustpan in case you really feel the need to clean. The kitchen had a ceramic tile floor and a large wooden table with 4 chairs. The table was too big for the small area given to it. You could not open the refrigerator door without constantly moving a chair out of the way. We ended up re-locating two chairs to the living room to give us more room in the kitchen area. The granite counter top held a full size 12 cup coffeemaker, blender, toaster and can opener. A basket held complementary samples of coffee, tea and cocoa. Modern wood cabinets with brushed nickel handles contained all silverware, plates service for 4, wine glasses, bowls,water pitcher, knife block, teapot,pots and pans, etc. Appliances included a refrigerator with ice maker, gas oven, and a large microwave. There was plenty of storage area in kitchen. An archway directly opposite the front door led to a very large (5 foot by 6 foot) walk in closet. The bedroom was to the left and the bathroom was to the right. The closet contained numerous built in drawers and two areas to hang clothing. Ours came with 16 hangars, some of which could not be removed from the pole. We wished we had brought a few extra hangars from home. A large built in safe was on one wall. You could close the doors and hide the closet from direct view. The bedroom contained a king bed and two night tables with lamps and a 42\u201d flat screen tv and not much else. Unfortunately this room did not have a ceiling fan, which we would have liked. More than once we felt it was too cool in the living room area and too warm in the bedroom. Perhaps a fan could have equalized the temperatures. The bathroom contained a large Roman tub with an excellent shower and the water pressure and temperatures were great. Curiously, the tub was not a jacuzzi tub ? The sink had granite countertop, modern faucets and a nearby hair dryer attached to the wall. Large sized samples (2.5 to 3 oz) of mango scented shampoo/conditioner, lotion and soaps were provided. The bathroom could have used more storage. There was little space for your towels as well as bathroom necessities unless you stored most of it in the cabinet under the sink. The toilet was in a separate room which could have easily held a storage unit for towels. Wireless internet service was available in the room. We had to log on with a password given to us at check in. We were instructed to call each day for a new password, but the same one worked all week for us. There was a telephone with ethernet data port in both the living and bedroom. We had housekeeping service once during the week, which is typical for time share rentals. When we called for additional towels and pillows they were delivered to us within 10 minutes. The pool area we viewed also had a hot tub and outdoor showers. We did not use any of the pool facilities. We felt the location of the resort was ideal for us. It was mid-strip, one (long) block away from the action of Las Vegas Boulevard. Not sure I would walk too late at night as the resort is across from a large deserted lot that is undergoing construction. It would be fine, although somewhat of a hike, to walk during the day. There were no restaurants or shopping in the immediate area. The closest food we found was at the Ellis Island casino down the road. Highly recommend the $6.99 steak special (not on the menu \u2013 just ask the server for it) which included a salad, 10 oz. steak, choice of potato, veggies and a 12 ounce beer! (or root beer). Service can be iffy, there was a short wait when we arrived and this place won't win any decorating awards, so be prepared. However, the food was great and you can't beat the price. The BBQ restaurant is also supposed to be very good and cheap, however, we did not eat there. The resort provided routine bus service throughout the day to the strip hotels. We did not use the bus, as we had a rental car. It was very easy to get around; we generally self or valet-parked at a hotel and walked from there. There is ample free parking at all of the casinos and the valet only costs the price of a small tip. One thing we really valued from the resort was the map of Las Vegas we received at check-in. It was better than any of the other maps we saw in guidebooks or online. We used it often as a reference, especially when we drove to visit casinos off the strip. Were there any negatives? Well, we really wanted someplace to put those bathroom towels. And a door separating the bathroom from the hall leading to the bedroom would have been nice. It seems like many of the condos do not put in a bathroom door for some reason. (There was a door separating the toilet inside the bathroom.) When we first got to our room, we had a question for the front desk. We called and the phone rang and rang and then disconnected itself. We tried a few times with the same results. Eventually we called the concierge who took a message and we later got a callback. We experienced the same problem a few days later. I mentioned it when we checked out and hopefully this issue has been resolved. Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a great resort, and we cannot wait to return again in the future!", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "gak128", "ReviewID": "UR35291450", "Content": "Summer Bay is still under partial construction.

Transportation was provided to many stops on the Strip and to Fremont Street. Also a daily run to a local grocery store.

This likely relates to the Old SummerBay location and has nothing to do with the new complex that is on Koval, between Flamingo Rd and Sands. It will be interesting for me to check back from time to time and watch this place climb in popularity. I suspect as it hits the top 10, the super deals are going to disappear. This place was great. We stayed in Building 2, on the 2nd floor, overlooking the 24 hour pool. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, Kitchen, Dining Room, Laundry Room, 3 TV's, 2 x Walk in closets, soaker tub, Shower, security safe, Balcony, etc. We ordered in food some nights to save money and cooked breakfast every morning. We had bloody mary's on our balcony, while watching our teenagers swimming in the pool. We rented a car from Enterprise, which is located about a 1/4 of a mile away at the Westin Hotel and they picked us up at the Summerbay to do the paperwork. We drove to VON's Grocery which is about 2 miles away on Sands, and loaded up with everything we needed for our stay. Because we had a car, we never used the Shuttle Service (To downtown, To the Strip, To the Grocery Store) but we talked to other guests and they said the schedules were maintained. It was also nice to park our car within 20 feet from our front door. At every other place in Vegas we have stayed, our car is 5 to 15 minutes away. We drove out to Red-Rock for a scenic drive and picnic, and it was such a pleasure to drive right up to our room, and be in the pools, 90 seconds after getting home. The waterfall pool by Building #1 and the front gate was still being worked on during our stay, but this did not affect us in the building we stayed in. When we checked in, I asked for a pool view room, and we were accomodated. Other guests wanted to be on the other side of the buidling, away from the pool, for privacy and quiet. Personal preferences are accomodated. I originally requested ground floor, but those were all were taken, so we got the 2nd floor instead. In my opinion, the 2nd floor is what you might want. Ground floor units have airconditioners, right outside their patio wall. If you sat outside, the airconditioner would be humming about 9 inches from where you are sitting. The 3rd floor would involve two sets of stairs to get to/from your car/pool. 2nd floor was best for us. We liked the fact the pools in the complex were available 24 hours. They have a gate system, where guests need to know the keycode. There are noise restrictions after 10 PM. Most other pools in vegas close at sunset or10:00PM, and it was sure nice to have our first dip the night we arrived, and after we returned from the evening shows we attended. Its location is fairly central, basically a vegas block away from the back door of Imperial Palace/Harrahs. Too far to walk in the summer heat however, and would not be a nice walk at nighttime, as would be too dark/dangerious. Cabs, Shuttles and Rental Cars would be required when staying here. Cab rides would be cheap because you are on Koval and not the strip.

Stayed in 2Brm that we booked through Bookit.com. Would definitely stay at this location again but there are a few things you should know to manage expectations properly: The Good - Location, location, location - short walk to strip (either Harrah's or Venetian) through rear entrance along road under monorail. If you take major streets instead of back entrance its a 30-45 min walk! The shuttle service was great but I don't like to be tied to a schedule. Friendly staff, not crowded relative to the Strip hotels. A quiet little oasis. Pools clean, lots of towels and never overly busy. BBQ's outside by pools also a nice touch. The Bad-Booking through Bookit.com (or Expedia) you get a rental suite which has not been renovated to same standards as the timeshare units. All pics on the web show the timeshare units. The rental units are clean and adequate (about a Best Western Standard) as opposed to timeshare units (which I toured) which are Westin standard. There is still construction going on so main pool closed (which is the nicest) but still four other pools open but they are relatively small. For us, it was a real downer that the fitness center was closed for renovation. The good outweighed the bad and I would definitely stay again. But thought this review might be helpful to others so you manage expectations and don't get surprised upon arrival. You might even try 'For rent by Owner' websites to see if you can get a timeshare unit. If they are priced competitively to what you can book the rental unit they are a definite upgrade. Other suggestions: Be wary of the map provided, the distances are huge and generally not walkable (except for the rear entrance short-cut mentioned above) Skip the Fashion Show Mall and go straight to the Premium Outlets - great selection and prices. Try the Timeshare pitch if the gift is attractive to you (eg discount show tickets). Relatively low pressure relative to other timeshare pitches (eg. Mexico) and did learn something about the resort. Helicopter tour was great - we went with Mavericks booked through the concierge. At first I was reluctant as Mavericks was more expensive than others I found on the web thinking the concierge got a commission. But after researching found that mavericks uses only the new Eco choppers which are faster (get to see more) and better for viewing especially those in back seat. More importantly, Mavericks flys out of McCarran which is only 10 mins from Summerbay. The cheaper tour operators fly from Boulder City which is at least 30 mins by shuttle bus.

The shuttles made our stay very enjoyable as it would have cost us lots to use the transit for that length of time. The shuttles were on time, not like other timeshare shuttes that I heard about. The renovated units were all that one needs for a pleasant stay in Vegas. The pools are small and well used. We had a room on the back side, not facing the pool, I believe it could be noisy if you were facing the pool as they are open 24 hours a day so far. The property is very large but they have small carts that will pick you up and deliver you after you have been to the strip or grocery shopping. Not once were we approached by timeshare sales people. The staff is friendly but under a bit of stress right now with construction and a few unhappy customers. I believe this is going to be a great place to stay in the future and even at this moment we had no complaints. The free internet was also appreciated.

They will even load your luggage to a golf cart and take you to you room. On Friday's & Sunday's they have a BBQ in the parking lot near the front desk, very yummy and reasonable prices. We stayed in a one bedroom unit with a full kitchen. The kitchen was equipped with granite counter tops, tile floor, great appliances and a four person dining table. The living room has a pull out couch, 52\" flat screen tv, fire place, dvd player, and a stereo with ipod docking station. The patio was nice and also included a separate laundry room with a washer and dryer. Our bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed and another 52\" flat screen tv, and a large walk in closet with safe. The bathroom also had tile flooring and granite sink, a very large shower tub (you could probably fit 6 people in it), and a separate toilet room. We enjoyed the pool and hot tube closest to our unit a couple of times. They provide pool towels, so no need to pack any. It was very relaxing and not crowded. Keep in mind there are also public gas grills on the property if you'd like to grill out. The shuttle is very convenient we used it everyday. Keep in mind you have to sign-up for some of the shuttle trips. Check the schedule for details. Monday morning we took the shuttle to the grocery store. Tuesday-Friday we took the shuttle to various locations on the strip and fremont st. We recommend taking the day trip to the grand canyon provided by Adventure Photo Tours. They pick you up at summer bay and bring you back that evening. It's an all day trip but it is worth it, believe me, a once in a life time experience. We also recommend the restaurant Bahama Breeze, which is a short cab ride from the resort. They have a great menu and reasonable prices.

The resort is nice and its location is great. It's in the heart of the strip area. The one block from the strip is like 4 normal blocks. It has all the amenities of being at home. We had to remind ourselves we were in Las Vegas. HOWEVER: One day our BMW was parked most of the day until early evening when we decided to go out. When we entered the vehicle, the side mirror on the drivers side was totally cracked. Two things: 1. Earlier in the day we noticed a man throwing a baseball with his small son...can't say he did it. 2. MAJOR construction going on. Looks like a stone hit it. We reported it with security and photos were taken from one young security female who also said she witnessed the man with baseball. At check out we met with her manager and he stated that he feels they are not responsible for the mirror, but would take it up with his superior. I recieved a letter today and they said that they are not responsible and for us to report it to our insurance company. They made us feel like we did it somewhere else and trying to pull some fraud stuff. Mind you, we purchased while we were there and gave a down payment because we really liked the resort. There are no signs that says park at your own risk because of major construction going on. I felt our car should have been safe there or I could of parked somewhere else for that matter. I am so upset because they are making me feel like we did it on our own and trying to put the blame on them which is so not true. We are going to fix our car reguardless, however it happened on their property and its the principle of it. We could of bought other timeshares there that were offered to us but we chose them because we like the resort, so what are we going to get out of blaming them for something like that. So in the end beware of where you park your car because they are not responsible for any damages even though there is alot of construction going on.

(dont forget to tip) The shuttle system was great, we only walked to the strip a few times and it isnt a bad walk at all. also other hotels like Harrahs and Rio send shuttles to summer bay, so you have plenty of option. The shuttles stop by 12am, so if your seeing a late show or partying, expect to get a cab, usually about $10 with tip. Every 4 bldgs have their own pool, so it was never crowded. in fact we only used it at night and 1 out of 6 nights their was another couple out there. Huge pool, indoor and outdoor hot tub. Stainless steel grills right outside of the pool and some tiki huts with tables, very cute and gives a nice tropical feel. We had a blast, I'm just sad its over.

I don't believe they are all renovated yet so you should request a renovated unit. We did and had no difficulty. There are three levels in each building but there are no elevators - this is impt. to know for people with mobility issues. Main points: - The grouds are lovely. Some work is ongoing. - Our renovated unit was beautiful. As nice as any 5-star hotel room. However, you also have the added convenience of a fully equipped kitchen if you want to cook. We also used the barbecue outside. - There is a balcony for each unit. - The air conditioning unit worked beautifully. I was confused about getting it to work my first night there and called for help. A maintenance guy showed up within 5 minutes. - The staff were all very friendly. - There are golf-type carts that will drive you around the resort - to and from the main entrance. You can book these to pick you up but we were offered rides all the time when we were walking. - There is a shuttle to the grocery store (Von's) every morning. You have to book this the day before. - There are regular shuttles to the outlet center and Fremont Street which you also have to book. - There are regular shuttles to the street which you do not have to book. - Free wireless Internet in the rooms. - Ample parking if you have your own vehicle. This resort is only a 10 minute walk to the Strip and, yet, feels like a complete getaway from the pace of the Strip when you've had enough.

Both bedrooms featured very comfortable King-size beds and 42-inch flatscreen TVs, and the living area featured a pull-out couch (we never pulled it out, and thus cannot comment on its comfort) and a comfy chair to sit in and watch the even bigger flatscreen TV. There was a DVD player and a stereo system with iPod docking place (I don't have an iPod, so I'm not sure what it's called, but if you have an iPod, you know what I mean). Our porch had a nice little table and some chairs which we sat in to enjoy our first lunch there. The dining area had a nice glass table with chandelier and 6 chairs, and the kitchen was well stocked with utensils, bowls, mixing bowls, a blender, dishwasher, microwave, gas oven, and full-sized fridge/freezer. They even had dish detergent for the dishwasher as well as a small Palmolive for whatever you wanted to wash by hand. The laundry room featured a full-sized washer and dryer and they even had little sample packs of laundry detergent and fabric softening sheets (which they refilled mid-week and upon request). The wireless internet worked without a hitch and I'd go so far as to say that it was more reliable than my home service, sadly. We made ample use of the pool and spa -- the pools are heated and the whirlpool was toasty -- I felt like a happy lobster drinking my beer by the whirlpool. The staff was very friendly, a maintenance worker saw us getting out of our car, asked if we needed anything, then told us to please tell someone if something went wrong, so that they could fix it, \"We don't know until you tell us,\" he said. Location-wise it is amazing. With my infant son in a stroller, it still took only 10-15 minutes to walk to the strip (Harrah's, Bill's, Bally's are closest) and they have a shuttle that leaves hourly to the strip as well if you're not in a walking mood. We rented a car so that we could easily get to the Grand Canyon, shopping, etc., but it wasn't a \"must\" to have a car. They have shuttles to Fremont Street as well as to a grocery store (Von's). And if you're on the strip somewhere a shuttle doesn't go, a cab cost us $11 from Luxor, and $9 from Bally's. I guess some of the previous reviewers had a bad time, but it must be the \"OLD\" Summer Bay.

Room was not ready at check in time and was told that we would be told when it was, we waited an hour and still no one had been to see us so enquired at desk and was told that it was now indeed ready. On the first night after just arriving the toilet would not flush and maintanece had to completly remove the toilet and re fit te greese ring (nice way to spend ur first night in vegas) Location is okay 10 minutes from strip but will involve walking down some fairly un-friendly looking streets, we found the best way was to go througth the Imperial palace car park anbd through the casino floor. Pools are nice but are not heated and in Sep even in vegas they where to cold to use. The other problem was the shuttle service the hotel puts on to the supermarket which is a 45 minutes walk away. There where no places avalible and they only run one a day. The shuttle service itself to the strip and Freedmont is a nice touch and helps with transport if you dont have a car but remember to book well in advance (24hr) While there we did have a sneek peek in the newely refurbished units and these are beautiful with leather arm chairs, gas fires, beautiful kitchens etc. Althought are stay was not great I would deffintly come again in the future if i was guranteed one of the new units.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Allis, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWhere's the HOT water???\u201d", "Author": "mjours", "ReviewID": "UR23202502", "Content": "This was supposed to be a highly rated resort and I do NOT completely agree.

I was willing to trade for the const noise but the mgr was not real hepful in trading rooms. There is very little soundproofing, well none, in the rooms. We had a \"Gold Crown time share\" unit. So this was 100% remodeled with expensive furnishings. It was comparable to a high end time share (Westin, Marriott) The rooms are large and the 2 BR has THREE hi def plasma TVs. All very nice. The unit Diver stayed in was a \"rental' unit. They have Wi-Fi AND ethernet so bring a LAN cable and plug it into the phone. Both work well 5 stars! There's plenty of security, the resort is gated and the officers, maint, maids were nice and helpful. There are 2 nice pools with several more coming. There were 11 pool chairs so some guests were lying on towels on the cement. Lots of shuttle buses to take you here and there. what's missing is strong middle and upper mgmt. Things are still chaotic from the big move and the front desk staff and mgmt is a little stressed out from all the complaints. A lot of little details are missed, we didn't get a room til late in the day and didn't get a phone call when it was ready There is no soap dish in the shower. where do you put soap, shampoo, toiletries etc...on the shower flloor. there are a lot of seniors here, DO NOT expect a ground floor unit, a guest in a wheel chair was on the 2nd flr!. no ADA units but i saw some railings in rooms under const. Not GREEN friendly which is par for Vegas. The pilot lite on the fireplace runs 24/7 and was noisy. The mgr wouldn't turn it off. No recycling, mgr said they leave the lites on for incoming guests (mine were off) etc. I'll give it 4 stars for the furnishings and what I think it will be but for the next few months, expect a lot of little issues and noise and not much help about it.", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key Largo FL", "Title": "\u201cSummer Good, Summer Bad: Right Now Summer Bay is Mediocre\u201d", "Author": "DiverDiver", "ReviewID": "UR21324956", "Content": "I'm sure that this resort will be ovely when all the construction and re-hab is completed.

The grounds were also in the process of being renovated and were mostly bare dirt pock marked by empty containers and holes waiting for new plants and shrubberies. The unit itself was pretty nice, although it was in the middle of a renovation as well: the furniture, paint, decor and fireplace were nice. Nice Laundry room with new W/D. However the kitchen abd baths were very dated: The kitchen cabinets were old and smelly, the formica counters were badly worn, the refrigerator had no light, the garbage disposal did not work, ratty little sink with no sprayer. Baths were spacious, with new tile floors, but the older cultured marble sinks were cracked. The bedroom had no drapes, only mini blinds, which allowed the blinding spotlight across the way to shine in practically full force. We were unable to sleep the first night because it was SO bright. We purchased a vinyl table cloth to drape across it to block the light at night. Maid service once a week. Not bad for a time share, but we checked in on Sunday, and got maid service on Tuesday. So the rest of the 5 days with no service. It seems that it could have been spaced a little more in the middle of the week. Any organized activities were nil.

Ok! Another 90 minute timeshare presentation. We arrived on Friday morning, checked in right away went to our room, the last building next to the Italian Restaurant & the Liquor store. I wasn't feeling all that safe to be right there, because usually I am in the middle somewhere with other people around me. I am also with my 12 year old daughter & my sister. We drop off our luggage open some curtains & tons of moths flying from everyone. Once those were shewed out we head to Bally's to start our adventure for the day. We come back to the room later that evening. My daughter wanted to go swimming so we went to the pool by the Club House area, the pool was not heated, deflated pool toys, the hot-tub was cold, and moths flying everywhere. It was gross! We then headed back to our room for the night, started showers and there were dead bugs in the window sill, the water coming out from the shower head was low. Everyone finished their showers and headed to bed. We were gone all day saturday, came in late, took showers and packed for our departure the next day. My sister was putting stuff away in here suitcase on the bed & opened the curtains only to find that there was a coachroach laying dead on the dirty disgusting carpet. I find this out on the last day of being there for 3 days total. I was so sick I could not get out the that room fast enough. I took the coachroach to the front desk when I checked out & asked for a refund of my $10 a night upgrade to the larger room. The woman at the front desk said \"oh my thats not good\", needed to get help from anohter person for the refund. That woman came up and said \"oh that's just a grasshopper\". I dont know what country she is from but grasshoppers and cockroaches do NOT look alike. Needless to say I will never stay at this resort or \"hell hole\" ever again, and not even at the new place.

The kitchen was fully stocked with supplies, very roomy with seperate rooms for living area and dining area, huge bed that was so comfortable, and a refrig and micro...great for leftovers. Staff came in and cleaned daily (not sure why other people didn't have theirs) bed was made everyday and toiletries refreshed. For all those that are complaining, go ahead and spend $200 plus on a single room with no kitchen at the strip hotels...leave these places for people that really appreciate comfort and convience.

We never got any maid service except we we called to request the towels to be replaced. - TV remote did not work - Windows had no screen - the only locks were the little metal clips you screw on and off.

If you are expecting a true Las Vegas resort, you will be very disappointed this a no frills place to stay and I agree with previous reviewers that the term \"resort' is misleading. This timeshare facility is a former Ramada Inn, trying to become a resort and while they are continuing to upgrade the property they do have a long way to go to rival a true resort. There is 24-hour security roaming the property and we never felt unsafe. Don't use the monorail, spend the money and get a car, the money you will spend on the monrorail is no more then what you would spend for a car and the facility is right behind Harrah's and the traffic is not bad. You can use the valet at all the hotels for $1-2 tip and not have to walk all over town in the heat! The 1 bedroom came fully equipped with a full kitchen, nice leather furniture and a very comfortable bed. There are no real frills, the pools are not heated and can be a little cold in the mornings, but with the heat of the day they do warm up. The grocery store is not far from the facility and I would recommend going to Albertson's instead of Von's. Get a players card at Harrah's and the Mirage/MGM and you pretty much have all the \"strip\" hotels covered. Go to Paris for the buffet it is wonderful and the hotel is great. The buffets at Harrah's and the Mirage are also wonderful. Try the Nine Fine Irishman at New York, New York it is a great pub with great food. If you want a really nice night out on the town go to the Veneitian to one of their restaurants, I recommend Emeri's it is outstanding.

I booked Summer Bay for 4 nights early April 2006 before I had read Trip Advisor reviews. The price was good compared to the strip hotels that were playing how much can we get away with charging for a room. I deliberately avoided weekends but for some reason other Vegas hotel prices went through the roof when we were visiting, however Summer Bay prices remained good value. From some of the feedback I considered cancelling my booking but decided to gamble that it would be OK. I needed two bedrooms and Summer bay offers suites. The accomodation was certainly spacious and quite well equipped. From the outside it resembles a 70's motel, inside it was dated but there were no complaints about cleanliness. Our suite was set in a small gated courtyard with no pool, just some sun loungers and scruffy grass, there was also a bbq. A pool was available in the next building but it wasn't heated and far too cold to use. We did not get accomodation in the \"renovated\" section. This was evident from the faults we found - including a faulty shower delivering scalding water to the feet and cold from the shower head and kitchen cabinets that wouldn't stay shut - both hazardous. The sink in one bathroom was painted over and the taps had parts missing. The ground floor windows slid open and had weak screw on catches - there were no bars on most windows and this did not seem at all secure. Some of the problems got fixed, the maintenance staff were helpful but why do guests have to write problem lists for the hotel? The guy that fixed the shower said it was the fifth he done that week. The front desk staff weren't very cheerful, when we checked out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay and we mentioned the problems we had experienced but no interest was shown. The location isn't brilliant. You can walk through the back entrance of Hurrahs to the strip but only after walking along the service road, past all the rubbish and across a road with no sidewalk and clearly not intended for pedestrians. When we were there, the next door property was a huge building site which will go on all through 2006 at least. To sum up, Summer bay was good value for the accomodation offered but suffering from neglect. Without any problems it would have been OK. Possibly it's too dated to really make anything worth the money it would need spending on it.

I use the term \"rennovated\" very loosely - they've basically painted them and a few have had some landscaping done - as for the rest - a paint job is about the best you can hope for. The rooms smell, the furniture is run down and stained badly - parking is relegated to a back alley next to boarded up buildings and large trash bins for some of the units - and you're guaranteed a boarded up building view.

We did have one in the masterbedroom but I didn't think that was fair for the other couple. The bedrooms consisted of one king bed and one queen bed in the other room.

Check-in was very friendly and we were given two weeks in the same apartment, not in the main building but a short distance across the road. Building 24 was in a very nice area near the monorail and the Imperial Palace as well as having roads both infront and behind. Although we thought this could be potential noisey it really wasn't. Although some generator noise from the Imperial bothered us occasionally we did not have any problems sleeping. I expect buildings 23, 22 which were further away to be better noise wise. The location could not have been better for us, all we did was exit through the back gate and walk up the road along side the Hilton and Flamingo (5 mins) and we were on the strip opposite Caesar's Palace, etc. The apartment was obviously recently refurbished and each large bedroom had a very comfortable king sized bed. It was far far better than the hotel room in the Luxor that my wife stayed in and much better value. Really the apartment could not be faulted and the air con was extremely efficient and easy to use. Check out the photos in review (Sep 19, 2005) as their apartment looked the same as ours. The apartment was beautifully tidy and clean and odor free when we arrived and new towels were provided on the Thursday after we arrived. We expected as we were staying there an additional week that house keeping would change the bed linen at the end of the first week but they disappointingly did not. They were also very reluctant to help in any way other than to provide new towels and did not empty bins in bedrooms when they should have. We were on the ground floor which meant we had access to an enclosed area with table, chairs and loungers for sunbathing. Being in Vegas with so much to do we only used this area a little but enjoyed it each time. Some of the other buildings in this row have their own swimming pools. We had a huge spa bath, seriously huge! and made use of it a lot at night to relax in and there seemed an endless supply of hot water. Despite taking over half an hour to fill the bath we never ran out of hot water. The resort do a complimentary continental breakfast on Monday morning between 9am-10am at which you can get muffins, doughnuts and bagels, etc. This we appreciated although you are recommended to get there early. They aslo provide free daily papers in the 'activities' room. I cannot commend the free shuttle and drivers highly enough and for 6 days a week at 8.20am it will take you to Von's grocery store. Remember to pick up a Von's reward card before you start shopping there. It saved us about $40 on our shopping. The shuttle also takes you to some of the popular hotels on the strip and near downtown also, a real boon. There is a convenience store very near by, but compared to Von's Grocery very expensive. The shuttle also takes you to Ellis Island which many locals go to for the excellent (homely) cuisine and cheap prices. It does entrees on Thursdays for 99c, a deal that cannot be beaten, other nights meals are from $4.95. Had we known this sooner we could have saved ourselves a lot of money by going a lot more often. We enjoyed eating at the Cheesecake Factory and also at the Stage Deli who must do some of the best deserts in Vegas. Both of these are in Caesar's Shop Forum. The shuttle makes several stops within the property to pick people up and some areas definitely look a little dodgy with some abandoned buildings boarded up. These abandoned buildings did not belong to Summer Bay. Wet walked back from Ellis Island (10-15 mins) at night and we were quite safe. Other than the shuttle and taxis there are 3 transport methods; the monorail (fastest and most expensive at $5 a trip but very convenient), the Vegas Trolley Bus (slowest but it does take you to the Las Vegas Outlet Mall), and the Deuce which travels up and down the strip for $2 (adult) and $1 (children) - slower than the monorail but faster than the Trolley. If you want to see a Vegas show, try going first to some of the half price ticket places. We did this three times and were never disappointed and of course saved ourselves hundreds of dollars.

Our 1-bedroom suite bore no resemblence. The acres of property, multiple pools and suites mentioned are really a conglomeration of various neighboring 1960's 2 and 3-story court motels that have been bought up and painted the same color. There are a few buildings mixed in that have not been scooped up yet by the hotel - some are vacant, some boarded up, and a few seem to be serving as cheap apartments. Our suite was a perfectly ordinary 1-bedroom motel room with kitchen. It was clean, with a decent tropical-pastel paint job and newer motel-grade furnishings. The carpet was laid over an uneven floor however, and obviously they are not too serious about keeping the rooms truly \"non-smoking\" - they just spray the room with Febreze or whatever.

We just decided to kick our way into our room instead of bothering staff again. When we got the door open the first night, oh goodness the smell that others write about is definitely correct. It was an old, moldy smell, (I had to clean and disinfect the entire space. I could not sit or sleep there until we found the Walgreens and I brought a can of Lysol, Comet cleanser and Clorox Bleach) has old scratchy furniture, no central air just a big lunky, chunky old 1970 a/c units (who uses these anymore?)

We stayed in Unit 512, and did not have a single complaint. We arrived before 2:00 p.m., and were able to check in early. Unit 512 was directly across the street from the office. It was a two-bedroom unit that was very clean and nicely furnished. There wasn't a single bug problem or mismatched furniture, and no bars on the windows!! We also had a deadbolt lock by properly using the door handle, and the instructions were posted right on the door! Our unit was directly beneath the monorail, but we never one time heard it. Actually, we rode the monorail frequently, and it was an excellent mode of transportation up and down the strip. Even standing next to the monorail upon it arriving, it was virtually noise-free. We really enjoyed the casino at Imperial Palace, which was a very short walk. In fact, all we had to do was walk out the back of our gated unit, and we were already in Imperial Palace's garage.

He stated that he had changed us to a renovated room before handing us key cards to room 363 in like building 5. I don't know what he was thinking but the room was in a horrible unrenovated state and had a rancid odor. We were prepared to move my mother to the Venetian suite with us but my husband noticed that the rooms in the buildings closest to the lobby were in much better conditon than those in the buildings further away.

My husband and I were interested in information about the RCI Points System, so we attended their timeshare presentation. The reward were tickets to a magic show at the Greek Isles. The tickets and show were not worth the time. The Greek Isles is a very run down place. If you attend the presentation, I would take their option for a show at the Sahara instead. The sales presentation was not high pressure, however. Two things that we did during the week that were really oustanding were going to the show, KA at the MGM. It is pricey, but worth it. Also, we spent a day at the Valley of Fire State Park and the red rocks were just incredible. The park is an easy drive to get to, and worth a visit on your own, or taking a tour if you don't have a car.", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Desert Club Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d1164660-Reviews-Desert_Club_Resort-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$79 - $189*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3950 Koval Lane</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> (Formerly Summer Bay Resorts Las Vegas Desert Club)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1164660", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e5/84/e58448c5aae17d618cddefcdedc08ef21large.jpg"}}
