It was very close to central park and times square not to mention in a safe area. now where do I begin with my bad review.. First of all the people in the front desk on the first floor are very unfriendly when u go in to the check in the office is a dump. The elevators are pretty old then just when u think the worst is over you walk into your room and find the windows don't close, there is a very bad smell in the sheets the restroom is small and dirty, no cable, the towels are so rough and tiny as if they were meant for children, u never see an employee so good luck getting new towels or room service.

I'll start with the pros first, the list is shorter but honest: This an apartment suite with basic essentials. Two girlfriends and I shared a bedroom bachelor room with a pull-out sofa. It has a simple kitchen with all the Ikea dishware and utensils. Simple hot stove with microwave and working mini-fridge. I was impressed with how clean the bathroom was. There is decent closet as well for your coats and shoes. Plenty of clean sheets/materials and drawers for yoru clothes. Everything is clean enough and it's perfect when you're on a budget vacation. It is right by one of the subway stations on the upper west side. Location is perfect to get to anywhere you need. I love this location because it is right by central park and this area is clean, convenient and quiet. We personally wanted to stay around from the busiest parts of nyc and we didnt mind a bit of travel. Taxis are always available around this area including plenty of places to eat. Anything you need or want you must ask for yourself or go to the main office directly on the second floor. The front door/foyer is wonderful and it's a nice small place to hang out if needed. Now, for some reason, our room had a difficult heater/ac. Perhaps the previous tenants messed it up or it has not be looked at in a while. A repair man did come up to our room to try & fix it but he said it would not be an easy fix. Other rooms were filled so we just HAD to deal with it for the rest of our trip. Luckily, we were outside throughout our entire trip and the ac still worked. the only problem was that it was noisy and the earplugs didnt help with the sleep. They usually have enough essentials and they are usually quite polite and respectful. It's only their services that need work. Any little thing you need, whether it's toilet paper or towels, you must go to them directly. anything we asked for we had to ask twice, especially if it was over the phone. would i come back? Not to this particular place. I would look somewhere else a bit cheaper or with better services. This is not a hotel so i had no big expectations.

I was embarrassed I was hosting my friend's first trip to NYC! my gosh. The subway was right outside our door feel the shake, and Central Park we could walk to, but it was a very dark lit street at night, and the staff changed shifts so much, no one knew that we were actually guests. No security to speak of, anyone could have just walked in. It was not that cheap either, I have since found other hotels that are much better. They have gone through a bit of a reno, when we were there there was drilling and scaffolding all up the front of the building and stairs. They could have given us something for inconvienace, but they Really did not seem to care or even speak English. Not even a smile, and it seemed if you had a question at the desk, they were eating something and ignored you. Not impressed. The lobby decor was also hiddeous, even my unwordly friend laughed at it.

It shows blatant disregard of the apartment's functionality, upkeep, and even potentially, resident safety: * The tub filled up with putrid water and did not drain after use. In addition, there appeared to be no overflow cap at the rear of the tub, instead an unfinished and unattractive and vacant hole was present. * The towel bar in the full bath appeared to have been broken off - the cleats were present, but no bar. * The door to the bedroom nearest the front door was held on by only one of three sets of hinges. The other two sets of hinges were hanging loose and no longer attached to the door jam. * The toilet seat in the half bath was cracked completely through. One person in our party received a painful pinch and was actually bruised when she sat on it, because her weight caused the gap in the wood to open, which then closed on her skin when she shifted her weight! * Exposed electrical wires were dangling beneath the cabinetry at three different locations in the kitchen where under-counter lighting should have been or perhaps was intended for future installation. In two out of three instances the wires were capped, but the third had none. I am hopeful that these were not \"live\" wires, but I was not about to touch them to find out! * Instead of an overhead light in the bedroom closest to the front door, there was a hole and more exposed and capped wires where a ceiling light should have been or perhaps once was. * The apartment had areas of significant wear and tear beyond that which would be considered acceptable for an accommodation of this price. Paint was flaking off in large areas around pull areas of closet doors. Numerous scuff marks were present in every room and the place appeared to be in great need of fresh paint. * The closet that contained the heating/cooling machinery was in a closet in a bedroom and not only was unlocked/accessible, but had the remnants of where a latch/lock formerly had been but had fallen or been broken off. The accommodations were so unacceptable that we had to leave after 1 night because they did not even satisfy our very basic needs (i.e., functional shower), and furthermore the entire process usurped at least 4 hours of our first morning in NYC as we negotiated with staff and looked for last-minute accommodation elsewhere. Disastrous! Insult to injury - they still charged us the full rate for our 1 nite stay AND are adding an additional cancellation fee equivalent to a 2nd nite stay (over $1200 total!).

Our accommodations were handled by \u2018woogo\u2019 (www.woogo.com) through Priceline. I hope no one else has to experience what we did at the hands of Woogo. Please, stay away from this company! Here is the timeline and experience: It will tell our side of the story, which woogo.com Carlos and their account manager already know. I can\u2019t believe this has taken so long to correct. April 9th, Priceline.com reserves us an apartment in New York City; the booking states: \u201cThe apartment will have a key for the front door for independent access to the building for the rest of the stay\u201d. We book it. When we arrive and buzz, the young lady at the buzzer says \u201cyou won\u2019t need a key; we\u2019ll buzz you in remotely.\u201d She assured us that this service was available 24/7, so although we didn\u2019t like it, we didn\u2019t have a choice. Trouble began the second night. Sometime after midnight we returned after having seen \u201cMemphis\u201d on Broadway (by the way: great show). Unfortunately, we had no idea what was in store for us upon our return. We pressed the now familiar buzzer\u2026 but nobody was there. Maybe the person was napping, we thought. And we buzzed again... and again... and again\u2026 Next we called the contact number my wife had stored in her phone: 212-616-8497. Verizon told us the number was not in service. Uh oh... On the wall of the foyer was \u201cin emergency call \u2026the building super.\u201d Of course, he did not pick up. But his phone had a recording which said, leave your number. So I did. Eventually he called back, but said that he was in Brooklyn and wasn\u2019t going to come up to the upper west side to let in a couple of tourists. His responsibility was to the building, not the renting agent. But he did give us good advice: buzz every apartment in the place, and somebody might let you in. Sure enough, after buzzing the people who live there, and pleading with one woman who actually answered the intercom, someone let us into the building. The apartment itself had a keypad entry, so we were in. The next morning, we tried both the buzzer and the 212-616-8497 number, just to see what had happened the night before. Was their 24/7 pledge really a \u201cget home by midnight or else\u201d rule? No answer on the buzzer, and the phone was still disconnected. Apparently it just didn\u2019t work. Call to Priceline: we need a place to stay! They tried reaching woogo.com also, but the phone was just as disconnected for Priceline as it was for us. They found us a new place, but because we were at the mercy of the market on a big vacation week, we paid about double for a replacement hotel room. Priceline said they\u2019d work out the details with woogo.com. We\u2019re still waiting for this to happen. So here we are a month later, and woogo.com has charged us for three nights, when they only let us in for one night. When I call I get left on hold. When I spoke to the reservations manager, he promised a call back but never did; my return call the next day to the account manager resulted in a 15 minute on hold, before I finally understood the hint and bailed out. They all give the same tired line \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, let me put you on hold to discuss with the next guy in line\u201d. For Priceline: if you can\u2019t screen out shady operators like woogo.com, why should we ever place our trust in you again? Anyone else, if you see a reservation handled by woogo.com, run -don\u2019t walk- away. They\u2019re scammers; incompetent at managing hospitality, and dishonest once they have your money.

In addition, the credit card statement confirmed more than one unauthorized charges from Woogo. I reserved a One Bedroom apartment at their Central Park property at 240 West 73rd St, New York, NY and arrived there at 2 p.m. The front desk lady pulled up the reservation and told us that we could not check in till 3 pm. The reservation confirmation email stated that the check-in times are between 2 and 3 p.m. She allowed our group to keep the luggage at the front desk and come back any time before 10 p.m. to get the room key. We came back before 9 p.m. and were told us that there was a \u201cSituation\u201d with our room and handed us $10 cash for a cab and directed us to Central Park House property, room X, located about 10 blocks away. I confirmed if that was a joke and was told they were serious. Ok, if that was the case and the room was not available even though it was reserved and the credit card balance was confirmed, I was so na\u00efve to believe that going to the new location due to their \u201cSituation\u201d could end the nightmare that was just starting. They even confirmed that there would be someone to let us in at the new location. Upon arrival at the Central Park House (not to be confused with Central Park, which we were initially at) there was not only no one there to let us in (the intercom system was not working properly), but the apartment X was locked and we had no key. I\u2019ve contacted Central Park person and the reservation office. They both were assuring that they are trying to get things resolved. It was already after 10 p.m. Our group was sitting on the steps in front of the locked apartment door thinking that the dirty steps cannot be the place we have to spend our NY vacation night after we paid for the One Bedroom reservation. The late-night Woogo \u201cPhone Resolution Team\u201d kept giving us the non-working access codes to Room X. Finally, one of the codes worked and the door opened\u2026.there was someone else in the room. Who knew what could have happened next, but gladly, no one noticed what happened. We were now horrified to death. The night Woogo \u201cPhone Resolution Team\u201d then told us that Room X was not the right room, we were suppose to be entering Room XX, same building. The access codes did not work again, as usual. Following about 40 minutes of such fun, we were told to come back to Central Park property and pick up the key for a room that was ready. I was also told that I will get 15% off for the entire bill. We have to drag ourselves and the luggage back to Central Park and discover that the room/apartment that so magically appeared in the middle of the night was as twice as smaller as the original room that was reserved. Plus, \u201cwhat 15% discount are you talking about\u201d? Forget the discount that was promised, we were glad to have a place to sleep that night.

The real clincher was the \"mini-bar\" itself: a price list tacked on the outside advertised $3.00 per bottle and there were 9 bottles inside (no booze, which was fine for me as I don't have to drink).

Great location. Not a hotel. Comfortable small apartments in NYC. This is not a hotel, it is a group of (sparsely) furnished apartments that rent like a hotel, daily, weekly, etc. The building also has permanent residential apartments, so you ride the elevator with tourists and locals together. As long as you go in with these limitations in mind, it's a great value. I grew up in the neighborhood, and this place is in a great location, as advertised. I liked having my own little Upper West Side apartment in a pre-war building (pre-WW2, that is, highly coveted in NYC). I have a 2-year old, and there is a great playground nearby on 76th in Riverside Park. Fairway is around the corner on Broadway, one of NYC's best supermarkets, and Trader Joe's is coming soon to 72nd & B'way. The price is great for the space you get and for the location. However, you do get what you pay for, and there are some shady practices when dealing with this company. Be sure to read all of the fine print before booking, don't overlook the detalls like I did. the bill kept going up and up with each new \"service fee\". What started as $660 turned into $820 after all the so-called fees. 1. I booked the room through booking.com. Woogo then charged $120 service fee for this! Maybe I missed the fine print, but this is outrageous! 2. When I checked in, they charged a 2.5% fee for paying with a credit card. Say what? It came to be more than $20. \"oh, but you're welcome to avoid the fee by paying in cash.\" right, like I'm going to be travelling with a huge wad of bills, come on now. 3. Who exactly are you renting from? Not Woogo. Not Tempo New York (the actual property). Your credit card is actually charged to Caribbean Sunset Resort, based in Jamaica (the island nation, not the neighborhood in Queens). Nowhere in the booking process is this made apparent. AND, my creidt card company just charged me an international service charge because they are based overseas, even though the card was swiped in NYC! Who are these people? The lady at the hotel's front desk explained it to me this way: Woogo is like Expedia or Travelocity, they are just a booking agency. She would not tell me who Caribbean Sunset is. 4. I called 3 times during the week before to confirm a crib for my baby. When we arrived on a Sat. night after a long day of travel, no crib! They had given it to someone else. Big Problem. After a few frantic phone calls, a friend bailed us out with a crib. I complained, and the next day they went out and bought another crib for us. A nice gesture, but too late. 5.

The price was very inexpensive for such a large apartment (since you're not paying for all the extra hotel services) and the Upper West Side area is great. There are very few tourists around so you really get a feel for what it's like to be a New Yorker. The location is very convenient, the red 1,2,3 line subway station is less than a block away. That subway line will take you to Midtown/Times Square in about 10 minutes so the major attractions are easy to get to. A cab ride from Penn station cost us less than $20. There is a very large grocery store about 2 blocks away and there are nice shops all over, such as a North Face store that is down the street. The numerous nearby restaurants will suit almost any taste. Also, Central Park is just two blocks over. I stayed here in May with three adult family members while we were on vacation in NY for four nights. We liked the idea of having a two bedroom apartment as opposed to 2 separate hotel rooms. The sofa bed allowed us to split up and so that two of us could essentially have our own room. The two bedroom apartment was spacious considering it was New York and had two baths and a kitchen. There was an air condioner/heater unit in the master bedroom and one in the kitchen/living room area, but the second bedroom didn't have one. The kitchen had modern appliances with a full size fridge, microwave, stove, and oven along with silverware, pots and pans, utensils, cups, etc. Any food for cooking could be purchased at the nearby grocery store. There was a TV with cable but the remote didn't seem to work. The apartment had Ikea furniture but everything was only a couple of years old and it was comfortable enough but not luxurious. Since I am not picky when it comes to beds, I found the sofa bed tolerable and got a decent night's sleep, others may hate it. The sofa had a bunch of nasty looking stains on it but everything else was clean. They had enough towels, sheets, and pillows for 6 people since that is the capacity of the 2 bedroom. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the soap and shampoo are from a large hotel chain but I don't think that's a big deal. The only things that I would've liked in the apartment was a hairdryer and iron and ironing board. Since it was a fairly short stay and my family and I clean up after ourselves well, we had no issues with not having a maid clean our room every night. I didn't use the wireless internet since cost extra, there was no problem finding free wifi elsewhere in the city. Since this is just a serviced apartment building, the customer service is lacking so don't expect much. For example, if you need to print something, they'll just tell you to go to FedEx/Kinkos which is around the block. Also, the reception desk has no one there after around 10 pm but there is an attendant at the front door 24/7. We had to check out at 5am so we just turned our key in to the front door attendant since the reception desk wasn't open yet. The only major issue we had with the apartment was that the top pane of one of the bedroom windows wouldn't stay shut. We didn't feel secure with the window open all the time and it let all the hot summer air in. The maintenance man fixed it within a couple of hours but kept it shut using a couple of screws which seemed kind of dangerous since it was heavy pane of glass. He came back the next day with the manager to see what else could be done about it so they'll probably get it replaced or something. Overall, we had a satisfactory stay. We enjoyed having such a relatively large apartment to stay in and the location was amazing. Since the price was so affordable, we didn't mind that the place didn't have many common hotel services and were willing to look past its issues.

Not so! My spouse and I, plus a teenaged son, stayed in this apartment for 4 nights and days, in the \"Executive Suite\" which indicates it accommodates 3 people. NOTE: IT DOES NOT. The sofa is a two-seater, so you can't sleep on it without using the pull-out sleeper function. The mattress was torn (not to mention stained) with rusty springs sticking out of the fabric that would likely cut you on the legs and thighs. Although he'd had a tetanus shot recently, our son still could not sleep on it without getting pricked or poked by errant wires whenever he moved. Fortunately our son had brought his small sleeping bag--the hardwood floor was preferable to sleeping on that dangerous not to mention disgusting mattress. As everyone pointed out, this is not a hotel so no one should expect concierge service or cleaning for a short stay unless you pay extra. You are renting this due to the location. That said, while the linens smelled clean, they had blood and other unidentifiable stains on them. It can't cost that much to refresh them at Goodwill, right? They already bought the cheapest Ikea furniture available so why not some non-scary linens and pillows? We were only in the apartment for breakfast and sleeping, so the location is the best reason to rent this place. It is so convenient and you just cannot beat the price for the neighborhood. Thus, I am giving this a thumbs up but be forewarned--it only works for two adults who sleep in one bed, unless you have a small child who could sleep on the love-seat sized couch cushion.

First of all this is not a hotel. Imagine living in a building with a doorman, that's how it is. (there are actually long term residents) It's a great location. I stayed at a studio apartment with a separate kitchen & bathroom. The bed is pretty big & comfortable. The sheets, the pillows, the comforter were clean and smelled nice. There was enough towels for two & extra sheets. There is a couch, huge tv, stereo, alarm clock, good size closet. The kitchen is pretty comfy with a table and 2 chairs. Everything was CLEAN, the kitchen, the tub, the toilet. The fridge is small. (the supermarket is 1 block away on 74th street, you can just go & buy fresh food everyday, you don't have to stock.) Yes just like someone said in one of his/her reviews they have some other hotel chain's daily care products (I think it was holiday inn), but I figured they bought leftovers from the manufacturer for less price. I don't think it's such a big deal, I never use any of the hotel daily care products anyways. They put $100 hold on your credit card in case you damage something. The day you check out, If you would like to leave your bags at the reception, you have to pay $5 per bag. (I kinda negotiated gave 2 luggages & one carry-on for $10) There was no hairdryer. (I bought one from Duane Reade on 72nd street for $19) didn't really ask them for a hairdryer, so \u0131 do not know if they have it. (if they have, I bet they'd charge you for that as well.) There was a vacuum cleaner & iron. The heater made this horrible sound every nite at certain times, it was as if someone was knocking on the window. Kinda scary but because it wasn't ongoing all nite and I was very tired, I slept through it. (but it's a major issue in the old ny apartments I guess, I remember when I was living in Soho, my heater did make same kinda noise) BUT IT WAS A QUIET ROOM. (there was no outside noise, no cars honking, alarms or sirens) Perfect for people who is not going to spend time in their room, there was no view in my room, the 2 windows both faced a wall, and the kitchen window faced other apartments. (but don't take me wrong it's not claustrophobic. There is no business center; they can't even print out one page but there is a kinkos on 72nd street. There is no free internet, you have to buy it online by using your credit card, it was $10 for 24hrs. Its right on the corner of 73rd and Broadway. By the main subway 72nd street subway station (1-2-3 Lines) There is a huge supermarket (Fairway) on 73rd & Broadway, Duane Reade & Kinkos on 72nd & Broadway. Couple blocks from central park (if you are visiting in the spring, summer or fall, perfect place to walk & run to the park.) There is a Barnes & Noble on 69th & Broadway and a huge movie theatre with Imax. There is shopping as well, you can go to colombus circle or take the train directly to Macy's (34th) or Century 21 (Chambers Street) without transferring to any other line.

At 4 AM the next morning, two men entered the apartment using keys and turned on the lights. Seems they saw our children sleeping on the floor, cursed, then ran out of the apartment. This was followed by a security guard knocking on our door looking for someone who apparently worked in the building. We suspect it was the aftermath of the building staff holiday party. In the morning we spoke with both the WooGo staff and the building security about the incident and all claimed ignorance of the event. Of course, the security guard visit to our room was not logged in any report. We have yet to receive any follow-up. Then that evening through the next day, the building was without hot water or heat - too bad considering NYC had a blizzard with a foot of snow. Topping it off, we were awoken at 7AM Sunday morning with a phone call from the building staff asking if we had water in our apartment as the apartment underneath had water dripping through the ceiling.

I happened upon the WooGo Midtown location so I booked online. Since I didn't get a confirming email I called the company and was told I didn't have a reservation in the system. The very nice woman who took my call offered to contact her boss to see if she could give me the Central Park Penthouse for the same price of the one bedroom I though I had already booked. She took my name and number and promised to call me back. In less than 20 minutes she called me back and booked the penthouse apartment for me. I started to read some of the prior reviews and was a little concerned that maybe I made a mistake since several reviews were unfavorable. I gained some comfort when I read a recent review which suggested maybe the building was under new management. When I arrived at the apartment building I was pleased with the warmth in the greetings from the staff and even the residents. Two lovely young women were working the check in desk and they were very sweet and helpful. As we went in and out of the apartment building to go shopping, to restaurants and the like, everyone was so friendly, from small children to other couples; everyone was especially nice and inviting. It seemed like each of the security personnel knew we were in the building since they smiled at us in every passing just like they knew us well. We really felt welcomed. What some of the other reviewers didn't notice is that this apartment building is the home to so many really NICE PEOPLE and the staff does a fine job in making you feel welcome. We even got a recommendation from one of the young ladies on staff and she directed us to an amazing cafe were we had a terrific brunch. The room we had was exactly what we wanted. The sitting area was ample and the terrace was spectacular. It was like having our own apartment on the UWS. The kitchen area is small and so is the bathroom but this is typical for Manhattan. The location is nearly perfect. We went shopping for fruit, cheese, wine and other snacks at nearby markets. We walked to trendy and well know restuarants. It was a great experience.

We were a party of three adults so booked a one bedroomed apartment. When we arrived it was between nine and ten in the evening. There was no bed linen supplied for the sofa bed. I went downstairs to request some and was told \"come back tomorrow - it's not my problem\" by the woogo employee responsible for checking people in and out. Eventually, when I refused to leave the lobby without bedlinen he got the message. How he thought we could sleep with no bed linen is beyond me. He was rude, unhelpful - and it was a simple request - can we please have some sheets and some duvets/slumberdowns for the sofabed. The sofabed mattress was thin and not comfortable, i.e. springs and bars stick into you, we ended up sleeping on the floor on sofa cushions because it was so uncomfortable. The bedroom had no door - when we enquired why there was no door, we were told that \"it ws designed that way\". The door frame had hinges still attached, so that seems unlikely. The bedroom with no door was right next to the kitchenette, so a door would have been nice. My husband found a cockroach but these are common in NYC. Noise - unbelievable noise every second morning at around 5am. This was caused by rubbish collection, our apartment was right at the front of the building so we dreaded the early morning wake up call. We requested several times to be moved, finally one nice member of staff offered to move us, but this was after five days and nights of requesting it. We were there for a week - when we requested that our apartment be cleaned we were told it would have to wait a day. That is a joke - they don't tell you they need two days notice to clean the apartment. Left luggage on checking out - they charge you five dollars a bag that you want to leave . We only stayed in Woogo because our other apartment booking fell through. I would NOT recommend woogo. Go to NY for a shorter period and stay in a hotel.

I didn't need much attention from the hotel staff, because you will not get any. As long as I had a bed and clean room that was all I needed. NYC is very expensive and trust me when I say that you should save your money for site seeing rather than a hotel room. The rooms are very sparce, but you didn't come to NY to spend your day at a hotel. Remember that NYC itself is old; buildings are old, surroundings are old, but that is what NYC is all about.

On trying to shave, discovered the plug in the sink didn't work, likewise, when my wife decided to have a bath. The toilet kept refilling endlessly, which was quite noisy. And none of the doors seemed to shut properly. Also there were no curtains, just some inadequate blinds, so we were awake at about 5:30 every morning, except when we blocked the light out with towels and cushions, and then we overslept. And now the good points, yes there are some. Good shower, clean apartment, except for some soap scum where the shower met the bath, and the top of one blind, which was filthy. And the kettle and toaster worked. All in all, I suppose the main appliances were fine, the air con, and the shower, I can live without a plug. Oh, and there was some noise from other apartments, particularly above us, where they seemed to be dragging the furniture around at regular intervals.

The hotel itself is in an apartment building so you share the place with people who actually live there. Nothing wrong with that coz when you get in your room, you can pretend that you live in New York City! It has a little kitchen complete with pots, pans, kitchen utensils, plates etc. The room was clean and surprisingly quiet. We had a two- bedroom and both rooms are big enough. The bathroom is on the compact side but it's big enough to give you room to move around it. Just one hitch: bring your own towels. I think the towels provided were so old I just couldn't get myself to use them. Otherwise, everything was clean and usable. We didn't have a good view from our window, but that' okay. We didn't plan on staying all day in the hotel room. 2. The location was perfect. Although it's on the Upper West Side, it's only a few steps away from the nearest subway station which will take you downtown. Walk two blocks east and you'll find another subway station near Central park-- or stay in Central Park. 3. It's an apartment hotel, so there is no turn-down service or in-room dining like in a regular hotel. That's fine for me. I did need help from the door man to hail me a cab, and he was helpful and friendly enough to do that. The girl at the front desk was helpful enough.

The floor has some marks on it that you could assume were from some time ago not been cleaned properly, same as in the room so, better not to be shoeless. Noise was a bad point too. Some guests were having a dog into their room so they left it alone on it and it keeped barking, if you are sensible to noise, take your ear plugs to have some rest because you'll be listening ambulances and fire cars all the time.

Half a block from the subway, lots of restaurants, quite perfect for a family. But expect some problems. The service is definitely 'take it or leave it'. They really don't care very much what problem you have. They get your money in advance and you will never ever get any of it back. One of the little surprises was that the price you get quoted is a 'cash' price. Once you read the fine print you'll see they'll stick you with another 2.5% to use a credit card. Our room was reasonably clean although once there, they will only clean it for you if you stay more than a week and request it. We only saw cockroaches once thank goodness. Most things functioned and all the pots, plates, etc. were present. The TV cable converter was not functioning so we got only a couple local stations -- trust me the clerks are not interested in fixing it. If you need any extra pillows, sheets etc. expect to ask many times until they finally arrive. It may be a $350/night room but service is definitely not included. You'll need to buy everything because no cleaning soap is supplied, or coffee filters, or salt, pepper... The rooms are reasonably quiet except when someone is talking in the hallway. We had a slightly deranged lady next door that seemed to be always angry at someone and often yelled in the hallway. We made sure we left quietly so as not to face her ire!

After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, I was positively scared of going BUT it was fine. As other reviews say, there is no point coming here if what you really want is a swank hotel ( you'll just have to fork out a whole load more cash for that). WooGo provide an appartment, not a serviced hotel room, and there is no point gnashing your teeth about the lack of towel changes - just take extra with you. The appartments are not huge, but New Yorkers live in flats this size, and for us it was fine as we were out most of the time. The kids had the bedroom, we slept on the sofa bed ( which was fiendishly uncomfortabe) and there was enough space for our stuff. It was a litte grubby round the edges, but adequate, and I 've stayed in lots of far worse accommodation. The biggest drawback was the lack of air-conditioning, and the apartment seemed to have a curious ability to attact heat. This could be a reason not to stay here, but after weeks of torrential rain and low temperatures at home in London, I quite enjoyed it. We saw no bugs or roaches, but then we took our rubbish to the communal bins frequently. The location is fantastic: there's a subway station on the corner of the street, there are great shops and delis nearby ( the Fairway supermarket was worth the trip to New York on its own), it's an easy walk to Central Park and the neighbourhood is busy but not frenetic and feels safe. The staff are the desk don't fall over themselves to help you, but are civil and respond to polite enquiries. When the cable TV stopped working, we reported it and it was fixed when we came home. The phone in the room only works if you buy a phone card, but the staff will tell you this if you ask. WooGo Central Park is not luxury, but it suited our needs very well.

Trust me, as a poor married college student, I understand that everyone is looking to get the absolute best deal possible when traveling--especially to expensive places like New York. So it makes sense to try and book the place that's only $195 a night, instead of say, the Marriot at $350 a night...But, if you want to save the money and stay at the WooGo apartments there are two things you must understand first!! 1. THESE ARE TEMPORARY APARTMENTS!!! This is not the suite at the Westin Times Square, this is a low-key, low-maintenence facility that is for people who do not care about having their rooms cleaned everyday (because they won't be!!), or care about the frills of a nice hotel (because there are none!!). Think of it more like a slightly nicer hostel/ your friend's apartment instead of a full-service hotel, and you'll start to get the idea... 2. The people that are working the front desk are your average, gruff, immigrant New Yorkers who are expecting you to understand the \"no service\" policy they adhere to--which is why you'll be met with a certain indifference when you come down wondering why your room wasn't cleaned today... Now, as for some of the other reviews listed here which cite the roaches and dirty rooms...I can't speak to any of that. During our week-long stay, we encountered no roaches or other rodents in our (tiny) room. Our \"broken\" airconditioner was fixed within 15 minutes with the flick of a switch--turns out someone had just tripped the breaker--, and when we arrived, our room was (moderately) clean, with no foreign odors or stains (including the sheets). Desk people were, gruff but not unkind. (Hey \"it's Noo Yawk\", right?) Maybe the WooGo is just a hit-or-miss proposition, I don't know...But, I will say that I'm sure you'll have a better time of it if you go in with the right expectations...err, low expecations. Bottom line--if you just want to save the money, and don't plan on spending a lot of time in your room, this might be a good option for you. If you're traveling with a large party, or with kids, spend the money and stay at the Marriot--you'll certainly get no mint on your pillow at the WooGo!", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSurprised .... and somewhat pleasantly\u201d", "Author": "Shugasong", "ReviewID": "UR7433274", "Content": "After reading all the reviews, I warned my sister and my pregnant friend about the reviews I saw here.

We decided we would grin and bear it, we were not planning on spending much time in our rooms and surely it couldn't be that bad? We were right to do so.... the apartment was brilliant.

You are renting a room for your stay and the guys at Woogo do not have to provide you with towels, toiletries and other extras you would expect to find in a hotel. We checked in at 1pm and was told our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm, the guy on reception locked our cases away and we killed time until the room was ready ( I was still very nervous at this stage at what state our room was going to be in) Anyway, 3pm we returned and were given our keys and collected our cases. With baited breath we opened our door for room 205 and were pleasantly suprised. The room was a good size, double bed, mini kitchen, sofa bed and quite modern furniture with a TV and stereo, looking out onto a quiet street (well quiet for New york!) The bathroom was clean, no cockroaches to be seen (no need to use the cockroach traps I had packed then!) the bedding did appear to have been slept in, there were a few stray hairs in it, however we had been left some clean sheets so we quickly changed them and everything was fine.

The staff were lovely, and kept our bags safe on the last day when we had to leave so we could have a final wonder of this great city! I would definely advise going, I can't wait untill I can go again! Ps.

I must warn you now that this is only because it is located in New York City. The scam that is Woogo is apparently a worldwide phenomenon that has plagued the western world for some time. I was not the person to book the accommodation for my New York holiday that I had been anxious about for the final two years of high school. I had seen one review of Woogo Apartments, and I was not impressed. But as I finally had an opportunity to go to New York, USA. I would brush it off my shoulder as I would stay almost anywhere to get to New York. We arrived and upon seeing the sites of the Manhattan skyline pass me by on the windows of the taxi. However to be dropped off at our destination of Woogo Apartments Lincoln Center was soon to crush my hopes for the adventure that would be to stay in New York City. Upon hauling the luggage of my mother, sister and my own all by myself up the stoop entrance of the apartments of Woogo only to view the \u2018doorman\u2019 talking on his cell phone to one of his buddies, whilst failing to recognize that guests are trying to get into the apartment. We were told by front desk, that we had been transferred to the Woogo apartments on 72nd West. We had no way of hailing a taxi at 11pm to take us to 72nd, so we settled for walking with all our luggage, in the dark, at night. Upon arrival to the apartments of 72nd West, we were to open and haul all our luggage inside on our own once again. This would become a common practice. To cut to the chase now \u2013 Woogo lacks any management. There were difficulties in getting into a room for the night in the freezing cold, as the front desk \u2018management\u2019 didn\u2019t realize that we were due to arrive that night. The room was a one bedroom suite. It was the smallest one bedroom apartment I had ever seen. I tolerated it, just so that I would still enjoy my holiday in New York. We had insufficient bedding, one mug between the three of us that we would have go and buy some plastic cups for ourselves for four days before getting two glasses. There was one role of toilet role and NO CLEANING done in the apartment for our entire stay! \u2018Management\u2019 informed us that cleaners would come once every 7 days, but after 16 days, they had not set foot in our apartment! We became fed up when the toilet overflowed and I had to use my ONLY bath towel to mop up the mess, leaving me with no spare towel and no possible way to get one. The next morning we collected up all our bedding and our three towels and dumped it in their lobby and told them to deal with it! The next day, we received the exact same bedding and towels back in our apartment, I didn\u2019t believe that they could have possibly been cleaned, but mealy dried! This vulgar and disgraceful behavior on Woogo\u2019s part was enough for us to pack our bags and move out. While we were preparing our gear to change to a brownstone apartment on 88th West, at 7:30pm cleaners barged in to clean our room \u2013 disgraceful. To disturb guests at night, in their room with three cleaners who failed to clean sufficiently or replace the missing toilet roll! We left the apartment and moved to a brownstone uptown which was a heaven compared to the gluten scum of the deplorable and scandalous management that was Woogo apartments! We were scheduled to stay in Woogo for 6 more night after leaving. My mother had put in writing of all the faults and mismanaged aspects of woogo, to woogo almost nightly. Yet they have still charged us and debiting our credit card falsely for services and accommodation that we did not use! WARNING, WARNING, Woogo Apartments have committed acts of fraud. DO NOT USE Woogo! (I have reason to believe that they rented out the apartment to another unsuspecting person(s) once they had realized we had left!)

Ended up very expensive. 10. Fridge was dorm fridge size and on the floor-inconvenient. 11. marble on floor of bathroom and hard wood floors were hard to walk on after a long day. 12. no maid service -- had to ask for more toilet paper, a garbage bag, ran out of clean towels. 13. Asked for extra pillow and was given a very lumpy one. 14. candy and drinks and canned soup in room and fridge by hotel were like a mini bar and very expensive and a big temptation to children/teens. 15. toiletries provided were very minimal-breck shampoo and dial soap (2 small bars). 16. Charge $10 a day for internet access in room. 17. No comfortable chairs-just a glass table and some rattan type chairs. 18. They don't really help you with your luggage. 19. Anyone overweight, pregnant, arthritic is not going to be comfortable here. 20. Feel far from times square, greenwich village, union square, financial district. 21. Porn on the tv. PROS: 1.

Couch was pretty comfortable when it wasn't made into a bed. 15. Near a Sephora. 16. Easy to hail a cab up by citibank. 17.

When we got to the appartment the door looked like it had been kicked in. when we opened the door all you could see was roaches walking along the floor, we were horrified,we checked the bathroom which looked like it had never been cleaned. I stormed downstairs to tell the guy behind the desk who started to laugh saying he would go and get some food for the roaches. He came to look at the appartment and agreed we could have another room. the 2nd room was even worse, stained bedsheets, the seal on the toilet was broken and there were even more roaches than the 1st room. Again we went to see the manager who said he couldn't give us our money back so he showed us a 3rd room. This room was horrific. Whilst i was running to the lobby to complain my other half was taking photos of these discusting apartments, when the manager saw him he demanded that these be deleted or he would cause us trouble. So we had to delete them. this was proceeded by a further 6 hours arguing for our money back. We rang woogoo centra resirvations who told us we needed to email them. In the middle of NYC at 2 at night. Whilst arguing the informed us that there was no hot water in the property. Besides taking our deposit twice we still haven't recieved our refund. We were also charge a further 2.5% on top of the total charge this was a further booking fee. This matter has gone to Watchdog who have been in touch with us and this company will appear on the show soon, as there have been so many complaints about Wogoo and the Tempo apartments.

The only nice spot would have been if we were staying longer and could have taken advantage of the small kitchenette, something you normally do not get in a hostel like atmosphere.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cPlan before you Stay\u201d", "Author": "catsie", "ReviewID": "UR5714140", "Content": "The WooGo Central Park would be a place to stay if you want to get a taste of being a resident of New York. Pretend it is your own apartment and bring your own towels and wash cloths, make your own beds, wash your dishes, take out the trash, and be willing to dispose of the previous occupants dropped trash and forgotten underwear. The first night the front desk staff directed me to the 'managers' office where I inquired of two surley young men if I might obtain a wash cloth. They informed me they did not provide anything but one towel per customer. We were there 5 days. No one cleaned our room, brought fresh towels or emptied the trash. As we were checking out other customers were at the desk asking for toilet paper, towels and trash bags. It has a good location - go up two blocks to the Fairway Market and you're set for groceries - it is an easy stroll to a main subway hub, Riverside park and Central Park. So, if you are good at taking care of yourself and don't mind being your own maid, it was a fine stay . P.S. The Fairway Market sells trash bags and Filene's has towels.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Woogo - Central Park", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d307945-Reviews-Woogo_Central_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$189 - $474*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">240 West 73rd Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10023</span></span> (Formerly YourStay Central Park)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514515", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/71/67/8b/lobby.jpg"}}
