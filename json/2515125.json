I took a quick shower and sank into a deep sleep in the comfortable bed. The room was quiet though there was noise from the housekeeper the next morning as she knocked on doors to clean. This property was clean and well located. The staff at the check in desk, concierge, and coffee bar were very nice. I was sad I checked out the next day at other recommendations to continue my Seattle stay at the Sheraton. Yes, it does have the club lounge, but the food there was actually quite poor and I found the staff at the Sheraton very unpleasant.

It's right in the heart of downtown Seattle. The location doesn't get much better than that. The hotel was very nice about getting us a room on a higher floor. We stayed on the 42nd floor. The minute we walked into our room, we were greeted by the Space Needle pretty much right in front of our window. We could also see mountains and the sound from our view. The rooms were nice and clean. The hotel was going through renovations at the time, but every room I went in looked updated. The bed was very comfortable. I'm not sure why the other travelers said that it wasn't. The only complaint I have is paying for internet. I feel like that's something hotels should offer anyway. We also had to pay to use the refrigerator. This was annoying because we were there for dance. We didn't have time to go out to eat everyday, so we need a place to store our own food. Luckily, the hotel did bring us our own fridge aside from the regular stocked one. Another thing was that the elevators were slow. It's a very tall hotel with a lot of people there for dance, so that might be the problem. The walls were also kind of thin. This might not be problem for some people. The people in the adjoining room next to us were having sex all night. Luckily, we were busy and hardly there. This sort of thing can happen in any hotel, so I can't blame the Westin for it. Overall, this is a great, clean, gorgeous hotel.

Back then, having enjoyed my stay, I vowed to return, and to lash out for a high floor (Grandview) with a Space Needle request. However, as much as I appreciated the hotel's location and views, this time I was troubled by the soft and squishy \"heavenly\" bed. I had a sore back from travelling, and my bed felt too saggy and worn to support my back and body. When I complained and requested for an alternative mattress, I was told that all the mattresses had been recently replaced and I was offered a bed board. I declined, knowing that the only appropriate action I could take would be to vote with my feet and stay elsewhere in June 2012 when I return with my family. I was disappointed to be charged $10/day for a mini fridge in our room (this was complimentary last time), and service express stated that kettles were not available to be brought to our room, whereas Elspeth Jones, Hotel Manager, in response to my previous tripadvisor report, had suggested they were available. We went out and bought one for our convenience. As we're Aussies with different voltage, we had to leave it in the room when we left. It wouldn't have fitted in our suitcases either. The $5 Green Option was taken, but only for one night only. I had misinterpreted the written information in the room and we had still expected at least the trash to be removed and the beds made, but as we found out by experience, the Green Option means no housekeeping, FULL STOP. We had an interconnecting door, that we weren't using, and everything could be heard from our neighbour's conversation, their coughs and their television. I assumed they could hear us too. I hadn't realised that the downstairs restaurant had opened until we were leaving and I was sorry we hadn't tried it. It's sort of tucked away in the lobby, but it's modern and it has a great aspect to the street and the menu and prices looked good. Maybe for next when we will be in Seattle again.

The room was nice and clean although it wasn't renovated and it was in the north tower.

There was always a stack of fresh towels and a rather tiny separate weight room which I initially mistook for the gym. Also, there's no way to get to the gym from your room by taking the stairs.

There was an iron and a safe in the closet. The hotel consists of two round towers, so there is a decent view from nearly every room I would guess. My room was not on a high floor, so I did not see Puget Sound, but I had a nice view of downtown and the monorail. I did not find the room to be noisy, but I live in an urban area so am not ultra sensitive to traffic noise. The greatest negative is the $9.99 per night charge for internet access in the room.

Westin features a 'pillow menu' where you can order your own type of pillow - but the standard one supplied was great for us. The bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the 17th floor and didn't find the street noise too obtrusive. The monorail down to the Space Needle leaves from just a block away. Probably a four or five block walk to Pike Place Market - takes maybe 10 - 15 mins tops. Well worth the visit! Also, must take a picture at the Gum Wall down there!

The headboards on the beds were uncomfortable (too short and had a moulding that jutted out making it uncomfortable to rest my head against).

We payed a premium price for what was billed as a \"Deluxe Water View\" room with King. That is definitely NOT what we got. We arrived at the hotel and, while standing in line to check-in, I noticed that only two of the 4 people behind the desk actually appeared to be doing anything. The other two just seemed to stand around and direct \"traffic\" instead of actually helping to check guests in. This isn't a big issue for us but I must admit that it gives a poor first impression. At check-in, we were told that a King was unavailable but that we would be upgraded to a \"better\" room although it only had a queen bed -- this seemed reasonable and no big deal to us if we were getting a nicer room. What we were given was room #2850 in the South Tower. My wife summed it up by calling it \"depressing\". We are actually quite used to staying in hotels/motels of the 2/3 star variety -- everything from a Motel 6 to a Hampton Inn. While the \"view\" down 5th Avenue and the partial views out to Elliot Bay were reasonably nice, the overall furnishing and general sense of the room was, in our opinion, not even a close match to what we expected. It turns out that our queen bed was actually a Murphy-style bed that swung out of the wall -- not exactly my concept of the \"Heavenly Bed\" that Westin is so quick to advertise! The rest of the decor was plain and (truthfully) a bit dated -- not in a \"1960's period\" kind of way but in a \"we really need to refurbish our units\" kind of way. We were lucky enough to have other options and we refused the room, got our money back, and went elsewhere in a hurry. Our Westin experience didn't end there, however. The next day I sent the General Manager of the hotel an email describing our experience and disappointment (similar to this review). No reply... After a few days of no response I forwarded the email to the Customer Service desk at Starwood (which owns the Westin chain). They told me I would receive a prompt reply from the hotel -- a couple of days later I did indeed.

Location: The location is pretty good. Shopping plazas, Macy's, Nordstrom, and restaurants are within walking distance. 2.

However, as long as you are able to find the entrance of this hotel, the very nice valet people will either help you to do the parking or direct you to the garage. The valet person we met is very friendly and helpful! Very good service! 3. Check-in: Painless and funny check-in. The check-in gentleman asked us whether we are \"Star War\" member (Yes, I am, since childhood! I think he must be in a very good mood because it's holiday season!) Right away, he noticed what he said and asked again whether we are \"Starwood\" member (Bingo this time!) Because of the Starwood member status, we got free upgrade to the 46th floor (they have 47 floors), where one of the rooms with best views is located! Their elevator is very fast, so it doesn't take much time to arrive the 46th floor. 4. Room: Thanks to \"Mr. Star War\", our room has very fantastic views! We can see mountains, part of the Ellioit Bay, and the Space Needle is just shinning in front of us! My Boston friend fell asleep while watching the Space Needle because the beds are toward it. Although the room may not be very modern, but has very nice and elegant combination of colors. The bed is terrific comfortable! It's the best bed I have ever slept in hotels!

The next morning we went to breakfast to discover that the complementary full breakfast was actually in a fast food cafe with counter service. Yes, we did receive the breakfast, but it was hardly the relaxed experience we anticipated in a full-service hotel dining room. On check out, we discovered an inexplicable charge on our bill (a room tax that represented about 40% of the bill). It was clear that the clerk didn't know how to calculate percentages, so she was befuddled. We spoke with the manager who couldn't answer the question about the 40% tax either, but he did reduce the cost of our room substantially to compensate us for the inconvenience.

Initially, I tried to book the Fairmont Hotel, but they were overbooked, and so were most of the other hotels due to a conference that had booked over 90% of all of Seattle's rooms. The best deal I could find was with my travel agent in Australia. I ended up pre paying approx $300/night inc tax (Deluxe City View) for 6 nights at the Westin Seattle. After staying a couple of nights there, I actually started to really enjoy the hotel and its quirkiness ! I requested a room away from the elevators and high up, and upon check in I was given a room in the south tower on the 28th floor. I didn't like that room for the rate I had paid, which seemed more than many of their published rates, so I asked to change rooms immediately. I was then given room on the 42nd floor of the north tower that overlooked Lake Union and it was much better, although I was still surprised at the noise I heard from Seattle city, so far up. I guessed that the noise was similar to what you'd hear in New York, even though I haven't been there (yet). The earplugs I had packed helped a lot, as the elevators were loud, the ice machine was close by, and the hum of the city was constant. Fortunately I had quiet neighbours. As I was travelling solo, I requested a mini fridge and that came to my room promptly for no charge. I connected to the Wi Fi but gave up after the first day, it wasn't worth the money per day. (approx $9/day). There was a coffee machine and cardboard cups (but no kettle), an ironing board and iron, a mini safe, good blackout curtains and a Heavenly Bed that was soft and squishy but I got used to that. The TV was at a weird angle to watch from the bed, but I never used it anyway. I turned the air con off, it wasn't required, although it was fairly silent anyway. Even though the elevators were noisy, they did an excellent job! Housekeeping staff spoke minimal english, they were rarely around in the corridor at all, which was very quiet apart from the elevators and the ice machine. I never heard a vacuum cleaner, and being in the presence of a lone raw almond on the floor, near my coffee machine, from the start to the finish of my stay, it made me I wonder if they ever had used a vacuum cleaner! What I did really appreciate, apart from the view and location, was the hotel's phone express line. I found that if I wanted any advice or anything in the hotel eg concierge, housekeeping, rooms service etc, all I had to do was pick up the phone and dial 0. It was that simple, and I never had to wait for some one to answer and the operator was always polite and efficient. It really made my stay. That service, the view, and the location. Whilst in Seattle, from where I was at The Westin, I only had to walk minutes to main attractions and shops. The monorail to the Space Needle was closeby at the Westlake Centre, Nordstrom and Macy's were sort of diagonally opposite, the Pharmacy was directly opposite and the Pike Market, the highlight of Seattle, was an easy five minute walk away. Starbucks and Seattle's Best were nearby too. I caught the underground and above ground buses too, the concierge helped me with the stops and timetables. What I did find lacking was a good restaurant within the hotel. There is a very large lobby with lots of seating and a bar, and a coffee shop with food and a hotel gift shop, but I appreciate a good buffet breakfast and somewhere within a hotel to eat a main course at dinnertime when travelling solo. Unfortunately, there was no such setting within the hotel to provide this opportunity. Having said that, I noted that Daliah's Lounge was close by with an excellent Dahlia's take away shop next door, and I loved Farestart Restaurant, 700 Virginia St, nearby too. The Pike Market was always a reliable place for coffee, snacks and meals. In summary, I would definitely return to this hotel for its location, views and service. If possible, request for a high floor, away from the elevators, in the north tower overlooking the Space Needle. If its affordable, a Grand View Room would ensure 38 floors or above. Other than that, I would be wanting to get value for money on a lower floor by not having to pay too much.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood experience.

The pool & hot tub area was very nice as well with all the glass windows. Disappointed there wasn't enough time to try the gym. We'll definitely be choosing the Westin again next time we visit Seattle.

Both my wife and I felt for the price we paid per night that things could have been better. For example the room was a bit tired (old carpet, bathroom tiles in need of replacing). A rollaway bed had been requested before arrival (we were getting in later in the evening with a 3 year old child and a time zone difference which meant that he had had a longer day) As usual it was not in the room and had to be brought up. To her credit that lady at reception sympathised with the situation and made it a priority. Check in was slow. Only two receptionists on duty at a time of evening when lots of people were checking in. However my biggest gripe and one that was not resolved due to tiredness and timing was breakfast. When I booked the room (a couple of weeks before travel) I asked for a breakfast rate...which I was given. When my email confirmation came through it confirmed number of visitors as 3 but gave breakfast for 2. Now my son is only 3 years old and other hotel brands do give free breakfast for children under 5...but to be sure of this fact I emailed the hotel before our visit....heard nothing back. Figured that it was no issue....my son would be included...arrived at checkin...handed breakfast vouchers for me and my wife...and when I asked about my son was met with a blank look before having it confirmed that he wasn't included at breakfast. Maybe it is a business hotel....but I don't really think it is acceptable to confirm a reservation for 3 and then give breakfast for 2. Not really what you want to have to sort out after a long travel day....which we didn't...we spoke to a receptionist in the morning who gave us vouchers for my son. At the time I was pleased and felt the problem had been rectified until I got my final bill and saw a charge from the breakfast cafe which I presumed was said voucher. GIven that we had a deadline to meet for onward travel I did not argue this on checkout as the reception area was busy..but I was not pleased and felt this was disrespectful. Especially as a 3 year old child is not eating the same quantity as an adult and I am pretty sure what I got charged was for an adult breakfast If you book as a family you should be treated as a family. I don't want extra charges on my bill at the end of a stay for things that should have been taken care of before I even arrived and would save the stress levels and the feeling that children are a nuisance.

We booked a very specific room type (king with pullout mattress), and my wife checked in very quickly. We got to the room, and discovered that we were placed in two queen doubles. Room was very high up with a nice view, but it wasn't going to work with the combination of young kids and two adults also traveling with us. My sister in law went down to front desk to see if we could get the situation resolved, but she was informed that the room type was not available that night. We were given vouchers for the breakfast joint in the lobby, and offered a crib. This still wasn't going to work, so I went down, explained that I had booked through corporate, and that we should be able to get the room type we booked. I offered to return the vouchers, and asked them to resolve. Within a couple of minutes I got the room I wanted (much lower floor, still a very nice view), and they let me keep the vouchers. Three different front desk reps, but eventually resolved. Housekeeping was exceptionally friendly, although we never got the towels we asked for on the second day. The concierge was helpful in getting a van to the airport on incredibly short order, although it was apparent she was frustrated with this last minute request. To compound the issue, my two very young children were having a break down in their very nice lobby, adding to nerves for us and the staff. However, once the van order came through, the concierge became much more relaxed, and even got got my kids a little snack to keep them calm. Outside of some of the frustrated looks I got from front desk and at first the concierge, every request was met without too much strife. I don't have too much travel experience with young children at nice hotels, but it seems this hotel is better catered to families with slightly older children and young professional travelers/couples. I can't help but shake the feeling that the reason we were changed in room type is because the room we booked was attached to another room (for closed 2 room suite upgrades). I've worked hospitality for 5 years in the past, so I know how these things go, but when you book corporate you should always make sure those room types are matched to a \"T\". Club members, then corporate, then walk-ins, then saver sites (Travelocity, Hotels.com, etc). Still can't complain too much since I got the room anyways. The beds were very nice and incredibly comfortable. I sleep on a Temperpedic at home, and this plush spring mattress easily matched the comfort level we expect. Very nice sheets, heavy blankets, and soft pillows (I think the king had easily 9 or 10 pillows). Turn down service on the pullout sofa was prompt, and the room was properly stocked with toilettes and coffee. Floor was very clean, and the bathroom was spotless. The only niggle I had was that the widescreen TV only got standard definition signal on the cable channels and on demand. We would have purchased content, but it looked incredibly poor, so we decided against it. Ice machine was down the hall, nice tasting ice, and you beverages heard it from the room. The hotel is slightly older (I'd say 30 years) but everything has been renovated. Quick elevators, clean hallways. The gym was nice and modern (although a little cramped) but the heated indoor swimming pool was great! Lots of towels out for guests, and a nice jacuzzi for the adults. The hotel is situated nicely in downtown, a short 15 minute walk from Pike Place. It's right next to the tram if you want to ride to the Space Needle. We walked there instead, took about half an hour. There is a inexpensive drug store across the street, countless coffee shops, indoor malls, and a ton of awesome dive bars a short walk away.

Room on 39th floor of North Tower faced West (towards water and Space Needle) which made for amazing sunset views. Very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. We had requested a quiet room and were given a room at the very end of the hall. This location turned out to be not quiet because the doors are thin and/or noise travels very well (when we returned and quietly opened our own door one night, our next door neighbor thought we were opening his door). So we ended up listening to housekeeping using the utility closet every morning. Somehow it was quite loud in what was a not very populated hallway--if you want a quiet room, ask to be away from both the elevators and housekeeping. When we arrived around 6 pm, I asked the front desk to send sheets/blanket up for the sofabed right away and they said they would do so. An hour later, we had to leave for a dinner engagement, but there were no sheets. When we spoke with the concierge about this on the way out, we told her that we had waited an hour and housekeeping had not appeared; strangely she did not ask for our room number nor took any action, but simply assured me they was coming. Four hours later when we returned, there were still no sheets. In essence, the hotel was sold out for a conference and while the staff were always polite, they were not particularly friendly nor did they step up to make our stay feel more than a standard experience. The location was great, but I got the impression the guests were basically on their own. Some tips: If you go to Pikes Place Market, keep in mind that the vendors close up around 4-5 pm --and start early. You can buy huge beautiful bouquets of fresh flowers for very reasonable prices (nice romantic touch). Great take-out sushi can be had at the food-court at nearby Westlake Mall. The Westin charges $41 for self-parking, but there is a lot right next door that charges $22 and it has a skyway that links into the Westin.

My husband and I did not rent a car and found it very easy to navigate around the city without one (of note, parking is a premium as it is in any major city and if you rent a car from the airport, you are loaded with a ton of airport taxes). From SeaTac airport, the best (and most affordable) way to get to the hotel is to take the Light Rail all the way to the end (one way is a meager $2.75 per person and takes about 30 minutes). The Light Rail is located at the end of the airport Parking Garage. Follow the signs, which are clearly marked. At the end of the Light Rail stop, it's about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and clean and the room we had was very spacious. It was well thought out for business travelers (a nice desk overlooking the window to comfortably accommodate laptops and files) as well as leisurely travelers (a large couch to place all the souvenirs without tripping all over them). The bed was super comfortable and the a/c worked just fine. There aren't too many rooms per floor for such a large hotel (there's 12 rooms per floor), making the stay feel a little more personable for its size. Despite being on the 41st (out of 48) floors, the elevators were very quick and efficient. My only small complaint is that I wish the bathroom amenities came with a shower gel rather than a bar of soap. We did not take eat at the cafe near the north tower elevators nor the restaurant, so I cannot comment on that. However, there are a ton of excellent restaurants within walking distance. The two we tried and highly recommend were Dahlia Lounge and Spur Gastropub. Here's a breakdown of what is nearby: The famous Pike Place Market is about a 5 minutes walk away and Pioneer Square is about 15 minutes walk away. Fashionistas would love the largest Nordstrom store I've ever seen (I believe it's the flagship location) and surrounding shops/mall just a few streets over. Taxi ride to Capitol Hill cost about $8.00 and about $10.00 to Canlis restaurant (a must go restaurant for foodies). Overall I was very pleased with our 3 night stay. The only reason why I did not rate this 5 stars was because we encountered with disappointing service during our second night. We had extremely noisy guests next door who started to argue at 3:30AM. They were using a lot of profanity and we did not feel it was in our position to knock on their door. In addition to their arguing, they also brought a dog that was barking. The noise was loud enough to where you could hear it from the hallway. We called front desk twice to have them contact the guests, but nothing was done. The guests continue to argue without anyone from the hotel contacting them. Unfortunately, we had to wake up early to attend an all-day seminar, so that was not a very pleasant day for us. I want to be clear that I am not giving a lower mark because of the noisy guests. I know that the hotel cannot control the type of people staying in every room. However, I was highly disappointed that nobody from security or front desk failed to respond to our repeated requests to contact the noisy guests that they were disrupting us. I felt we did the right thing to notify the hotel of the issue and that they should have addressed our request more promptly...or at least offer us an explanation as to why nothing was done if they were unable to do something about it. Fortunately, the guests checked out the next night, so our final night was quiet and allowed us to catch up on some much needed sleep. Despite that, I admit that the rest of our stay was perfect.

Good thing they provided free internet service in the hotel lobby so our kids were entertained during the 1/2 hr wait. We used our GPS to guide us to the hotel but due to the two entrances, it was listed as North and South but the same street numbers. We ended up at the front entrance with loading zone parking so my husband went in and encountered a grumpy not very helpful concierge who was quite curt giving my husband direction to the valet on the back side of the hotel. Valet paring with tax costs $43 a night and the parking attendants were all very helpful. The rooms were decent size with floor to ceiling windows, both with 2 beds. One of the rooms is geared for wheelchairs, power curtains, bathroom bars and larger space between the toilet and shower. Strangest thing is the adjoining doors, if they're opened then you cannot open the entry way doors. Housekeeping. The bathrooms were being kept clean enough but I noticed dust accumulating on the lamp base and bedside table only after just a couple of nights there. The hair dryer in my room also did not work properly, only on high and not low. The handle was caked with dried hair product. One of the worst I've seen in hotels and this was in a Westin!

The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping and has great views, but is a bit of a hike to the Washington State Convention Center, where our conference met. I didn't mind the walk, but as it is mostly uphill, it would be a challenge for those with mobility issues. The 5th Avenue Cafe downstairs is great and a good value for hotel breakfasts - I had an omelet and hashbrowns for about $10 one morning and a bagel for about $3 on another day. The walls and doors are, as others have noted, paper thin and you can forget about sleeping in once the housekeeping staff start vacuuming. The Heavenly Beds were great as always, but we couldn't sleep much due to all the noise on our floor - you can hear ordinary conversations spoken at a normal volume level quite clearly through the walls. One final issue: the elevators do not have key card access, and we witnessed at least one homeless individual using the ice machine on our floor (35) to procure ice for her needs. I appreciate the charitable spirit of allowing others to use the Westin's ice, but it definitely made us feel insecure to see someone who was obviously not a hotel guest on our floor - it was clear that anyone could wander in at any time. Perhaps the Westin could reach out to the area's homeless community in other ways while better securing access to the guest floors.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but a little tired\u201d", "Author": "katyzm", "ReviewID": "UR117666325", "Content": "Great view from the upper floors.

We arrived on the Saturday of Memorial Weekend and paid $119 + tax booked indirect with a UK provider. This was $60+ tax cheaper than the best rate available direct from the Westin website. Whilst appreciating the great price for a Downtown property in Seattle we were rather concerned by the negative reviews that seemed to be consistently posted by Tripadvisor users, but as it turned out a number of these were one review contributors and I did start to believe that there was some kind of vendetta against the Westin. Whether this is true or not, I don\u2019t know, but it did leave us feeling rather uneasy before travelling to Seattle. We didn\u2019t need to worry at all. We arrived from the airport using the Light Rail, which takes about 35mins to the Westlake Center and is $2.50 per person. It is a 2 minute walk from here to the Westin entrance. First impressions were excellent. The hotel does have a lovely lobby area which is huge, with a number of seating areas along with a bar, and a breakfast/lunch caf\u00e9 at one end. The reception desk was well staffed and we were able to check in immediately. We were greeted by a lovely young lady who seemed as happy to see us as we were to see her and she kindly provided us with a King Bed Space Needle view on the 20th floor of the North Tower. Our first experience with the \u2018notorious\u2019 Westin elevators was put to the test and passed with flying colours. It was seconds before we were up on the 20th floor. The public areas on the 20th floor are very well maintained and certainly up to a 4* level. Upon entering the room we were blown away. There was a small reception area leading to the bathroom and a mirrored wardrobe directly in front of us. To the right was a small walk through to the main bedroom and a glorious Heavenly King Bed, a sofa, chair and desk and a rounded window which had one of the best views I have ever seen in any hotel throughout the world. It really was a stunning room, the bed was perhaps the best I have ever experienced and most importantly it was spotless, with no sign of the wear and tear mentioned in other reviews. The bathroom was also spotless and a nice size. The much talked about Heavenly Shower was outstanding, again one of the best I have ever experienced and a nice vanity area with plenty of towels included as well. To top the room as a whole off, there were his and her robes, an ironing board/iron and an easy to use safe. What more could you want? It really was a 10/10 room. A really big issue at the Westin seems to be the wait for the elevators. There was on occasions a sign up saying that due to the number of people staying at the hotel there may be a wait, but I would say we had to wait a minute most each time and this was over Memorial Weekend and also with a few large conferences taking place. It really isn\u2019t as much of a deal as some previous reviewers have made out. We didn\u2019t dine in the Cornerstone Caf\u00e9 in the Westin as there are so many great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. We did however have breakfast a couple of times in the 5th Avenue Caf\u00e9 and we found this to be good value. There was a special available each morning of a pastry and coffee for $3.00 which was a great deal, and the service was always spot on as well. We didn\u2019t experience the lack of seats/tables like some have on here but if the room was full, I would expect people to utilise the seats in the lobby. It really isn\u2019t such a big deal. Another huge plus point for the hotel is the pool area and hot tub. My Wife enjoyed heading down to the 5th floor for this on a daily basis and her experience was very positive. As for location, well I doubt it can be beaten in Seattle, minutes from the best shopping and attractions in the Seattle, all within an easy walk. I did laugh earlier when I read a review stating that Pike Place and the Waterfront were a bit of a trek from the Westin, it really isn\u2019t very far at all. 5 minutes on foot to Pike Place and then just a short walk down (easier than up) to the Waterfront. It is quite hilly, but that is Seattle. For easier access to the Waterfront, I would recommend the 99 bus which is free and goes up 1st and around via the Waterfront. Seattle Center was easily reachable via the Monorail (station 2 minutes walk from the hotel) and a 90 second train journey but you could easily walk there as well. The area seemed very safe at day and night with plenty of people about. There was also a station for the Lake Union Streetcar directly across from the hotel which was another transportation option available. Overall, this is a great hotel in a fantastic location. I would definitely take some of the reviews which have heavily criticised the hotel with a pinch of salt. This is easily a 4* property.

My only complaint is that they charge a ton for parking and aren't exactly fast getting you your vehicle when you want it if they are at all busy at the time.

Although the service was typical Westin and very conscientious, I would say that the hotel itself beyond the lobby is falling a bit behind the standard set by all of the other Westin properties in my experience. We were initially given a room in the South tower on the 25th floor (although there are 40+ floors, apparently the 25th floor is one of the exclusive Starwood Preferred Guest floors). We were a little dismayed that the room was visibly dusty (even in the bathroom), and that the couch and chest of drawers were visibly dingy. Although tired from a 6-hour flight, we asked downstairs at the front desk for a better room, and were given the key to a room in the North Tower on the 24th floor. This tower and level were a bit better - the common area itself upon exiting the elevator was better, and room #2 was cleaner, and had a better shower. The bed was awesome (typical Westin), and the view was awesome. My advice about the parking is NOT to park in Westin's hotel-owned deck, but to park in the public deck (that - confusingly enough - has a blue Westin sign on the 5th Ave. entrance). it costs $22 per night and is connected to the hotel via a covered aerial walkway.

The staff does a good job keeping the rooms comfortable and helping the guests in every possible manner. I was assigned a large room with a comfortable king size bed. I went to bed and, at two in the morning I woke up unable to breathe. I am allergic to insect bites (some more than others) and know an anaphylactic reaction. And I always keep my emergency medication for such reaction at hand. That night it laid in the nightable. I could administer the medication on time and was able to breath again, when I discovered that my whole left arm and leg were covered in bloody dots. I knew that I had been bitten by an animal and called the front desk. A security team arrived immediately. They explained me about bed bugs -I had never heard about them- and that they are becoming a problem in the USA. Although they did not have that problem at the hotel, they couldnt rule it out. When I left, they had isolated the room and were about to bring dogs trained to find bugs -another thing I had never heard of'-. I was immediately moved to a suite at the last floor. Way too big for me. I could comment on the decor (after all, I am an architect) but the room was spacious and had a fantastic view. The hotel managers on duty (Michael and Mohamed) were at all times kind and concerned. An appointment with the doctor was arranged for me and the doctor could count over 90 bites on my leg and arm but was not sure which animal caused it. It was a pretty horrid experience, but the hotel staff went through great lengths of pain to assure that I could do my job and have a pleasant stay. I also had an important dinner party, for which I had bough a pretty Channel dress -short skirt and sleeveless- which I could no longer wear due to the extensive rash and scaring of my arm and leg. The hotel took over the expenses of a new pants outfit -no Cahnnel this time, though-. What makes the most of a stay in a hotel is the attitude the owners and staff have towards their guests and customers. Regardless how modest or elegant the hotel would be, if the owners, managers and staff have the mission to be sure that their guests have a pleasant stay, then you can be assured that you are in a good hotel. The way how the staff at the Westin Seattle took responsibility on a potentially serious matter and the delicacy and warmth of their approach to it makes it clear that everybody involved in the business of managing a hotel know what they are doing.

With so many bookings, I have often been capable of getting Westin bookings with a little experience in looking through the options before booking - maybe just luck. Luck that was until this past weekend at the Seattle Westin. There are many positive comments on this sight, and my guess is that those patrons are not Hotwire customers. I believe this hotel is capable of 4 - star status, but they save those rooms and service for their full charge customers. The room was dirty and cramped, and the bed was VERY uncomfortable. This was probably the worst night's sleep ever. The comments about the elevator service are completely accurate. Plan up to 30 minutes wait for an elevator to get down. I noticed a several comments about the high parking rates in several of the posts, but none that are current for May 2011. They must have raised the parking rates in the past couple of weeks as well - self serve (including tax) is now $41 and valet $43. Think the $2 additional charge for valet is worth it? Plan up to another hour to get your car out. The sign on the garage says $28 daily and in very tiny font \"plus tax\" - the tax is $13 for a grand total of $41 self-serve parking. When we returned to the hotel on Saturday at 5:30, we found a parking place on the street next to the entrance of the self-parking garage. We placed a couple of quarters in the meter, put the meter ticket on the side window, and enjoyed free parking from 6:00 pm Saturday through all day Sunday. The best part about this hotel is the location - easy walking distance all around down town and to Pikes market. Here's the kicker - my teenage sons are baseball fans, and our family vacations are usually planned around touring major league parks and taking in a game or two. (Yes, we spent Mother's Day at Safeco Field watching the Mariners.) We met several season ticket holders at the game on Sunday and were quick to ask about the tv/cable system that didn't show home Mariner's games in Seattle. They had no idea what we were talking about. We continued to explain that the previous night we had returned to our hotel room planning to watch the end of the Mariner's game, but we were unable to find it on the TV. We called down to the front desk, and we were told that the game was only available in the lounge, not in the rooms. The fans we met all laughed and told us that the games are all carried in the basic cable package that even Motel 6 has. This is a 4-star hotel?

Being owners at the Westin, Palm Springs location and having stayed at various Westins, we knew we were in for a real treat. Unfortunately, for this stay our experience was not so positive. Some of the basic services that we would expect at any hotel chain did not pan out for us. For instance, the safe did not work, the showers were tepid, and the elevators were extremely slow. On our check out day we waited half an hour for the elevator that never did arrive. We ended up having to walk down 4 flights of stairs with all our luggage and were not able to get out of the hotel due to the signage saying: emerengy, fire exit only. We reentered the hallway and phoned down to the front desk where they said they would send the service elevator to us. We waited 15 minutes for the service elevator and it still did not arrive? We finally found a different set of stairs that took us out to the Lobby? Some of the Westin luxuries that we have always received were also not followed through with: no bath robes, no glasses - the first night I had two glasses in my room, but the second night I was left with 4 paper cups - really no bottle opener - I was not able to keep it in the room as it was the last opener in the hotel according to person that delivered it to the room. Wow, 40 plus floors per tower and only one bottle opener, you may want to check into this. The first night we had enough coffee for each of us to have a cup the second night we only had one coffee pack? Again, the above mentioned items may appear small, but to top it all off I had to wait 10-15 minutes each and every time I wanted to use the elevator. The kids wanted to use the pool and we had to wait for the elevator. Once we arrived at the pool the water was ice cold and we never did go back to the pool. I am not a person that likes to complain, but Westin hotel did not live up to its reputation.

This time, on a whim, I ended up with the Westin Seattle through Priceline for half what the AAA rate was. I checked in very late, and it was quick and friendly. I originally ended up on a high floor, but the two full beds were too much. I called and asked if I could have a room with a single bed, and they offered me a queen accessable or a Westin Workout with a King. I took the latter. The room was great! I didn't have to trott through the hotel in my sweats to go workout, the treadmill and weights were in my room, including a set of extra towels, wipes, and other workout toiletries. There was an extensive collection of Yoga equipment, which was no use to me, but I didn't care. The room was no additional charge, which was nice, because they usually rent at several dollars more a night then the deluxe rooms. The view was the best I ever had staying at the Westin. Great view of downtown and Elliot Bay with the ferries coming in from Bainbridge and Bremerton. The fact that Westin/Starwood offered me this great upgrade, not knowing that I was a SPG member and booking through Priceline really delighted me and will keep me loyal. Only downsides to the experience were the lack of any toiletries in the bathroom upon arrrival (they were restocked on the second night) and on the second day, water bottles magically appeared where there were none before.

More times than not, Starwood properties have been very good for us. That's why it was shocking to see all these bad reviews for a starwood property like the Westin Seattle. We went to Seattle celebrate our 10th anniversary and saw that the Starwood site had deals for various cities & hotels. This particular westin was one of them. So, I booked a high floor room with a view & king bed. The internet-only pre-paid rate on spg.com was a good deal, so I prepaid for the room. Then I came across these reviews that said how horrible this hotel was. Service was horrible and cleanliness was an issue. Oh boy, I wanted to cancel so badly, but I was already locked in through the prepayment. Oh well, we'll see how it goes. It turned out to be very good. I'm glad I wasn't allowed to cancel. First, the hotel lobby was a happy gathering place during our stay there. There were always people there having a good time in the lounge and bar area. It was a happy place to return to after a day of walking around. A home away from home. (I've been in hotels where the lobby was eerily quiet, like a mortuary. I won't mention names, but the initials are Denver Loews). The room was well-appointed and comfortable. The view was amazing! The shower head (actually two shower heads) were one of the best showers I've ever had in a hotel room. There was good water pressure and you actually feel clean after a shower, not like some hotel showers where the water was barely over spitting pressure. We were on the 32nd floor, which makes the water pressure issue even more impressive. The location of the hotel is very convenient. It was centrally located between downtown shopping and Pike's Place. We often went between these two part of town and had the luxury of stopping by the hotel to drop off stuff, use the bathroom, and/or take a small break. Unless you are booking this hotel through a discount site like Hotwire, it's worth a stay here.

Stay at the Westin and you'll find out. Here are some tips to enjoy your stay at the Westin: - ask for earplugs when you check in - don't expect good service. I think there is a service charge for smiles. - don't expect a clean room While the location is great, it cannot compensate for the horrible night's sleep, poor service, and unclean room. First, the room had an incessant creaking. It was one of those noises that you notice during the day, but in the quiet of the night, it gets progressively louder and louder and more annoying. If it was just my wife and I, we would have requested to move. But with small children already settled in and sleeping, we suffered through the night. I could not understand how they could rent a room that creaked like a haunted house. The next morning, I got my answer when I complained to the front desk. When you check in, they are *supposed* to give you a sheet of paper explaining that the creaking is caused by a safety feature for windstorms and offering earplugs. Unfortunately, nobody communicated this during my check in. This brings me to my second point: service. The worst part of the service was the stark lack of empathy the front desk expressed when I calmly described my night. I would have expected at least something like \"I'm really *sorry* no one told you about the creaking. It must have been a horrible night.\", instead all I got was a sheet of paper explaining the creaking one day too late. Note to management: verbal apologies do not cost you any money! When I told them I was never booking with them again, the front desk didn't seem surprised. I guess they hear that a lot.

If you plan to use mass transportation to see the sites around Seattle, the Westin's location can't be beat. The monorail to Seattle Center and light-rail to the airport are about a short block away. Several family-friendly restaurants, a food court at the mall across the street, and Starbucks, of course, are all nearby - meaning w/in a two-block radius (that was really important to us being with a toddler!) The cafe in the hotel offered an inexpensive breakfast option - coffee and pastry for $5. While a bit on the older side, the Westin is very comfortable and clean.

Room was spacious and we had a great view (see photo), but we were on floor 13! I have NEVER seen a hotel actually have a floor 13!!! Everyone was commenting on that in the elevators. lol Room was clean, but when we pulled back the bedding the first night, there was FRESH BLOOD on the sheets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Grosssssss! I called and they sent someone up in about 15 mins to change the bedding. I thought we might get a meal comped or something because of this, but nothing - not good customer service. It was REALLY gross. It was not like it was just a blood stain (still gross) on a washed sheet, but fresh bright red blood! I took a photo of it. I was thinking that whomever had the room before us did not use that bed, maybe did something gross like wipe blood on the sheet, then put the duvet back up nicely, and housekeeping thought the bed was unused and didn't change the sheets. Sheets should be changed between guests regardless of whether or not the bed looks used! Parking is $39, so we found an open parking lot directly across the street that is $30 a night, saving us a total of $27 over 3 days. I have a good car alarm so was not concerned about leaving it there. Car was fine. I just had to make sure I went and paid each day, which was not a big deal because we were out and about. Tons of fast food options in Westlake center across the street, and also there is a full mcds across the street at the back of the hotel. Hotel was typical 4* with typical amenties. Staff were nice, nice big lobby with free internet. We opted not to pay for internet in the room at $10 a day when it was free (but slower) in the lobby. We also just used our iphones in starbucks and places like that. Seems to be free internet everywhere you go in Seattle. You have to mortgage your house to buy food in the hotel - we had an early dinner one night and were hungry in the evening, we decided to order a burger/fries and a milk to share from room service. The burger/fries were 18.50, milk was $6 and by the time they put all of their fees on top, it cost $37!!!! I don't understand why hotels charge so much - if they were to charge normal restaurant pricing they could do so well - we would have probably come back from a long day of shopping/sightseeing and ordered food from them instead of zipping across to Mcdonalds or similar. I have stayed at the best western by the space needle and their room service was very affordable- about 12 bucks for a burger/fries. We could do dinner for 2 for about $30. One evening we also got a snack in the lobby - 3 sliders and fries, and 2 pops and it cost me $22. Its quite pricey to eat at this hotel (and I know many 4* hotels are the same, but I just wish they could keep it more affordable and they would probably triple their food sales in the hotel). 5 min walk away is Top Pot Donuts- yummy. We went to gameworks (10 min walk) - icky food and filthy dirty games. Would not do that again. Pool was super crowded due to a big dance competition in the hotel, but was warm and hot tub was nice.

We got a great deal on Priceline, so I was quite chuffed with my win. Location: Great! It is right on Stewart and 5th so it is fairly central and we were able to walk everywhere (we did not use the car once) and the neighbourhood felt safe. Service: About average. We were able to check-in fairly early - 12:30PM - and the front desk staff who checked us in was nice. Not overly helpful, but nice enough. When we got to our room, our safe was locked, so we called to get it unlocked. Security was there within 2 minutes (I am not exaggerating) and got it unlocked in no time. Room: We were assigned a room on the 31st floor overlooking Puget Sound, so that was really nice. We got a room with 2 double beds - I asked for a king, but they said because I booked with Priceline, I only get whatever they give me, which was fair enough. The rooms are looking a bit old, but hey, the beds were comfy and I paid $69/night so I am not complaining. HOWEVER, I will complain about the water pressure in the shower, which was non-existent. I don't know if the lack of H20 pressure is due to us getting a room on the 31st floor, but it was bad. It was so bad that my husband could not get any water running in the sink while I was in the shower. I think the lack of water pressure could be a deal-breaker for us - we love our hot, steamy showers, but if showering leaves us feeling cold and unclean, then I don't think we will be returning. But then again, the beds were comfy so I COULD be convinced. Maybe. Bottom line: at $69/night, I might be convinced to go back because the beds were comfy and I had a good night's sleep. However, the shower situation is terrible so it would have me concerned especially because I get the feeling that Priceline customers do not get treated as well as the non-priceline ones. Based on my experience, I would definitely not pay more than $95 to stay here, even during the summer. My rating: 2.5 stars, but I am rounding up because of the location and the price that I paid for my stay. If I had paid more than what I did, I'd definitely give it 1.5 stars, maybe even rounded down to a 1 star. Wi-fi Tip: Wi-fi in-room is $9.95/24 hrs, but is free in the lobby. Parking Tip: The hotel wanted $38 for valet parking, so we parked next door in the Westin Building on 5th Avenue and Virginia (it is connected to the hotel via a skybridge). For $22/day with in and out privileges, I thought it was a good deal compared to what the hotel wanted.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price\u201d", "Author": "BrophRDH", "ReviewID": "UR99189044", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for a date night out away from the kids.

When we checked in to our king sized room, my husband noticed an old urine stain on the toilet seat. Gross, but when we mentioned it to the front desk, it was handled extremely efficiently and definitely to our satisfaction. The room was, \"meh\", but large and the view spectacular. I didn't want my 4 year old playing on the carpet or sitting on the furniture, so I had her stay on the bed with her toys and blankie. The carpet is very old, stained, dusty, and has tears in it. The walls were stained and the furniture gave me the creeps. The bed was very comfortable, clean, and updated. The TV was a flat panel and rather newish. Bathroom was quite nice and the shower was amazing. Great water pressure; seemed updated to us. The soap was a huge hit with our daughter because it was leaf shaped and smelled quite nice. No free WiFi - 7 bucks for the day. We had checked in after a long day returning from Disneyland and were looking for somewhere to eat and the front desk suggested a place within a very short walking distance from the hotel in a mall. It was great. The hotel's room service prices were WAY too high for our liking. The pool area was lovely and exceptionally clean; hot tub was as well. Our daughter was able to stand on her toes in the shallow end (she's 42\" tall), but there is a slope drop-off, so make sure you're with your smaller kids at all times. Looked as though the patio off the pool area would be really nice in the warmer months as well. We had over the top, fantastic service from the bellhops, especially John, (HUGE kudos to him; he even tied my little girl's shoelaces) and all the other service staff were courteous and friendly, save for the Concierge fellow. He was a bit, um, off, to say the least. We felt we were wasting his time, instead of him helping us expedite ours. Overall, an okay stay, however, I'd stay somewhere else until their reno's are done. But, I can only imagine I won't quite get the deal I did on Priceline when that comes. ;-) I say \"no\" to recommending this hotel for now because there isn't a choice for \"maybe later\".", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, excellent location to the city and great staff!\u201d", "Author": "angelsSydney", "ReviewID": "UR98044667", "Content": "Well Obama stays here so what can you say but it is pretty nice indeed!

Although it wasn't bad, it seemed to be geared more towards takeout. The menu was fairly limited, but the worst part was that it was loud and had a hectic atmosphere.

Might be okay if you're looking for a quick bite before heading out for a business meeting, but not the ambience you want if you're on a relaxing vacation or weekend trip.

I was generally looking to get a great rate on Priceline, and we got a great one so overall we are happy with our stay. THE PROS: The location and service! The location cannot be beat if you are looking to be in the heart of downtown Seattle and want to do all the touristy things within walking distance. Seattle is not a great city to be driving in due to congestion and few parking spaces, so if you want to be central then this is it. We parked in the Westin (Impark) Garage next door (not underneath the hotel) that is connected by the skybridge, and it was $22/night with in&out privileges. Well worth the money since we could come and go as we pleased and didn't have to worry about our vehicle. I believe the garage was pretty safe as it seemed to be manned 24/7. We walked pretty much everywhere including the Pike Place public market, and there was plenty of shopping and dining around (recommend the Mexican restaurant in Pacific Place mall). We did drive out one day to Northgate mall and congestion was bad even for a Saturday. NOTE: We noticed you can park on the streets after 6pm free of charge, but spots are really scarce, and you would have to move your car early in the morning. There were also plenty of outdoor lots you can pay to park in--your choice. You can take public transit free of charge in the downtown core free of charge as well, but we didn't take advantage of that. As for service it was great. There were always minimal waits at the check-in counter and they treated us well even though we were Priceline customers. They just mentioned we were paid in full online, and gave us our room keys with a map. We got a King room on the 17th floor with average views (of the North building and surrounding area). You can take advantage of the Green option, meaning you get $5 credit/night you choose to skip the maid service which we did. You can use this voucher for food/drinks downstairs. The average cost of a quick bite to eat down there is $8-9, and coffee is the usual $2-4. You can also opt to redeem for points instead. You can ask them for a code to use WI-FI internet free of charge in the lobby. Pay internet in rooms. My hubby mentioned it was a bit slow, but I decided to go internet free this weekend. THE CONS: Yes, parking is expensive, and if you are not happy about paying $22+ to park a night then I recommend you choose another area to stay in outside of downtown Seattle, but you would be hard-pressed to find cheap, available parking downtown if you decide to come down. People were circling Pike Street Public market thinking the would find parking--don't do it. Anyway, not Westin's fault, and we were happy with the $22 pay parking because it was secure, dry, and close. The only thing that could have made our stay better was a cleaner room. I have read previous reviewers mention the dreaded bed bugs (which btw are a major problem in many nice hotels these days), and we escaped unbitten. It is a bit unnerving, but not too sure you can tell which hotels to avoid these days since it's such a problem. We were extra vigilent and checked the bed for signs. We didn't sleep that well, but that was due to the fact the bed was a tad soft (sunk in when my husband lied down, and he's not huge), and the bed/pillows smelled a bit stale. The place was also quite dusty. I'm wondering if the cleaners are having a harder time cleaning since people are choosing the \"green\" option, meaning the rooms are not getting the daily cleaning it really needs considering the heavy traffic. The rooms are newly renovated and yet showed so much sign of age (sofa was stained, everything was covered in dust, and the smelly sheets/pillows). This is the only area that seemed in need of improvement. I don't need a lot of things when it comes to accommodation, but I do think cleanliness (or lack of it) leaves a lasting impression. Overall we had a good stay, and would choose the Westin again if we got it for a good rate (ie. Priceline).", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA Classic Seattle Stay\u201d", "Author": "JustinG788", "ReviewID": "UR86987637", "Content": "I'm a Seattle native of 27 years.

We had to ask where the parking garage was and all he said was off 6th....we got outside and had to use the map (which we had to ask for since he didn't offer) to figure it out due ot the construction around the hotel.

I have no idea what the south tower rooms looked like, but ours was very good. Room is spacious, King bed angled to have a view over the city, through wall- ceiling windows. Great blackout curtains as the sun (yes, sun in Seattle) shone in the morning. Actually a wonderful site. We could also see down to Lake Union, Belltown and over to the East, Southeast of the city. Absolutely no noise at night from the street. As we were located pretty close to the ice machine and the elevator there was a bit of noise from that. I\"m a light sleeper. Good size TV (not HD), lots of plug ins to charge accessories, office desk that was situated looking out the window. A sofa bed and arm chair with a small coffee table were also in the room. But it was not crowded. Coffee machine a bit different, but I liked it ...Starbucks coffee filter, into holder, place Starbucks paper cup underneath, push on and it brews one cup and shuts off.

Some things that did surprise me: Sheets not as soft as I would like No bathrobes (you could get them if requested) Carpet looking a little worn out No cover between bottom and sheet and mattress. Now having said that, I have never looked to see if other hotels do have a cover. If you are on a high floor, be prepared for the milk run on the way down (especially early in the morning) and if you are on a lower floor, be prepared to wait a few elevators as lots of people loaded on by the time it reaches you.

Initially, I was very pleased with this as we generally like the modern style of the Westin chain. We contacted the hotel prior to our visit and requested for a king room on a high floor to get some views of the city which - besides the location - are actually the main feature of this hotel. It was nice of them to fulfill our request and we got a king room on the 42nd floor of the north tower. The north tower has a total of 47 floors (although maybe 5 numbers are missing in between on the elevator, don't know why...) and the south tower is a few floors shorter. There is nothing to write home about regarding the rest of the room. As other reviewers said, the hotel is dated and due for renovation. Not really modern style, maybe except for the unusual positioning of the bed which makes it difficult to watch TV from there. The sofa was very much worn out. However, the Westin heavily bed is soft and really comfortable even though I didn't like they are using 60% polyester sheets. The main drawback for me in this hotel is the price for extras (which aren't really extras in other, much cheaper hotels). Firstly, parking is about 40 USD per night. There is no microwave in the room, just a coffee maker which is not really suitable for making tea as your hot water would have some coffee smell. Also, the tap water smells like chlorine. There is also no fridge for your personal use in the room, just a minibar. The minibar displays a (not-very inviting) sign that basically says that if you are touching a bottle it will automatically been billed to your room and if you remove anything to store personal items it will result in a 25 USD cleaning plus restocking fee. Be especially aware if you have children with you as the minibar is just below the TV. So you decided to get a drink from the minibar? Well, a small bottle of regular water will set you back 5 USD (all prices plus tax, of course...), a beer is 8.25 USD and a small pack of mixed nuts 7.75 USD. Can't even think of using room service. Besides their already high prices for the food, there will be a 4.50 USD fee for delivery and an 18% service charge on top of it all. Need to make a short phone call? Dialing a (supposingly free) 1-800 number will cost you 2 USD plus tax. Want to access the internet? No, it is not free (except if you sit in the lobby with your own laptop). They have 3 guest computers, where internet costs 6.99 USD plus taxes. No, not per hour, for just 15 minutes or any part thereof. To be fair, it has to be said that these terminals can be used free of charge for checking in your flight and printing your boarding pass. Just before our stay at the Westin we had stayed at a three-star Hilton Gardin Inn at about half the price of the Westin. There we had a bigger room which was at least as comfy as in the Westin and had microwave, porcelain mugs, fridge, free internet computers for guest use and making a 1-800 call was free of charge. Sometimes choosing one star less will add to your level of comfort... Bottom line: I would stay at the Westin Seattle again only if getting a great rate (below USD 150). If you need more luxury in the same great location, you should consider the Pan Pacific where we had a nice dinner in their Sea Star restaurant.

We were impressed by the location, the amenities, and operations as desribed by many reviewers on this site. We were encouraged by one reviewer to write to the wonderful Erin Huff to see if there was any possibility of up-grading to a view room. (If all hotels had staff as efficient and personable as she, the hotel industry would be set for life!) For a reasonable fee, we could snag the last Grand Vista room, which, in our case, was on the 41st floor. My wife was surprised to have a full frontal view of the Space Needle from her pillow. We arrived Friday, August 20, at a little after 1 PM and were immediately given our room cards. Yes, the lobby was indeed busy throughout our stay, but nobody was disorderly nor were there any signs of it being crowded. It is true that there is limited meal service in the Cafe, which closes at 2:00 PM, or earlier if there is no business. But for the two days we were there, I went each morning around 7 AM and put together a wonderful breakfast of juice, muffins, fruit, yoghurt, and the best steel oats oatmeal I've ever had--all for under $20 for two. The staff would assemble everything and I would take our breakfast up to the room. (There was plenty of coffee, as attendants restocked our coffee each day.) Never was there any problem with the elevator. The longest we waited was a minute on check-out day. If you have limited time in Seattle, please consider the insider's tour that is offered by Evergreen Escapes. You will feel part of this special community. The rooms are not huge, the carpets are indeed old and dark, but the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms clean and well serviced, and everything works perfectly. Of course, the view would make one forget any problems! Two blocks away are two of Tom Douglas's restaurants, Lola's and Dahlia Grill, where we dined Friday and Saturday nights. Both serve innovative Northwest cuisine with a slight emphasis on Greek food at Lola's. Less than $100 for two with drinks (wine and cocktails), tax and tip included at each establishment. Check-out can be a problem if one needs to ask any questions about the account. For this reason, the express check-out is encouraged. Problems can be handled by phing the front desk, making it unnecessary to stand in lines resembling, as one guide book puts it, \"lines at SeaTac.\" Our cruise representative was thoroughly used to rounding up guests to transfer them to buses and to the dock, without making a spectacle in the lobby.

The smell is a combination of cigarette smoke still left in the air circulation system from when not all the rooms were smoke-free, old carpeting, and simply a lot of people congregating in a place where there are no open windows anywhere, ever. I am sure an upgrade to the 1970's air circulation system could have helped.

If you want to check in for your air flight and/or print your boarding pass, they have a computer room where you can do it for free (computers can be used for normal web browsing for a fee). There are several places to eat breakfast, but most are on the expensive side. We ended up eating in the caf\u00e9 in the hotel. We had great breakfasts for a reasonable price. Yes, there are homeless people in Seattle. We didn\u2019t\u2019 find Seattle to be any different than any other large city we\u2019ve visited. The hotel is in a safe area, within walking distance to many of the points of interest in Seattle. We returned to Seattle after spending four days in Vancouver. I asked for a room with a view and was given one on the 42th floor. I would rate it the same as our first room, clean with a great bed.

We stayed at the Peabody Memphis a few months ago and really liked those beds and thought we'd compare. It probably was just the bed in our room (1862) but the middle was considerably softer and made us roll towards the middle. I think we'll purchase the Peabody mattress. The Westin sheets were very nice, though. Overall, I thought the stay at the Westin was decent. Sounds from the hallway and the street were surprisingly audible in our room. I'd be happy if they had a white noise generator in the room. The view is very nice, We didn't opt for the water view, but it was fun to watch the busy Seattle streets. The layout of the room is good and it's nicely decorated. I think the door to the bathroom should slide open rather than swing. You have to step out of the way because it swings so close to the toilet. The A/C didn't seem to cool the room like I thought it should. I was hot when I had it turned to the lowest temperature of 65 degrees. I agree with most people that inroom internet access ought to be free. The lobby is full of people with laptops. Everybody seems surprised when they hear that it is a paid option. Also, parking is $36 and $39 for self park and valet, respectively. We parked next door in a garage that said Westin parking, but was not affiliated with the hotel for $22. It's just before the hotel on 5th street (one way street) and is a short walk to the hotel. Parking is expensive all over downtown Seattle. One thing to note about the $36 parking fee is that it's for 5-24 hours. So, if you park 6 hours, it's $36 and if you leave and come back, you start all over again. We were pleasantly surprised by a $5 voucher we got for forgoing maid service. We used two of them during happy hour at the bar and got two excellent appetizers with two non alcoholic drinks for a total of $4.50. The clam chowder is very good and the customer service in the lobby was good. Judy, the concierge was very helpful.

The Westin Seattle is an older property (by Westin standards) north of Seattle city center, although anywhere in downtown can be reached by a short walk. All of the facilities within the hotel are a bit older, especially the infrastructure parts such as the elevators (more on that in a second). I arrived slightly before 12pm and was informed that all of the rooms were still being cleaned, but I could have a wheelchair-acessible room. I readily agreed and went to the designated room on the third floor. I opened the room and looked out the window to discover, with great dismay, that the entire view outside was of a wall. I figured out that the hotel has a four-story tall wall holding the marquis, and because I was on the third floor, I was facing the other side of the wall. So much for the views of this wonderful city. I was glad I was only staying one night. The next morning, I went out for breakfast at about 8:30am. Apparently that was rush hour for the three elevators, as I (and other guests) waited for about ten minutes with no luck. The one elevator we saw was packed and could hold no more passengers. Frustrated, I took the marked stairway down, which led bizarrely to a dirty outside back area of the hotel, and I stumbled my way down to the first floor.

Let me preface that by saying that my point of reference for upscale hotels in Seattle is the Grand Hyatt. Perhaps my judgement was slightly clouded by the fact that I thought that in several aspects, the Westin simply didn't measure up, and that both hotels are generally in the same price range. The Westin features rather odd, pie shaped rooms around two tall, narrow towers. The rooms themselves were fairly standard Westin--very nice work area, typical Heavenly Bed--can't go wrong there---and nice enough bathroom. The room didn't smell quite as \"fresh\" as I would have liked, which I think is a product of the carpet. At one time, many rooms in this hotel no doubt featured excellent views. I think as construction has continued around this area, that has been mitigated somewhat. My room--which was facing the \"right\" direction (ie, toward the water)--had what can charitably be described as an \"obstructed view.\" There is a massive, new construction condo tower that has been built essentially right in front of the Westin, which wrecks the views from a lot of rooms, at least in the North Tower. The other thing I'll mention is that the staff here just didn't distinguish themselves. My colleagues witnessed a rather remarkable incident when a late night reveler literally passed out in the lobby, and several hotel employees stood there and watched--not one of them made any kind of move to either assist or remove the individual. Not good. I contrast that with a previous experience at the Grand Hyatt, where the staff was literally one of the best I've ever encountered. Not only did they come out the woodwork to meet every need, but they were friendly and went out of their way to figure out how they might make your day brighter. I don't expect or receive that in most places, but in Seattle, I knew it was a couple of blocks away from the Westin. The Westin is a fine choice...it isn't like you are unhappy.

First of all, we were primarily interested in a hotel in the middle of the more touristy things in Seattle, having never been before, and we were very pleased. The hotel was originally built in the late 1960s and this is most notable when you use the elevators, which have analog floor numbers. The age may make one wonder about the overall level of cleanliness of the hotel but our experience was very positive in this regard. If I'm honest, the carpet was dated and could stand a face lift, but our hotel room was impeccably clean (and re-cleaned from day-to-day). We liked to sleep in and, because of the building and room design, we never heard either of our neighbors; nor were we awoken by staff trying to clean our room despite the card on our door stating otherwise. And the beds were very, very comfortable (something that Hilton properties could take a note). We found the service to be absolutely top-notch, from the doormen to the front desk staff to the concierge (who was always bustling with other tourists). The location was great, with easy access to the waterfront, Seattle Center (a la the Space Needle and many other museums), Pike Place Market, and just about every shopping and restaurant you would care to visit. There's even a corner market a block away for various items. My wife and I even had room service the first night we arrived (we arrived quite late) and found the food to be outstanding for the faire we ordered, even if it was obscenely overpriced (about $50 for chicken tacos and a sandwich, both with fries; including tax and madatory 18% gratuity). I refused to spend the absurd price for their wi-fi (it was either $15 or $20/day for something that costs them next-to-nothing) but they reportedly had a business center that I suspect would have had a free internet connection if necessary. We had drinks downstairs at their bar a few times; excellent drinks for $10-12 each, if memory serves; not sure I wouldn't walk across the street next time despite how good the drinks were and the relaxing environment they were in. I should also mention that we made the reservations through an opaque internet site and felt the price we paid was more than fair for the overall accommodations. I typically reserve a 5-star rating for accommodations that are truly exceptional. To be honest, this is a fantastic property, but does not meet the \"truly exceptional\" range.

We opted for the water view! We got our room right away! Took up the luggage and hit the streets shoppping. There were 4 of us sharing the 2 queen beds! Plenty of room, but as previously stated the beds in our room were not heavenly at all! Quite soft and lumpy! The view made up for that though! Great views of the cruise ships in port, space needle and Pike PLace Market. We found the bathroom had great water pressure and hot water in the shower, plenty of towels, although we grabbed extra facecloths and bars of soap off the maid cart in the hall. The vanity was large and good lighting above. We enjoyed a cocktail and crab cakes in the lobby lounge and used the concierge service to book us a reservation for supper. It was a quick walk to the market and all the other stores-Macy's, Nordstroms, Sephora, Gap, Old Navy etc! Lot's of great restaurants nearby as well. You MUST go to the Crab Pot on Pier 57!!! Soooo good! We ordered the \"alaskan feast\" ( $35/person) You get a bib around your neck, a wooden board and a mallet and they dump a big stainless steel bowl filled with alaskan king crab legs, dungeness and snow crab, shrimp, clams, mussells potatoes and chorizo. We actually had to leave behind crab legs we were so stuffed :( You must have the famous award winning chowder at Pike Place Chowder located on post alley, and for a treat we went to the Crumpet Shop! Never had one of those before and it was warm and delicious! Thank goodness we walked everywhere!. We used the Valet Parking($38) but never took the car out at all as we just walked eveywhere. They even moved the car for us when we had to park in the non-valet parking garage since we couldn't turn into the valet drive due to a big U-haul trailer in the way. They just took the keys, went to the other garage and brought the car over!! Very kind! Thanks! The monorail takes you directly to the Space Needle for $4 return.

He's on business, I'm tagging along for fun. We've stayed at many Westin's but this one doesn't come close to any of the others. It feels more like an old run down Hilton. Cons to staying here / Ick factors: 1. Upon arriving, the signature Westin fragrance was barely noticeable. What I did smell was car exhaust. (Definitely not a deal breaker, but it was my first impression of the hotel.) 2. We checked in early (husband is a gold member) and they assigned us a room immediately. When we opened the door to the first room (room # was 3534, 3634 or 3734...can't remember), the offensive stench of body odor hit us hard. We went back down to the check-in desk and they assigned us to a different room. 3. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. It takes some maneuvering to get the bathroom door closed so you can get in the shower. Let me state for the record that I'm fit, I have no idea how anyone with a few extra pounds on them could move around in these bathrooms. 4. Yellow stains all over the comforter. DISGUSTING! 5. The mini bar was half empty when we arrived. Not a huge deal since we don't usually purchase anything from it, but we better not see that missing stuff on our bill. 6. Pool was ok, but I did smell like pee pee the rest of the day. 7. There is no room service during the afternoon. Not normally a big deal, but I had just worked out and was starving. This was entirely my fault for not planning properly, but I'm just so turned off by this hotel that I'm including this in my ick list. 8. The bed was ridiculously uncomfortable. We have slept on the Heavenly beds many times and love them. We're even considering purchasing one for ourselves. I'm not sure how old this mattress is, but it's AWFUL. 9. In the lobby bathroom, only one soap dispenser had soap in it. 10. This hotel needs some renovating / updating in a major way. Pro's: 1. The people working here are very nice. 2.

We chose the hotel because of the central location. It is one block away from the monorail station to the Seattle Center (including the space needle). It is also close walking distance to many of the downtown stores as well as the tourist attractions like the Pike Place Market. I've included pictures below which offer some perspective on the location. The hotel has 2 round towers (north and south). We were on the 26th floor with a view out of the city towards the bay and the space needle. We were able to see our cruise ship when it docked that morning. However, since the hotel is round the views will vary greatly from room to room. There are also a number of new high rise buildngs in the area so these can also block the view. We noticed noise from several of the adjoining rooms, at one point, just as we were falling asleep, the best description was someone threw there shoe against the wall. But this quieted down soon afterwards. We also noticed the elevator going up and down but it was more of a \"feeling\" than an \"irritation\". We had to wait often for the elevators, athough it seems that maybe at least one wasn't working properly. We advised the hotel and it seemed to improve after that. One thing we did notice is that they do not allow luggage to be taken on the escalator (they had an employee stationed there) and you had to go up a level from the parking level to the lobby (and vice versa). These elevators also serviced the south tower. When we arrived, there was a very long line of people waiting for the elevator. Not sure if this is just an occurance when large groups are arriving/leaving but you should plan time just in case. Also, if you come by car, they offer 2 parking options, self park ($36) and valet ($39) per day with in and out privileges and these are both located on the 6th avenue side of the hotel.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenacres, WA", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite Place to stay in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Swirlz5", "ReviewID": "UR66266157", "Content": "Memorial day was our first time bringing the kids with us to the Westin.

There were a few cons. First, the hotel really nickel and dimes you by charging $39/day for valet parking/$22 per day for reg parking (a charge you don't find out about till you get there) and I was even charged for 2 calls I made to room service during my stay. I mean, I can see charging for phone calls, but calls within the hotel?? give me a break! I also had to call the hotel a couple of times; once on questions about getting food after the restaurant was closed, another about a question regarding my receipt.. Both times I found the help on the other end of the line to be rather cold and apathetic. Not something that I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Finally, the elevators in this building are creepy! It seemed like everyone in the elevators with me was kind of nervous. they just seem really old, really dirty, and like they haven't been serviced in a long, long time. the ride up and down is really bumpy. it just doesn't feel right. I mean, it's probably okay in all honesty. But again, $160+ per night for a room and they still have crappy old elevators from the 1970's? not to mention, they are totally worn down and dirty? it was odd.

The bathroom had twin showers which were awesome. The hotel does recommend that you only use one head for water conservation however, it was lovely to indulge once in a while.

It was a preferred guest floor, although I'm not a \"preferred guest.\" Everyone I came in contact with at the hotel was friendly. From the front desk to the cafe workers to the operators and housekeeping. I parked in the adjacent parking lot to the hotel (make sure you tell them you were a guest of the hotel and remember your room number so it will be an $18 charge and not a $28 charge.) I walked to the drug store last night and got a wave and a friendly \"welcome back!\" from the valet desk, and it's little things like that that make a stay more pleasant. I really liked the workout room. I had it to myself and the music in the room was adjustable. There were magazines, clean headsets, towels, lockers and a water cooler to make my visit comfortable. I biked for a half hour and enjoyed cable TV on my bike with the headset. There were a lot of people taking advantage of the free wifi in the lobby. But most of the common areas were bare. When it came time to check out, there was only one couple ahead of me, and I was quickly waved over to the preferred guest check out since they had no one there, so I didn't have to wait. I saw a bottled water in the minibar that said \"our compliments preferred guest\" and mistakenly thought it was free. When I told the woman at the desk when I checked out, she immediately removed the $5 from my bill, no hassle whatsoever. (Pizza and tiny dessert, no beverage, was $50. Gah.) My only complaints: the phone and alarm clock were dusty. When I sank into the tub after my workout, there were gross hairs on the ledge next to the tub. There was dust and some long hairs around the glasses on the bathroom sink. Bleh, stuff like that really bugs me. The only other things I could think that bothered me don't apply to everyone. My daughter and I ordered room service and were stuck with a pizza because we're vegetarians and everything seemed to have meat in it. Odd for Seattle. Also, although the beds ARE dreamy, they were down. I could see little feathers floating around. The problem with this is that down feathers are obtained by hanging live birds upside down and ripping the feathers out on a systematic basis. It's one of the crueler, more painful animal procedures out there. Again, I thought this was something odd in Seattle, because you generally see a lot of concern for the environment and the animals here. All in all, I had a great time and will be back!

Lots of goods tips from other reviewers including the cheaper ($18 per day) parking on the north side of the hotel along 5th Ave connected by the 2nd floor skybridge. Pulled into the drive-thru area on arrival and they allowed us to leave the car there for 15 minutes while we checked in. That was plenty of time as there was no line at the counter. At other times during our stay I noticed short lines at checkin - luck of the draw like any hotel. Check-in was friendly with certainly no hint of an anti-Priceline bias as one reviewer claimed. We were given our choice of towers so we went with the north and asked for a view if possible. We ended up on the 30th floor and did in fact have a good view of the Sound. The room was fine. We went with the King and put the kids on the pull-out sofa. Thanks to another reviewer for that suggestion. We used the pool a couple of times with the kids. The top row of tiles needs a good scrub but it seemed fine otherwise. I couldn't bring myself to use the big hot tub. There was a healthy dose of foam on top and it looked like it needed a good dose of something.

The inside has been fully refurbished with a very modern and relaxing interior design. The double shower-head is a winning touch, and the mattresses are the best that I've found in Seattle so far. The \"white tea\" soaps smell really, really good. Westin is not the best in Seattle, however. The sheets didn't smell especially clean and almost appeared re-used. I had to look closely for the proverbial hair that would have had me calling the front desk to request a room with clean sheets, but the hair was nowhere to be found, so I figured that maybe the sheets sit in storage for awhile after being cleaned and pressed, or maybe the bleach is highly diluted during washing, or just maybe... In favor of Westin Seattle's cleanliness, I will say that there's was the first in-room coffee maker that I have used. That's because after the second time running straight water through the machine, the water actually came out clean and without that proverbial rancid coffee smell that characterizes most in-room coffee makers. Since I could probably write much more than might be appropriate for this forum, I'll skip to the main reasons why Westin Seattle is not the best. Number two (other than being less-clean than other Seattle hotels - such as the Mayflower) - there is a lot of glass (and a balcony) but NO WINDOW TO OPEN. For a lower price The Warwick has a lot of glass too, but you can actually walk right out onto the balcony and get some fresh air! Number three - no free wifi in the rooms. Four - every time a housekeeper brought something up to my room she or he would pause for a second before leaving as if *waiting* for a tip. They could be a little more slick about it since people either have the tip already in-hand or they don't. If there is so much stress over tipping that the housekeepers fear that by leaving the doorway they will lose the tip, then I am forced to wonder just how underpaid they might be. I guess that explains the cleaning discrepancy perhaps. I get the impression that the enormous \"twin towers\" of a different decade are now a little to expensive to maintain as a hotel, especially since everything - including internet access on the guest computers provided in the lobby - cost at least 10 dollars extra. That hasn't been my experience at other Seattle hotels. Let's call it a day already Westin Seattle and replace it with a modern tower that doesn't cost so much to maintain.

Location: The Westin is centrally located in 5th Avenue, within walking distance of the Pike St Markets and the CBD, Puget Sound etc, and short monorail ride to the Space Needle. It was a good location to get pretty much wherever you wanted without too much hassle. Rooms: Good, quite spacious and fabulously comfortable beds.

The bathroom was quite good although the shower was over the bath and my preference is for a separate shower recess \u2013 however the water was nice and hot and it had good pressure, and everything was clean. Restaurants: There is a small cafe of sorts on the ground floor which served breakfast, but it was poorly run, too small for a hotel of that size and the service could have been much better.

The \"heavenly\" showerhead had no water pressure, and I had to sqaut down to get my head wet because the shower head was placed so low. The couch in the room had suspicious stains on it, as did the curtains. The walls were scuffed up too. The wall colors were sea-foam green and just seemed tired and worn out. Room service is out-of-control. A breakfast of just oatmeal would have cost me over $14. The small cafe was adequate, but was limited on choice there too. Parking at the Westin is $36/day, which is ridiculous, and they don't offer free wi-fi. Be wary of conferences and events taking place in the ballrooms.

I booked a night for Valentine's day weekend via Hotwire for a great price hoping to have a fun and romantic time in Seattle downtown. However, upon arriving at front desk I was shocked when the guest rep. stated we were assigned TWO FULL size BEDS!!! Are you kidding?! I was aware of the fact that by booking through hotwire you are not guaranteed a king size bed or a double..However, I called a few days before our check in date to request for a king size bed. Also keep in mind that I booked this a little over a month prior to our check in date. On the day of check in about an hour prior to arriving at the Westin, I called again to check what kind of room we were going to be in. Rep clearly assured me that we were assigned ONE KING SIZE bed. So here's what really upset me: The simple fact that I was told one thing AN HOUR prior to arrival and then another when we got there. I totally understand that yes you are not guaranteed anything if booked using a third party website..However, aren't these employees trained well enough to know what they are talking about?!? When we finally got to our room I decided to call and requested to speak with a manager. First I went through a couple people claiming they did not know who their manager was or they didn't have one because they were in the reservations dept (HA, right). I finally spoke to James- one of the managers at the Westin who was very patient w/ me and nice about the whole situation. I definitely expressed my frustration and he explained some things I was not aware of as far as policies and what to expect from booking via websites (e.g. Hotwire, Expedia, etc.) I felt a little bit better after speaking with him- he even sent a bottle of wine later on that night for us. The wine was another issue. (what we thought would take 10 minutes after getting off the phone with him took an hour so we decided to call back and had it delivered at a later time since we had to be elsewhere.) We appreciated the wine..however, I just felt that was the wrong hotel to be in after waiting an hour for it. There was a mini-fridge w/ all kinds of beverages including alcohol in our room. I do not recall seeing a sign anywhere saying there was a sensor nor did the lady who checked us in warned us that my card would be charged if you lift any of the drinks. My partner decided to remove all the beer cans (about $8/ea) so we can store the wine in there instead. There were several cans that were removed and of course WE WERE NOT AWARE we would be charged until I checked my credit card statement today. SO I call today, front desk rep tells me I have to call back tomorrow during business hours and speak with \"Accounting.\" I am already dreading to make this call. I've invested too much time and energy with these people. The only good thing I can say about this place is the location. Yes it's near everything, but there are so many other hotels that can provide BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, better staff in the area that you should consider. We stayed at the GRAND HYATT in downtown the following evening and we definitely noticed the HUGE difference once arriving there..They had the friendliest staff, (rep who checked us in made us aware of the mini fridge sensor) nicer loby, beautiful room, view, location, BETTER SERVICE!!! so don't waste your time at the WESTIN, i definitely regret my decision because my expectations were not met at all. WESTIN is a 4 start hotel and so is THE GRAND HYATT, so shouldn't the customer service level be the same?? If not, even higher? THE GRAND HYATT definitely stood out w/ us. The WESTIN- not so much. I would never recommend this place, the faculty don't seem to care- it takes 10 rings before someone can pick up your call, guest reps are rude esp. over the phone, It takes an hour to deliver a bottle of wine, lots of noises from the upper level *not sure if it was maintance or what- If you don't want to waste your time explaining errors to management, calling them over and over, writing reviews such as this, don't stay there!

The beds. The heavenly beds are just that -heavenly! Had perfect sleeps both nights. The bad: 1. The service isn't bad, just not really there. Nobody said hi to me in the 2 days I was there, other than the front desk of course. I don't like to pick on that, but even a friendly 'hello, how are you today?' and a smile would be nice. No one is grumpy by any means, but they don't exactly go out of their way to make you feel at home either. Maybe it was just my experience. 2. The carpets/floors desperately need to be upgraded. It was kind of dirty and not very nice. 3. parking is ridiculous at $36/day. TIP: DO NOT park in their parking lot. There is a parking lot a block away on 5th ave off lenora that is half the price. It says westin on the building but is not owned by westin anymore. It's only $18. Please heed this advice. 4. No free internet anywhere. You have to pay for it in your hotel room (!), and have to pay for it downstairs on the main floor! Not cool. Overall it's a nice hotel. The TV isn't HD, for me I like to watch sports, for someone else it might not matter. The bathrooms were very nice as well, other than the tub looked like it needed to be re-caulked.

Knowing that hotel rooms at decent properties in Seattle are quite expensive I chose to do a name your own price selection through Priceline. The hotel which won my bid was the Westin in downtown Seattle. I was initially pleased. I\u2019ve stayed at Westins in different parts of the U.S. before. They are generally quality locations and typically cater to business and convention travelers. This seems apparent with regard to the fees they charge for things that other hotels include as part of your room stay. Services like Wi-Fi and parking are not included at the Westin, but are at other brands of hotels. That is just a limited example, but I think illustrates my point. Upon arriving we found the front desk staff friendly in that typical Westin way, young bucks just out of college or hospitality school who are dressing way beyond their pay grade and paid to be friendly and ingratiating. It is much better than being sneered at by the night desk clerk at a budget motel, but it still has a corporate insincerity to it that is hard to disguise. Our room was reasonably nice, on an upper floor of the building. The view was of downtown Seattle and not the bay, but it was still very pleasant. I was a little confused as to why my wife and I were given a room with double beds, but I associate that with booking through Priceline. Unfortunately, for a 4+ star property, the beds and room d\u00e9cor were not nearly up to standard. The bed linens were the typical nice linens you see at all Westins, however the mattresses themselves were very uncomfortable and felt worn out. The furnishings in the room looked well worn; corners of end tables and desks were scratched up and marred from guest use and abuse. There was a patch hole in the carpet right at the foot of a bed in a high traffic area. The work desk was generous and the view from it was very nice, but the chair accompanying the desk was beyond worn out and leaned to one side. The side chairs in the room looked very work, and one of them was heavily stained. The bathroom was very clean and was probably the nicest part of the room. It was as if the bathroom had been remodeled recently, but the rest of the room had not been given any attention in many years. The provided soaps and toiletries were top notch as usual. It was especially nice to have a flip cap on the shampoo and conditioner. Nothing is more annoying than hotel sized soaps that you have to unscrew with wet hands in the shower. The most annoying part of this stay, was having to pay to park. I had to pay $36 to park for one overnight stay. Not acceptable. The Westin Seattle is a nice hotel to stay in, certainly not a dump by any means, but nickel and diming for services others provide as part of the room rental is not acceptable in this day in age.

It used to be closer to the center and then the city moved. So if you are going to meet with companies or see the sites at this end of town it is a good location. The towers are 40 and 50 years old roughly. I stayed in the north tower which was nice. The idea of the rooms is they radiate out from a point thus the outside of the room is larger than the inside since the towers are roundish. The big negative I had was the lack of view. I paid for a view high floor room which was 3432. There are quite a few towers surrounding parts of the hotel so I had a great view of the space needle to the left and the office building to the right. IF YOU STAY HERE AND WANT A VIEW, GO OUTSIDE FIRST AND LOOK AT WHICH ARE HAS A CLEAR VIEW OF THE CITY OR THE WATER. Then go back inside and ask which way the rooms face. You could paye extra for a high floor like 3436 and be looking at an office building. The service is good, the rooms are nicely appointed in the north tower and I got the higher floor for $142 - the lower ones werw $112. These rates are very reasonable. I liked the hotel is is not one of the newer or well remodeled but at this rate it was very nice.

We weren't planning on driving, so it was very important for us that we're close enough to attractions, shopping, etc etc. We got our room through Hotwire for $76/night before taxes and additional charges. We stayed for 7 nights. It's a big saving for us considering the hotel web site was going for at least $300/night. In that regard, we're very happy with what we received. If I were to pay full price, I may have been more critical. Let me explain why. We arrived before their check-in time. The Mr. had done a bit of research prior to arriving, so he requested the North Tower. Perhaps we got lucky because I've heard people who usually book through discounted sites usually get regular rooms on the lower floor without view. We were checked into one of the Starwood Preferred levels *I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for the big giant sign that greeted us as we got off the elevator*, and the room had a gorgeous view of Elliott Bay and slight view of the Space Needle (see pictures attached). We did mention that we're Starwood members, except we weren't getting points since we didn't book direct. Not sure if that had anything to do with it. Pros: - The room itself is actually quite large. It fits a sofa, desk, a bed, and still has room to move around. In fact, this may have been the largest hotel room we've ever stayed at. Disclaimer: I have no idea if all rooms are as large as the ones we stayed in. Perhaps for the view rooms, but not the regular? - Location location location. About 15 mins (or less) walk to Pike Place Market, and about a block or two away from a couple shopping malls - One block from the Monorail - Free internet in the lobby; not free in the Business Center, so be sure to bring your own computer - Helpful staff; okay, they're not necessary friendly per say, but they're all very helpful. Cons: - I am usually a big fan of Westin bedding, but not this time. The pillows were extremely soft. we had lots of pillows, but for some reasons, they were all super soft, not enough fluff. While the bed itself was comfy, I woke up with neck pain. Thankfully, they provided us with enough pillows that I ended up sleeping on three pillows to support my neck. The Mr. who is not as sensitive as I am when it comes to pillows also agreed that the pillows were just too soft. - Stained carpet and the older furniture (see picture of the couch) made the room look a bit outdated. Not that big of a deal, but I'd put this under something that can be improved. - Very small Workout rooms (there are two of them; one of them is a lot smaller than the other). - The room is actually set up quite nicely, except for the TV (please see picture). The TV is not set directly in front of your bed or the couch. So, unless you're sitting at the desk right in front of the TV, you have to tilt your head a bit. You can however, tilt the TV, except two people can't be really sitting at different places for you to enjoy it. For instance: the Mr. can't be sitting on the couch while I'm on the bed if we want to enjoy the TV. Again, not a big deal for some people. I can't live without TV (even when I'm on vacation), so this was a major pain for me. - Thin walls. I could hear people talking in the hallway in the morning and at night. Overall, it was a very good stay at Westin.

Seattle public transportation is very convenient to others areas and buses are free downtown.

After a lifetime of staying at Best Westerns and Holiday Inns, this was a welcome change. I had asked to check in early and they gave me a room at 12:30pm. However, I was disappointed when I was told they couldn't give me a room with a view of the Space Needle. I think it's because I booked the room through Expedia. I was on the 36th floor by the elevators and the ice machine. One thing I really noticed was that the walls were very thin. I could hear people talking in the corridor, or doors closing. I remember being awakened by voices outside my room. I was also given a room with two queen beds. Although it's no biggie, I would've preferred just one king bed. I really liked the furnishings, though. The Starbucks coffee pods were a nice touch, too. The bed was really plush, although a bit too soft for me. But the pillows were heavenly! The room was clean, and I was glad to find out everything looked immaculate. No stains or tears on the carpet, no smokey odor. Everything looked tasteful. I didn't watch much TV because the reception was poor - not true HD, and the channels were limited. The Westin Seattle is perfect for a solo traveler like me who will be getting around town by foot or public transportation. From the airport, I boarded the light rail to the downtown station in Westlake Center Mall and walked less than ten minutes to the hotel.

We didn't know what to say so we just went along with it, but now I wish I had fought back. This other Hotel was very dark, had lots of loud music, and full of teenagers and/or college students. The room wasn't much better and after a good cry we decided to go back home. I never did have my wedding night. A year later around our first anniversary I felt reminded of this event and wrote The Westin an email encouraging them to be more sensitive to their guests, because you never know the impact a guest's stay can have. Surprisingly they wrote back, confirmed that my story was true, and to my amazement offered us a one night's stay in one of their deluxe suites. Although this couldn't make up for the importance of our actual wedding day I thought it was a sweet gesture and appreciated their apology, so we accepted. Some time went by, and we never received the certificate we were told would arrive in the mail. When I tried to contact them to see what was going on they never responded.

The headboard had separate dimmer lights so that either occupant could read without disturbing the other. Nice touch, I thought. Great sleeping. The mattress was very good quality.

I also decided to spend a little more than I normally would for lodging, because we'd only be there a few days and wanted it to be special. Yes, I did spend more than I would have at the other nearby hotels I was looking at, but there was definitely nothing special about the Westin. In fact, it was very standard and like most other hotels I've stayed in. I should've saved $50 a night somewhere else or save $100 by using a bidding site. The location is very good. Right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, next to the Monorail, and within easy walking distance of Pike Place. Everything was clean, though the carpets were worn and dated. Elevator service was awful, as there were only two per tower and waits were excessive (we actually almost missed our shuttle to the airport because of the elevators).

We had the lovely Marissa at the front desk (as noted by another reviewer...one of three Marissa's apparently), and she was pleasant, professional and courteous. The lobby was PACKED! There was a group going out to a cruise, and several people checking in also (wearing *Mariners* t-shirts, in anticipation for the game the following day), so the *mood* in the lobby was an infectious excitement...it was a good start to our stay. Our room was lovely...although, I do admit I was happy when she mentioned the \"south tower\" (check previous reviews). We were on the 30th floor with a view of the water if you stretched to look at it...but all in all, we were happy with it. The bed was very comfortable, but (again, as noted by another reviewer), the walls were thin. We did not use the pool facilities, fitness room, or eat at the hotel restaurants, so I cannot comment on any of those. We only had a delay once when waiting for the elevators, so that was not a real concern to us. The cost of the in-room Internet is a bit disconcerting. There were always several people using their laptops in the lobby area which saved the in-room expense. Our maid service was prompt and courteous. We would see them in the hallways, and one time my husband was in the room catching up on some phone calls, and they were very considerate and professional in doing their work. The location was wonderful...we took a walk down to the Marketplace, but the walk back up was a bit more strenuous. We could handle it , but were not really prepared for how steep and hilly it was in that area. We also attended the Mariners game, but took a taxi which was convenient and always in abundance from what we could see. We also had rented a car and parked in the adjacent building...a little more challenging to find initially, but for the cost savings, very convenient in the long run. The walkway was very handy. I took our vehicle out to go shopping one day and asked the attendant if I would have any problem on the return, and she said no..I did have to park on the 6th floor of the parking garage, but that didn't prove any hardship.

The woman at the front desk was really nice--the room we were originally given had 2 double beds, but since we only wanted/needed one she gave us a queen size been in a handicapped room. The room itself was spacious, but quite a mess. There were stains ALL OVER the floor--I didn't really want to walk around barefoot on that carpet. There were ugly tangles of cords behind the desk and the table with the coffee maker. The lights also had too many switches that weren't properly synced with the wall switches, and a few of the outlets in the room didn't work. Since we were in a handicapped accessible room our bathroom had a large open shower, which wasn't too bad. Though I was really wishing I'd brought some \"shower shoes\" because the tile in the bathroom didn't seem very clean. We were on the 42nd floor and had a great view despite a new condo high rise being built across the street. The hotel's location is perfect--in walking distance to Pike's Place Market and the Seattle Center (Space Needle) and to the monorail to the Seattle Center (if you don't want to walk). We actually walked all over Seattle. There is a restaurant across the street, Icon Grill was also good and the service was fantastic. As mentioned before, there is free Wi-Fi in the lobby, which means it's always PACKED with people. Plus, the lobby bar is exactly that--open right to the lobby, so people drinking are basically sprawled out throughout the entire lobby. We actually were having drinks down there one night and there was a loud group of middle-aged people there (for a convention I believe) who were obviously drunk--it made me feel bad for the parents with children who were just checking in.

Check-in was great\u2014friendly staff and no attitude about, or even mention of, our Priceline deal. Our room was ready for us early, and they offered to help with luggage. We heard rumors of long elevator waits (reportedly 25 minutes), but experienced no such thing; elevators were very prompt and fast, every time.

The bed was surprisingly a \u201cMurphy\u201d type pull-down bed, which upon reflection could be considered a plus, if you wanted to use the room for a business meeting. (It probably makes it easy for the cleaning staff to vacuum too.) Linens and pillows were very nice. The bed might be too soft for some people, but I found it very comfortable. The shower/tub had two shower heads, but the wimpy water pressure did not allow the benefits of that feature to be experienced. Curved shower curtain, flex-arm mirror, and \u201cHeavenly\u201d bath products were nice features. Surprisingly, there was no fan in the bathroom. Wireless internet was available for free in the lobby and restaurants, but for a fee in the room. Street noise was present, but not bad at a dull roar, normal for a city hotel.

The pool was closed during May, but the Westin website warned us of that condition. They expect it to be up and running mid June. The main lobby bar is still closed for renovation, but the secondary bar is open, and the lobby is nice again.

The grout on the floor of the bathroom was crusted with deposits, with the grout under the floating vanity the original clean white color. Needless to say we put towels down on the floor every day. The room carpet was stained in several places and felt thin underfoot. The carpeting had jagged edges and dust balls where it met up against the wall, almost like someone had forgotten to put baseboards in to cover the seam. The furniture also needs some refurbishment, one dresser drawer and one nightstand drawer had the bottom panel nearly popped out, and the desk chair had some padding coming through the seams. The bedding was a high point, Westin's Heavenly Bed is among the best I've ever experienced, with crisp sheets and a really nice pillowtop mattress. We slept great every night of the stay. We stayed on the 34th floor of the North Tower, which offers views of Puget Sound. However, there is a tall hotel/condo building under construction right across the street that has now blocked off a third of the view and light that usually comes in. Disappointing, to say the least, considering the price premium for water views. The location is excellent if you want to be able to walk to a lot of places. Pike Place Market is only a few blocks to the west, the waterfront and ferries are about a mile away, and for shopping the flagship Nordstrom, a large Macy's, lots of boutique shops, and the Westlake and Pacific Place shopping centers are within a block or two's radius. Benaroya Hall and the Public Library are also within half a mile, if you want to catch a performance or gawk at at modern architecture. If you like doughnuts, do yourself a favor and go to Top Pot Doughnuts a couple of blocks up 5th Ave. from the hotel. Delicious and inexpensive, snag a table on the second floor to people-watch as you chow down. We would stay here again due to the convenience, but would save a few bucks by going with a city view room. The value proposition is rarely there when you have such a good location, so we'll just note the few cleanliness issues to the housekeeping staff for next time. Positives: + Great location + Cab stand outside hotel + Westin Heavenly Bed + Great meeting rooms Not-so-great: - Rooms could be cleaner - Partially-obstructed views of waterfront due to construction - Pricey room service", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cWow, a PERFECT stay here\u201d", "Author": "inspiration100", "ReviewID": "UR31337199", "Content": "After having stayed in the Edgewater and several other Seattle hotels, this hotel beats them all.

The entire staff was friendly, the hotel was very clean, and they upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 34th floor overlooking the city. Thank you Westin Seattle! I appreciate this hotel upgrading people to higher floors when they are not sold out! That's what I call good service. The rooms at this hotel are decently large with a very nice TV and superb views of the entire city. The hotel's pool was out of commission but they made up for it by offering free access to either the Sheraton's pool or the Warwick. They also were willing to pay the taxi fare to get to the pool!

The bed was very comfortable, the TV was nice and big (flat screen) Starbucks coffee and assorted teas in the room, free wireless if you bring your computer. The business center let us print off our boarding passes for our flight the next morning, but wanted to charge something like $7/HR for internet use. Easy to get to the airport, we made it in 20 min, so good location for that as well as walking to Pike Place, which is a must do! You can also pick up the monorail a block away, which we did to get to the Space Needle. It was $4 round trip per person. Worth it. I would stay here again, if I got a good price.

The location is very convenient, centrally located downtown next to the shopping district, two blocks from Pikes Market, 4 blocks from the piers and a short walk to the Space Needle district. It is also adjacent to the end of the monorail line so you can hop that easily as well. It is also just 2 blocks off of I-5 so very easy to drive in and out. It is a large hotel and clearly a convention mecca. We were there when a convention was going on and it was awfully overcrowded. I would normally avoid staying for that reason. Fortunately I knew the convention was ending the next day and we would then stay on in a much more pleasant atmosphere. And I was right. Once the 580 rooms of conventioneers moved out, we were able to upgrade our room to the 39th floor with great view of the sound and the Olympic mountains beyond. The lobby and restaurants were more pleasant. The staff, by the way, was very attentive with or without the crowds. Overall we had a great stay. Our room was strategically arranged with the bed hidden from view but facing the view through the large picture windows. So we could feel comfortable in the room with drapes wide open to enjoy the view at night and wake to the sun reflecting off the snow capped mountains. Room is typical Westin, comfortable and 'contemporary'. The king beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms clean and updated. There is ample room for luggage. Room includes desk as well as couch seating area. I will state my standard complaint about the entire Westin chain...all the 'extras' are always horribly overpriced. Internet access is $13/night (it's free at Hampton Inns!), minibar is $5 for a 3-Musketeers bar and Valet parking is $39/night plus tips. So even if you got a deal on a room, or you are staying on your Starwood points, you might find you still dropping $60-$70 per night on these 'extras'. You have been warned. Since this is Seattle, there are Starbucks, Tully's and Seattle's best all nearby. And lot sof great restaurants all around. So you do not at all need to feel trapped. I highly recommend Buenos Aries Grill, just two blocks up on Virginia St. Excellent Argentinian style restaurant, great steaks and empanadas and a nice atmosphere.

While the building is not new, this design element gives an elegant look to the shape of the rooms and interior. Interior of the rooms are done in soft beige tones. Coordinating colors throughout the room and bath area. Dual shower heads and a Toto toilet add to the nice touches. Ice machines are on every floor. King size bed was very comfortable although the pillows were a bit flat. Flat screen TV and a cordless telephone was present in the room. Now the devil in the details - The pool is out of commission - they say until the end of May 2009. The front desk offered to reimburse taxi fare if we went down to the Sheraton to use the pool there. To some it may be 'Sleepless in Seattle' but the reality is its usually 'Raining in Seattle'. The Sheraton is too far especially if you're just looking to use the pool with kids.

Not once was I told that they were doing construction nearby (I called several times). There is construction going on across the street from the South and North Towers. The construction started at 6:00am until 7:00pm. Just when I thought I would get a break on Saturday it started at 7:00am. The rooms are very outdated. This isn't the nicest Westin I have stayed at. I only stayed at this hotel due to the location and price. My original plan was to stay at \"The Inn at the Market\". They couldn't guarantee me a water view so I canceled, big mistake on my part. Seriously spend the extra money and stay at the \"Inn at the Market\". The hotel is beautiful and small. Back to the Westin, I was able to check in at 11:00am and was very happy about the early check in. I informed the front desk clerk that it was my birthday and could I get upgraded. He sent me to the South Tower. The room was really small and had a view of a building under construction. The room also had a big stain on the floor (I'm thinking animal urine). I couldn't figure what was the upgrade. The room looked like a basic room (nothing special). I went back down and spoke to another clerk she said she could put me in the North Tower (which has water views). She did inform me that it would have double beds though (fine with me). The clerk that originally helped me came over and loudly said \"What's the problem I put you in an upgraded room\", which I found rude considering he didn't know what I was asking from the second clerk. I apologized for the confusion and informed him that I thought the \"upgrade\" would be a water view. I went to the second room and this had a water view but it also had a view of construction that was going on across the street. The room was a little dirty, the night stand had a layer of dust on it and one of the curtains was coming down. Also this room had a small stain on the floor as well. The only thing that was not dated in this room was the bedding. This hotel seriously needs to be updated. I paid $150 per night (and felt ripped off) and I wouldn't recommend spending over a $100 a night. (Especially with all the noise due to the two construction sites). Again, the location is great and there are tons of restaurant to go to that are in walking distance. You can also catch the airport shuttle right outside of the hotel.

We were in one tower, and used the jacuzzi/pool in the other tower. You do feel a little silly walking through the entire lobby wearing a white bathrobe, but oh well! The Dec stay was for our annual Christmas night in Seattle with the kids. When we checked in they had run out of kids' goodie bags, so they gave us a free in-room movie credit. We had an Executive Suite, which seemed more like two rooms they had joined together. There was a living room area with a sofa, tv, desk, and a pull-down bed, as well as a full bath. You open the adjoining doors (two sets) and enter the bedroom, which had a king bed, desk, and sofa, and also another full bath. The kids loved having their own \"room\" and they thought the pull-down bed was pretty cool and comfy. They brought up a little crib for our 2 yr old to use, too, which was nice. We donned our bathrobes (alas, no little robes for the kids, like the Fairmont does) and used the pool/jacuzzi--kids had a blast. We bought some snacks at the sundries shop downstairs, which were actually reasonably priced. After spending the evening out on the town we all came back for a good night's rest, as we had a Santa brunch the next day at Macy's. The kids sacked out pretty well; the rooms seem well-insulated from hotel noise and street noise (we were on the 35th floor). We sacked out on our own bed, and they don't call these Heavenly Beds for nothin'! It was such an incredibly comfortable bed, holy cow. We kept the curtains open and the downtown views were fantastic. We watched the flat-screen tv from our bed, which has really cool personal lights for reading, and it was great.

Here are some observations: Rooms: Extremely dated, stained carpets, old bathrooms with outdated fixtures and amenties - not nearly worth the almost $200 a night price tag. Even the once prized \"Heavenly Bed\" is nothing special at this time. Everyone including lower end hotels like Courtyard and Hyatt Place have better beds. \"Heavenly Bath\" is a joke. No-name, substandard bath products and tub/shower combinations abound. Old lighting, half of which didn't work, poorly placed TVs are standard. Low ceilings and \"old hotel\" scents are abundant. Service: Hotel staff were nice, but failed to deliver efficient, quality service. I had to call room service 3 times before recieving a cork screw. Check in staff were very good and eager to please. Food: I attended a meeting at this facility and the food was nasty. The eggs were runny at breakfast and the food was the typical \"rubber chicken\" type food that so many people speak of when they talk about conference food. Nothing worthy of praise in this arena including the dull meeting room, reminiscent of hospital waiting rooms. Safety: We had a high value item stolen from our group while we were at the hotel. Staff were pretty pathetic in there approach to resolving this situation. The best they did in an hour and a half was provide the non emergency number for Seattle Police Department. Overall, I am very disatisfied with this hotel. It is a few blocks off of an area that is safe and much more upscale. Stay at the Grand Hyatt or Sheraton. Avoid this very dated and underserviced property unless you pay under $100 per night. I have stayed at several other Westin hotels and this was the worst.

There are a bunch of treadmills, a couple of cross trainers and a few bikes (all with individual tv screens attached) and a whole separate area with weight machines. The Westin is really centrally located so I took off to find dinner and found a bunch of places within a block or two of the hotel. It's also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macy's are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place. Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin! The Westin prides itself on its \"Heavenly Beds\" and I couldn't agree more with them. That bed was AWESOME!! I fell asleep fast and woke up feeling really well rested! Saturday morning I got up, worked out, and went looking for breakfast. Although there are a lot of coffee shops nearby, I decided to head to Pike Place Market and see what I could find there. Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk from the Westin and is definitely a must see. Try to get there early though, because this is tourist central and it really got crowded later in the day. I got there a little too early, as people were still setting up their stalls, but I have never seen such beautiful looking produce and flowers! And the seafood!!! It looked so fresh and delicious! I went back to the Westin to pack up and check out. Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room. When I was ready to leave for the airport, I just went to the front and the Downtown Airporter bus pulled right up and took me to the airport for just $10.25 ($17 roundtrip)!

When asked this question, staff looked as though they were sympathetic, yet powerless. With this experience, I conclude that \"nice\" hotels can charge for image. So, if you don't mind staying somewhere where the walls are rice-paper thin, the food terribly over-priced and a staff of attentive drones, give the Westin your business. But heed my warning, \"you can't polish a ____\". However, if you want a stay where you are appreciated as a guest, where someone acknowledges that YOU COULD TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ANYWHERE, choose somewhere else. Posh Spice is in LA, not in the Westin Seattle (regardless of how they portray themselves).", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the money!\u201d", "Author": "isoruku", "ReviewID": "UR8118535", "Content": "I don't know how we managed, but we got a bargain price at the Westin, and loved it!

We had 2 rooms, both rooms were nice upon first glance. Both rooms had stained carpets. Our room was the worst of them. the desk table was chipped on the legs, it had a power strip taped to the side of it. The lamps and lamp shades on all of the tables were crooked and loose (I fixed them). the couch had huge white stains on them. The dressers were dirty. The headboard was dusty. The couch and chair had rips in them and the strings were still attached. The bathroom mirror was dirty, and the framing was off as well as when they stained the wood frame, they got some on the mirror and didn't even bother to fix it. There was a few long hairs in the bed and on the bathroom floor and in the bathroom there was brown spots on the ceiling that has never been wiped off. I travel quite often for work and have stayed in several 4 & 5 star hotels and I would not consider this a 4 or 5 star hotel. What you are paying for is the name...The best part of it all was I needed to use the restroom after walking back from the waterfront. I went into the lobby restroom and the urinals were yellow (no one bothered to flush, but on top of that, they were stained) so apparently it happens frequently. There were 6 stalls, 3 were being used, and the other 3 were overflowing with toilet paper and one of them was a red color. I informed the front desk clerk and she said oh really? I am sorry and that was it. I don't even know if or when she called maintenance or housekeeping but apparently they do not monitor their property (and this was a busy weekend mind you). Our first night was horrible. We went to bed about 9:30 pm. I was awaken several times between 10 pm and 12:30 am due to a party going on 2 doors down from us. We could hear the music clearly and then people coming and going and the door slamming shut, people having conversations in the hallway on the telephone inviting their other friends, swearing and drunkenness. I finally called the front desk to complain. They arrived about 20 minutes later and told the person in charge to be quiet or they were going to be removed. Finally, I got some sleep. I was not and am not overly impressed with this property and I will not stay there again. When we complained to the front desk clerk that checked us in, he did send up a bottle of champagne and a fruit basket for my daughter (it was her birthday) in addition to that, they signed a card and sent up a piece of cake.

It was not just closed, but locked witha deadblot, and the top latch thrown, too. This caught me completely off guard and when I opened it the room service attendant could tell I was flustered. I asked who closed and locked that door and he was as dumbfounded as me. All he could come up with was that the person in the room next to me had closed it perhaps to make it quieter....why the Westin even has doors like that is beyond me.

I love luxury hotels, but to me this Westin did not seem so much luxurious as it was simply trying to extract money from you at every turn, while supplying very few of the amenities that would make the extra money worth it. It was like paying Ritz-Carlton prices without the level of service and attention to detail that a Ritz or a JW Marriott delivers. If you are going to Seattle on business, find another hotel, there are plenty in the downtown area. If you are going for pleasure, either save your money and stay somewhere cheaper, as you will be walking the same areas, using the same downtown restaurants etc, or choose another luxury hotel that actually delivers.

Problems galore, which management chose to ignore. My biggest problem, far and away, was that they assigned my mother to a non-smoking room which stunk of cigarette smoke. Yes, all the rooms are now non-smoking but that does not mean that the hotel went to any effort to cleanse the former smoking rooms. Management moved my mother to another room, but guess what? It stunk too. It took a third move (at midnight) to finally resolve the matter. Lost in the shuffle was a northwest facing room (our primary reason for booking this hotel) and the connection to our own room (important b/c early-to-bed toddlers traveling along). Did management offer me a credit or refund? No. Did they adjust my rate to the non-view room rate? No. Did the apologize profusely? No, they didn't even attempt this most basic courtesy.

Had a great room on the 32nd floor, with a nice city view (I'm a Platinum Starwood member). My pet peeve with hotels is noise, so a connecting door to another room or excessive hallway noise is always a big downer for me. This was one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in. Possibly because my room was almost all the way around the tower from the elevator, but the lack of a long linear hallway seemed to make it very quiet. Loved the floor to ceiling windows (you need all the light you can get in Seattle). Bathroom was fairly average, with a pretty shallow tub (another pet peeve). The bed was angled diagonally into the room, and had a nice overbed light incorporated into the headboard with a dimmer switch. Nice touch, as I could actually read my book by this light (as opposed to the usual 40 watt bulb that is too dim to read by). You had to angle the TV over a bit to see it from the bed, which was a bit akward, but OK. The bed did not seem to be the typical Heavenly Bed mattress, it seemed much firmer, without the pillowtop mattress. It did have the Heavenly bedding sheets/comforter though. I was there for a meeting, and I must say the food we received in all the meeting rooms (breakfast, morning and afternoon snacks, and lunch), was terrific. Very healthy fare, and very tasty. I attend LOTS of business meetings in hotels, and the food at this Westin was some of the best I've had.

It has long been one of my favorite hotels, so my most recent experience was extremely disappointing. I should have worried at the outset - as I was met with hordes of airline crews upon my arrival - usually not a sign of a great hotel. In addition, the front door to the hotel off the taxi entrance was broken and resting askew like it had been hit by a car. Seemed dangerous to me, but no one from the hotel seemed concerned. I was greeted by a friendly desk person, but it soon became apparent that my reservation, made through the hotel toll-free reservation line, was seriously messed up. When a manager intervened, I was told that, sorry, but the room type you booked is not available, we are sold out, and we can give you what's left. So much for a loyal, multi-stay, gold status guest. Arriving at my room, in this now (thankfully) all non-smoking hotel, I was surprised to see an eight-foot smoke filter outside my room. Entering my room, I was greeting with the unmistakable scent of a smoking room. Guests be warned - even the now non-smoking hotels may find converting former smoking floors a challenge (hence the filter in the hallway.) I called the front desk to request a new room, and after several minutes on the phone the agent did come up with an alternative and said a bellman would be up within 15 minutes with a new key. After 45 minutes of waiting, trying not to disturb anything in the room I was moving out of, no bellman materialized so I called the desk again and asked for a manger. I was told there was no record of a room change being requested or made. To her credit, the manager recognized she had a very annoyed gold member on her hands and comped the room for the night. My tale of woe notwithstanding, I was really surprised by how the quality of this hotel seems to have slipped. I don't know if it's the heavy summer vacation/convention business or what, but the place was showing wear and lack of attention to upkeep. The towels were frayed and in a couple of cases had substances attached that made them unusable. There was no shower cap ammenity as you might expect and the bathroom just felt dirty. I could write my name in the dust on the headboard. The room felt tired - the Heavenly bed which was once so great even seems dated. My room service tray, left outside the door at 7pm, was still there at 9am the next day. Nonetheless, in the midst of this dismal stay there were bright spots. Room service was prompt and the food fresh and hot (when you're paying $27 for a burger - that's a good thing). The concierege was very, very good.

The workout room was like a real gym with plenty of equipment. Check in and out, valet, housekeeping all functioned well. I had one mishap with my laundry which the hotel corrected and they did not charge me, which was a very nice touch from such a big place.

We left for the day and they never got to the room until late afternoon. The housekeeper had never been told. Went to desk again.

I heeded the advice in other reviews and asked for a high room facing the water and away from the elevators. Overall, we were very pleased. The check-in staff was extremely helpful. So was the concierge. The housekeeping staff was also very helpful but not too intrusive. Our room on the 41st floor had an amazing view of downtown Seattle, the Space Needle, and the Puget Sound. It was especially beautiful at sunset. The windows are panoramic. The decor is contemporary and did not seem worn. The rooms were a little worn, but nothing to complain about. The bed was very comfortable with nice pillows and the two-headed shower was fantastic. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is right across the street from Westlake Center. The monorail to Seattle Center runs from there. There is a lot of other shopping and restaurants in the area. I recommend Assagio, which is 1.5 blocks away. We went to the Seattle Opera and took a cab rather than the monorail. The fair was only about $7 and that included fighting the theater traffic. The hotel is very lively. The gift shop was well stocked, there was a nice display of glass & 2-d art in the lobby, and we never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The only negatives: 1) The walls are extremely thin. The door that could potentially adjoin our room with the next room had a one inch gap at the bottom. Due to the gap & the thin walls, we could hear just about everything our neighbors said. The lack of privacy caused us to whisper at all times. 2) At 4:30am on Sunday morning, the fire alarm went off. Being on the 41st floor, and with visions of 9/11, we didn't take any chances and ran for it. At the 15th floor, we ran into a lot of other guests and a hotel staff person who told us it was a false alarm. Since the elevators were not working yet, we walked down to the lobby and then caught the elevator back up. Apparantly, it was a practical joke, probably pulled on the hotel as part of the football playoff festivities (Seahawks v. Panthers) that weekend. I can't blame the hotel, as this was out of their control. However, I was disappointed that there was no memo to the guests or other appologies given how disruptive the event was.

The rooms were relatively quiet, clean, and well appointed. That said, the hotel is definitely older and the design is just plain silly. The hotel consists of two round towers. Because each tower is round, all of the rooms are oddly shaped and a bit narrow from front to rear (as opposed to narrow from side to side as with most hotels). As a result, the bed is quite near the windows and you can hear some (very little) street noise. Again because of the round shape of the building, the elevator area is not separated from the rooms. Thus, several of the rooms are right next to the elevators and if you get one of them, as we did, you can hear the elevator bell ding whenever an elevator arrives and you can hear people talking while the waiting for the elevator. I have trouble sleeping and this noise didn't help. The bathrooms are also relatively small and have a shower curtain instead of a door, as most modern hotel rooms do. If your room faces the other tower, beware that people can (and do) look out their windows and will see into your room at night. The two guys in their underwear in the room opposite my kid's room apparently didn't know (or didn't care). Also, I was a little disappointed at how our bags were handled. When we arrived, there was no bell staff available so the doorman simply left our bags unattended at the other end of a long sidewalk next to a major street, instead of taking the bags into a more secure location while awaiting someone to transport them.

The hotel market is competitive in the high quality bracket, and in truth it is hard to go wrong with a 4-star, downtown hotel. Receltly I discovered Priceline gives great deals on Seattle hotels, and so bid on a 4-star room at $122/night. I got the Westin, and was not unhappy with staying there. With taxes and fees, the price came to $143/night. I thought the Westin was well worth it, despite the fact the hotel is the largest in downtown Seattle and is probably about 30 years old. It may be a big old sleeping factory, but it's still a good one. First off, the check-in was effortless. Perhaps there was no check-in line because we arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Nevertheless, there were enough people at the desk to handle the flow. Despite the fact we were Priceline customers, we were put on a high floor in a recently-remodeled room that had views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains, in the distance. The large windows were clean and very welcome, letting in light and making the smallish room feel larger, but did a good job keeping out street noise. We were greatly impressed with the quietness in the rooms. We never heard our neighbors making noise, any toilets flushing, or the bells announcing the arrivals of the elevators, just across the hall from our room. The in-room amenities were excellent; far better than comparably-starred Sheratons or Hiltons. We really liked the two-headed shower and the marble bath. My only complaint about the place is that dining options are not what they used to be. Roy's Restaurant and the Nikko Restaurant have departed. Nikko is now empty space and what has replaced Roy's is not as good. However, that dining complaint is a mere quibble.

Vons was one of my favorites. There is also a nice food court on the 4th floor of the Westlake Complex across the street where the monorail station is. I ate there often. The elevators are a bit scary, they shake and rattle and move quite fast. My room was on the 32nd floor, the Starwood Preferred Guest floor.

The coffee machine smelled badly like it needed a proper cleaning. I just ended up buying my coffee at the many Starbucks in the area. The fitness center is a tight squeeze. Each piece of aerobic equipment had its own tv and they had complimentary headphones to use. The indoor pool was freezing, so I only stuck my big toe in there.

I had made the reservation through the Starwood website because they had a promotion, stay two nights get the third for free. I read the reviews on this hotel so I wasn't expecting it to be perfect but since I got a good deal I figured I couldn't lose much. When we first checked in they told me they didn't have any king bed rooms available on a high floor like I had requested. This was a little upsetting because not only did I request a King size bed on a high floor at the time of the reservation, but I had also called a couple times a couple weeks in advance just to remind them. The guy at the check-in counter told me they had a room with a great view but double beds but if we wanted a king it would be on a lower floor. I asked if we could go see it first before deciding and he gave us a key to go look at it. The double beds were much too small if we wanted to sleep comfortable together for three nights so we took the key back down and told them we wanted a room with a king bed. I asked again if they were sure there wasnt any king rooms on a high floor. This time they had me wait about 10 minutes and then said they found one. I felt really happy and thanked the clerk for trying harder to find us a room. We went to our room and expected that they would send our bags up within 10 minutes or so (we requested they be delivered to our room when we valet parked). About a half hour went by and still no sign of our luggage. I called the \"Service Hotline\" from the room in the phone to find out what was going on. The lady was really helpful and said she would call me back. She called back about 20 minutes later and said that she couldnt get a hold of the front desk because they weren't answering the phone. By this time almost an hour had past since we got into our room so I decided to go back down to the lobby to talk to the front desk myself. I told the man that checked us in that we hadnt received our luggage yet and he said it would be up shortly. I went back to the room and got another call from the lady at the Service center and she asked me what our bags looked like, which was scary considering I would hope they have some sort of tracking system for the bags. Eventually the bags showed up about an hour and a half after we arrived in our room. We also had to cancel a dinner reservation becuase we didnt have our clothes to change into. While I am grateful we recieved our bags and they didnt get lost, It was upsetting that this would happen in a hotel like this. Apparently our bags had been put into the first room we looked at and were left there Other than the incident with the bags I didnt have much else to complain about. I wouldnt recommend the pool or spa, it was croweded with kids and indoors so it wasnt very relaxing. But if a pool isnt a big deal the hotel is in a great loaction. Also the hotel didnt smell very clean. We didnt eat at the restaurant so I cant really comment on that. The location and the view are definetely the best things about the Westin.

I share this by way of leading up to the major problem with this hotel. Arriving in the driveway, there was a ton of activity. No one was available to meet the cab or help with luggage (the ones that Alaska DIDN'T send to Reno). Dragged the bags inside and upstairs myself. Next comes the checkin area. It is seemingly ALWAYS busy. This is a huge hotel, and while there are several people at the front desk there's never enough for the volume they do. Fortunately there's a SPG Gold/Platinum checkin line in a separate 'room' at the far right, but even that had a line. Checkin agents here, both times I've stayed, have appeared to act like checking me in was a great chore, standing in the way of something they'd rather be doing. I've never gotten a terrific upgrade here, but have never had a problem getting a room with direct view of the water. The views here are wonderful. Continuing the theme of busy hotel staff -- too busy to help -- I asked about a bellman to assist with luggage and was told that I could wait (awhile) for one, but that I'd probably just want to take bags upstairs myself. I had a room view a great view of the water on a high floor, somewhere in the 30s. Heavenly bed is great as usual, better on this stay than when I was here in September (that time the bed seemed pretty worn, proibably close to needing replacement, and wasn't as comfortable as I've come to expect). Heavenly bath seems more or less limited to a shower curtain extending out into the bathroom to create the illusion of a bigger shower/tub. Room itself was a bit worn, scratches in the wallpaper and some stains in the bathroom.

After my stay with the Westin, I can honestly say that I will never stay with them again. They even offered me a free stay in the future to show that they can do better, but I'd rather go to a clean hotel. Here's my experience: First, we checked in at 4pm (checkin for the Westin is listed as 3pm). They did not have our room ready, they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes to half an hour. Both my boyfriend and I were fine with that. We said that was Ok, we would just get some food. Here's the first complaint... The hotel has 800+ rooms, 3 restaurants, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon not a single restaurant onsite was serving food. We found this odd, as they have 3, but we just went across the street. If you do stay at the Westin, the restaurant across the street ( something \"grill\") was excellent. We had dinner there, and talked to the bartender for a while, so we were in there for a little over an hour. When we went back to the Westin we were expecting our room to be ready. It was not. This is when we found it to be a bit ridiculous. We are from the Caribbean, so we had been traveling for approximately 24 hours to get to Seattle. Check-in is posted as 3pm, and now it is after 5 and there is no room for us. We tell the clerk that we would like to check in as soon as possible, we are going to sit right over at the bar (we pointed our where we would be sitting to him), and asked him to come and get us as soon as our room was ready. At 6pm we went back and low and behold, our room has been ready but no one came to get us. If this was the only problem. I would not be complaining. We get into the room and we were impressed. The view was great (view of Puget Sound). The bed was luxurious, as was the shower. That night we had a few things out of the mini-bar, and went to bed. The next morning we got up early, got showers, ironed our clothes and went out. Next complaint: When we came back to the room that afternoon. I was surprised to see that the maid hadn't been to our room yet. Upon walking in farther I saw that she had been in. The only thing that she did was make our bed. The maid did not empty the trash, tidy the room, fill the honors bar, or clean the bathroom. Clean the bathroom, and empty the trash!!! How ridiculous. The first day this happend we told the front desk, and when we came back up after dinner it was done. The very next day it happened again! 4 days and our room did not get cleaned, our trash did not get emptied, all that happened was our bed was made. On the final day the bed wasn't even made. We told the front desk about it, and nothing happened. My boyfriend and I are big honors-bar users. With the honors bar never being restocked I ended up buying my own water, and soda. (I did call down, but it was never refilled). On the final morning, after ignoring our room all week, we got up early, and underneath the door they'd slid our bill. This, to me, was just insult to injury. I'd been down to the front desk, and nothing had been done, no one had been up to refill the bar, etc. However, they did manage to find us to deliver us our bill. We did go down then and ask to speak with the manager. We told the manager that we were not looking for a discount, we knew what we would be spending on this vacation. But we would not be paying anything for the honors-bar, and we would not be paying for the drinks that we had at the bars, as those were had while we were waiting for people to clean our room, which they'd had all day to do. The manager, was extremely gracious, proffessional and apologetic. She absolutely agreed that we should not pay for those things, and she offered us a complimentary 4 night stay in the future to make up for this. I just can't see us ever wanting to go back there. I realize that this is all very negative, and some may read this and just think that I am overreacting, and that I did not handle myself properly. That is fine, but, as I said, both my boyfriend and I work for a caribbean resort. Things happen, we understand that, but the things that happened at this hotel were completely unacceptable. Finally a few nice things about the hotel: The concierge service was fantastic. We used them for dinner reservations, movie times & tickets, shopping ideas, and a great daytime activity. I was very impressed, they were on top of things. The other great thing, was the location. As other reviews state, the location of the Westin is wonderful. It is centrally located to Pike Place Market, shopping, restaurants, movies. And it was nice because if we weren't quite sure were the hotel was we could look up and see it in the Skyline, and know where to go. We will definately be coming back to Seattle. We loved the city, and ate at some fabulous restaurants (Oceanaire for one), we also loved the activites that we did while in Seattle, we just will not stay at the Westin again.

I should have written this review earlier, but here goes. We orginally selected this hotel because our good friends had stayed here previously. We confirmed our check in about at about 4:00 P.M because we didn't plan to arrive until about 6:30. When we arrived it was an absolute zoo at the valet parking. In fairness there was a function from the University. In any event we left our car and were told the bags would be brought up to our room. Check was reasonably quick. The fellow at the front counter was quite young, about the age of my son. Just to make small talk, I asked how long he had been with the hotel. He snapped back, \"Why do you ask\". I guess he thought I was complaining because he looked a little tired and I said, I was just wondering how you liked working here. I think he then realized I was just trying to make conversation. He gave us our keys and pointed to the elevator. We arrived at the 7th. floor and were hit with a waft of stale smokey air. The carpets looked beat and were stained. Food trays were outside of two doors and it looked like they had been there awhile. We we opened the door to the room the smell was even worse. Being cheap travellers from Canada, I remarked to my wife, \"I guess this is what $165 US gets you\". We looked at the carpets and they were gross. I would not even feel comfortable taking my shoes off. We decided the smell was too strong and the room was obviously for smokers, which we were not. We went back down to front desk and were greated by what appeared to be a more senior person. We were very polite with our complaint and he apologized and gave us keys for another room on the 11th. floor. When we arrived the carpets were marginally better. We opened the door to the room. Nice view of another tower and no smell. I guess this is what we will get. I looked at the desk in the room and it appeared someone had sat down and poured themself a drink and there was ice that had melted in the bucket. It looked like someone had already checked into this room. I looked in the closet expecting to find someone's clothes. I then went into the bathroom and there was a bag underneath the vanity and someone had used the toilet and it had not been flushed. This was awful! Back down to the front desk. We said that we really don't like to complain, and told them that we though the room had already been checked into. My wife asked about the possiblity of an upgrade. The gave us another key and directed us to the other tower. We were given a room on the 46th. floor. A really nice suite with a great view of the space needle and Elliot Bay. There was a robe on the bed and one in closet. It looked like the robe on the bed has been worn the way it was thrown on the bed. Then I looked at the side table and thought it was nice to see the evening paper only to discover it had already been read and looked like it had been pulled out of the garbage can. In the shower in the bathroom, there were empty, used open shampoo and conditioner bottles just left in the shower. We thought, at least they have made good and we were satisfied................... That was until we got home from a nice dinner around midnight. The bed had been turned down, but as my wife climbed into bed and adjusted the pillow she notice it had blood on it. This was really gross. We just threw the pillow on the floor and used the remaining two. Funny, a couple of weeks later we had our good friends over and related the story to them. They then told us that they haven't stayed at the Westin for years because it had really gone downhill.

Ok, not their fault. So I wandered around for a couple hours and came back. Checked in (after a long wait with many other disgruntled travelers) and got to my room which I found did not have a working television, just snow. I called the front desk and was told there was no estimated time that it would be working if at all during my stay. I decided to give it a couple hours and went out. When I got back at midnight it was working. The next morning I ordered a \"healthy\" room service breakfast and ended up with yogurt that had already expired. To top it off the staff was lazy and not helpful. Instead of being appreciative and apologetic, I had to prompt them to fix things that went wrong, like \"can I get another yogurt\"? After a discussion and much prodding, I was promised a room credit for one night which I have never receieved, even after I asked about it at check-out. I was told I would have to speak to the person who had promised it to me who wasn't there instead of just having the credit on my bill. After I was home I was just happy to be away from that horrible hotel. Honestly, I think a Motel 6 or Best Western would have been cleaner and more comfortable.

I think that reading this review can help you avoid some of the low points we experienced. When booking this hotel I heard many great things about the view. Well, our room had a great view... of the other tower. Because the two hotel towers are so close to each other, we didn't see much of the city. That was disapointing. The lobby and bedroom decor really was bland and dated. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member who has stayed at many Westin and Sheraton hotels, and the look of this place really wasn't up to par. On other reviews, people say that they received a room that was recently renovated. That may be the case, but keep in mind that the majority of rooms appear not to have been. And with a view directly into the other tower's rooms, I could see the exact same bland decor duplicated ad nauseum. That was disappointing The \"heavenly bed\" that Westin is known for is used at this hotel. However, our King size mattress had a lump down the middle. The next morning, when I awoke with a back ache, I took a closer look. I discovered that it was two smaller \"heavenly beds\" bolted together to make a king size matress. That was disapointing. Because the hotel towers are circular, each room has an odd wedge shape, much like slices of a pie. This makes for unusual placement of furniture. For example, our tv was not directly in front of the bed, but to our extreme left. That was disapointing. Despite all of our issues, there were two things which went very well for us there. First, the location CAN NOT BE BEAT! The hotel is right in the middle of everything. Second, the concierge was excellent. I asked them to recommend a romantic restaurant for my wife and I. They made us a reservation for a restaurant called \"The Pallisades.\" Because it would be a bit of a trip, he arranged a ride for us. When we showed up in the lobby later that evening for our \"ride\", a stretch limo was waiting for us. WOW!!!!! The restaurant, by the way, was all that he said it would be. And when we were done, the limo gave us a ride back to the hotel. The limo ride was completely free of charge, complements of the Westin. All of this being said, you can probably get a good room at the Westin if, upon check in, you request a recently renovated room, that it does not have two beds bolted together to make a king size bed, and that does not directly face the other tower. Also, don't be afraid to use the concierge.

Okay, now the gross part: There was a coffeemaker in the room. There were packets of Starbucks coffee and those tiny containers of half & half next to the coffeemaker. One might assume the half & half would be fresh, right? Uh, wrong. I made some coffee and added three containers of half & half which I proceeded to drink before I noticed the fourth container was actually open and full of mold.

Unfortunately, the bathroom didn't have a separate Heavenly Shower/soak tub like other Westins, but the sweeping wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling view and the huge living space more than made up for it (room was furnished with a king-size Heavenly bed as well as a double sleep sofa with plenty of room to spare.)

I had a newly renovated room with spectacular views, nice furnishings, the famous Westin \"heavenly bed''--which IS very comfortable--and a wonderful bathroom. Maybe because I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest member and went to the special check-in area for SPG members, the desk clerk was very friendly and when I asked if the 41st floor room I'd been assigned in the North Tower had a water view--it didn't--she reassigned me to a 33rd floor room in the South Tower with a wonderful Puget Sound view. She asked if I'd mind being in an upgraded, recently renovated room (duh, no I didn't). The room had nice, new furniture and the usual Westin great bed and bath (with the cleverly designed rounded shower curtain that keeps the curtain--and possibly other people's germs-- away from one's body). My only minor complaint was that there was a FAINT smell of cigarettes (in spite of it being a non-smoking room and floor)--a common problem, I've found, at many hotels. But I saw a maid around the bend, asked her if she had room deodorizer, and she came right in and sprayed up a storm (maybe too much for our health!), and that pretty well killed the smell. I'm very sensitive to cigarette smells, by the way. I decided to buy a scented candle at the drugstore 1/2 a block away just for good measure, and the smoke smell was gone from then on. (I also bought bottled water there I could keep in the room's mini-bar to avoid the overpriced water the hotel made available.) I had worried about being kitty-corner from the elevator (since I usually ask to be away from the elevator and the ice machine), but since there are only about 10 rooms on each floor (because there are two tall and skinny towers at the Westin), it wasn't a problem. (Well, one night, some party-ers came back about 1:00 and were noisy in the hall for a few minutes, until another guest shushed them.) The other staff members I encountered--bell staff, concierge, etc.--were all very friendly and helpful. The concierge made us dinner reservations both nights, and arranged for us to get a complimentary appetizer at the famous Ray's Boathouse in Ballard. I'd stayed at this Westin once before, and had to switch rooms twice to get one that didn't smell like cigarettes and had a view--but even then, I wound up with a great room. I like the large desk by the window in the room--great place to look at the view, write, read, etc. The TV was new and had a great picture, and the lighting was better than at many hotels. The web access was too expensive for me to use--like $16/day--and I tried to avoid making local calls--for $1.75. (There are pay phones downstairs.) But almost all big-city hotels nickel and dime you to death this way. I was traveling with a friend who'd booked the Warwick Hotel, which was a little cheaper, and she was miserable there (busy street with lots of traffic noise in the room, unappealing decor, unfriendly staff, terrible view of parking lot, etc.). She moved to the Westin our second night in Seattle and was very happy there, too. In fact, the Westin gave her a very good deal for that last-minute reservation. (I got an amazing bargain since I used Starwood's \"points and cash\" program; but my friend's rate of $149 seemed very reasonable for such a great room in an expensive city in peak season.) All in all, I'd highly recommend the Westin for its rooms, decor, and staff. Maybe you need to be friendly with the desk staff for them to be friendly in return, or maybe it's just a matter of who you happen to be dealing with (as in the rest of life). I wouldn't let some of the reviews here scare you off. Also, given the height of the Westin buildings, you have a better chance of getting a quiet room on a high floor--and thus away from downtown Seattle traffic noise--here than in lots of other shorter hotels.", "Date": "September 11, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Westin Seattle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100570-Reviews-The_Westin_Seattle-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$177 - $329*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1900 5th Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515125", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/55/3f55304baf7f97c0cd43ff2e07adde9d4large.jpg"}}
