Based on our price point and the reviews of the hotel, we chose Hotel de la Porte Doree, and we were not disappointed. The hotel was gorgeous, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and they even had free wifi! It was so charming and lovely, it really brought it home for me that I was in Paris. Although it was very affordable, the hotel felt luxurious. The whole staff was friendly, and most of the desk clerks spoke great english. We opted not to go for the inclusive breakfast option, so I can't speak to that, but we really enjoyed the croissants we got every morning at the boulangerie across the street (and I've heard that those are the same croissants they use at breakfast). I wouldn't say there was a lot to do in the immediate area entertainment-wise, although there is a precious park just a few blocks away. We would have loved to rent a canoe there and take it out on the lake, but felt it was too cold. It was also super convenient to have a pharmacy and grocery store close to the hotel. I appreciated that we were in a part of Paris that wasn't too touristy. The metro is literally in front of the hotel, and although we could hear the trains when they passed by under us, they stop running at 1am and we never found the noise to be an issue, but it may bother a super-light sleeper. To get there from Charles de Gaulle, I would suggest a taxi. It only cost us about 40EUR, and we really appreciated the convenience with all the luggage we were hauling around (we chose to take a taxi on the way back). We took the metro from CDG on the way there and found it to be long and very difficult to maneuver (with luggage). As far as restaurants go, we tried both Les Cascades and Bistrot de la Porte Doree. We enjoyed the food at both, but found Les Cascades to have a more comfortable atmosphere. Les Cascades was also cheaper, so if you're looking to not go far from the hotel for dinner, either of those options would be good. Overall we had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Paris!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "tanya s", "ReviewID": "UR126807926", "Content": "This hotel was fantastic.

Location is very good: yes, it's a bit away of the major city highlights, but being on top of a metro stop with good and frequent connections, that doesn't bother at all. Is it value for money? Not in my opinion. To Parisian standards, 95 EUR a night may be a bargain, but does that mean that it takes you away the right to have hot water in the shower? Or that the dustbin in the (very small) bathroom may be stuck? When we told the reception we had no hot water, they told us (quote) this is normal, because a lot of people take their shower at this time of the day (end quote). They offered us the key to another room of someone who had just left, but that wasn't cleaned yet. We politely turned down the offer :-). We paid a few euros extra for a superior room to have a larger bed. Well, don't. The bed, which is comfortable, was no larger than 140cm, although they did promise otherwise on the booking site. Rooms are noisy, as you can hear the first metro depart in the morning, but that we knew, so it didn't bother us. If you're a light sleeper, you should consider ear plugs or simply staying at another hotel (which I would recommend anyway). The hotel is clean, nothing to say about that. Rooms are very small, but hey, this is Paris! Breakfast doesn't blow your head off, but there are plenty of bakeries around to spend your 10 EUR/person. Our expectations were much higher than what they could offer and that's a pity.

I emailed several times trying to get info on a specific room I had read about, I knew they only had one in the hotel that had a terrace, so I wanted to make sure I got it when I made the reservation. Everyone was so polite over email I could not wait to get to the hotel and see if all the great reviews I had read were true . . . They are!!! First, we arrived very early in the morning, around 9am, hotel check in is much later but the lovely lady at the front desk made sure that our room was set up and perfect within an hour of our arrival, which gave us some time to explore around the area. The area is very nice, some say a bit far from all the tourist sites, but with the Metro station so close we didn't mind at all, we got everywhere within 20 - 25 mins. There is a pharmacy and a supermarket very close by, for a quick bite there is a Subway, Quick, McDonalds, we never ate in one of these fast food places, but is great that the McDonald's there is open until 1am, since I was always after coffee at all hours of the day and those were the biggest coffees we could find, other than Starbucks. There is also a wonderful place right across the street that sells paninis, pizzas and sandwiches that we absolutely adored and was always open, even at 3am! Very good food, even better prices :) I was so looking forward to try the bakery across the street that I read so much about, unfortunately it was closed during the time of our visit. But more about the hotel, they gave us the room around 10am, we get in and it is so nice, clean, beautifully decorated. It is the first hotel that I visit where the website photos actually match the place! The bed was so comfortable, the pillows, the duvet were dreamy. Considering standard Europe hotel rooms, our room was very spacious. The free Wi-Fi was awesome! It helped so much that we could use it every night to plan our next day and to keep in touch with our families. Also I was amazed at how many electrical outlets we had in our room, never seen that in European hotels I've stayed before, we had all our gadgets hooked up with no issues and even had a couple of outlets to spare! We had an iPod dock station so we could listen to our music, huge plasma TV mostly French channels, but we loved it! They were so nice to us and so considerate, it was wonderful, since we stayed up really late every night, they made sure we were not disturbed in the morning so we could sleep in! How nice is that! I can't say enough about the wonderful people at the front desk, they all went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect!

On the second floor, where my room was, was a small room with a computer for use by guests. The staff is very nice and helpful. The breakfast for 10 Euro is more than adequate. But it is because of its fantastic location that makes this hotel an even better find. The hotel is right in front of you as you ascend from exit 2 of the Doree Metro station on line 8. Line 8 is a very good line to be on because it is the line of Opera, Invalides, Bastille, Concorde. The Opera stop is where you catch the Roissy bus to CDG. Bastille is a great stop for restaurants and museums. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood with lots of boulangeries and shops, even a supermarket is 2 blocks away.

I enjoyed its location, only 20 minutes from central Paris via metro (there's a convenient metro stop right outside the door), and also in a real neighborhood. I enjoyed observing Parisian life around the hotel as much as an tourist attraction. There is a fabulous patisserie across the street for easy and delicious croissant breakfasts, and several good cafes in the area. The day after I arrived, a pleasant street market appeared with all kinds of produce, pots and pans, and flowers, and cheeses. The street in front of the hotel is very good for walking, and if you have the energy you can walk to central Paris in about 40 minutes. The hotel itself was quaint, with great reception and service. Staff greet travelers warmly and are willing to help with requests from directions to understanding French directions for a local SIM card, to running across the traffic circle to find the taxi that had been ordered to get to the airport. They go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and supported, from arrival through checkout and departure. The hotel contained the smallest elevator I have ever seen, but fit my medium size rolling luggage along with myself. My room was clean and comfortable, and designed to use each inch of space efficiently. I enjoyed the large window overlooking the street, crown molding, and tapestry linens, which all gave a sense of authenticity to the hotel. While small, the bathroom was newly renovated with rainforest shower head and outfitted with quality and clean towels, and good toiletry products. The one complaint with the bathroom is that the water pressure was set too high to for the mini size of the sink, often ricocheting off the edge of the ceramic bowl to the floor below, leaving puddles. The bed was quite comfortable and I enjoyed being able to view various cable channels on the flat screen TV and listen to my own music on the iPod radio provided in the room. The hotel has some noise from outside traffic, but this dies down at night.

I spent a lot of time choosing hotels in Paris before deciding on this one. It turned out to be an excellent choice indeed, even more so when the metro exit is literally steps from the hotel's entrance. It is located in a very agreeable neighbourhood - Paris 12, and is convenient too as there are many useful shops nearby. ***WHAT'S AROUND?*** Across the road you have Vandermeersch which serves the most divine pastries. Loved the croissants and pain au chocolat. And yes the mille feuille is to die for. Next to is is a supermarket which is great, you can buy mineral water here in a multipack which saves a lot of money compared to the nosebleed prices elsewhere. There's a small stationery shop too and for some convenient eats you have Subway, Quick and Mc Donalds. A self service launderette is a couple minutes walk away, on the same road as the Ibis if I'm not mistaken. If you need an even larger supermarket there's a Monoprix which is about a 5-10 minute stroll up ave Daumesnil or you could take the metro there. ***THE ROOM*** Back to the room, it was a single room, petite as communicated beforehand, nevertheless tastefully and charmingly decorated just like the rest of the hotel. It was clean and like others have mentioned the bed is comfortable. Getting the shower to be at the right temperature was a bit of a game though - it can be temperamental. But after a couple of days I managed to tame it and everything was fine after that. I really liked the fragrance of the shower gel/ shampoo provided. It may be a bit of a distance to the center of Paris, close to the Peripherique but with the Metro it's hardly an issue. By the way I have no idea why some reviews mentioned issues with the night porter, there was no surliness or anything of that sort. I even got smiles.

The room was extra clean, I run B&B myself in UK, I know where to check to be fussy and mean, but it was spotless. I know how hard it is to keep up with this cleanliness. They must have a great cleaner with very high standard. And breakfast cereals are very yummy... All organic product make you feel better. Even the soaps in the room was organic, and it was deliciously flavoured and I loved it so much I had to take them home so that I can find where I can get some more of it.

A cute little cafe across the street had a great lunch, and at the Vandermeersch bakery across the street everything was delicious. Vandermeersch was a cheaper alternative to the hotel's breakfast, but the hotel's breakfast had everything, too - cheese, meats, yogurts, breads, croissants, coffee, etc. Our room was a standard size with a very soft bed and newly renovated bathroom. The bathroom was tiny but had enough space, and functioned very well since it was all new. It was obvious the hotel is in an old building - the stairs creek and the walls look like they've been painted over many times. So, the hotel does not look as fresh as it's pictures, but it's still clean, comfortable, and charming.

After a very long journey our ascension from Porte Doree station was welcomed with the pleasant surprise of our hotel directly in front of the number two exit. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly night porter and given our key. The first thing that struck me was the decor- beautifully chic, this boutique hotel has all the attributes expected of a Parisian hotel but with modern amenities- by this I mean censored lighting, climate control for your bedroom, free wi-fi and a thoroughly cleaned room with fresh towels every day. Positioned directly in the epicentre of Porte Doree we were within stumbling distance of two fantastic nrestaurants, a wonderful bakery, supermarket and a fresh fruit street Market on Sunday. Getting around Paris was very easy as we were located directly on line eight which was quick and efficient. The hotel staff were more than happy to call ahead to make reservations at restaurants and help us map out our journeys. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and already have to several friends and family members. Jerome is a fantastic help and we would like to thank him personally for making our stay as perfect as it could be. Top three tips for a weekend in Paris: 1. Get a metro pass for the duration of your stay. 2. Use the free wi-fi to plan your day trips - trip advisor was a saviour! 3.

Not a big deal to most city folk but worth a mention to light sleepers No complimentary coffee or tea On our last day, Tuesday Oct 18, different lady working reception was far less helpful than her colleague working the previous days A few points that address other peoples posts: The Italian place a few doors down is not that good. Their pizza is nasty. Too soft and chewy, not enough sauce. Also, the hotel is no greener than the next. Going green is nothing new, it does not mean saving energy only by not washing towels everyday and asking guests to turn off the water when brushing their teeth. That's 1980's green. 2010+ green is finding ways to use renewable energy, recycle smarter and exclusively utilize local resources. As for the elevator, sure its tiny, but this is Europe and at least they have one. Anyway, I digress...Overall, an excellent hotel choice that I would recommend to any traveler staying in Paris for more than 3 nights. Although with 2 nights/less time or a business trip you would be better staying closer to the city center.

The nearby train line did reverberate a bit through the night but it wasn't dreadful and was part and parcel of the experience! We booked a superior double and I would recommend that as we were advised the standard double was smaller - the superior certainly wasn't huge although it was enough for what we needed and the bathroom was a decent size. Again, the room was spotless and the hotel is one of only four environmentally accredited 'green' hotels in Paris - something they are very proud of and work hard at maintaining. We had no problems at all with the hotel - one tip, probably don't book the breakfast as, at ten euros, you can buy coffee and croissants cheaper out and about but they were very flexible with our departure - we couldn't retain the room beyond checkout but they stored our luggage, free of charge, into the early evening on our last day so that we gained a full extra day of sightseeing without the hassle of carrying bags etc. I would really recommend it as a great base for a short break and we will certainly be returning next time we are in Paris!", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cCharming Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "raeberlin", "ReviewID": "UR119294915", "Content": "I stayed in the Hotel de la Porte Doree for a week in September after reading about it on Trip Advisor.

Quick and easy metro access. Good breakfast for 10 euro. Friendly staff- especially liked Jodi- always helpful and going the extra mile to assist with shuttle, advice, etc. The rooms are a little small but cozy and have all the room you need unless you are throwing a party in your room. We had the smallest room in the hotel ( or so it appeared after peeking into other empty rooms) and we were fine with it. Soft beds, great towels, good linen, wake up calls on time, and a double window that let in the night air if we were tired of the A/C which was nice also. The Metro is a great people watching affair. We enjoyed our Metro time and it gave us time to talk, plan our day or rest our sore feet. There were convenient bakeries all up and down the street in front of the hotel and many good restaurants. A bonus was the park with the lake. We LOVED it and it gave us a great place to relax and unwind in the middle of a 10 day trip to regroup and not be in the hustle and bustle of tourism. One of the things that was our favorite tour in Paris was the Chateaux Tour in the Loire Valley. We really liked the old castles and the drive through the French countryside..... the Giverny and Versailles tour was great also. All in all, no complaints with the hotel. The previous reviews were pretty much right on. Doubt we will ever be back to Paris, too many other places in the world to see, but would definitely recommend it to others. Should be a 3 star and not a 2- hope they correct that soon.

The hotel is beautiful and so french! We had a lovely room - it was clean, spacious and had bay windows which opened out. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were changed every day - the decoration was tasteful, although our room was decorated quite modernly, it still managed to keep its' authentic french decor. The bathroom was small but clean and we were provided with clean towels everyday. We had two huge mirrors in our room and plenty of natura light which was great for getting ready. It seems that the walls are quite thin as we could hear other people flushing the toilet etc but it wasn't a problem. We also had an ipod dock in the room and a flatscreen television although the only thing we could watch was CNN as the rest of the channels were all in french :( Overall, the hotel had a very relaxed atmosphere and although we didn't pay for breakfast prior to our stay we decided to have it every morning - I'm a bit of a fussy eater and would have preferred more choice of yogurts and cereals but other than that it was lovely and there was never any rush to get you in and out of the breakfast room. The man that served us breakfast was very helpful and spoke a good bit of english - he always checked if everything was ok. The elevator is really small but it's not an inconvenience as I loved taking the stairs anyway because of the decor. Nathalie on reception was always very helpful with directions and it was nice to have somebody we could ask for help if we needed it. During our stay we came across two other men that were doing reception at various times who didn't seem to be very conversational or approachable so we didn't ask them anything, although Nathalie was there most of the time so it was fine. The books provided in our rooms were very helpful and we would have been lost without them. We ate in Les Cascades on two evenings and had beautiful food - although without the help of the one english speaking waiter I'm not sure this would have been possible. We returned on our last day for some lunch to find no waiters who spoke english and as a result found it an absolute nightmare to order - we had two hamburgers and some chips, one was raw inside and the other just looked like mush and because noone spoke english we couldn't complain so we paid and left hungry. On the two occasions that we had good food there, we found it to be really quick and cheap and we both cleaned our plates, it's just a pity we had to end on a bad note. There are plenty of supermarkets in the area and we went to the aquarium and bois de vicennes on our last day which was beautiful. The hotel also organised for us to get a shuttle for our walk to the airport which arrived efficiently - although I'm not sure I would get it again and I wasn't sure we were going to make it to the airport alive - worst driving I have ever seen! We were so glad to see the airport! The hotel also has a free wifi service was invaluable as using 3g outside of the hotel was a complete no no as it totally wiped all the credit on my phone. The metro runs underneath but didn't affect our sleeping at all, although we were on the 3rd floor - it does take some time to get to where you are going and taking the metro isn't always a pleasant experience but that's to be expected. Generally it is a great little hotel and very well looked after and managed. A mini-fridge in the room would have been really helpful as we often wanted to buy food and make picnics to take with us but we couldn't keep anything fresh. An iron in each room would also have been helpful and perhaps a few english channels on the tv.

We hunted around for a cheap hotel (they are quite expensive in central Paris) and this one was brought up by hotel comparison prices. It was a bargain price so I was wary of what we might be getting for out money. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is directly under a metro station so travelling into the centre was really easy. I would recommend a travel card as this keeps the costs down. On a positive note, although the hotel is right above the metro station we could not hear any noise from it. It's about a 10/15 minute metro ride into the centre but like all large cities it depends on where you are heading and how many changes you need to make. The hotel itself is small but has a really nice ambiance. The staff were friendly and we had no problems. There is free wifi, you just need a code from the reception. This helps as a visitor as it means its really easy to check up on details for your day ahead. Our room wasn't huge but big enough for what we needed and the bathroom had a shower cubicle and was nicely decorated. There was a safe within the wardrobe which puts your mind at rest in a big city. Like all hotels you can often hear people in other rooms and unforntunately our neighbour (who we names the Moaner Lisa) was rather vocal!!!!! But you have to accept this :-) The hotel offer a breakfast for (I think 10 euro) Its a continetal buffet style which was nice, but there is a mcdonalds just over the road which was much cheaper. While there are not many shops in this area there is a lovely bakery over the road as well as a small supermarket and we found a lovely snack shop with a very friendly owner who sold lovely coffee (although I wouldn;t recommend the criossants from her, go to the bakers they are much nicer!!) The hotel offers a info book in the room with some recommendations for restaurants. The hotel itself does not offer a restuarant and we did not visit in the area so I cannot comment on that. There is, as I said a McDonalds and the french equivilent called Quick but after trying both I would say that Quick is more expensive and not as good as McDonalds. Most people would probably cringe at the thought of travelling to Paris and eating fast food. Just be prepared to pay extortionate prices in the city centre. Drinks are very expensive and as I quickly realised Fanta and Coke are the same from any place but some cafes were charging up to 5 euros for a small glass of coke so McDonalds was a cheaper option.

The hotel was beautifully decorated inside and the staff were very warm and exceptionally helpful - even with my attempts at pigeon-french! They all spoke English (although I liked making the effort in French which they seemed to appreciate). The hotel is literally the first thing you see when you exit from the Porte Doree Metro station, there's no long walk to the metro so hopping into the city is a breeze. Its situated on Line 8 of the underground and we got the train from CDG airport no probs (route = RERB to Gare du Nord, then Line 5 to Republique, then Line 8 to Porte Doree) which probably took just less than an hour including changes. We stayed in Room 28 which faces the street, opposite a lovely row of shops including a Boulangerie from which the breakfast food comes from each morning. This was classed as a 'Superior' room, I didnt see the others, but I was impressed with the decor and the bathroom was very smart. The room had a LCD TV, magazines, iPod dock, very very comfy bed, nice ambient lighting, the bathroom as I say was excellent with a great shower - the size of a dinner plate!! The overall size of the room was good, not too small - plenty of space for hanging up clothes and there is a safe in the room also (hidden away, I'll let you find it yourself!). The breakfast was 10 euros each as was nice, it was as described, i.e.a continental and fresh items brought over throughout the morning from the bakery opposite. The coffee was delicious - the only thing I would have liked would have been to sit outside and have breakfast and there wasnt anywhere to do that, but there's plenty of other places in Paris to do so. Dont be put off by other reviews saying the hotel seems a little far out in the sticks - its not. If you're ok with the tube (we bought a \"Paris Visite\" 5 day pass for about 50 euros each) you are about 20 mins away from the hub of the city and you'll be glad of the relative calm of this hotel. We found it nice before bed to lay with the window open listening to the buzz of the traffic (not busy) going by and the vibes of the underground every now and again. The place is superb, and if you dont want to venture out too far to eat there is a lovely restaurant literally over the road (Les Cascades) or if you're on a budget there's a Subway or McDonalds!!! A small tip also (for what its worth) - we found the price of mineral water quite expensive in most places in the centre of Paris - there's a shop over the road (think its like a kebab shop) that sells bottles of cold mineral water for 1 euro, or better still keep a bottle and the hotel have a water machine in the breakfast room which you can fill up with. It's also worth mentioning the hotel information folder you get in the room - this is jam packed with recommendations - which are honest - about local food and drink. its worth checking out especially if you're running out of ideas of where to go. Overall I cant fault the hotel at all. The staff were a pleasure to deal with (even when we arrived to check in at 23:30 the night staff were still v. pleasant). I read some comments also about them having 'thin walls' etc, rubbish. Throughout our stay the hotel had 'no vacancies' and had kids in the hotel - and we didnt hear a peep at all.

Why must? Simply because everyone deserves to know how wonderful of a place it really is - 139 on trip advisor just won't do. I have stayed here on several occasions, the first time being 2007. I was looking for a hotel that for one could fit my budget - single 20-something girl who buys too many shoes right here - and also one that felt REAL. A lot of people don't understand what I mean when I say real, after all, isn't anywhere you stay real? But what I mean is somewhere that isn't touristy, isn't all glossed over or the North American version of Paris. I grew up with a European family, my mother from Belgium, my grandparents from France, and their stories of Paris had been what I was looking for. I found part of that at this hotel. The people are wonderful, the rooms charming, and the neighbourhood? It's a real french neighbourhood. This where people live, where they eat and shop in the market and buy pastries from the OMG so wonderful bakery right across the street. Seriously, I would go to Paris just for their passion-fruit tart with raspberries. On my first stay I was so relived when I arrived, I wasn't staying somewhere I was afraid to walk on the street, but also I didn't spot a bunch of tacky tourist shops disguised in the facades of old buildings. And wait... did I see a metro right outside the building? Oh yes, steps away in this case really is steps away. The furnishing in the room weren't brand spanking new, which I liked, they had character and were clean and well taken care of. Painted sometimes, or polished up. it all looked nice. It made for a cute room, smaller, but not super tiny. Don't expect giant rooms in Paris - it doesn't happen often, it's just the way it is. The room I booked had a double bed with a little writing desk and chair and nice linens. It also had those lovely french style windows I got to throw open on a sunny day. Then there was the staff who were always helpful and cheery and put up with me trying to speak my badly spoken french, not because I had to, they all spoke lovely English, but because I was determined to come home and show my family that my second language skills were not a total lost cause. I really don't know if I can say enough to do it justice honestly and I don't know if I have the words to explain. I guess best way to tell you how wonderful this hotel is, is to tell you I went back. I went back in 2008 , taking my mother for her birthday trip, I went back in 2009 on a brief stop before Italy, I sadly missed it in 2010, my vacation occupied with the Vancouver Olympics, but I sent my brother instead. And today I'll be booking my stay for October. The only thing I could could mention as a con is there doesn't seem to be a double room with single person option anymore. I can understand why, but as a person who travels on her own I miss being able to get a room with double bed without having to pay the same price as 2 people. As far as cons go, that's a very small one. I love the Hotel de la Porte Doree and recommend it to anyone who wants a great little place to stay in Paris. <3", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leonberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat for family stay in Paris.\u201d", "Author": "Anjellicrew", "ReviewID": "UR115155254", "Content": "I really liked this hotel compared to the other my friends stayed in which was a little closer to the city center.

We did not eat breakfast here though the evening guy at the front desk was not willing to offer me any other suggestions than their \"fantastic\" breakfast--fair enough. There was a little bakery, fresh market, and small grocery shop right across the street. It is also not far from the metro station (only about 25 meters) which was more convenient than a bothersome noise from the trains. The daytime front desk clerk was VERY helpful and printed out a map for me to meet my friends later in the evening. Most people who have children have found themselves in a situation where they realized that not only where their children seemed to be out of place, but sometimes they even seem unwelcome--common is some places in Europe. This hotel really surprised me since there was a box of toys in the closet for my 22 month old to play with. The hotel provided a pack n' play, which I did request in advance.

I could see how if I had a family and I was looking for a family friendly environment, I'd like this place, or if you have a more leisurely sightseeing plan. We were on our honeymoon and we stayed for an entire week in this hotel and there were great things about it, some good things about it, and some bad things about it. Great things first: 1) They are indeed across the street from Vandermeersch, a boulangerie known for their kugelhopf (not very French you say? I said that too, actually, while stuffing my face with delicious gooey, sugary, stretchy, ball of heavenly delight... not on the street in public though. I have manners). 2) The Port Doree metro stop is right outside the hotel. Seriously awesome for not having to walk a block or two for a metro stop. 3) The person at the desk always spoke English, if that is important to some of you, especially if you didn't plan your trip that well and have no idea what to do. 4) The park across the street (Bois de Vincennes) is amazing to jog around and chillax in (but if you had the choice of spending a day here, or in front of the Eiffel Tower, which would you choose?) and is really huge and is reminiscent of Central Park, but with less people. Good things: 1) The room, though dormlike, and the smallest of all the rooms we stayed in Europe (We went to Paris, San Sebastian, Barcelona), had a double bed, a tv, internet on the second floor if you didn't bring your own computer, your own bathroom with shower, a closet. The ice machine exists, just in the basement of the hotel, where the soda machine is. Wish they had a fridge in all the rooms to keep some of the delicious things we bought more fresh while we were staying there. 2) Twice a week, there are street markets set up so you can buy fresh food there. You just can't buy for more than one day if things spoil fast because there's no fridge to keep them in. I bought amazing cheese and ham from a man, made a baguette sandwich to take with us to Versailles. It was totally worth it! Bad: These things aren't entirely the fault of the hotel. 1) It's hella far from the city. This might be okay for those who have already been to Paris before and are okay staying away from the tourists and the sightseeing places but if you are there for the first time and you have to take the metro into the heart of the city every day, it takes a good twenty - forty minutes, depending on where you want to go. The worst thing is coming back home, changing, and wanting to go out again. There were many times we wanted to go out and experience the nightlife but the thought of having to come back home first to shower, change, and go out again on the metro wasn't enticing enough, especially knowing that the metro stops running at midnight. We had to weigh whether or not it was worth taking a cab back home, which would cost us anywhere from 18-30 dollars, depending on where we were. 2) A family of 2 or 3 children were staying upstairs or next to us (unsure of where exactly as we only had the shrill sound of muffled kids screaming, waking us up at the crack of dawn to judge their location) for a couple of days. Those rooms are not sound proof, let's just say that. Obviously, this just depends on who stays on your floor when you're there and it's hard to control maniacally screaming kids in any hotel so that's not really their fault but anyway, just know the rooms are not sound proof. 3) Lastly, if you want to eat dinner after 10pm in this area, good luck. The only place that serves dinner that late is Au Metro, and their food is not the best (although apparently their mussels are okay). The takeaway: Good place to stay because it's affordable and if it's not your first time in Paris and you want to avoid all the claustrophobic tourist spots, this might be your spot, especially if you don't mind taking the metro in and out of the city, or you don't have an aggressive or packed schedule where you have to return to your hotel to get something or to change, etc. If you're on your honeymoon, or it's your first time in Paris and you want to see all the sights and you still want to enjoy your nights out on the town and be relatively close so you can come home to relax before going out again, this is not your spot. We desperately wanted to enjoy the neighborhood but most things were closed by the time we got home, which although late (around ten at night), the sun doesn't set in Paris until close to 11pm. We tried eating dinner around here but they all close so early and we had to walk a few blocks to a mediocre restaurant because we didn't want to trek out to the city again on the metro. From the other reviews, it seems like there were more interestingly laid out bedrooms and perhaps if we stayed away from those screaming kids, we would have had more sleep and not as exhausted during the day.

My only (small) gripe would be that there is no kettle (and hence no chance of a decent cup of tea for the length of your stay in France!). The hotel does offer coffee on call for a couple of euros however. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, preferring to sample the patisserie delights across the street, although be warned, it is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. The Tramway, a brasserie just up the road, does a very nice breakfast for 7 Eur 50 though. The hotel is just seconds away from the Porte Doree metro, from which you can connect to all the major lines within a couple of stops. A nice alternative to the metro is to walk along the promenade des plantes which takes you up towards Bastille. This is a raised aqueduct that lives up to its name and its popular with strollers and joggers alike. In fact, we ended up walking all the way from the hotel to Sacre Coeur via the promenade des plantes, Bastille, Marais (where we had a very nice falafel in pita for lunch from Chez Marianne), Opera Garnier and Galerie Lafayette! Quite an expedition, especially since we had only planned to check out the local area whilst we waited for our room to become available! I was really impressed with the 12th arrondisement - it has a lovely vibe to it and there are plenty of nice places to eat, with patisseries on every doorstep. There was a lovely market on Sunday morning, starting opposite the hotel, selling fresh fruit, meat, shoes etc and it made for a pleasant amble whilst savouring the delights of the bakery! We also spent an hour or so walking round the lake in the Bois de Vincennes. Again, just a 5 min stroll from the hotel and well worth taking an hour or so out for, especially if you have children with you. There are boats for hire and a fair was being set up to open on 5th June (not sure how long for though). Would make a lovely place for an alfresco breakfast or picnic before setting off into Paris for the day.

I actually took a nap one evening with the window open and a nice breeze coming through. Now onto the metro rumbling. It's not like the building shakes. The noise lasts MAYBE 5 seconds...if that. We had a twin room with a private bathroom. Meaning one room has just the toilet and right across it is your sink/shower. Very good shower with terrific water temp and pressure. As much as I truly liked this hotel, I'm not sure I'd stay here again. Only because it's so far out and there's nothing really around here. The price is right, the people are exceptionally polite and helpful. I'm just not big on the hike to get to \"scenic\" areas. OH wi-fi is free. You just have to make sure you ask for the passcode.

Finding a good parking space near the hotel is difficult, but a nearby Renault garage offers private parking. First of all: this hotel is a gem and I would highly recommend it to my friends. The hotel stylish interior and wonderful staff make you feel welcome the moment you step into the hotel. Both staff and owner are incredibly nice people and offer professional and friendly service. As with many Paris hotels, this one also has small rooms, but they are quiet, clean and have airco, good beds, flatscreen TV, mid size safe, shower with soap and shampoo, toilet and hair dryer. Free WiFi access is good, although they have a weird open system on it. Airconditioning is easy to use and it works very well. I would have liked a refrigerator in the room. Windows can be opened for fresh air. The images on the hotel website are as the rooms look like in reality. The metro line is nearby and you can hear and feel it slightly in the hotel, but it isn't annoying. Different than some other Paris hotels, walls/floors are thick enough to not hear any noise inside the hotel. Breakfast is perfect: all fresh (organic/fair trade) and lots of choice. Very good service. Most hotel breakfast prices are too high, but this is well worth it. Alternatively, it's easy enough to cross the street to get groceries. Porte Doree and Michel Bizot metro station are on walking distance. Line 8 takes you to Bastille with its connecting lines to Paris city center in mere minutes. The hotel off-center location is by no means a problem; it's a plus, actually. Brasseries and restaurants nearby are plenty (recommended: Les Cascades and Au Tramway). Quick and McDonalds, a pizzeria and a sandwich/snack place are just around the corner. The park is a 5 minute walk and hosts the Foire du Tr\u00f4ne fun fair in April/May/June.

If arriving via the Metro make sure you exit at number 2 as the hotel is only a few metres away. Reception was always manned by very friendly people who were always helpful. Breakfast was monitored on all but one day of our stay by a very friendly gentleman who was always willing to assit with hot milk/chocolate. Our room was on the second floor and was a perfect size for the two of us (note that we were in a superior double so some rooms may be smaller). The bed was extremely comfy and freshly made every day - though the hotels site does say that as an eco hotel if requested they will not change the sheets/towels every day which is a nice option. The toileties which were provided were all eco friendly - and the breakfast food appeared to be organic and locally sourced. The bread and pastries are bought from a lovely bakery just across the road which is also a perfect place to grab a snack on the way out for the day.

It was overall Good but not Very Good. After reading many great reviews and the very few poor ones we were quite excited to check into the Port Doree for our last couple of nights in Paris. My husband had been ill the day before and we asked about early check in, they did their best to accommodate. We appreciated that. When we got our room it was much more simple than their web site suggests. That was OK but we noticed that the bedspread was not very clean and there was a very visible, crusty white stain on it. We thought about saying something but we had already asked for early check in and my husband just wanted to get to bed asap so we folded it up and put it in the closet. Next morning showering was a bit of a problem because water pressure was being lost due to a leak at the main join of the hose. OK life is hard, it's a leak, so what. We did not say anything to the front desk. The breakfast was as good as most others have said; fresh, filling, good variety, healthy, great coffee and the first morning a very cordial hard working gentleman kept everything running well. The morning we were going to check out my husband was showering and the hose shot off from it's connection and he had to finish his shower with the 1/2 inch hose running like a garden hose. I went down to the desk to let them know what had happened and that we were not happy and the woman there put up a \"cheery\" instant brick wall. Had we noticed the leak before? Yes. Well these hoses break quite often because travelers are quite rough with them. However there is nothing they can do about if we don't tell them. (Very true) We suggested that the room staff should also have noticed and reported the leak. The staff don't use the shower full blast like we travelers do and so, no, they would not have noticed. Since we were on the subject of things I should have mentioned I told her about the soiled bedspread but did not bother to suggest that the room staff should have noticed the crusty stain. I want to note that she was NOT wrong; we should have mentioned things we were not satisfied with right away. However I approached the desk in a calm, and I think quite pleasant manner and I didn't like being made to feel we had done something wrong.

It's fair enough that you don't have one in your room at these prices but if you need something pressed, you need to bring your clothes to the kitchen on the groundfloor rather than them bringing it to your room. Inconvenient but no drama. In summary, if its your first time to Paris and you're keen to walk everywhere and see the famous sights etc, this might not be the one for you due to its location and equally if you're driving from the UK you may choose a place on the other side of the city.

We were in Room 8, which is on the 1st floor (2nd floor in the US) and had a double bed. PROS Location--it's located on the east end of Paris and in a non-touristy area. Very very close to the metro. Situated across the street from an awesome bakery. There are restaurants, supermarkets, and various stores nearby. We loved taking walks around the neighborhood after dinner. For you Bank of America customers, they have a BNP Paribas ATM nearby, so you can make fee-free cash withdrawals. Cute room--it wasn't very large but was simply decorated. The mattress and pillows were comfy. The window was very nice, but it was a view of the roof next door. I was tempted to jump across and climb on different rooftops but thought better of it. Reception/Staff--friendly and efficient, both night and day. They also speak English if you don't speak French. One night, we just bought a bunch of picnic food to eat in our room--baguette, cheese, meats, etc., and they let us use plates/silverware/glasses. The shampoo/soap was also very nice--organic and citrusy. CONS Facilities--while the room itself was nice, there were some minor issues. The bathroom tiling grout had mildew. The flush button (made of plastic) was cracked and looks like it has been for a while. Also, one of our side shelves fell off from the wall when I put my wallet on it. I brought it down to reception, and they said that it's happened before and told me to bring it again in the morning when they could get the repair person to look at it. It looked like the adhesive they used to reattach to the wall was pretty weak. Also, because they had made the repairs while we were gone, when we returned, our whole room smelled strongly of epoxy, which was unpleasant. If you're on the more horizontally gifted side, fitting into the shower stall will definitely be problematic. I'm only 5'5\" and 150 pounds with broader shoulders for my height, and it was tight. Noise--the metro's proximity to the hotel is a double-edged sword. In the mornings, you can hear the rumblings of the trains, so if you're a light-medium sleeper, that may spell trouble. Aircon--you can't control the temperature in your room, so it was a bit on the warm side, which dried out my throat during the night. CONCLUSION: All in all, it was a nice hotel.

It fit the bill! Although it is a bit removed from the main attractions, it was easy to get everywhere (metro was steps away). It was quiet - we never heard noise from another room. The beds were extremely comfortable. We had a triple (1 double or queen bed, and 1 single for our daughter). The room was very small (especially with the 2 beds) but was comfortable. When we arrived, they brought up a box of toys for our daughter. We weren't sure we were going to do the breakfast, so we didn't buy it when we booked. It ended up being great. Wonderful pastries but also cereals, fresh fruit, ham and cheeses. Breakfast is from 7am to 10am. It was well attended to during the week, but the one time we went on the weekend, it was sparse when we arrived at 9:45am (a different person working I think). They also have crayons, coloring paper, kids utensils, sippy cups, plates, etc. It was nice to get a full breakfast at the start of the day- and kids eat free! Natalia, who worked reception, during the week was wonderful. Very helpful and nice. The weekend person wasn't quite as helpful. The hotel is 4 stories and there is a small elevator (sadly, our daughter liked do go up the steps each time!). There is a playground not too far away. That (and the elevated gardens) was a nice thing to do the first day when we were very tired. The hotel seemed like a great price (109 Euro for the triple. Probably could have gotten a smaller room since they provide cots, but it was nice to have comfortable beds for everyone). There was free Wifi, and also a computer to use if needed.

Stayed 19-23 January, 2011. Chose the hotel based on value (Trip Advisor rated #170 of 2,000+ Paris hotels - said so much @ $89 US/night). Short drive from CDG (20/30 min.). Stayed in Room 216 overlooking Av. Daumensnil. Entered into a pretty little lobby where we were greeted immediately. Had read about the small elevator and actually loved the experience of sending our bags up the lift while we took the stairs. It was big enough for both bags and one of us. Anyone who has a problem with this doesn't appreciate the fact that this convenience has been added to an original building, much the way it's been in the apartment buildings of many Paris neighborhoods. They put them where they can and they are not meant to be impressive but are very functional. Our room was impeccable and smelled heavenly. The decor was beautiful and every attention to detail was noticed. From the wood floors, high ceilings, to the high quality drapery, the unbelievable art, to the molding at the ceiling, to the exquisite and welcoming bedding to the well equipped bath all in a very efficient and spacious Parisian hotel room. I dare you to compare what you get for the price. It cannot be beat! Not to mention that we were literally out the front door and onto the metro entrance, but not before crossing the street to get some of the most heavenly pastries I have ever eaten. The same that are served in the hotel's dining room should you chose to enjoy breakfast there. We had a plan of how we wanted to do the city and leisurely breakfasts were not part of our plan. In the evening we would head back to the 12th and enjoy some of the local places for dinner. Great values can be found - follow the advice given in the in-room guide to the 12th. You can't go wrong, either reading the guide for entertainment or taking the recommendations. (Your hostess has a flare for writing and loves her neighborhood!) The first night we were recovering from our flight from the US. We wanted to celebrate my daughter's 20th birthday so we decided to walk the 10 minutes to the MonoPrix where we purchased wine, cheese and fruit. Stopped at the Boulangerie across the street for a bagette and little pastries for desert and back to our room. Our hostess offered corkscrew, plates, utensils, napkins and wine glasses so we could enjoy our birthday celebration. She so enjoyed her Parisian birthday celebration!!! Though we had brought our own, I noticed that there was an umbrella bucket at the reception area filled with like umbrellas, obviously there in case you'd forgotten to bring one. I have to admit that we did hear the metro rumble - but it \"never\" interfered with our sleep. I am an extremely light sleeper. I think partially because the trains slow to a snails pace at some point and stop at about 1. Resume early morning but never bothered us. Thoroughly enjoyed the view out the two \"huge\" windows facing the street in front of the hotel. Open air market one morning. You cannot get a better value unless large reception areas are your thing. Let me mention the Boulangerie across the street one more time!!!! I would stay here every time I went to Paris & not hesitate to recommend it. So much value for the $. The owner treats you like a guest in her home but you have a lock on your door - which we actually forgot to lock on several nights.

While it is some distance from the centre of Paris, it has a metro entrance literally outside the door for a line that goes straight to Concorde. Provided that you are reasonably mobile to cope with the longish metro walks and stairways, all you have to do is to climb the stairways out of the Metro and you emerge only steps from the front door of the hotel. From a transport point of view, Paris is at your feet. We chose the hotel because it had been recommended as being good value and of a quality superior to many that are far more expensive in the city centre. It looked good on its website, also. We received a warm welcome. It is our understanding that the average bedroom size in Paris is much smaller than the norm in other cities in Europe and USA. Our room was small, but perfectly formed, with a high ceiling. It had two tall windows overlooking the trees and the street. We appreciated the simple, restful, clean decor. Wardrobe space was fine for people like us there for a few days who dress simply. We valued the safe in the wardrobe. The bed was comfortable and the bedding spotless white. The bathroom is very small but well lit, clean and had a good shower in the bath, lovely natural toiletries and adequate towels, which included a facecloth. A bonus in that room is that the toilet is separate from the bathroom. I liked the touch of the basket of magazines in the bedroom. There was no television in our room, but given that we were on a break from busy lives, that was a bonus. We liked the breakfast! We are NOT people who like the smell of fried food in the morning so if that is your lifeline to wake up, this is not the hotel for you. The breakfast room is simply and attractively furnished and the food is self service. Choose from whole fresh fruit - bananas, kiwis, oranges were on offer, fruit juice, cereals, milk, lovely choice of excellent breads from the high quality boulangerie across the road, honey, jam, lovely cheeses,yoghurt, cold sliced ham, teas and coffee. All at your own pace. This is not a fancy hotel, it is not in a modern building so if you want acres of tiling, 21st century minimalism, go somewhere else. The orginal simple architectural features of the building remain - stair balustrades with carpeting as it would have been done originally. We really appreciated that we got - for Paris - good value. The metro trip is not more than 20 mins from the city centre and the bus for the Gare du Nore railway station stops right outside the door going to the train station and across the road coming from it. If Charles de Gaulle is your airport, it could not be better as the train from the airport goes to Gare du Nore and the bus station is right beside the train station. We walked over to the boulangerie one day and found high quality food - they take pride in their work and made up a baguette with the fillings we desired. Their pastries are works of art. Sometimes in the mornings there are queues outside the bakery. Strolling around the streets behind the boulangerie admiring the intricate and varied architecture of the apartment buildings was pleasant and there is a large park not too far away. The area gives you the feel of what living in inner suburban Paris is like. The pleasant welcome and friendliness in the hotel added to our positive experience of Paris. If we could have afforded super luxury accommodation right beside the Louvre, we'd have gone there. But this is simple, clean, good quality hospitality that is NOT souless chain, poorly-maintained-because- we-are-selling-ourselves-as-inexpensive rip-off. We enjoyed our short trip to see the sights of Paris and were exhilerated by the simple pleasures of being in a beautiful place together sightseeing and delighting in so much. This hotel met our needs and did not detract in any way from our expereince. Would we go back to it? YES, most definitely. When that will be, is another question. We were a couple, but this would also be a good hotel for a single person on a budget and would be fine for the business person who needs good clean food to set them up for the day, with the certain knowledge of transport with links to everywhere in Paris close at hand.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExceptional - not your average 2-star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "AmataH", "ReviewID": "UR91444204", "Content": "I stayed at Porte Doree in a single room from 30 December 2010 to 1 January 2011 and was thrilled with my stay.

My room was spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable and smartly decorated, with a small writing desk and chair (confirming that it was bigger than the glorified wardrobes you'll find masquerading as single rooms in many Parisian hotels) and fast, free wifi. The room was also fitted with its own airconditioner/heater, meaning that I could control the temperature exactly as I pleased. No, it isn't quite in the heart of Paris, but an easy 20 mins or so on the Metro (the station is a stone's throw from the hotel) will get you most places you want to go. The 4.5km Promenade Plantee - similar to New York's High Line - also begins very near the hotel, offering a lovely scenic walk to the Bastille. My room included a terrific booklet of information on local restaurants, shops and sights, giving residents the opportunity to make the most of the neighbourhood and get off the beaten tourist track. One of those local treasures is the boulangerie across the street; the source of the amazing pastries you'll enjoy as part of a Porte Doree breakfast. In short: I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, and have already suggested that friends stay here. It is a real find. The only tiny thing I could suggest as an improvement would be the quality of the towels, which were a bit scratchy and institutional. Still, for a two-star hotel, this is absolutely outstanding and charming. Some have commented on noise from the Metro but I could only hear a low rumble on the 3rd floor, and that was nowhere near loud enough to be a bother.

The staff were very kind and helpful to us and allowed us to store our big bags at the hotel on the last day, and then arranged for a taxi for us to Charles De Gaule airport, which was only 30 minutes away.

The metro is so easy to navigate through and you can get dropped off pretty much anywhere in Paris that you would want to go to. The neighborhood is lit with streetlamps and even after dark there were always at least a few people milling around, grabbing a late dinner,etc. There were several eateries nearby (within 2-3 blocks) that we could walk to and were reasonably priced. There were two pharmacies within a couple of blocks that we were (very) grateful for and, during the week there is a bakery right across the street that supplies scrumptious breads to munch on. There was at least one ATM about a block away that I used, and I think I saw a second one about two blocks further on. The front desk staff were GREAT! Two of the young ladies working there answered all of our questions, gave us great advice on what to do, and wrote down important tips on how to get around smartly. And they were both from California so their English was perfect! The hotel itself was adorable!! The front waiting area had an ornate couch, warm lighting, and shelves filled with books. There is an elevator but it is TINY and you can't help but laugh while you're in it! My friend and I could barely fit squeeze in, my backpack barely made it! Follow the tapestry-covered staircase up and you're greeted on every turn with more shelves packed with books, art hanging on the walls, and light sconces warming each level. The halls are made of hardwood floor and covered with rug runners that add to the rich details. Our room came with two twin beds that were the most comfortable out of any of our six other hotels. The mattresses were soft with fluffy comforters and pillows. There wasn't much to see outside our windows but we didn't mind at all since we were always out and about. There was a full bathroom, all of the fixtures worked great, the water was hot, my friend took a hot bath every night in the deep tub. We did have a small, flat-screen tv in the room, a safe, and a writing desk. There was shelving in an alcove between the main room and the bathroom which was great to keep our clothes organized. There was a large window in both the bathroom and the bedroom that we could open and let in the natural light to our room. Overall, we LOVED this place!!

The park was easilly the most important feature of the neighboorhood because it gave my son some space to run, and interact with French kids. A bank with an ATM, a grocery store, and a take-away deli, is a couple of blocks away. Since it is a living French neighboorhood, out of the tourist areas, the area is not overrun by hords of tourists, and the real French hospitality has a chance to come out (meaning you get to meet friendly French people).

The breakfast includes fresh croissants and French baguette, eggs, ham, fruit, coffee, teas, apple juice, orange juice, yogurt, cereals, homemade jams and several delights I may have missed, is a great bargain (10 Euros) for Paris and a way for you to fuel up for the sightseeing trip ahead. The hotel is located in a safe neighborhood of Paris with inexpensive restaurants, boulangerie (the bakery across the street at 278 avenue Daumesnil is the GREAT ) and boucherie (butcher) shop a few doors down that has succulent rotisserie chicken all make items for a nice lunch or a picnic in the Bois de Vincennes Park (located near the hotel). The Parc Floral (a flower garden) and the Vincennes Zoo are also a few blocks and within walking distance from the hotel. I took several walks to the Bastille from the hotel on numerous evenings after having dinner in the Porte Dor\u00e9e area and had no problems. A Monoprix grocery store is located nearby for you to pick-up bottled water (for your sightseeing walks), any other toiletries and snacks (the hotel has an ice machine). A self-service laundry facility is also within walking distance of the hotel. Some of the other amenities that Hotel de La Porte Dor\u00e9e offers are: Business center, bar, and a free books exchange, I donated the book I had completed reading. Every Thursday morning, steps away from the front of the hotel there is a weekly market with vendors selling fruits, vegetables, cheese, meats, fish and clothes that spans a few blocks down Avenue Daumesnil. The market is a great place to purchase fresh fruits, cheeses and other food items to try and enjoy while walking around Paris. To get to Hotel De La Porte Dor\u00e9e from Gard du nord Station take the Number 46 bus to the Porte Dor\u00e9e stop or by metro take the 5 Metro line in the direction of Place d'Italie to R\u00e9publique, then transfer to the line 8 in the direction Cr\u00e9teil, and get off at the Porte Dor\u00e9e station. The 46 bus has a better view of Paris, so I opted for the 30 minute bus from Gard du Nord to Hotel De La Porte Dor\u00e9e. Excellent train service -- the Porte Dor\u00e9e train stop is a few steps away the front of the hotel, so a quick 15 minutes train ride will take you into the center of Paris and to most major attractions. Oh Yes, while a train does run under the hotel from 5:45am to 12:30am, I was not bothered while I was at the hotel during the day or at night while I slept and I'm a light sleeper. Throughout my stay at Hotel De La Porte Dor\u00e9e, that staff was professional, courteous, helpful, and friendly, all of the things that make Hotel de la Porte Dor\u00e9e a wonderful place to stay. I enjoyed my stay at Hotel De La Porte Dor\u00e9e and was able to easily relax and enjoy my visit to Paris.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Parisian Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RambleOn33", "ReviewID": "UR81047543", "Content": "We loved this hotel!

Because of its proximity to the metro station, you will hear the building shake and a bit noisy as a result. The hotel is consisted of 4-5 floors, there is a very narrow elevator (lift) which will help you get between the floors if you have luggage. If your luggage is larger than the lift you'll have to hand carry it up the floors. We had a room on the third floor, but noise was still heard from the street and the metro. The metro does stop running after 12:30 at night but restarts again around 5:30 in the morning. If you're a light sleeper, this is a distraction more than anything else. If you have no problems, then it's not an issue. I had to use ear plugs and i was able to sleep. The rooms are appointed with a queen bed, closet with small safe, small 19\" TV, work desk and en-suite bathroom. They serve breakfast at 12 euros/person on the downstair floor. They also have a computer and printer on the second floor. Wifi is free and included and is not bad at all, pretty good connection speed. For the price, this is a good deal. The biggest reason besides the noise from the metro for not coming here really is the location .. it is about a 30-35 min. metro ride into most places visitors would want to go to (and that usually involves changing at least once or twice). As we were only planning to spend a day or two in paris and the rest of the time going on day excursions this wasn't bad. The local neighborhood is safe, lots of great restaurants/cafes/shopping areas. The owners of the hotel do a good job with the guide they give you with lots of suggestions and they are very helpful. So, if you want a nicely priced hotel and ok with the metro noise an being a bit far from the center this is for you. if you need something closer to the city, this is not the place as the commute in may be inconvenient, better to pay more for a closer place.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuper\u201d", "Author": "Digger21", "ReviewID": "UR78927981", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay.

Its a modern lift so none of that feeling like you're in a cage...so it was even OK for my claustophobic mother. Yes you can hear the rumble of the trains. Just bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper and dont let it bother you. I was worried before we came that my mother might complain about it..but even she was Ok with it. Ive been woken in a hotel in Covent Garden, London by partygoers at 3am..so I would prefer train rumble any night! its less intrusive than road noise. Breakfast was included as an offer for August and wonderful..from the bakery across the road. A good selection of fruit, cheese, yoghurts etc. Lovely jams. The area...i wouldnt describe it was 'gritty' as one reviewer did...again that worried me but its in a lovely leafy avenue, and even the side streets feel very safe. Much safer than in central Paris. Location. Again some past reviewers have said its out of the way, but it took us less than 30 mins to the Opera door to door. Wherever you stay in Paris you are likely to use the metro so it doesnt make any real difference. Yes its not as central as the Ritz but the local restaurants are better! and its not 500e-10000e a night! I normally manage to find fault with most hotels...before I know it Im scanning the skirting boards for dust...but I couldnt fault this hotel. We had room 36 at the back ground floor with a terrace( superior double) ...godsend to sit out with a bottle of wine when we arrived. We also had 37 at the front with a connecting small corridor which overlooked the street. Both together are the family room. I think room 39 is also at the back and has a bigger terrace so get that one if you can. We also had a single room (classic but still very stylish?) 46 which was great. Another superior twin (with bath) on 4th floor lovely and areary with views over the trees. Very romantic. Hot water and showers no problems at all. Free WiFi. Computer in room on first floor more than adequate. Local information. Again I spend ages on tripadvisor looking at best places to go and eat. You dont need to here. The American owner gives good honest info on everything you need to know. We went to Monoprix supermarket. Turn right out of hotel and 5-10 mins walk along main avenue. Eating. Cascades first night...diagonal across main street. Great service, omlettes for 5 euros, maison hamburger...12e, plat du jours 13e. Villa Romana on 2nd night (turn right out og hotel on main street) . My favorite. Moules 10e, good house rose 9e for 1litre (I think), pizza 8-9euros, good deserts, try the Citroen vodka! Great efficient service, although it has English translation on the menu and the waiter spoke great English (even though we tried our french!) we were the only tourists the rest being busy with locals. Total bill 130euros inc deserts and wines and beers for 7 people. A bargain. Just to put this in context we had a coffee in a cafe near the Opera for 7.50euros..nothing special about the cafe! Activities. Some went to the Le Bougyet Airport to see the concordes. Others, we went on DiscoverWalks Right Bank tour. Brilliant. Very funny and informative...we had a guide who is also an actress and its just like they say on their leaflet. This isnt about reading out from a guide book.......We felt we had seen some of the real Paris. They market it as free and say they then have to work hard at being good so you might give them a tip and the standard tip is 10euros for a 90 minute tour. Worth every cent.

We stayed at the hotel for four nights. We booked two rooms, the Classic Double room for my wife and myself and the Superior Twin room for the our family with an Extra Bed. Reservation/Booking: I reserved through the Hotel website. I couldn't use third party sites like hotel.com, etc since I need one room to fit 3 people and we had 5 people in total. On their reservation site they have some internet deals. I chose the 3 night package price which can be used for a minimum of 3 nights or more. Also on the site you can chose a triple room or you can chose a superior room and book an extra bed. The extra bed is 20 euros a night. Once we arrived the rooms were ready and the extra bed was already in the right room. Location: The hotel is in the 12th Arrondisement which is at the outer edge of main city Paris. The metro stop is Porte Doree on the 8 line. From the metro use Sortie #2 Ave Daumesnil. The hotel is on the same block with the metro. The neighborhood is quiet and residencial. Within a block there is a Boulangerie(bakery), several restaurants, a little convenience store, a McDonalds and a Quick (like a McDonalds). Close by is the Bois de Vincennes (a huge park), Chateau de Vincennes (a palace), and an Aquarium. Currently the block where the hotel is situated has construction (looks like they are laying down fiber or fixing pipe) which makes crossing the street a little inconvenient. The hotel is on top of the metro line. We were on the 4 level(3rd floor) and I could sense it a little bit. If I had not read about it here then I may have not noticed, but it wasn't so bad that it prevented us from sleeping. I cannot say it would be the same if we stayed on the lower levels. If you are worried about this bothering you, maybe just ask for a room on the higher levels. The only metro close by is the Line 8(Lavender). The 8 is a good line since it'll take you to these sites with walking distance: Eiffel Tower, Rue Cler, Hotel Invalides, Napoleon's Tomb, Opera, Canal Saint Martin, Opera, Concorde, Musee Grevin. It's also just one transfer to other lines like Line 1 and RER C which will take you to many of the major sites. We never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for the metro to come. The main bus line is 46 which will take you straight to Gare du Nord one way and Chateau de Vincennes the other way. A taxi from the airport will cost less than 50 euros. If you forget the address just tell the driver to go to the metro stop Porte Doree. If you have bulky luggage and don't want to use a taxi I suggest catching the bus 46 from Gare du Nord or Gare d Lest to the hotel. From the Charles de Gaulle you can get to Gare du Nord from the RER B. Otherwise, if you take the metro you will have to take two trains. Rooms: My wife and I stayed in the Classic Double, Room 25. The room had a dresser that had a closet with hangers, a safe, and some shelf space. The room also had a chair, a desk with a mirror and an old heater/fireplace of which I was unsure if it was still functional. The bed was a queen bed. There was enough space to be comfortable with our luggage(2 back packs and two hand carry size rollers but not enough for an extra bed. The bed was comfortable including the pillows and comforters. The toilet was a separate closet from the sink and stand-in shower. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom. They had shampoo, conditioner and body wash by the sink, however, they never provided drinking glasses. There was no fridge or minibar. The TV was a flat screen LCD and it looked like a 22 inch. As far as airconditioning, I couldn't tell. There were vents but I couln't find a thermostat. The weather was unusually cool so I am not sure we needed the AC. We had one big window facing out front. Noise level was not an issue even with the construction, but we were always up before 9am. I did not have any experience with using the WiFi, although it is free. My Nook connected to it but I never used it. It is not secured so you don't need a password. The small computer room with one computer was sufficient for my needs. My family in the other room(room 27) had no complaints. Here are the main differences between the classic room and the superior from my observations: -the room was bigger and the space was more than enough to make it comfortable even with the extra bed -there was a thermostat -the room had a bathtub instead of a stand in shower Staff: The staff was very polite. The people in the front desk were all fluent in English. The hotel still uses the old lock and key for the doors which you have to drop at the front desk before you leave. If you want the hotel to call for a shuttle for you to the airport, I think it was 40 euros as a flat fee. You do have to give a 16 euro deposit to the front desk. I never used this but I was in the lobby when someone needed to be picked up early the next morning. Over all everything was good for the price I paid for four nights and two rooms. If came with a large group I would try this hotel again.

It is a residential neighborhood that is quite near the \"peripherique\" (the highway that surrounds Paris). The air quality in the neighborhood is not at all good. Additionally, the hotel is right above a subway line. While the proximity to the subway station is very convenient, you also feel the hotel rumble every few minutes when the trains go by. In many ways, it's pretty bare bones (not even a box of tissues in the room). It is reasonably clean, although I did find there was a slightly musty sweet odor in the room that I didn't care for. On the other hand, the attitude of the people at the desk ranges mostly from indifference to outright rudeness. Additionally, while they bill themselves as a \"green\" nop-smoking hotel, the desk people smoke right in front of the open door, allowing smoke to go right into the lobby. Probably the best thing you can say about it is that the building has some charm, the prices are low, and there is no smoking in the actual building. On the other hand, the computer is in a tiny room and hard to see/use (although I do believe it had an American keyboard) and in order to print something you have to email it to the front desk. The restaurant list is so outdated that the closest recommended restaurant turns out to have closed several years ago. The advice of the desk people on basic things is not to be relied upon.

The hotel is clean and the front desk staff are nice enough. I paid extra for a superior double room. It was a complete waste of money. The bed really didn't seem any bigger than a normal double (advertised as larger) and the room definitely wasn't any bigger (as advertised as larger). We know for sure the room was small as we looked on the fire escape map and it was one of the smallest rooms. Be prepared for stairs if you stay here. There is an extrememly small elevator to put your luggage in to get it to your room. You will always have to use the stairs. Sure it's a good work out, but after you've been touring Paris all day the last thing you really want to do is climb 3 flights of stairs to get to your room. Like I said above the rooms are small, ours especially. There really wasn't any room to have luggage. It had to be closed and standing all the time to move around the room. If it was open and on the floor (since they had no luggage racks) it would take up all the floor space. The room and bedding appeared to be clean. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were not. The bathroom was extremely dated and not well kept. It was clean enough but the flusher on the toilet was cracked. It usually took a couple tries to get the toilet to flush. The shower also leaked. The shower was extremely tight. I barely fit and I'm average height and a slim build. My husband had to duck to get his head under the shower and he's only 6ft. The water pressure was horrible. I have long hair and it would take me 30 minutes just to get the soap out. The water also seems to be connected to other people's rooms. If you heard a flush next door all of a sudden you would have burning hot water on you. If someone else was showering you couldn't get hot water. In our room we had the big beautiful french window. A complete waste though because they are completely blocked by a giant tree. That's not what I call a good view. Transportation into the city center is easy, but not quick. The metro station is right outside of the hotel. If you manage to get every metro perfectly timed it will take 30 minutes to get to the Arch D' Triomphe. Perfectly timed is NEVER the case. On average we found it took 60 minutes to go anywhere. Be prepared to stand and wait at the Porte Doree Station for 20 minutes before you can catch a train. I am also disappointed in this hotel because they are the only hotel on our trip that did not go above and beyond to make our honeymoon special. I did not expect anything prior to leaving but when every other hotel gave us room upgrades and free meals, and bottles of wine to celebrate it sets the bar at a certain level. This hotel isn't willing to go above and beyond to make a special experience for the traveler. The one good thing about this hotel was the food near by. The bakery across the street had wonderful pastries, and the restaurant on the corner called Le Cascades had great food and wonderful service. Overall I would not stay here again. There are better hotels closer to the city center. They might cost a little more, but it's worth it to not have a 60 minute metro ride.

The neighborhood is quiet and there are shops around for anything that you might need. I had fond memories of the patisserie across the street and it was just as I remembered it. If only I could find a way to bring back home some of those croissants aux amandes or the pain aux raisins! There's a corner MacDonald's in case you want something fast and cheap, lots of little grocery shops for a light dinner, a tabac, a drugstore and some restaurants. I like Cafe Les Cascades cause they are open late and the food is good but not too expensive, as well as the corner pizza shop. The hotel is nice and clean and the service is good without being too much. They have a computer with internet access on the second floor that you can use and wireless access but my experience was it only worked well in the lobby/reception area. Overall, I was very satisfied with this hotel and I can't wait to visit Paris and this hotel again...", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBooking online can be glitchy but the stay is worth it\u201d", "Author": "periwinkl", "ReviewID": "UR70804811", "Content": "Massively convoluted exchange caused by a temporary glitch with their online booking system meant it took me nearly a week to amend, update, and renegotiate the terms of my booking!

In fact, I anticipated a smaller room (from the pics and from other reviews) than the one I actually got, which was very adequate for one person, very clean, and the bed was nice and comfy. I didn't really use the staff a whole lot, but they're always friendly and are happy to help at any time. As for the metro which I remember reading in other reviews prior to my stay, to be honest, I didn't notice it at all. But, I am a heavy sleeper and wasn't in the room except during late night and early morning, so maybe there were less trains then and I just wasn't bothered by the noise. (I was also not on the ground/first floor, so maybe that helped?) As for the elevator, I never used it (and forgotten to take a look at it), so no idea about the size or functionality. The location is a bit further away from the main city area, but Paris is such an easy city to navigate with the metro that it was definitely worth it in exchange for a room that is very clean and a hotel where you don't have to worry about getting ripped off or have things stolen or something. I had a great time in Paris and I'll definitely try and book this hotel on my next visit. Oh, but there is one con - and a strange one at that. In my room, near the window, there was this hole (maybe the size of half an A4 size paper, around waist level. I didn't even see it til the end of my visit because it was blocked by the desk and the curtains) in the wall. It didn't affect my visit since I didn't know it was there, and there wasn't any weird smell or wires or gross things in the hole, and it was far away enough from the bed and closet and my things that I'm not too worried about safety issues, but it was very strange to find just this random hole in the wall. Hope they get that covered up soon! But if that creeps you out, I'd suggest one to really check out the room (so if there is a hole, perhaps you could get a different room or something) when you first check in just to be sure.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 2* accomodation In Paris\u201d", "Author": "peter023", "ReviewID": "UR66141190", "Content": "Whilst visiting Disneyland Paris we decided on the spur of the moment to extend our stay by a couple of days by visiting Paris. Finding a Hotel in such short notice was quite problematic and all the hotels i knew in Paris were all fully booked. With the aid of a website i knew little about www.parishotels.com i managed to find a few that looked promising, one of which was Hotel de la Porte Doree. Probably a little further out from Paris than i originally wanted but hey after 2hrs of searching i wasn't going to complain too much. Well here is where I made my first mistake, i phoned the hotel and was quoted a price of 150 euro's...which was within my budget, but closer examination would have made me a realise if i had booked on-line then that price would have been 30 euro's cheaper. The on-line site of this hotel has three different prices, so be aware, if you phone or walk in off the street you will be quoted the public price. All in all i got what i wanted so i can't complain, just noted for future reference. The hotel was easy to find literally steps from the metro entrance in a leafy suburb of Paris. The entrance has a few steps and the lift was comical, we have a small stroller buggy which couldn't fit in, we just put our luggage in and ran up the stairs ( see pic's). The room was small but i knew we had booked the last available room so again no complaints. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable, but i had less than 1ft around the bed, if was to stay longer i would have requested another room and for the price i eventually paid, it didn't feel money for value. But for one night it was more than adequate. Another warning.....when i spoke to reception earlier that day the female i spoke to had excellent English, when i arrived the male receptionist had quite poor English which made communication quite slow and difficult, but hey another minor point and did nothing to detract from our stay. As quoted earlier the metro is steps away and you can hear and feel the rumble of the trains beneath you, so light sleepers be warned, me personally i had no issues. Breakfast cost 12euro's and although i didn't partake it looked very nice, we did have coffee and juices delivered to our room which was presented well and i would presume the breakfast was of the same standard. As a travel advisor i get to travel a lot and have stayed in 100's of hotels/guest-houses etc and would definitely recommend this hotel to others as long as you heed the warnings above. When we left i did take the opportunity to look at the other rooms which is how i know we had the smallest room in the hotel, but i was still happy with my stay and would most likely visit again. One last warning, the hotel states that it has free Wi-fi in all rooms, well unfortunately this doesn't seem to be the case. Reception will give you a log on and password and in reception the access is great but as soon as i left reception i lost the signal, room 7 is above reception and i still couldn't get a signal, so again just a minor point, there are seats in reception as well as a desktop so i could still access my emails etc. Hope this is useful for someone !!", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alvechurch, Worcs, UK", "Title": "\u201cstylish and good\u201d", "Author": "EBGB,s", "ReviewID": "UR64492238", "Content": "This is a stylish, clean hotel and a good stay for sightseeing Paris.

I am pleased to say, it met them. We decided we wanted to treat ourselves while we were in Paris, so we paid the little bit extra and got the Queen Size Room. This room is on the ground floor, which means you don't have to worry about the tiny lift. We were also quite happy with the size of the room. It was much bigger than we had experienced so far on the trip, and it had lots of cupboard space, and as we were staying for several days, we were able to unpack and hide our bags away, rather than tripping over them all the time. Being on the ground floor though, I was worried about the rumble you could hear from the subway. However it did not keep us up/ or wake us at all. In fact I had the best nights sleep while staying here, compared to places we had stayed in England. This was due to the best feature of the room, eletronic window shutters that totally blocked out the light. Being on the Ground floor, we had french doors that went out to our own private courtyard. This is Room 37, I did not take any photos of this room but I have seen some photos of it on here. The area was also very good. The first night we went to La Gourmandise, right next door to the hotel. Our French was hopeless and they didn't speak much English, but the expereince was good and the food was fantastic. The pizza place next to La Gourmandise was also very good for a quick, light and cheap meal. We stayed at Porte Doree from a Saturday until the Wednesday. Therefore we were unlucky that the Boulangerie across the street was only open on the Sunday and Wednesday morning. We walked down Avenue Daumesnil to the Michel Bizot entrance of the Subway, where there was another Boulangerie. They were also very good. They sold lovely Baguets filled with very yummy sandwich fillings, the brie cheese was the best. We also ventured up to the round about up near the Daumesnil subway entrance. Up there it was a bit busier and more cafes. Here you got a real sense of a Parsian Neighbourhood. We also went to the new Bercy Village. The gardens were beautiful and the shops and cafes there were trendy and nice. This was within 15 min walk from the hotel. The park near the hotel, was also a nice area to walk around. The subway system was very easy. If you missed one, another one would come in 3 or 4 minutes. It didn't take long to get anywhere really. There were several places of interest you could go to with out switching lines and everything else was only one change. The trains and subways have the route map and the line changes, which is very helpful. One night we stayed at the Eifel Tower until quite late, and didn't really think of how to get home. In the end it was very easy, line 6 took us from Eifel (Bir-Hakeim) to Daumesnil, and then we just walked back to the hotel. It did take about 35 min but it was direct and very easy. All in all we had a nice time in Paris and a wonderful stay at Hotel De La Porte Doree. If I ever get back to Paris, I would stay there again.

After hours of searching for hotels online I picked this one based on the reviews and photographs of the hotel from reviewers on TripAdvisor. As it was a 2 star I was a little nervous, but when I arrived it was far nicer than I had imagined and not what I thought a two star hotel would look like. And I'm quite picky about hotels! The room was larger than I expected which was great, as most Parisian hotel rooms I had viewed looked no bigger or better than student accommodation, and was spotless and decorated beautifully. The beds were clean and comfy. The bathroom, which had a bath, toilet, sink and two shower heads was also a fine size. There was also a sort of little hall as you walked into the room with a wardrobe and safe, so the room seemed more like a little bedsit. We were on the top floor but you can still hear the faint rumblings of the metro, if you are sensitive to noise this may be an issue for you, but it didn't bother me at all. The only issue I had with the room was with the bathroom hair-dryer, it would stop every now and then while in use but it's usually hit and miss with hotel hair-dryers anyway and it was no big deal. The rest of the hotel is decorated beautifully from reception to the furniture on each floor to the breakfast room. Yes the lift is tiny but I used it frequently as did my mother who was dubious at first. As for the staff, I found them to be very nice and the American lady on reception was particularly helpful. Breakfast was lovely - fresh pastries, eggs, meats, cereals, juice and coffee was on offer every morning, it's \u20ac9 but we felt it was worth it for the quality and quantity of food available. The hotel is about 20 minutes by Metro away from the main tourist sites in the city but as we had planned to use the Metro to travel all over the city this wasn't an issue and it was right beside the hotel - I don't like to stay in the heart of the city because it can be quite noisy and you really don't feel the 20 minutes on the Metro!

The price was right and even though it's farther away from the main touristy things it was the best choice. It's a short walk to the metro station so the distance isn't too bad. We opted for the larger queen size room for comfort since Paris hotels are supposed to be TINY! Well the room wasn't huge but it was enough that we didn't feel like we were in a tiny room. The bathroom's small, but much more roomy than I expected and very clean. We had a shower with an adjustable shower knozzle for those taller people. We were pleased with the room and having in-room internet access for our laptop. I will say I was at first disappointed to see we were on the first floor. I'd read reviews about the noise. We were a little annoyed to be on the first floor and you can hear the metro and some random water noise running through pipes, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be after reading the complaints. We were going to give it a night and see if we wanted another room but it wasn't bad at all. We weren't woken by it either so it did not affect our honeymoon. We didn't try the breakfast because we were trying to save money. The Boulangerie across the street was EXCELLENT though. It's got great bread and pastries and is packed on the weekends. Be sure to look in the little hotel booklet. It gives nearby recommendations for restaurants and tourist things to do. The italian place to the right of the boulangerie was also excellent. The Bistro de la Porte Doree was good too, but not cheap. And by all means, avoid the McDonald's nearby... there're other ways to eat cheap. Do it the way many french people all do, eat bread or a sandwich on the go for lunch and eat a nice dinner. I loved the excuse to eat pain au chocolat (bread with chocolate inside) for many many breakfast and lunches. You can look at the menu and prices before going into almost all restaurants in Paris to see if it's affordable.

The sink had a medicine cabinet above it, but the handle was broken off, so you couldnt access it easily. The biggest issue with this hotel was noise. We kept the window shut, and really didn't notice the street noise, but the metro below the hotel was very obvious. It was a deep rumbling noise, every 15 mins or so until 1am. On top of that, we heard every noise coming from people going up the stairs, as well as noise from adjoining rooms (conversations, flushing toilets, showers etc). We could also clearly hear footsteps above us, and would jump everytime the people in the room above us dropped something on their floor. Worst of all we were above the breakfast room, so we could hear all of that noise as well. No chance to sleep in! Also, despite this being a non-smoking hotel, we could smell cigarette smoke coming through the ventilation. They told us to report anyone smoking, but we couldn't work out where it was coming from. We didn't have any problems with the staff - they were more than helpful, and the American lady working during the day was great with sightseeing tips.

A couple of days before we left, while checking the RATP (integrated transport authority for Paris) site, I found out that the Porte Dor\u00e9e station is closed for renovations. I now know I shouldn't have worried, as the Michel Bizot station, just before Porte Dor\u00e9e, is only a 10 minutes walk from the hotel and takes you right by 2 boulangeries with mouth watering offers. The location of the hotel, in the 12th arrondisment might not seem ideal for sightseeing purposes, yet this is one of the aspects I enjoyed most about the hotel. Staying there you will not be in walking distance of the Louvre or the Tour Eiffel, but you will be 20 minutes away by metro and, best of all, you will experience a \"real\" Parisian neighbourhood. This being a residential neighbourhood, everything a traveler might need will be readily available : 3 great boulangeries, restaurants, a Monoprix supermarket, a launderette and even a 'Fleuroteque' (a florist, but isn't that a cute commercial name). Our room was very nice, spotlessly clean, with extra-confy beds and lovely furnishings. Although the hotel was undergoing renovations when we were there, this did not affect the room in any way. The only thing I would've appreciated in the room but there wasn't one is a mini-fridge for keeping drinks cool. Not a big deal, though.

As a middle aged woman traveling alone, I found the hotel to be a bit off-putting. First of all, the room numbers have no relation to the floors. I was on the 1st floor in room 46, while my friend, who met me in Paris, was on the 2nd floor in room 11. It made it confusing. Plus, they were doing construction while I was there and that gave the place an unfinished feeling. When we returned one evening from a late meal, I found the motion sensor lights on the stairs to be a bit scary. Sometimes it was several seconds before they came on and walking in a darkened stairwell in a strange hotel was uncomfortable. Any hotel room for a single person always seems to be something converted from a closet, which unfortunately seems to be the norm everywhere. The window in my room looked out on to a brick wall. The room itself was very tiny, but clean. The bathroom was a nice size and spotless. I highly recommend upgrading to a double. We saw inside one of the double rooms, and they look just like the pictures on the website. The staff was very nice and helpful. The location is good and the neighborhood felt safe. Another issue for me was that as a vegetarian I found the neighborhood to definitely be lacking in meal options. The French bistro mentioned earlier (which was very nice) where we had dinner one evening had nothing on the menu I could eat, with the exception of a starter that consisted of a nice selection of cheese and some bread. But the Metro station was close, and we had an easy time getting around Paris from there. The French people were of course, wonderful and were very helpful when we needed help.

In the bathroom we enjoyed the luxury of very big medicine cabinets to unpack into. Our room had a his and hers closet. We woke to the sounds of the city with our terrace doors open. And chose to eat breakfast on the terraces because it was such fine private outdoor space. The gentleman that served our breakfast was so great, in addition to our rooms he was serving other guests of the hotel in the breakfast room, which was so gorgeous. The food was of course a typical delicious french fare and the coffee was so nice to wake up to. The front door staff was great. The mornings we had plenty of help making the right decision on what to do with the family for the day. Less than obvious pointers were made to us to make for smooth sight seeing days. Along with thoughtful recommendations we followed up on and were very please weather is was a specialty shop or the right area to exchange money. They really made a huge effort to supply us with the right maps for the day. The night men were always there and seemed to be alert the night through, I really appreciated a locked door after 2am for a sense of security. Although the neighborhood is so dreamy. The house keeping was really great and very helpful. The rooms had full attention everyday and the linens towels were a very nice quality. The location for us was great. Very close to the hotel is the Bois des Vincennes. A huge park. The flowers were amazing there. And if you like bonsai trees it was a real treat.

First off, the location is great, and though not in central Paris, is easily accessible with a metro station 30 seconds from the door. The neighborhood is nice, with a McDonalds and a lovely bakery across from it and very safe. The rooms, though not very large, are cute and nicely decorated. The toilet and shower are separate, but that wasn't a big deal to us. Blankets all seemed clean, bed was comfortable. The toilet room, however, smelled a bit like mold. The shower didn't really have a curtain, either, just a glass door covering half the shower, thus a lot of water would come out. Most of the staff was friendly enough, though the night person did not seem that friendly and rather annoyed at any questions or requests. There was a baby crib in our room for some reason and it turned out that it was supposed to be for the room next to ours, but when I phoned down to ask very politely why it was here and if they could take it away, he was rude and abrupt and got annoyed with me like I had done something wrong, telling me to speak to the manager even though I had no idea who the manager was or where he/she was. In the end, we resolved the issue ourselves when we found the family next door outside their room waiting for a crib and moved it to their room. The lift is really small, like you have to see it to believe it, so we took the stairs most of the time, and it didn't even work when we actually needed it. Another really big peeve I had was the amount of noise your could hear through the door, waking me up early every morning. Whenever someone made any noise in the hallway, you could hear it very clearly. I left my room with the TV on to go get some ice and could hear it clearly from the hallway even though the volume wasn't on that loudly.

Some aspects reviewed in the previous bad rating we will compare. We booked a lower fare through the hotel's website and chose a refinished room. The hotel is clean. Our room was sparkling clean. Indeed, there is not much room for suitcases or running around but this is Europe, People! We were able to put one large suitcase down and could walk around it. The floors were clean and so was the bed. It was extremely comfortable to an extent that we had difficulty getting out of it in the morning. The bathroom was cleaned every day. Upon our arrival we noticed that the shower door was unhinged; it was fixed promptly. Yes, the shower was small, good enough for us but maybe not for a plus-sized person. The air-conditioning worked very well. We did hear the metro every once in a while but by no means was this bad and the street (a relatively major road) did not seem noisy from our first floor room. Even when we left the window open, we could easily sleep through the minimal noise. We didn't watch much TV cause we were in PARIS and didn't come to watch TV in our hotel but spent most of our time out and about (the content of european TV is more liberal than the US: gun fights and murder shows are found to be more offensive than a naked breast). The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. Sometimes the fren-glish can be misinterpreted as harsh but it is not by any means. Everyone on staff at least attempted to speak English and they were polite and helpful. The location of this hotel is absolutely ideal: there are three Boulangerie's (bread and pastry shop) with absolutely delicious warm breads to feast in the morning. There is a great authentic french restaurant around the corner which shares the hotel's name and probably has the best meal we had in our three week vacation. One can also find many other restaurants in the neighborhood. The metro stop is 50 feet from the hotel main entrance and unlike the previous reviewer's experience, we were able to reach Paris center within 15-20 mins. We came back before 1am and never felt any transportation problems. When we did arrive later in the night, the staff opened the door for us and were not rude about it. There is a public computer in a separate room with internet access which didn't always work but it was good enough for us. We definitely would return to this hotel. If you chose this hotel, you clearly are making a choice not to pay 300+ Euro's to be able to stay in the heart of Paris. The distance from the city center is easily compensated by the cleanliness, comfort, the proximity to metro and local scene.

We didn't want to spend a ton of money, and based on the reviews here, this hotel seemed like a decent choice. Sadly, this was not the case. First of all, while the room was of a reasonable size, there was practically no place to put anything, like luggage, toiletries, etc. There was a small table/writing desk which didn't really serve much purpose, a small closet with a few hangers, and two very small ledges next to the beds, with basically enough room for a glass of water. For people with a good amount of luggage, this was a problem, and led to our floor being very cluttered. The bathroom was separate from the toilet (not a problem) and it was very, very small, with no ventilation, so after a shower it was dripping with condensation. The light in the bathroom kept going on and off. The bathtub was exceptionally bad; the floor wasn't flat at any point, and given how cramped it was, one could easily fall while trying to maneuver in the tiny space. The room had an air conditioning control, but it didn't seem to do anything, and the room would get swelteringly hot. The street outside is quite loud, if you intend to leave the window open. In addition, one definitely hears the Metro. We were on the top floor, and it sounded like not-so-distant thunder. Also, beware of the TV stations at night! I am not a prude by any means, but while flipping through channels one night I saw some things which are bound to make the most calloused person blush. These are relatively minor points considering that this is a two star hotel and they don't advertise that they have air conditioning, but other problems are more troubling. The room did not seem to be all that clean, and it had a bit of a musty odor. Worst of all, we both got several bedbug bites. Looking through other reviews since we've been back, I notice that this has been mentioned in another review, so this is obviously an ongoing problem. Based on this alone I would not stay at this hotel again, because as far as I know all you need to do to get rid of bedbugs is to wash the bed linens in hot water. The location of the hotel is really quite bad. The area seems okay as far safety, but if you are there as a tourist, there is practically nothing of interest anywhere close, and it's really, really far to get to all the places you'd like to be while in Paris. You can go to the RATP website and calculate Metro times to various neighborhoods. In our experience, with connections (you always need to make at least one) it took about 30-40 minutes by Metro to get to the center of Paris (Hotel de Ville, Place de la Concorde, for example). Forget about walking. I tried it twice and couldn't make it (and I consider my self in pretty good shape). The Metro stops running at 1 am, so if you're out late (as many people are and should be in Paris) you'll absolutely need to find a cab, which isn't always easy on a weekend. I should also mention that if you get back late at night, you need to ring to have a member of the night staff open the door for you, which was a big turn off for me. The man who would let us in always acted like we had woken him up and he was doing a favor. I didn't want to wake him up any more than he wanted me too, but it's his hotel that feels the need to lock its front door. Other European hotels that lock their door in this fashion usually enable their guest keys to open the front door, and one doesn't feel that he's putting the staff out by coming home late. Also, apart from the woman who seemed to be the owner, the whole staff seemed rather rude, especially at night. I believe that this is an ongoing problem, based on other reviews. All in all, the hotel is relatively cheap, but not cheap enough to justify what you get (especially bedbug bites!). I'd rate it as a pretty mediocre 2-star hotel. What you save on your room, you probably end up sacrificing in cab/metro fare, and in the overall enjoyment of your trip. I would bet you could find a better value for 100 euro a night, which is what we paid. Paris is a lovely city, but it isn't cheap, and you get what you pay for. If you are lucky enough to take a trip there, spend a little extra and find a place with a better location.

The croissants were delicious and as other reviews have mentioned there is plenty to choose from including Fairtrade juices and home made jam. We used the metro to get to and fro the centre of Paris but did not find this to be a problem at all - just give yourself time to plan your day ahead. In the tourist books I purchased prior to our trip the 12th District (where the Hotel is situated) is described as 'Undiscovered Paris' and so we used our last day to try and discover it! We took a stroll along the Promenade Plantee and visited the Viaduct Des Arts. We then visited Le Marais area which is great and then returned to the immediate area of the Hotel to spend some time in the local park -the Bois de Vincennes which is really pretty. We also had lunch at the restaurant next door to the Hotel ~ The Villa Romana which was delicious and inexpensive. We had no problem at all with street noise - in fact we liked it.

TV available in both rooms but limited channels. No fridge. Thin walls - I could hear folks next door chatting, getting ready in the mornings, watching TV late at night. #14: Cramped considering I\u2019m a very petite woman. Also, the shower and toilet were in two separate rooms across from another. Wireless internet was hard to connect and stay connected to. #16: More spacious in comparison, and both shower and toilet were in one room! Wireless internet was much easier to access. Only disadvantage was it was two single beds so my husband and I had to move the beds around so we could sleep together. Location: Loved the neighbourhood, very quaint and gave us a chance to experience the way the locals live. Lots of grocery and pastry stores nearby, however they close early for what we\u2019re used to. The hotel is a bit of a distance from all the touristic sites, at least 30 mins by train. After a long day of walking, getting to the hotel felt like eeeternity. Cleanliness: Up to standards, no complaints. Front desk & Customer Service: I had high expectations as far as customer service at the front desk since all the reviewers were gushing about how friendly and accommodating the staff were. Personally, I didn\u2019t see anything to be impressed about. At some point we had some questions for a gentleman at the front desk (balding and tad feminine one), he was talking to someone on the phone and seemed more interested in doing that than answering our questions about the neighbourhood. On our last day he handled our check-out and almost double charged us but quickly rectified that situation. We had questions about getting to the airport and he didn\u2019t seem too happy about answering those either. All in all mediocre hotel.

Coffee or tea, apple or orange juice ad lib, (hard) boiled eggs, homemade jam (yummy), fresh fruit, a croissant + some white bread. You will not find it better or cheaper in the nearby bistros. - the bistro \"Porte Doree\" just around the corner is a MUST if you like an excellent dinner.

The carpet had not been cleaned around the edges for some time as there was an inch wide strip all the way around the room which was thick with dust and fluff. You could see it was a different colour from the rest of the red carpet. In the bathroom, the large heated towel rail had not been cleaned for some time. Every rung was thick with dust and felt sticky. Not very appealing when our fresh towels were hung on it! A couple of the towels had slight stains on them as did the bed spread. Having complained to the front desk the room was cleaned and we had no problems after that. Some of the wallpaper was peeling though. We were given a discount of 16 euros from our bill in compensation when we checked out. I would stay in the area again but not sure I would stay there. Our room had no tea or coffee facilities and did not have a fridge which would have been helpful. The metro which runs past on a viaduct every few minutes can be a bit annoying as it is quite loud. You can also feel the rumbling of trains beneath you which is strange. If you do decide to stay here, there is a very useful Monoprix supermarket down the road where you can buy very cheap water, filled baguettes, fruit etc. Also the restaurant two doors down, Villa Romana is excellent. You can get a dinner plate of smoked salmon and caviar with a side plate of toast for 8 euros and a huge pot of mussels with fries for 10m euros.

The only problem some people (not me I don\u2019t watch TV) might have is that the TV is a little small... but then again if you really care about watching TV what in the world are you doing in Paris anyhow? The rooms have free Wifi (Although its not a guarded connection which means you may have problems from time to time connecting) and an electronic safe both which I found very handy. Also, if you don\u2019t have a laptop there is a computer room on the main floor for guests to use. The hotel is a 2 second walk from the metro which I found invaluable seeing as we took the metro every day. If you are really ambitious you can even walk downtown... we did this our first day here, however, I would not recommend this for people who are not willing to spend 2-2.5 hrs or so on foot. Right next to the Metro and the Hotel is a great park with an amazing statue , and an aquarium which is included in the Paris Museum pass (only open 10-5pm). There are lots of great restraunts near by , a grocery store and a bakery across the street. The bakery I must say is amazing, YUM! Most of the staff at the restaurants are not very good at English but they really try, and this is France (not the Uk, Canada, US etc etc etc) English is not a requirement and you can get by pretty well anyhow. I guess that there was a little street noise (we were on the 1st floor) but this did not bother me or my boyfriend in the least (and he often has sleeping problems... not here though) someone in these reviews complained about the subway, although it does rumble a little bit this was again no problem for us and hardly noticeable to be honest. The staff and the owners are very helpful and very nice. If you need anything just ask the desk staff and I'm sure they will get it for you. Hmmm what else... oh yea... the bed was VERY comfortable, I'll be lucky if the beds in the other hotels I'll be staying at in Europe are this great.

We wanted to keep our cash for sightseeing and dining, and so we set ourselves the challenge of finding a nice, safe hotel at a reasonable price. The Porte Doree met this description. First things first - this is a clean, attractive hotel with friendly staff. It isn't in a central location, but like so many European cities, Paris has an efficient transport network that we're simply not used to in Britain. Once you've mastered the underground map, getting around is a piece of cake. There's a metro stop just outside the hotel, and it takes around 10 to 15 minutes to get to the heart of Paris. The transfer from Charles de Gaulle airport to the hotel took around one hour. We were on the ground floor of the hotel in a room behind the reception area, and yes, there was a deep rumbling metro noise. This did not adversely affect our experience as we were up and out early and back late, though I can see it being more of an issue for anyone wanting to have a lie in. To us, the many positive aspects of the hotel more than made up for this. We didn't make full use of the hotel's own travellers' guide, but the one restaurant we did visit on its recommendation - Little Italy - was superb, which suggests you can follow it with confidence. I can echo other reviewers' delight at the bakery opposite the hotel. It, without a doubt, offers the best cakes I've ever had, and we tried a few! All in all, this was a great hotel at a great price in the most romantic city in the world. We would definitely stay there again, even if we had more cash available. To us, it was more important to have money to spend on making the most of our time in Paris, than to get a five-star hotel that we'd only be sleeping in. I'd also recommend the book, \"The Mini Rough Guide to Paris\", which we relied on a lot for its street maps.

The rooms were smallish (this is typical for French hotels) but decorated nicely and cozy. American-style pillows were tucked into the closets and when the maid (a very nice older lady) noticed we were using them, she made our beds with them from then on. We had a view of the street outside and lots of leafy trees (we were on the second floor (what we in the U.S. call the second floor)). We were aware of the metro (some people have mentioned this) but aside from a very light rumbling sound and vibration, it wasn't a problem. It was easy to get used to and then easy to ignore. The hotel windows did a good job blocking the sound of the street, but when we opened them for fresh air, the traffic sounds were fairly loud. One real advantage was the hotel's willingness to let clients leave their bags in the lobby pre- or post-checkout. If you arrive with your bags and the room isn't ready, it makes life much easier to be able to leave your bags. We were able to leave them between our 12 noon checkout and 5pm train also. Several people have mentioned the bakery across the street - it was excellent. We'd get pastries and then head to a brasserie up the street for coffees. There was also a creperie nearby and the lady who ran it was extremely friendly and kind. We had a chance to explore the Bois de Vincennes, which is within easy walking distance. There are lots of joggers and dog-walkers and if you keep going, a lovely trail around a small lake. Lac Daumesnil, I believe. The only sour notes in our five-day stay were a random fire alarm at 6:45 one morning that woke the whole hotel up (for apparently no real reason), the loss of wifi for a full day because of a storm (although having free wifi was a treat - and there was an internet place across the street we used since the hotel's own computer was down), and a tiny bit of bad attitude (a little smirking and dismissiveness) from an older gentleman working the hotel desk in the mornings while we were there (we met the owners and they were very nice, but they left soon on vacation so we only saw them our first day there).

Room 46 was not on the top floor near all the other rooms in the 40's(including the surreal room 45 with a door without a doorknob) but right next to the elevators and one floor above the reception area. So along with the noise of the metro trains rumbling (headboard jiggled a bit sometimes during those moments) and the periodic sounds of water rushing down through the pipes in the walls, someone in room 46 might be able to hear noise from the elevator and light sounds of anyone talking in a loud voice from the hotel's lobby. Also, as other reviews have mentioned, the hotel is in a quaint and rather newer part of Paris and very close to the metro stop and businesses such as restaurants, bakeries, and the huge Monoprix grocery store. However, anyone carrying heavy luggage and thinking about using public transportation to arrive at the hotel from either CDG or Orly Airports or specifically from the Chatelet-Les Halles metro stop should be extremely fit or should just abandon the idea. A taxi ride at least from somewhere central is a must, otherwise, one can expect to carry luggage up and down over 8 flights of stairs over the course of making a couple of station transfers to reach the hotel's closest metro stop. Also, the hotel's extremely thin elevator might pose a problem for certain people. With even just heavy bulky luggage, the elevator which measures perhaps 30\" across might make for an unexpectedly unpleasant experience for people used to elevators of greater dimensions. I did see someone at the front desk being extremely nice to a guest. I'm guessing that the same front desk person wrote up the compact tips and travellers' guide in English located in each room.

No complaints about the price-$70 Euros a night is hard to beat. The lobby of the hotel is welcoming and the staff person on duty (Christine I believe) was very friendly. We checked into room 4 and after a long train ride from Amsterdam were ready to take a quick nap before heading out to explore. I know for $70 Euro you cannot expect much in terms of luxury and the simplicity of the room and minimal amenities were fine. As we were laying down to enjoy our nap, I tried to ignore the hairs and stains on our blanket and sheets, although no matter how budget a place is, I would hope for cleanliness. It's hard to know what woke us first....the pleasant sounding gentleman on the phone in the room next to us (we could even hear the phone being picked up and hung up), the constant flushing sound in our bathroom (it seemed the main drain pipe for the place ran through our bathroom), or the rumbling of the subway. All I can say is, if they put you in room No. 4, don't take it. We told ourselves we were there for Paris, not the hotel, which was true and headed out. The next morning when we woke up at 7am because our next door neighbors decided to wake up at 7am, we asked for a room change. We were obliged and moved up to a quieter room on the third floor. This one was better, mostly clearner, although with a broken shower head. But at least it was quiet and we could sleep. We left our adapter in the previous room and the night manager (who a previouse reviewer referred to as not being very helpful) wouldn't even tell us if someone was or wasn't in the room so we could grab it. The area was fine, it's nice to stay in an area where people live as opposed to just for the tourists. There is a supermarket a few blocks down so you can get drinks, etc. and keep them in the room. The subway ride didn't bother us, but we are from NYC and used to public transportation. You have to take the train a good deal in Paris anyway to get from place to place.

There's also a restaurant around the corner also serves interesting french food. The monoprix and other conveniences such as laundromat are nearby. People in this neighborhood are friendly in general and the neighbourhood feels safe, unlike some other dodgy neighbourhoods we chanced on in our travel to Paris. We stayed on the 1st floor fronting the main road. As our window was closed most of the time, we were not too bothered by the noise from the main road. There was one night where the window was opened and i recall that it was quite noisy that night. If you are a light sleeper, you really should try to get a room that is not as noisy. Other reviewers have suggestions. The metro right at the door step is VERY convenient. The way Paris attractions are structured, you will end up walking a lot and relying on the Metro to get around.

The Bois de Vincennes is a gorgeous park and a great place for a walk. Ultimately, it depends on what sort of Paris experience you are seeking. You can't see the Eiffel Tower from the Porte Doree, and the Louvre is a long way away. But the 12th has its own distinct charms, and probably gives you much more of a sense of the \"real\" Paris. So, if you want to wake up yards away from Notre Dame and the Luxembourg Gardens, etc., this is not the place for you. But if you have a little time to spend and want a friendly, tidy hotel, and don't mind being a bit away from things, you can't go wrong. The breakfast, incidentally, was just fine (the croissants came from across the street!).

The hotel is right next to the metro stop \"Porte Doree\" on line 8. It is outside of central Paris in the southeast area. We did not meet Christina the owner because she was in the US. Everyone at the desk was very nice and most of them speak English. The elevator is the smallest I have ever seen but certainly very unique. Our room is large compared to other European hotels. The bathroom was adequate size with a small shower. It wasn't a problem for us, but will be difficult for a larger person to shower. The water pressure is lower than what I prefer but not a big problem. Towels were changed daily. Room and bathroom were very clean. Extra pillows were provided. Since we were on the 4th floor, we did not feel the metro at all. There is no air conditioning, but Paris is still cool at this time of the year, we had our window opened the whole time and was fine. This may be a problem in the summer. The hotel is in a neighborhood, so it was fairly quiet at night even with the window opened. Did not try the breakfast in the hotel. We went to the bakery acrossed the street every morning which has great croissants, quiche, and desserts. Another bakery is further down the street but not very good. There is a grocery store about one metro stop away. There are several great restaurants nearby. Bistro Porte Doree around the corner has wonderful French crusine with a fixed price menu including a bottle of wine. We went there twice. La Gourmandise is right next to the hotel and is another very good French restaurant. For anyone who is craving American fast food, there is a McDonald's right across the street but I do not recommend it with so many other choices around. The hotel is not close to any tourist sights. Took us around 20-30 minutes on the metro to all the sites. This seemed long coming back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing. My only complaint is the Internet access. The hotel has one computer in the lobby but there is always a wait even at 11P. It costs 4 Euro per hour which is bit high compared to all the internet cafes we been to in Europe. Also the internet speed is very slow so it took a long time to check emails. Overall, we really liked this hotel and our stay was very comfortable. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive and clean hotel located outside of central Paris.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in Paris\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5292320", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hotel de la Porte Doree for a week at the end of May.

The small breakfast cafe on the bottom level is a gem. Hard to believe someone would complain about paying $7 euro for a fresh croissant, baguette, home-made jam, cream cheese, fresh coffee, and juice. The service was pleasant as well which is always a bonus. And while most main attractions are far enough to need a cab or tram ride, it is well worth it.

Typically I have reservations regarding opinions I read online, about hotels. Service, convenience, facilities, and expectations can be extremely subjective. Some itinerary decisions are simply leaps of faith, based on intuition. I felt somewhat more comfortable selecting L'Hotel De La Porte Doree, because of the owners responses on trip advisor, to negative comments. It appeared the owner took seriously, any issue that would impact a stay at the hotel. I travel often to Europe, and have stayed in some absolutely wonderful small hotels. The most memorable in my experience are those in mid size communities, where unfettered tourism has not diluted the charm of the area. Hotel De La Porte Doree, was a gem. The initial welcome by the staff was genuine, and personal. The very thoughtful, and appropriately decorated common areas were a reflection of the owners pride in their business. The attention to detail, provided a warm and friendly atmosphere. The elevator was small, but convenient in sending the luggage to our 2nd story room. It allowed us to walk up the stairs, and enjoy the tasteful decor. Our room was larger than I expected, and absolutely pristine with modern ensuite facilities. In concert with the rest of the hotel it was tastfully decorated, conservative, and artfully appropriate. The free wi-fi connection was a definite plus. It allowed us to keep in contact with the folks at home. Our room also had a folder containing a list of favorite places, including suggestions for dining, sight seeing and activites, which was helpful. Hotel De La Porte Doree, is located in a very clean area of Paris, with enough activity to make it interesting, and quiet enough at times, be almost tranquil. Restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies, and public transportation are conveniently close. I sometimes enjoy the comfort food of MacDonalds, and one is located across the street. On the occasion I had difficulty in communicating with a local shopkeeper, someone would always be willing to offer assistance. My ability to speak fluent French (or English sometimes) is effected by a prominent Oklahoma accent. Bois de Vincennes, is about a five minute walk from the hotel. The park is magnificent. Even in the rain, and cool temperatiures it was a delight. Bois De Vincennes is a pleasant respite from the pushing and articulated walking, necessary in the busy areas of Paris. It has convenient boat and food concessions also. Two things added a unique spice to my stay. The sound of the subway, which apparently runs underneath the hotel and the walls which allowed a bit of insight into my neighbors television preferences was passivly noticeable. Neither prevented a good nights sleep, and neither detracted from the overall excellent service and facilities, of L'Hotel De La Porte Doree. These experiences simply add to the memories, and offer fodder for future conversation. There is a bus stop, and a metro entrance in front of the hotel. The bus #46 takes you on a pleasant ride, directly to Gare Du Nord, passing a collage of Parisian neighborhoods in about 40 minutes, for 1 Euro 40. If you are going to CDG, you do not have to tote luggage up and down the stairs of the subway system, and the bus much less crowded. A very pleasant surprise occured a few days after returning to the States, I received a personal e-mail from Christina, the owner, thanking me for my stay. This is my first time to comment on a message board, but the exceptional value and convenience of this hotel inspires me enthhusiastically recommend L'Hotel De La Porte Doree.

It was fantastic. We liked it much better than the much more expensive 5* hotel we stayed at in London the next week. We had no trouble getting there from the airport on the metro, except for a moment of confusion when we came out the metro exit and didn\u2019t no which way to go in the rather confusing intersection near the hotel. Tip- head to the right of the McDonalds, and it\u2019s on the right side of the street. The first room we were put in was on the second floor and it was quite small and decorated in green. Based on later conversations I can only assume it was meant for one person. We asked to switch and were moved to a very nice room on the top floor (orange). About halfway through the week we got a call from the owner who said that even the room we were currently in was small for two and she would upgrade us to the larger room down the hall for free. It was gorgeous. The bathroom (with separate toilet behind another door) was one of the nicest I have ever stayed in (including the one in London). All of the rooms we saw were very clean and had nice views. We never found them noisy, and all were adequately cool when we opened the windows The wifi access was a bit spotty, but any trouble we had using it could be quickly remedied by calling the front desk. They were cheerful and never failed to fix it. We found the breakfast very reasonable, and best when savoured in bed. Delicious food, beautifully presented, and at your door on demand! We also liked the idea of leaving our key at the desk when we went out, primarily because it meant we were never woken up by the maid. They were never in the way, but very cheerful and thorough. My boyfriend and I both speak enough French to get by, which was helpful, as in the hotel\u2019s neighbourhood there were fewer English speakers than in the city centre. We loved walking around the neighbourhood and found the food delicious and cheap and everyone very friendly (generally, it got less crowded and cheaper the farther we walked from the hotel). We especially recommend the sushi place just down the street from the hotel. The food was delicious and very affordable, and the woman who ran it was lovely. Yes, it is true that the elevator was small (but charming in its own way) but it was more than adequate for the few times we needed to use it and generally we had no problems with the stairs even though we were on the top floor. Although there was no ice maker, the staff were happy to provide a tray on request, which was just fine for chilling a bottle of wine. Could not have asked for more.

The Porte Doree area is fine, and it's fun to live in a real French neighborhood after a day of being a tourist. The food nearby is pretty good--I esp. enjoyed the Villa Romano next door (pizza, pasta, seafood), which was fairly cheap (less than 10 euros for a main course), and the Sakura Japanese Restaurant down the street and across the street was also tasty. The Monoprix supermarket is just five minutes away on foot, and has a convenient bakery section. Beware: it (and about half of Paris) is closed on Sundays. The bakery right across the street from the hotel is excellent and tasty, but closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. For food, I strongly recommend bringing a French-English (or French-whatever you speak) dictionary, since many restaurants in the Porte Doree area (and other areas of Paris) speak little English, and the menu gets a bit confusing.

My mother and I were fortunate to find the Hotel de la Porte Doree for our March 2005 trip to Paris. Thanks to TripAdvisor reviews, we knew we were in for a treat. What a value!!! A few tips & tricks from our lessons learned: GETTING THERE: Finding the hotel is much easier if you have a game plan ahead of time. We simply jumped on various trains and metro lines from CDG -- a mistake, as we were carrying lots of luggage. Instead, take the direct & fast Rossybus to L'Opera, then transfer via the purple line (9?) on the metro to Porte Doree. We took the reverse of this route back to CDG on our last day and found it much easier to navigate. Do take advantage of a Metro Pass during your visit -- you'll need it for all the sightseeing. You can buy the pass at CDG as you fly into Paris. THE ROOM: Although it takes a moment to drop your key at the desk upon leaving and retrieve it later, it's wonderful to know you won't lose it while you're out sightseeing. We used the little lift to send our bags to the second floor, then walked up ourselves. Our room was the perfect size for two women (two twin beds), and the bathroom was indeed immaculate, as other reviewers can attest. (Note: nice bathrooms are a rarity in France, and we were thrilled to have a newly remodeled one in our hotel.) Do bring your own hairdryer and bubble bath for the tub, as they are not provided. The decor was lovely -- very warm and not overly done. Above the beds hung a beautiful print of a mother and daughter, a painting we would soon see in Le Louvre. We were lucky to have great weather and only needed to open our windows (not street-facing, very quiet) for a few moments upon our return to let a little of the cool night air in. THE SERVICE: Christina is a joy. It is, honestly, comforting to hear an American accent once in awhile during an extended trip to Europe. When she is at the desk, you have no worries about easily understanding directions, getting reservations, etc. The night manager is decidedly more difficult to converse with, but he tries very hard to \"get\" your English and help with whatever questions you might have. The Internet access in the lobby was very useful, and I warmed to it after I wasted precious purchased minutes trying to get into my email account. Note that the keyboard is different, and you shift differently when entering your familiar AOL or MSN password. I was convinced my AOL service had been suspended -- then realized I was simply typing incorrectly! THE NEIGHBORHOOD: The location is amazingly close to a Metro stop. Though some say this is \"out of the way\" from the main attractions, we would argue that half the fun of being in Paris is experiencing life as a Parisian. It was great to be tourists by day and \"locals\" by night. Staying in the 12th Arrondisement (sp?) allows you to frequent florists, pharmacies, shoe shops, and grocers you simply could not encounter on the Champs-Elysees and other touristy areas. And, we found the Metro rides to be one of the best ways to learn about the Parisian culture. The people-watching was prime, and we walked off all those pastry pounds by making transfers to various trains. Since so much of the city was covered by foot, it was really kind of relaxing to sit on the Metro for awhile on the way back to the hotel. One word of caution: do not eat on the Metro. Especially if you are American, the French will look at you quizzically. We discovered AFTER our visit that the whole point of the \"French Women's Diet\" is to savor your food; quickly eating a sandwich and milk on a train simply doesn't fit that standard. Ha! THE FOOD: Speaking of food, the Hotel de la Porte Doree is blessed to be located directly across the street from a fabulous patisserie/boulangerie. If you'd rather not sit for the breakfast in the hotel, you can stop across the street and find a wide assortment of breads and mini-quiches, which the servers will happily warm in a microwave upon request. Then, stop back across the street to the Quick (sp?) fast-food restaurant for a generous serving of orange juice. You can sit outside and people-watch while enjoying your breakfast. We challenge you to avoid the McDonald's two steps away from the hotel. It was, ironically, the only one we saw in Paris. It just wouldn't seem right to order a Big Mac when fresh pastries are available! Need more than a pastry? Though little markets abound, the best place to grocery shop for snacks and food-oriented gifts is the nearby Monoprix (similar to a mini-Meijer). Simply exit the main door of the hotel and make a right. The Monoprix will be a few blocks up, and you can easily tell it's coming because you will see numerous motorbikes and Smart cars parked outside, offset from the street. Bottled water abounds, as does produce, yogurt and cheese. If you simply must have cereal in the mornings, you can find skim & 2% milk there by looking very carefully (the milk selection itself is quite small). Also within walking distance of the hotel are a gas station (an experience in itself), post office (ask Christina or Patrick for directions), numerous optical shops, a Chinese restaurant, Sushi place, Italian restaurant, and many other little finds. Be sure to ask directions to the gardens as well. This will give you a fun look at Parisian apartment-dwelling, and you can take the walkway to the next Metro stop and not have to backtrack. THE LANGUAGE: In our humble opinion, the best part of staying at the Hotel de la Porte Doree is the ability to be immersed in the local culture. Because this is not a touristy area, many of the local shopkeepers speak little/no English. Don't let this scare you. It really helped us improve our French, and it resulted in many fond memories as we did our best to order goods in our own little version of \"Franglish combined with sign language.\" Oh, my! I've written a lot, but the experience deserved to be shared. We hope these hints will help you enjoy the hotel as much as we did!

The hotel is without air conditioning so the room can become quite hot and stuffy. Worst yet the first night we arrive, they just gave away their last fan away so we have to cope with the heat without fan. Lucky that we originate from a tropical country, so we survived!!! The lesson here is to make sure one ask for a fan as soon as one arrive if one is staying there during the summer months. The room size is adequate, considering that it is in Paris. The location is on the main street, so the noise is quite high, and one can hear the metro from the room. But with the windows closed, all the sounds are muffled -excellent double glazing!!! But if one is sensitive to background noises, than this is not the hotel for them. And of course if the windows have to be closed to muffle the sounds, than the room will become more hot and stuffy. However, the room is clean and they do change the towels daily (I am not sure about the bed linen though). The stuff is not overly helpful, I can only say that the night clerk and the chambermaid are friendly. But then, I did not expect a five star treatment. My husband tried to access the internet wifi but cannot get reliable connection from the room. The monoprix is near - handy place to get ice and mineral water. The area itself is nice with shops and a wide selection of restaurants. For muslims there are 2 halal restaurants nearby. The metro station is nearby, and it takes about 20 minutes ride to major attractions. Be warned that at certain times the metro can be packed, so if one can't bear the metro crowd, then it is best to find a hotel with minimal travelling time using the metro. All that being said, for Euro 64 for double room per night - it is good value for money for a clean hotel, in safe relatively central area with adequate room.

I feel badly that this person had such a negative experience. We checked into Porte Doree on May 24th - the counter person (Jody? An American woman, but not Christina, about whose hospitality I'd heard so much) was delightful, good-natured, and helpful. She showed us the fabled tiny elevator, which - others' complaints aside - we found utterly hilarious and quirky and fun. The room was small by North American standards - but then again, so are the cars, the food portions, the grocery stores ... everything. Because hey, how about that? We weren't in North America. Our rooms - we were a party of five, and took a double and a triple - were scrupulously clean. My wife and I were on the 3rd floor - Room 24, with huge windows that opened onto Rue Daumesnil. Our adult kids were in Room 10, just underneath us on the 2nd. The rooms aren't luxurious, by any means. They are furnished in what can only be described as a utilitarian fashion - two plain chairs, a bed, a ledge/desk. The bathroom was small, and the shower stall comically so - as in \"drop the soap, you'd better be able to do a straight-backed knee bend\" small. So, sure, not spacious, these rooms. Not the place you'd choose to spend a whole heap of time. But if you go to Paris, can I suggest that you occasionally venture out of your room? There are a couple of things to see in that city, ya know? Why, they got a museum downtown with literally hundreds of dollars worth of art in it. I mean ... DUH. The location is as perfect as you get. Getting around in Paris means becoming acquainted with the Metro, and the entrance to the Metro is 48 steps from the front door of the hotel. No trip to any major attraction took us longer than 25 minutes, even in rush hour. The street itself has tons of excellent restaurants, shops, boulangeries, chocolatiers, brasseries ... this part of Paris is fairly residential and the prices were about 30% less than what you'd pay for a meal on, say, the Champs Elysees. The Italian restaurant we found by going out the front door and turning right, then walking about 40 steps, offered the most stunningly tasty mussel dish I've ever had - for 10 Euros. Please. On the Champs Elysees, the waiter would spill that much worth of wine down the side of your glass. The hotel is not air-conditioned, and the weather when we were there was hot - sometimes oppressively so - but by the time we got back to our room at night it was livable, even comfortable enough to close the windows, which effectively cut out all but the most strident of the city noise. And yes, there was city noise, because - without getting too technical here - PARIS IS A CITY. An exciting, vibrant, alive, bustling, sometimes noisy city, and it's all happening just outside your window and you can choose to embrace that or you can p*ss and moan about it. If you choose the latter, may I suggest Sioux City, North Dakota? It's very quiet. In short, we'd go back to L'Hotel Porte Doree in a heartbeat. I mean, if I win the lottery, then sure, Four Seasons George V here I come. But as long as I want excellent value in one of the most expensive cities on the planet, this is the place I'll go.

Only the desk staff spoke English, housekeeping and kitchen staff did not. The room had two single beds and a full bath and was nice and clean. I felt the breakfast is overpriced for what you got, but then I feel that about all hotels.

Didn't help me move and the next room was even worse...and reeked of smoke and alcohol. There were beer bottles under the bed. THe tv didn't work and there was no internet availability. I called the reception and the man there told me he'd be right there. An hour later after having an asthma attack and using my albuterol inhaler twice I went downstairs and requested that he please come check my room. He took his time, while I sat out of breath in the hallway of the floor. Once he came upstairs he said that there was nothing he could do, I requested that I please be moved to some other room as I couldn't breathe. Was told the hotel was full. Finally, upset and sick I told him I was leaving and started calling other facilities. 15mins later he came to show me some other rooms where I might be moved...all worse than the last one. Finally, when he saw me wheezing and huffing he showed me room #37 (non smoking room). I took it because I was exhausted from climbing up and down the floors. What I want to know is why I wasn't given the room to begin with?? Was it because I was young and they figured I had no option in a foreign country. Also there is no breakfast included in your hotel stay. If you would like breakfast you have to order the night before and it is 6 euros for 1 croissant, 1 cup of orange jucie,& 1 packet of jelly. I'd highly recommend going out and actually having a real breakfast at the little cafes around. There is a MONOPRIX 10 minutes down the road...a walmart/ target like store, and you can buy fresh croissants, juice, groceries, beauty,etc there. Also there is NO Airconditioning, which is a very severe drawback for the summers because the heat was sweltering. And keeping the windows open is even worse because you hear ambulances, police cars and the metro rushing by every 5 minutes. For light sleepers the tremors from the metro every 5 minutes can be problem. The last & worst problem was the plumbing...the toilet constantly smelled like a urinal even after the cleaning service went thru the room. The sink starts accumulating water after you flush ...& the water smells like the sewer at that point. The celing also had paint chipping and falling...I'll try and post some pictures of that too. Lastly, please don't use their SAFE. I had my passport put in it...and not everyone has the key. And there was a whole scene to get my passport back because I hadn't requested it back on wednesday 25th may...after which the safe was locked with my passport and the owners left with the key ...to the United States. However, I will say there was an american receptionist(JODY) who was there one day .. really helped me in getting my passport back.", "Date": "May 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!

The location is great - you can see the Metro station from the doorstep. It is more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel. There's a computer in the lobby so you can email back home. A great price for Paris with a nice bathroom/shower right in your room. With the subway (metro) right beside you, who needs to pay 5 times as much in order to be in the center of town? I would definitely stay here again. Our room looked right out onto the street and when we shut the windows there was QUIET. Amazing soundproof windows!

The bathroom was nice and the room quaint. We liked the convenience of the hotel to the Metro and the bakery across the street is simply magnificent! The staff was friendly and helpful. I've read some of the poor reviews and was quite surprised at the complaints. I didn't feel/hear the Metro, nor did I have a problem with a smokey smell. As for the noise, it is a city, which adds to the charm. I actually enjoyed being awakened with the sounds of Parisians starting their morning. The hotel made me feel like I was secretly watching the residents' lives, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to see how they actually live. If you're wanting a true taste of Paris, avoid the touristy neighborhoods, which are only out to make a buck (or euro).
