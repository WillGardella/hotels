Upon arriving, we called down to the front desk (on our cell phone because our room phone wouldn't work and then they accused of making international calls) to get some ice and set up the rollaway bed we had ordered. Juan Carlos brought us up some ice and left the roll away bed un set up. Before leaving, he told us it was \"no big deal\" because \"no one was here\". We called down on our cell phones again, realizing we didn't have a wine opener for our celebratory bottle of wine and needed some more ice (my friend hurt her ankle) and they then told us we'd have to go downstairs to open the wine/get ice. The room is very tiny, had about 1 foot walking space in between the bed, roll away bed we had to set up ourselves. When we went to turn on the tv, it had about 10 channels, only a few actually had volume. The room's temperature was unbearably hot, and the windows were not able to open up to get any fresh air in the room. None of the clarion staff members offered to help us turn the air conditioning off so we all had to sleep in our underwear. Also, you can't turn the light on in the bathroom without turning the fan on too so its impossible to communicate with anyone else. Luckily, there was no one else in the whole hotel so noise level wasn't a problem. The complimentary breakfast was an entirely different story. We went down about 9:30 to an odd assortment of hard bagels (unable to be sliced by a metal knife), gas station pastries, bagged orange and apple juice and coffee that tasted like dirt. There was a waffle maker there, but no waffle mix. My friend and I grabbed two of the hard bagels and attempted to slice through them while our other friend went to go ask the hotel manager where she could find the waffle mix. She returned with the hotel manager who yelled at her saying, \"I make them\"! He then came over to where my friend and i were attempting to slice our bagels and yelled at us \"put them back\" and grabbed our bagels and threw them back in the pin. He also yelled at us for using a tea plate instead of a plate by the waffle maker void of any waffles. This horrible man then yelled a few more things under his breath and went in some back room for a while only to return with two bags of bagels. Then, he put his dirty little hands all over our sesame bagels, took the bagel chopper liked it was a guillotine and slammed our bagels in half on the counter. Meanwhile, he attempted to make a waffle for my friend which wasn't cooked through and tasted horrible as well. We were very surprised when we saw another guest at breakfast - a grandma that looked like she'd taken too much valium - guess that's the kind of guest that the clarion looks to attract here. The hotel managed stood by and watched us like a hawk while we ate and then as we got up, muttered some things under his breath about us and yelled at my friend for not finishing her cup of their crap coffee. Overall staff was horrible, so unhelpful in recommending places to eat/go/sightsee and wouldn't so much as dare offer to call you a cab. I highly suggest NOT EVER booking a reservation at this abominable \"hotel\". It was a disgrace to see such inattentive or even friendly peoeple acting in such a wretched manner at their place of employment.

Timothy the manger/owner of Clarion Hotel on Park Ave (NY222) ran the hotel at the utmost unprofessional way of doing business. He lets greed get in the way to make his decision instead of providing the service that a guest is entitled to. I had made a reservation at this property for 2 nights. Traveling from New Orleans, Louisiana my flight had cancel in Detriot, Michigan due to a thunderstorm in New York. The only flight out was the next evening at 5PM, so instead of wasting a whole day of travel I reneted a car to drive to New York (a long 9 hours). In the mist of all this I had called the hotel to try to cancel my reservation, which I was refused by the hotel that they are not able to cancel my reservation. I explained my situation to the hotel and was told that unless I have document to show that my flight has been cancel then they will not charge my credit card for the first night ( which they did anyway). Before arriving into New York I had called the hotel again to confirmed my reservation and was told that everything was ok for an early check in. Few hours later arriving at the hotel to come to find out that they gave my room to another guest that paid twice as much as my rate. The hotel had over sold their rooms, so instead of finding a room for me at a near by location Timothy just simply told me \"you have no reservation here\". By then I was very tired and didnt really cared how much a room will cost me at that point in time, so I sat in the hotel lobby for an hour looking for another hotel anywhere nearby. By then Timothy was able to get me into a room with one bed in his hotel (which I am very greatful for at the time being) Because I was traveling with a friend and our room reservation was originally for 2 beds we settled for a room with one bed,(the room is very very small) but requested for a rollaway bed which was never delivered. At check in point I gave my document showing that my flight has been cancel, Timothy took the document and didnt return it. During check out time I had asked about the charges for the first night stay and the desk agent confirmed with me that the charges was adjusted back onto my credit card. Two weeks later my statement still showed the charges on my account so I called Timothy to question about my billing. This time Timothy said the document that I rendered was not enough proof I need to get a second document of proof in order for me to get my charges adjust back into my account. At this point in time its not about the money anymore its about the principle... this owner/manager over sold his rooms which is clearly the hotel problem not mines, but turn it out to be my problem. So instead of being sympathies about the situation that the hotel had caused, the manager decided not to resolved the issue.

We arrived in the city by bus (a trip to see the Christmas Show) and were dropped off near Bryant Park at 9:30am. We proceeded to start to walk toward the hotel to drop off our bags. It didn't seem that far on a map. Well after walking a few blocks in the cold we hailed a cab. I so glad we did as it was quite a ways away. Cab was $5 or $6. Our room was not available but we could check our bags and have breakfast (waffles, bagels,muffins, cereals, coffee and juices) which is included, then headed back out on the town. We took a cab back over to Times Square to walk around before the show. Cab was $8. Went to the Christmas Show at Radio City Music Hall and it was great! After the show we went to lunch with a friend and her 6yr old son at Mars 2112. This restaurant was cute. You ride a spaceship to Mars then get seated at a table in the middle of rock walls, martians dancing around and and waiter dressed up in a Star Trek type outfit. The food came out extremely fast and was good. We started heading back towards the hotel to check in and did some shopping with the street vendors around Rockefeller Plaza. It was extremely packed so we didnt even try to get over near the tree or skating rink. We checked into the hotel around 3:30pm and were given room 303. I thought the room was good size for NYC. There was a dresser, desk, Queen size bed, big flat screen tv, good size closet and decent size bathroom. All I wanted was a clean place to stay. Was the hotel a little worn down? Maybe, but the bed was very comfortable with nic ethick bedding and the bathroom was spotless. Our room was facing a brick wall, but it was very quiet and we slept very well. That is pretty much all you are in your room for anyway. My only complaint is you could smell a hint of cigarette smoke from previous guests. After check in we went over to the West Village to visit my Aunt. What an upcoming area of NYC. She told us it used to be the meat packing district and they are renovating all of the buildings to either be condos, stores or studios. Lots of neat little shops and restaurants. We went to dinner at Chelsea Restorante. A restaurant my Aunt have been going to for 25 years. It was authentic Italian. Awesome food and the service was the best! After dinner back to the hotel (cab $12) and straight to bed. The next morning I went down to the breakfast area and grabbed a coffee, juice and a couple of muffins to bring up the room. There is a sign that says this is not allowed, but the waiter let me as long as I brought the coffee cup back. I thought that was a little weird, so I brought the cup back down with me. Checkout was fine. I found the front desk staff very friendly but I didn't really need anything from them either. We took a cab back over to my aunt's home and went shopping in Chelsea Market before our train trip out of Penn station home. I put the prices of the cabs in my review because I chose this hotel because of the price and the name. It was little far from the places I was visiting.

Everything on Manhattan seems to be expensive, so you will have to shell out a bit. In the end we booked the Clarion because a friend was staying there, because lets face it - it doesn't have the best Trip Advisor ranking! The hotel is small, in Manhattan terms, sandwiched between two larger buildings, it is almost misplaced on Park Avenue. Its almost slightly homely as you walk in, a small reception area and one small lift which serves the 8 (or so) floors. It is extremely central, close to the empire state building, with a metro on the same block, and 15 minutes walk from Times Square. The rooms are similar, very small - although probably to be expected whilst staying in such a heavily populated and expensive area. They've just about managed to squeeze a double bed in, and a small desk and chair which occupies space contested with the door, you'll need to squeeze by if the someone is using the desk. The desk also hosts the coffee making equipment and a lamp, you can barely fit a laptop on there - but its worth the squeeze, as you get free WiFi in this hotel. The bathroom is equally small, with a small (half) sized bath with shower attachment. The best thing about the rooms, is the fantastic 40\" Sony LCD television (you'll get a slightly smaller one in the single rooms), which is a great after a long day walking about the city. There are a few things which annoyed us. Firstly the heating, which seemed to be turned up full whack on our first few days - it was almost unbearable. We had to have the air conditioning occasionally, which is ridiculous in winter! The air conditioning is essentially useless, its loud and ineffective - so in summer (and winter it seems!) you'll be baking at night unless you dont mind the loud fans whirling. The other thing, was the view from the window. Possibly the worst I've ever encountered, you get a view of the dirty brickwork of the building next door, about 4 feet away - so you get hardly any sunlight through there. You'll also notice a fire exit stairway decorated with bird poop, and if you're lucky - a couple of pigeons sitting on your window going \"coo, coo, coo\"! Fantastic! You wont want to open your window here. You get a free breakfast on the ground floor every morning, which isn't great but it does the trick if you want to save a bit more money. They have some packaged pastries, bagels and bread, cereal, and fresh waffles. Elsewhere, there is a 24 hour McDonalds just outside the hotel to your left which can be useful. As I said though, it is reasonably priced. We paid around \u00c2\u00a3450 ($900) for 6 nights, taking advantage of a 15% discount when booking 3 nights in a row on crshotels.com.

The rooms are very small, but who wants to spend too much time in their hotel room in New York. If you only need a place to stay, the room size is not a problem. The bathroom was also new and very good. The breakfast was also great by comparison to other hotels, with cereal, fresh bread and bagels, fruit and fresh made waffles. The downside was the rather pushy management, who seemed to just tell you anything to apease you, and were not so open to being asked questions or queries about the booking or rooms. We booked a no smoking room but our room always smelled of smoke when we got back into it at the end of the day, and there was no room safe even though everything we looked at said there was. When we asked management they seemed surprised there wasnt one, however they clearly knew that was the case. When we asked to leave our passports and valuables in their own safe they simply said we should leave it in our room, it would be fine. Overall, Id stay there again if the price was right as the facilities are small but very good.

The real surprise is the size of the halls: stepping off the tiny elevator, you can't take but half a step or you'll run into the wall. That said, you don't spend your time in the halls, but it's a little disconcerting. Based on the fire evacuation route map on the back of the door, it appears that the rooms 01, 02 and 05 on each floor are the largest so keep that in mind while booking. The bathroom was small with a miniature tub/shower, pedestal sink and nothing but a tiny glass shelf for toiletries but it was kept spotlessly clean by the staff. There was barely room to set a suitcase in the room and that was only on the floor. There was a small wardrobe with some hanging space and a couple of shelves. The desk had a hanging light over it and several extra outlets which was a nice touch. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but had very few channels to choose from. The air conditioner was mounted at the top of one window but the controls could be reached and it didn't block the view. The carpet was a bit dingy and the baseboards needed cleaning but overall it was clean. The queen size bed was fairly comfortable (no pillow top mattress) but the pillows were quite tiny and thin. The towels, although small, were very new and thick. Although I had requested a non-smoking room, the hotel said they could not provide one. I believe this was because the rate was a business negotiated rate and lower than their regular rates. They were saving those non-smoking rooms for higher paying customers. This was the only slight I felt during our stay. The staff was quite nice and friendly. We did not take advantage of the continental breakfast because it consisted only of coffee, juice and some prepackaged muffins. When I'm in NY, I want to take advantage of the opportunity for something better than convenience store food. The breakfast area seemed to be set up for eating in rather than taking something with you as I only saw coffee cups & saucers rather than disposable cups. There was a tip jar very conspicuously located for the lady who was keeping coffee cups filled. There are at least a dozen places for a quick breakfast within 2 blocks including a Starbucks directly across Park Ave. and a Dunkin Donuts a few steps north. For $5 you can get something besides cellophane covered muffins. You can't beat the area this hotel is in. It's easy walking distance to some excellent restaurants, Madison Sq. Park and lots more. It's a very safe place to be and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cLocation so-so, awful staff!\u201d", "Author": "ASSDO", "ReviewID": "UR8127504", "Content": "Not bad location, but I\u00c2\u00b4ve been much better located in NY for less than the USD180/day paid here.

Small room but OK, except for the heat so hot that we had to turn the a/c on, and also cleaning could be improved. My travel agent never send my credit card information to the hotel as she booked it via some system that does not require credit card numbers - I was not aware of that. So the front desk staff kept annoying me, asking how I intended to pay for the stay. Every time I left or arrived with shopping bags they would tell me to be careful otherwise I would not have money to pay for the stay... Awful and unpolite! If they had told me at check-in that they did not have my credit card number, I would kindly have given it to them and would have been spared from all the embarassing comments. I understand the situation was not their fault, but the lack of assertive communication was their fault indeed.
