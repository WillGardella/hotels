I would have booked at a different hotel. I booked a room with a queen sized bed and a pull out sofa bed. My husband and I do not like to sleep in double beds so a queen was a must for us. When we checked in and went up to our room we were shocked to see two double beds.. no queen bed and no sofa at all! Also there was a strange metal box in the middle of the room. My husband told me it was an ozone machine, to remove odors. So we went back to the front desk and told him this wasn't the room we had booked. We wanted the queen bed with the sofa sleeper for the kids. He looked at us like we were crazy and said that they didn't have any sofa beds! We said it's right there on your website and so he called someone on the phone and said nope we don't have any sofa beds. At this point the kids are tired and cranky so we gave in and just took the double bed room. A maid later came and took the ozone machine away. Besides being the wrong room in the first place, it was just plain gross. The room looked nothing like the photo's. The carpet had stains. The bedding and curtains were dated. I went to take a shower and the shower head was way too low for a normal person. I'm only 5.6 and had to bend backwards to rinse my hair. We thought maybe this was intended to be a handicap room but one of the beds was almost up against the bathroom door. Overall we didn't feel safe here with the kids.

Despite my requesting a non-smoking room, the previous guest apparently had smoked heavily, with the hotel making no attempt to flag it as perhaps inappropriate for a non-smoker like myself. There was no way to prevent the smell from getting all over my clothes, etc. After some polite complaints, I was given a 10% discount, but the front desk employee said he couldn't change my room without his manager's authorization (and the manager's shift had already ended.) The smoking issue aside, the rest of the property was also not in the best shape. There were faded logos for the Motel 8 chain, and my travel partner surmised that the hotel must have been kicked out of the franchise for failing their quality standards!

There are also some nice coffee shops and a Whole Foods market right around the corner (on Westlake). But DO NOT expect spectacular Skyline views or any great atmosphere out here. There might be some intresting views from the rooms with a patio but even then it's mainly huge parking-area-car-dealership-atmosphere in the surrounding blocks, despite some trees). We never felt anything close to unsafe, though. This place is ok to have some sleep and a shower and then hang out in the city most of the time, not more. The official website photos tell you - as in most spaces - not the whole story. We stayed there three nights (1st floor, usually very noisy from staff working and people outside by the parking spots; room 105 is facing the laundry which is a big noise source) and then one night on the 2nd floor a week later, this time on the back side which was somewhat more quiet. You could, however, always clearly hear noises from rooms around ours. So, take earplugs with you. The rooms are OK at first sight (not more, let's say there are slightly under the level of usual 60$-motel averages in rural areas and clearly under newer chain motels), but they definitely would need some touch up or lower pricing. There are no terrible \"holes\", I guess, but it's all far from super-comfy. Bathrooms are OK, but you'd expect more quality and space for the price. Some mold on the ceiling, not too much though. One leaking water tap, water flowing down the shower drain only very slowly, toilets OK. The beds are OK. It just all has that 70s-style-look-and-feel somehow. A/C in one of the rooms looked messy (dust, missing switches). Some not-so-hidden spots in the room haven't been vacuumed in weeks. No big eye on details in this facility! The TVs didn't work properly in either rooms - a channel listing with 99 stations isn't worth anything if there are only five snow-stormy channels available. During the first stay we asked three times to have it fixed - the last night, there was a note from the maintenance guy \"I replaced the TV, seems to work better, sorry for the inconvenience\" - OK, that is charming, but I'd expect more. And even after the \"fixing\" channel reception was awful. And any technician should see that the loose TV cable wire needed to be fixed, not the TV set. Staff besides that was average friendly, not more, but no problems here. Wireless reception was poor in both rooms (lots of outages), and it's a slow network. Bottom line: I guess there are better places for that price. We gave them a second chance since prices dropped after labour day, but no positive surprises unfortunately.

Avoid it if you can. I, unfortunately, couldn't. I booked through Hotwire for the first time, trusting their website when it said that 2 star hotels were quality brand names like Best Western, La Quinta and Days Inn. All three chains have hotels in the same three blocks, so I assumed it'd be one of these or maybe the Holiday Inn Express. But no, the result was that I was locked into the Eighth Avenue Inn -- not a quality brand name or even a \"quality independent hotel,\" as Hotwire told me they carried in their response to my message requesting to be let out of the reservation due to false advertising. Okay, so, grudge against Hotwire aside. (But I do have to say -- book through Priceline -- I stay in Seattle / Bellevue every week and I've never had trouble with Priceline as they do carry brand names.) The good (I'm stretching to find it...): - The sheets appeared clean. - The towels appeared clean and relatively fluffy. - The shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. - Supposedly the hotel had free wi-fi (although I didn't want to sit on one of their chairs long enough to find out -- see below -- so I never tried it). - The tile grout in the shower couldn't mildew because there was no tile and no grout (they'd covered it with cheap plastic). - Parking was free. The bad: - Everything else in the hotel was torn, stained, beaten. Both chairs in my room had stains and rips. The carpet was waterstained and had other stains all over it. Basically I didn't want bare skin to touch anything in the room, so I was very careful to make sure it didn't. - The walls were really thin, so I could hear the TV and couple next door until 1 a.m., and the guy upstairs doing jumping jacks (or who knows what) at 5:50 a.m. - The elevator was upholstered all around with torn grey carpet, and hadn't been renovated since the 50s (and there were more modern elevators in the 50s). - The motel backs up on a 24-hour restaurant. There aren't many of these in Seattle, and so you can imagine who they attract at 4 a.m. and how likely they are to yell, scream and get in fights right outside your window. - I had to wear earplugs to sleep. Without earplugs I wouldn't have slept. The basics are clean, so the hotel has its place for those in their late teens / early twenties trying to save money (I've been there, somewhat recently, and can see it throught that lens).

After quite a few hours of unsuccessful hunting we began to feel like \"Mary\" and \"Joseph\"....though we held back on asking for the stable accommodation. Finally, at the Eight Ave Inn we were giving friendly advice and assistance by two young front desk lads. There were no vacancies on the 13th but they redirected us elsewhere for that night and then offered us a room for the following night at the discount coupon listed price. I was very impressed by the boys thoughtfulness,friendliness and general attitude. As for the Inn, well....... really,..... what u pay is what u get. It is more of a budget Inn. The carpets and beds are getting old and are in need of replacement. The bathroom was satisfactorily appointed,though we did have a problem getting our toilet to flush.I phoned front desk and within 5 minutes a lad arrived to rectify the problem. The blankets and sheets are needing renewing also, the sheets are thin and there were some holes in the blanket, I think another reviewer also mentioned that the bath towels are quite small. ..they are. Breakfast was adequate....cereals,breads/toast,cinnamon buns,and a few other pastry type things. We were last into breakfast so the fruit bowl was almost empty. Coffee, tea or hot chocolate were available as well as juice. There was a tv in the breakfast room and one of the young employees came in to check out the state of play of the football game between Seattle and St louis.I enjoyed observing his enthusiasm and appreciated his chat about the football game. All in all the Inn seems to be run by quite young people...the only person I noticed over the age of 30 was one of the female cleaners. The Inn's position in Seattle is quite good.Its only a short walk to the Space needle and environs. Even the Pike place Market isnt too far to walk to from here, though its slighlty up hill for the return walk. It isnt far from the place where u can access the free city bus service,though we didnt use it. We had no problem with the Inn's parking, our car remained right outside the front door the whole time we were there.

The parking was very cramped and I could not find a parking spot in the front or the back without waiting a few minutes. I was greeted inside by an empty reception desk and a run-down lobby. Once I rang the bell, a young teen in white socks came out of a door behind the reception, where I could hear rock music. He did not know that much about the city, but he did offer us a travel brochure. Out room was on the 2nd floor, (it was the one with the large balcony in the front). Probably the best thing about the room was the large balcony, that had just a view on the road. The carpets were stained and the matresses were hard, but the bathroom looked pretty new. An average Travelodge I guess. But my worst impression came on my first night when I entered my floor.

When we checked in, the hotel did not have the reservation and we had to wait about half an hour while they waited for Orbitz to fax the reservation details. We had made the reservation two weeks in advance. The person working at the front desk was not very friendly. We were told there were no non-smoking rooms available with two beds despite the fact that the people in front of us had been offered one (they chose smoking). I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke and asked the desk clerk if we could get a non-smoking room with a single bed and a roll-away cot. I was told the cot would be an extra $8. So, out of principle, I decided to take the smoking room instead of having to pay for the cot, which I thought was ridiculous. When we entered the room, it was like entering a very nasty smokey bar. To make things worse, we went downstairs later and overheard several guests being checked into non-smoking rooms with two beds. I don't know why we were told there were none of these rooms available. Perhaps it was because we booked the room at such a low rate. Even if I was a smoker I would have probably been disgusted. We open the windows as wide as we could and hoped for the best. Despite the occasional squealing tires and sound of bottles being broken in the parking lot behind the hotel, we kept the windows open all night. It helped a little. Other than the smoke drenched furniture and drapes, the room was relatively clean. The sheets smelled like bleach and the bathroom appeared to be clean. There was also a nice little fridge and microwave in the room. I would not have minded the room so much if it did not reek of smoke.

I have personally never been to a Travelodge and after my visit there to the City Center Travelodge in Seattle for three nights, I won't be going to another one and I highly advise that you don't either. Why you ask? Aside from looking ratty and dingy, the service was horrid and the bed, dreadful. Let me explain. One afternoon, after arriving in the room, we found our beds made but our bathroom completely void of towels. So I politely call the front desk and ask them to deliver towels to my room and they said they would do so. A half-hour later still no towels, I call again, and ask for towels and they said they would bring them up. Over an hour later, there are no towels and I finally go down to the desk myself and demand the towels. I've just adduced a good example of how nonexistent the service was at Travelodge. Let's move on to the bed. This won't take long to describe. Just imagine sleepping on a mattress but with next to no cushioing or padding, just the metal springs. That's what it felt like. If I wasn't so damn worn out after sightseeing, I would have had serious problems sleeping on it but I survived. I think I've adequately stated my case here and if you consider yourself an intelligent and prudent traveler, you will not go to the Travelodge at City Center in Seattle and if you must, pay a nominal amount more to stay at a hopefully newer hotel/motel with better service and a real bed.
