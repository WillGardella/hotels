Particularly, there were two older men on the evening/night staff that were just downright rude. Our father is diabetic and needs to store his insulin in a cool place. The rooms don't have refrigerators, which is fine, so we asked if we could use their kitchen refrigerator. Well you would've thought we were asking for all the gold in Fort Knox. Those two men were very lazy and didn't like to leave their chairs or talk to anyone, grunting at us whenever we'd ask for help. In fact, we went out late one night and came back to find one of them asleep at the desk. When we woke him to ask for the insulin, he was clearly irritated that we dared to wake him up. Our train was leaving early the morning we checked out and let the night guy know the night before to call a taxi and have it ready for us. No surprise, he hadn't done it so we nearly missed our train. Not only did he forget to do this one small thing, he was completely rude about finally getting to it.I would NOT recommend anyone stay here unless you don't plan to ever interact with the staff, which is impossible because you still have to check in and out, requiring some level of interaction. Breakfast was below average. The only two good things about Hotel River is the rooms were nice and the view of the river was gorgeous (hence they got 2 stars instead of just 1). There's a rooftop overlooking the river that is open to all guests, however, there are guest rooms beside them so you have to be courteous of when you go and how loud you plan to be.If your trip at all involves a stay in Rome, I highly recommend staying at Les Chambres D'Or Hotel. Delicious breakfast, best cappucino in Rome, wonderful location less than 10 minutes from the Vatican, and most importantly of all, their staff was impeccable. Hotel River needs to take a few lessons from them and I hope their management reads these reviews and does something about the staff.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR250229623", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mojovirginia"}, {"Content": "Nice Place, bad service The location of Hotel River was perfect, in walking distance to everything but out of the way to relax. The room was nice and we had a view of the river. The only issue was the concierge. I can't remember his name, but he was the most unhelpful man I ever met. We asked him to make reservations at a reccomended restaurant. He replied you don't want to go there it's touristy. We asked him than to reccomend another restuarant. He said to give him a half hour. We cam back down only for him to inform us that they were all closed. He didn't reccomend any others and it was too late to go to our original choice. Another issue that I had with him was we booked the florence in a Day tour. He only took cash and when we went to the tour they said our concierge booked us for the lesser priced tour, yet we paid him full price. Thankfully the tour people trusted us and let us do the whole tour, in which we paid for. Upon checkout he gave me a bill, which I was sure I pre-paid through expedia. When I told him this he became extrmely defensive. I went to go on line so I could figure out the problem and he literally was harassing me to pay him and wait till I got back to the states to work out any issues with expedia. he literally came into the internet booth with me.

The first surprise was attempting to take the bus system from the train station on a Sunday -- we got stranded and thankfully a very friendly gentleman from the Grand Hotel called a taxi for us to get us to the Hotel River! The Hotel River looked very nice inside, though our room was VERY small (barely any room around the bed). Not like the pictures I've seen on this site; I assume we just got unlucky. Between that and the fact that we needed to get to the train station several times during the week, we decided to inform them that we will need to leave the hotel after a day and get closer to the center of town.  The staff reminded me of a concierge you might see in a Home Alone movie. The night person told me to talk to the manager in the morning. The manager told me I'd have to pay a 100EUR cancellation fee. I talked him into making a compromise, that I stay 2 nights and pay no cancellation fee. He really seemed to want me to stay the entire week. The next morning when I was checking out though, I heard everyone around me being charged only 60 EUR a night! This did not make me very happy.  When I asked the staff for dinner recommendations the night before, they happily offered a non-touristy place and promised to make reservations. They never notified us, though, that the restaurant was closed for holiday! (We learned this the hard way).The only other favor we asked them was to tell us the number to make reservations at the Accademia, to which we were lied to and told it could not be done over the phone. The location, while inconvenient to us, was very nice -- right by the river and away from the hustle and bustle.

We were thrilled with our stay at the Hotel River! It's a charming hotel located right across from the Arno River. What I loved about it was the location. It wasn't right in the center of the city where all the tourists are. It was quiet and had a nice ambiance. Although, it was still in walking distance to most things. We did take a cab to the train station though. It's in walking distance to the Santa Croce and Ponte Vecchio and other major sites like the Doumo.The rooms were spacious enough and had a nice bathroom. Great shower and good towels (which is important). Beds were comfortable too. The room had a small flat screen TV. It was a very nice stay - not a super fancy place, but perfect for a city where you won't be really around your hotel much. They offer a nice continental breakfast and free internet access in the lobby. The hotel only has three or four stories, so I liked that it was small. There's a nice terrace too upstairs. The hotel has a home away from home feel to it. The best part of our stay were two of the concierages. Abbas and Salvatore! They were extremely helpful, kind and knowledgeable. They didn't steer us wrong especially in the restaurant department. I felt like we didn't go to typical tourist type eateries. They recommended two restaurants we loved - Ristorante di fagioli and Il Barrino. They were wonderful. Ask for Rita at Il Barrino and she'll hook you up with an amazing tasting of all different stuff. Get the Florentine steak and ask for the pasta with truffle oil (which wasn't on the menu, but she gave it to us anyway). Abbas and Salvatore did add to our experience with their hospitality and friendliness. Abbas in particular was very helpful and so wonderful! He also has a car service and took us on a day tour in Chianti. He knew so many charming little towns in Tuscany to visit and took us to a great winery for wine tasting including a homemade lasagna lunch. He truly made our trip extra special since we saw so many things we would've never had a chance to if we just went by a guide book.

The staff were eager to please and extremely friendly and amicable. The rooms were decorated very thoughtfully and we were much impressed by how quiet the room was at night. The only (very very minor) complaint we have about the room is the lack of natural light. The buffet breakfast was well-equipped and we really enjoyed eating in the sun room, which overlooked the hotel's sunlit courtyard. The upstairs terrace on which you can enjoy a drink while gazing out onto the Arno River was much appreciated. As much as other reviewers say the hotel is well-located, I must admit that I found the hotel far from central. It is located in the Santa Croce neighbourhood and is about a 10 minute walk from the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio - it doesn't sound like much, but returning to the hotel in the heat of a summer afternoon from the center of the city to take a rest and then going out again in the evening can become very tiring. Overall, we adored this hotel and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR338376922", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "indilicious"}, {"Content": "Best Hotel of our Italy trip!!!", "Date": "Jul 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR134840845", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pkmgolf"}, {"Content": "Perfect Hotel, Good Memory When my boyfriend and I first stepped into this hotel, we know that we have made the perfect choice for our 2nd visit in Italy.
