When the group returns to spend its last night in Paris at the hotel, room numbers are assigned in advance. All we had to do is give the staff person our room number to get our key. No one clogged up the small reception area. As to how individual Americans who own Rick Steves books behave, I can't say, but I would like to add that my husband and I felt we were treated wonderfully wherever we went in France, even when we weren't with the tour. The manager at the Hotel Castex was very polite and tried to be helpful, but he wasn't. We arrived a day earlier than the tour group, and at the time we booked our room, we were assured we wouldn't have to move. It was a different story when we arrived. It couldn't be done. And we were told that although our room included a free breakfast with the tour group, we would have to pay for it the first night we booked on our own. The manager felt badly that he had to move us and promised a better room with a garden view, but that didn't happen, either. When when we returned for our last night, at the end of our tour, we were given another room on the noisy street, with twin beds this time, (although we requested a double.) Finally, when we checked out, we were told that breakfast was included for our first night...but we'd gone somewhere else. Regarding the room itself, the decor was depressing, the bed was uncomfortable and the rough floor mat by the bed was disgusting on bare feet.

I'll skip most of his comments, but the important detail that he mentioned was that apparently the hotel does not plan to renew the Steeves contract.

It's very near to victor hugo's mansion though. I enjoyed myself more at the montmarte area. The room was as usual in Paris, Tiny. But the tiled flooring for both rooms i stayed in, was sticky and dirty. I think it's an American thing. They don't take off the shoes in the room and sleep with their shoes on ? The cleaning lady must have gave up on mopping the floor. I saw her cleaning the room, she only vaccumed the room. Didn't mop the floor. There is a small kettle in the room though. The design of the hotel, I find it weird. The lobby has lots of character and nice furniture in contrast to the boring design of the rooms. The elevator is a modern elevator. I would say it's a new addition to the hotel. There are 3 large garbage bins in the courtyard that spoil the view. It seems that is their permanent resting place.

First, almost every guest was an American with Rick Steves' guidebook. They were fairly rude to the staff, begging for the discount, and completely oblivious to everything but themselves. It was almost as bad as if they were all on a guided tour in matching t-shirts. Also, due to the overwhelming number of Americans, the hotel served a lackluster American-style continental breakfast instead of the wonderful European breakfast I expected, and we had to pay extra to boot. Second, the shower was ridiculous. We requested a shower bathroom because we were traveling through after an extended trip in a developing nation and we looked forward to long, hot showers. We knew it would be small by American standards, and it was about normal for a European shower. However, it was completely impractical. There was NO shelf inside the shower for soap or toiletries, or anywhere to hang a washcloth. There was nowhere to hang a towel nearby. And, the curtain blew open constantly and the water ran everywhere on the floor of the bathroom. I believe I read that the French prefer bathtubs, and apparently Hotel Castex has no idea how a shower should even work. Finally, the service was a horrendous. I believe this was a result of the above-mentioned rude treatment from many of the guests, and the Parisians' rude treatment of tourists in general (I say this without any prejudice whatsoever - the six days we spent in Paris we, we were treated worse than any other country we have ever been in the world). Even though we gave advance notice that we were traveling through Paris after our extended trip in a developing country and requested an early check-in, when we arrived, our room was not ready and we were forced to wander aimlessly for an hour (after twelve hours on a plane and several days without a proper shower). I believe the staff only let us into our room early to be rid of us. When we checked out, the staff very nearly made us miss our return flight. We came outside to discover that a political rally had shut down traffic for several blocks around the hotel and the nearby Bastille. We hiked into the nearest Metro station, only to discover it unattended and with the sole ticket machine unable to read any of our credit cards (which work fine). When we hiked back up to the hotel to explain our situation, the staff refused to give us any coins in exchange for bills (the metro machines only take coins). After being similarly denied by three servers and a bartender at a nearby cafe, we returned to the hotel and requested that they call us a taxi cab. The staffer informed us that it would be a while due to the traffic shut down because of the protest, which we readily accepted, as the train rides themselves would take almost as much time as we had remaining before our flight at this point. After five minutes waiting outside, I stepped in to see where we would meet our taxi, only to discover that the staffer had not even called for one yet. He then proceeded to inform me that another Metro station about five minutes in the other direction was staffed every day, and would take our credit cards or bills. This info could have been passed on half an hour earlier and saved us lots of time and anxiety. We literally made the airport gate as the plane was loading and, had the American Airlines staff not helped us through security, we would have missed the flight. I will never stay here again.

The room is so small we didn't even have room to place our luggage anywhere. And I have traveled throughout Europe and I know a room for two usually means 2 beds put together. However, usually they make some kind of effort to actually attach them together. These beds slid apart constantly. So much for our romantic getaway.

The room, yes it was small, but it also had such a bizzare shape to it. The wall around the bed curved inward, so you could barely move around the bed.

The room had individual climate control. The staff on the desk were all pleasant, though my interaction was rather limited, not being a first time traveler to Paris. The elevator was big enough for 2 or 3 people with luggage. The biggest plus of all was free wireless internet access. The other hotels I looked into around there in that class all charged heinous fees for wi-fi.

Also, the price I got on their website was quite a bit less than their posted double rate. We had a double for 110 Euros (and with free breakfasts b/c we had the Steves book). We visited in December, so the fireplace in the main room made for a nice place to hang out, play card, read the paper. There is also a computer for internet in the lobby. The hotel offers free wireless, but the service did go out a few times during the 5 days we were there. The hotel is a very short walk from the Bastille metro stop (less than 2 minute walk).

That can be a challenge, as there are not many good, affordable hotels right in the Marais. My most recent Marais stay was at Hotel Castex, and I was very pleased with it. It's a solid three-star property with comfortable rooms, great location, and good prices. I paid about 115 euros/night for a double-bed (the usual-for-France two single beds pushed and sheeted together) room that I booked directly on the hotel's easy-to-use website. Location: Hotel Castex is only two very short blocks (maybe 100m) from the Place Bastille, but it's on a short, quiet street. It's on the eastern edge of the Marais, which is compact enough that walking from one end of the 4th Arrondisment to the other is no problem. And the nearby Bastille metro stop is great for getting easily to other parts of the city. As with any central Paris neighborhood, there are plenty of shops, cafes, and restaurants within the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Cafe Le Rempart, at the end of Rue Castex, has excellent and cheap coffee. There is a Monoprix supermarket nearby, on Rue St. Antoine, as well as a very good wine and spirits shop called Nicholas. Hotel itself: The lobby is pleasant, with comfortable furniture, an internet-connected computer for guests' use, and someone on duty 24 hours. I didn't use any of the hotel's few services or have breakfast, so I leave to other reviewers to comment on those features. I did, however, ask the day clerk to arrange a wake-up call, which he did as I watched. (Like many hotels, Castex uses an automated wake-up call system, and I received my call at the exact requested time.) I spoke French with the various front-desk clerks, so I didn't discern their English capabilities. Rooms: As others have noted -- and as is the case in most European cities -- the rooms are small but well appointed and comfortable. My double room, which was on the 2nd floor, faced the street. The windows opened, and I was able to keep my beverages (very) cold on the mini-ledge with a metal railing -- it was the same size and space as a beverage shelf in a large refridgerator door. The bed was comfortable, even with the slight ridge where the two twin beds met under the fitted cover sheet. The room had a decently sized flat-screen TV with a limited selection of mostly French channels -- although it did also have CNN. Wireless internet access in the room was free and pretty quick and reliable most of the time. The bathroom was spotless and sufficiently roomy, with a full-size bathtub-shower combo. The room's decor was fine: pleasant and unremarkable. I did not hear much noise from the street or other rooms. In sum, I recommend Hotel Castex as a very good mid-priced hotel in Paris's most charming neighborhood.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Coast", "Title": "\u201cI've Stayed Here Twice Now\u201d", "Author": "2rosie", "ReviewID": "UR22426307", "Content": "I picked this hotel last year based on a Rick Steves' recommendation and returned again this year - both times in early December.

My only complaint is that the night desk clerk didn't follow though on my request for a wake-up call, but fortunately, I had set my travel alarm clock, too.

We were part of a tour group during the week and extended our stay through the weekend. The people who work the front desk of the hotel are all very friendly and helpful. Our flight arrived early in the morning on our first day but they got a room ready for us by 10:00 am so we could rest a little. They were very patient about speaking English with us and also helped us with our French during the week. There is free wireless available for a laptop and one computer in the lobby. Regarding the rooms, they are very small, especially for two people. If you have a lot of luggage you will have space issues. But if you are there to see Paris and only need a room for sleep you will be fine. The maid service was much better during the week than it was on the weekend. But the room and bathroom were kept clean. The bed was made, trash emptied, and towels changed out daily. There was a noise in the wall that seemed to come from the air conditioning unit but we were so tired at night that we adapted and slept through it. I recommend that the noise be fixed however. The hallways and rooms are tight so you will hear people coming and going in the hall. We were only awakened one night by a loud neighbor who came in very late in a tipsy condition. The other nights we slept comfortably. The hotel is on a side street so there is limited street noise at night if you are a light sleeper. Regarding location, the hotel is very close to the Bastille metro stop and you can go anywhere in the city from there. The Marais district has many places to see and wander through like the Jewish quarter and Place de Voges. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area and a grocery store within a five minute walk from the hotel. No matter when we went out we always felt very safe in the area. If you are looking for a hotel at a comparably good price, and are okay with small rooms, I would recommend the Hotel Castex.

There are 3 Metro lines at the Bastille and a 4th line just down Blvd Henry IV. These would get you to most of the tourist sights in town.

As I had no idea what of part of Paris to stay I eventually decided that near the Place de la Bastille might be appropriate. After asking friends, reading extensively about small hotels and wearing out the reviews on Trip Advisor I finally decided to stay at the Hotel Castex. I booked direct with the hotel and had to pay 148 euros per night - but then it was the start of the French holidays. We followed the hotel's directions and took the bus to the Gare de Lyon and then the metro to Bastille. (If you are planning on using the metro I would recommend buying a 3day, 5day or whatever pass. You can then hop on and off metros at will.) As other reivewers have warned - take the rue St Antoine exit. We arrived well before midday but there was no problem leaving our bags whilst we started our sightseeing. The weather had hotted up with a bang and it was about 34 - 35 degs C so when we opened the door to our room the cool temperature of the air conditioning was very welcoming. As warned by other reviewers the room was small. As I had no previous experience of Paris I was not able to compare it, but it didn't turn out to be a problem. The beds were actually 2 x 3ft beds pushed together and were extremely comfortable. The room was clean and the bathroom was reasonably modern. As a previous reviewer (BobH) - we also stayed in room 504. Bob stated that his TV didn't work and there wasn't a proper showhead. However, he stayed there in October 2006 and they have now put a fixture on the wall for the shower head and the TV worked fine. The big thing for us was the airconditioning in Paris in July. The main thing that bothered my husband was the lack of fire escape. There was a 30 minute fire resistant door outside our room and the next room (like a small lobby) but there was absolutely nowhere to go apart from the stairs. If there was a fire on the stairs the only way down was out of the 5th floor window and there was nowhere to jump to apart from the ground. The hotel staff were very agreeable and I had e-mailed beforehand asking about somewhere locally to eat on my birthday. It was suggested we went to Bofinger just round the corner and the hotel booked this for us. I had read various reviews about Bofinger and some none too flattering. However, we couldn't fault the service or the food and when the waitress brought my dessert there was a firework in it for my birthday. We really liked the Marais district - we felt very safe at night walking around. It is within easy walking distance of Notre Dame, which I thought was absolutely fantastic - far better \"in the flesh\" than photographs or films. You couldn't starve in the Marais - there are numerous cafes, bars, restaurants, bistros etc etc - even a supermarket! The Place des Vosges is also just round the corner and also St Pauls church which is part of the old St Pauls Village. We enjoyed our stay at the Castex and would consider staying there again, but might ask for a lower room (not so far to jump if there's a fire !!!!)", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cIncredibly helpful staff!\u201d", "Author": "MCTozzo", "ReviewID": "UR8090027", "Content": "Just stayed at the Castex for 4 nights.

I had read many favorable reviews including the 3 star recommendation from Rick Steves--the travel guru and decided to give it a whirl. I was not able to get a better price than 140 euros per night which is what they charge for a double room in high season. A complete buffet breakfast (everything except meats and eggs) is provided in a nice environment at 10 euros per breakfast--if you mention being referred to the hotel by Rick Steve's the breakfast is free during your stay (hehe..remember that name). The hotel is clean, has a nice sitting area in the lobby decorated in Louis IV furnishings and has a small elevator to service the 5 floors (30 rooms). If you want more space, pay for the double room even though it is still small by hotel standards. I stayed in Rm 504 which did not have a good view but the windows were large and can be opened for ventillation. the rooms are all air conditioned as well. My room had a comfortible bed, desk & chair, two closets to hang things as well as an average size bathroom with shower. However, the showers are hard to use--you have to remove the sprayer from its holder in order to use it properly and when trying to juggle soap too, that is a problem. I don't know why the hotel didn't spend a little more money for a proper shower head----the convenience would be much appreciated. The small tv in the room did not work. There are no carpets in the room, just a tile floor with a throw rug--probably a good idea for people with allergies. The hotel staff spoke relatively good english and was always helpful especially the owner's wife Veronique and one of the males, Octavia. They give good recommendations on tours, restaurants, transportation etc. The hotel is located on the outer boundaries of Le Marais on Rue Castex between Rue St. Antoine and Blvd Henri IV--4th Arrondissement (district) and close to the Bastille Arrondissement..both are very nice areas....young professionals living in these neighborhhods and it is less touristy than others. Public transportation is excellent...you can buy 1, 2, 3 or 5 day visitor cards good on Metro (subway, bus and suburban trains). The closest subway station to the hotel is the Bastille Station on Line 1& 5 which is 2 blocks from the hotel at the intersection where Rue St. Antoine and Blvd Henri IV come together--across from the statue commemorating the site of the original Bastille prison which no longer exists. there is no need to recommend restaurants here--there are so more bistros, cafes and restaurants than you can shake a stick at in Paris..just walk around and look at the menus and the decor and make up your mind..it is not rocket science..bon appetit! I higly recommed the 1.5 hour city bus tour of the highlights of Paris fo 17 euros--there are brochures in the hotel looby. The tour bus with headsets for each passenger givs the tour automatically in 8 or 9 longauages...pick up the tour outside the tour bus office on Rue des Pyramids and Rue Rivoli outside the Louvre. Also, please take a trip to the Chateau de Versailles 40 minute train trip from Paris which was the residence of royalty before their heads were lopped off...beatiful gardens and for 8 or 10 euros you can take a tour of the residence of the king and queen and see all of that opulence with a headset with english translations included. If you are in Paris on a Sunday, for some cheap Christmas gifts, take Metro Line 4 to the end of the norther terminal--Porte de Clignacourt--walk 2 or 3 blocks from the Metro Station to get to the large flea market---there are signs at the Metro Station on the street directing you to the flea market. This is my 2nd visit to Paris and it was a wonderful trip...I had much fun..enjoyed the people, food and sights. It is not a cheap city; bring plenty of cash...lol If you have further questions, contact me r.huffman@mindspring.com", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cConnecting Rooms/Buffet Breakfast/RickSteve Discount\u201d", "Author": "rocknroll52", "ReviewID": "UR5709095", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Castex for 5 days in August 2006. We are a family of 4 including two teen girls. The availability of connecting rooms at this hotel is great for families with children. Here's the setup: two separate rooms, each with their own bathroom, connect via a small hallway off the elevator lobby with a door that can be locked from inside. So you can leave the bedrooms open to each other but have privacy from the rest of the hotel. We had rooms 203 and 204 which were both comfortable although the bed in room 204 sagged on one side. The buffet breakfast was excellent. It is nice when you have children to have the convenience of breakfast in your hotel. In addition to the usual bread, croissants and jam, breakfast at the Hotel Castex includes: fruit, yogurt, cheese, pate, fresh fruit, and cold cereals. And to drink: orange juice, hot chocolate, tea, hot milk, and hot coffee. The usual cost of breakfast is 10 euros which is a bargain by Paris standards. This hotel is in the Rick Steve Paris guidebook. By mentioning Rick Steve's book we were given breakfast free of charge, and the fifth night of our stay for free! This is a great value. A word about the Metro. The stairs to the Bastille stop (Yellow #1 Metro line) are close (about 2 blocks away) but to get to the actual Metro train is a much longer walk underground. Because of the walk to the Metro, parents with small children or the elderly might not find this location ideal. However, it is fine for older children and teens, and older family members who don't mind walking. Also, keep in mind that the Bastille stop is somewhat confusing with 6 exits (\"sorties\") and if you take the wrong one you will be quite far from the hotel. Look for the \"Sortie\" for Rue St. Antoine! Once on the Metro you can go directly to the Louvre, Champs Elysees, Rue de Rivoli, Tuileries and Arc de Triomphe. To get to the Eiffel Tower, go to Charles de Gaule Etoile, change to the #6 line and go to the Trocadero stop. There you will get a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower as you approach. To visit Notre Dame you can either walk, or take the Metro to the Hotel de Ville stop. There are plenty of cafes in the neighborhood for casual dinners; we walked around at night and it was very safe. As we were there in August a number of shops and restaurants were closed; however, you have all the basics at your disposal within 2 blocks: newsstand, post office, ATM, grocery, pharmacy, patisserie, photo store. Also within walking distance are several nice attractions: the Picasso Musuem, Jewish History Musuem, Carnavalet Museum and Centre Georges Pompidou.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cHidden Gem\u201d", "Author": "twitchery", "ReviewID": "UR5628129", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Castex Hotel as part of our 3 week European vacation. It was our first time in Paris, so we took extra care in choosing exactly where we would stay. This hotel is located in the desirable 4e, right by the Bastille. After we were in Paris, we realized that the Metro will take you almost anywhere you need to go. We worried about not selecting a hotel right next to the major tourist sites in the 1e. We were so glad we didn't! Not only did we get a much better hotel rate, but we stayed among the Parisians! We stayed 3 nights and loved it. It was roughly 100 euros a night, which is a serious bargain in Paris, and we found that Venere.com had the best rates. We can't say enough about the staff. They were wonderful and extremely friendly. They all spoke English very well and were eager to help us with whatever we needed. The hotel is also air conditioned which is somewhat rare from what we learned there in Paris. We were there during the \"heatwave\" in late July, and it was our saving grace coming back to that chilly room each night. And the beds, so comfy you didn't want to get out of them in the morning! However, that delicious breakfast and excellent coffee were waiting for us downstairs, as well as Paris! The location couldn't be better; 2 blocks from the metro and around the corner from anything you could need- grocery, bakeries, cafes, clothing, laundromat, post office. The area was very \"untouristy\" and it felt like we were walking amongst the locals. We kept telling ourselves that we scored the whole time we were there. We'll definitely stay there again when we go back. It's a hidden little gem among a mass of choices.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel!

The housekeeping staff did a good job with the rooms, although they like to wake you up if you sleep in so they can get into your rooms to clean. Oh yes, and free wireless internet, which is great!!

What a fantastic place! From the consistently helpful and friendly staff (offered us an umbrella when we were about to go out in the rain, and asked the cab driver how much the fair would be to the airport before they let him take our luggage) to the immaculately clean room, the place was just great. And the location couldn't really be better. When you go out the door, make a right, and your a few blocks from the Ile de St. Louis. Make a left, and your at the Bastille and the Marais. Good A/C too, although it was so mild out, that we slept with the window open instead. On a 3-week trip to Europe, we stayed at many nice hotels. This one was far and away the best of the trip! One other thing - yes, the room is small. But they've clearly put thought into maximizing the limited space. The result is a small room that feels much larger than it actually is.

The very small room wasn't too clean, but the bathroom was better. But I highly disliked the \"telephone\" showerhead that doesn't have anything to hook it on the wall - just handheld in the bathtub. Very unhandy. Had to keep laying it down on the bottom of the tub and picking it back up to use. Made showering a major ordeal. The breakfast was OK, but not worth E10. And the breakfast room was quite cramped. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The Internet machine in the lobby was worthless (needed a special card to use). The closest Internet cafe was a 15 min. walk away and VERY expensive. The Marais is too busy for my taste. My room was very noisy (at the front of the hotel) and I was awakened several times at night and early morning by partying people, street cleaners, and trash trucks. I prefer a quieter neighborhood. The local Metro stop was just a few blocks away (Bastille), but nearly everywhere in Paris has a nearby metro stop.", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in a great area\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3255012", "Content": "I stayed at the Castex in February '05 with my boyfriend. Overall we really enjoyed the hotel, the location is great and the room while small, was pretty efficient. We had a room facing the street on the 3rd floor but we were isolated from any street noise. The hotel has an elevator which I'm told is huge for Paris standards. The bathroom is very small but it does well with the room it has. The fixtures and design all seemed very modern, the bathtub was comfortable, and the water pressure in the shower was unbelievable! The maids were very friendly, they are the ones serving the breakfast in the morning. It is normally 10 Euros but free for two people for your stay if you have Rick Steve's Paris book. I don't love the book but it was certainly worth it for the free breakfast. (The croissants were marvelous!!) The Castex is in a great area, near the Bastille which has 3 metro lines stopping there and it's near the heart of the Marais with great restaurants, shops and museums nearby. We didn't always love the staff at the desk, some of the people on the night shift seemed really junior. They were perplexed when we asked simple touristy questions (can you confirm our dinner reservation? where can we find internet access in the neighborhood? etc) but the woman at the desk each morning was helpful and overall we really enjoyed our stay. I almost forgot, the bed and pillows were very very comfortbale! Not like you usually find in hotels! There is also a promotion that gives you your 4th night free during certain months.
