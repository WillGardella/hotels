Was not booked by myself but by my company. Not an ideal location as it involved using the flyover, but can't blame that on the hotel. The hotel itself was cleanish and comfortable. Had a single room which was a decent size, but the en-suite leaves a lot to be desired. Apart from the damp on the ceiling, it was tiny. Not enough room to swing a mouse. A few of my work colleagues said the same thing. The breakfast is nothing special. I had almost finished it when my toast was brought out to me. I sent it back. Didn't try the on site restaurant, but it smelled very good and was always reasonably busy, which brings me on to the next problems. Very limited parking round the back of the hotel, so when the restaurant is busy then its a struggle to find a spot. On the plus side, the bed I had wad very comfortable.

However, when we got to our room (217) we were extremely sorry that we hadn't agreed to move. To say it was grotty is putting it mildly. The walls were dark brown and dirty cream.

It was a disgusting room, and if we hadn't made such a fuss about staying put (and if it hadn't been so late - we had our very tired 4 year old grandson with us) we would have moved out immediately. Perhaps we were given the worst room because we had insisted on staying for the two nights we had paid for, I don't know.

The hotel stuff was very attentive and caring, I felt very secure and comfortable. Secondly the hotel has an absolutely perfect location. I was travelling from Heathrow. It took only 15-20 min to get it by tube and approximately 15-20 min to get central London. When I was flying back to home, I had a very early flight, the taxi cost me just 14 pounds which is nothing for London prices! Besides, the location was especially good for me because my daughter lives in that area, and it was so easy for me and for her to visit and see each other that made me absolutely happy! And finally, the prices were very affordable, it was a very good value for money, my stay in Boston Manor significantly saved my finances.

One small blessing was the cleanliness of the bedding. Which brings me nicely onto the matress, while clean, it resembled a block of concete with absolutely no give whatsoever, which is fine if you like extremely firm matresses but totally ruled out a decent nights sleep for me. after a really rough night i awoke looking forward to a nice full english breakfast, which was exactly the opposite to what we got. We sat down and after twenty minutes of asking received our \"full english\" breakfast which consisted of two hard eggs, one value sausage, one undercooked rasher of streaky bacon and a quarter of a cold tomato!!! I asked where were the mushrooms, beans, black pudding, hash browns and fried bread and was told i could have some beans if i wanted. After half a sausage and a bit of the egg i gave up!! I sat for ten mins to finish my coffee at which point i was given a bowl with beans in lol. Everyone eating breakfast at this time received the same treatment.

It was cheaper compared to other budget options like IBIS, premier inn etc. The staff was very helpful, they helped us carry our luggage to our room. We had lots of heavy luggage as we were returning after a long vacation. Also they stored our luggage when were in town before our evening flight. Many chain hotels in London now refuse to store luggage due to security reasons. We were also given complimentary Internet for our room.

The best (and nearly only) choice seemed this hotel I picked it mainly because it was the most convenient for the price, close (ish) to the piccadily line & close to a night bus route from central London. In these terms it did everything it needed too- but I have stayed at far more convenient (and better) hotels for less. The public areas of the hotel were dated, tired and in places not overly clean. I too laughed like the previous reviewers at the 'Luxury suite' signs! I cannot imagine what definition of Luxury they have used! The room itself was similar- the delightful net curtains were a lovely shade of yellow & the windows were dirty. I would also bet that this room has recently been smoked in (is this not banned now?). The sheets were worn but were clean & the bed was on the hard side but one of the better hotel beds to sleep in. The bathroom at first appeared clean, but whilst sat on the toilet (sorry!) I noticed nasty looking stains on the door frame (erghh!). The busy road mentioned before didnt affect me (except the drunks at 3.00 am) and I had a decent nights sleep. Breakfast was OK actually- OJ was OK, cooked brekkie not too cheap & nasty- apparently branded cereals. The staff didn't speak much English, and there was a highly embarassing incident on an adjoining table (the customer wanted wholemeal toast- this was incorrect 3 times, ignored twice & then finally it was deduced that they didn't have any!) Didn't make breakfast second day unfortunately but nothing at all to complain about on my part....... Hotel itself is about 10 mins walk to tube one way (with a (shock) decent Harvester on the way if you are hungry. The other way some pubs (polish or Irish- take your pick!) & places to eat. There is also an Indian Restaurant in the hotel itself, but didn't try this out... In the context of London hotels I feel that a 2 rating would be mean for this hotel- I reluctantly give it a 3 because I have stayed at a number of London Hotels in this price range & really it is not bad in comparison.

We had two rooms booked for us and two kids: they upgraded us to a room big enough for all 4 (one full and two twin beds) but refused to let us exchange our reserved two cheaper rooms for that one more expensive one (which would have saved us some dough) even tho we ended up not using the kids' room (they wanted to stay in ours because theirs was far away through a lybranthine arrangement of poky corridors and staircases). The room we did use was cramped with all those beds and the bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. The whole experience was pretty creepy and unpleasant.
