{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice hotel We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street.

The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR244257898", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CKF"}, {"Content": "Loved the Dong Fang!

My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic hutongs and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos!", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR919866672", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kacie01"}, {"Content": "great hotel We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2008 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats.

We arrived on Friday 25th January 2008 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around \u62e216.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half.", "Date": "Feb 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR219116422", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LOWESTOFT MEMBER"}, {"Content": "Not great We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour.

This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!!

English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2008 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience!

However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor.
