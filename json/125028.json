High-end pastries, but also oatmeal, breakfast burritos, fresh fruit, potatoes, and a full omelet bar with quality ingredients like spinach and asparagus in addition to the peppers, meats and cheese most of them have.

The rooms are the perfect size with large bathrooms, comfortable beds, lots of windows and a fireplace. The spa is relaxing and clean and our treatments were heavenly.

The location was not the best since it was close to the back of the kitchen, but was ok, after all, was kinda raining... The rooms are very confortable and spacius, they have a fireplace and nesspresso machines (yes!) At that point I forgot about the closeness to the kitchen. In the afternoon, they have a complimentary cocktails and or d'oeuvres. It's so well serve that if you want a frugal meal you can totally skip dinner. On Saturday evening they also had a winemaker offering wine tastings. The breaksfast is outstanding, from the cheff cooking eggs to your order to the champagne brunch. After that you just fill totally ready to go an explore the wine country. I didn't go to the spa, since my relaxation method is sleep, but my husband did and the was very happy...

Room was really nice. Yountville is a tiny peaceful town, in between Napa and St Helena. You could miss it if you weren't looking for a hotel or one of the big-name restaurants in town, but it was nice for walking around. Great launching point for winery touring. A previous posting mentioned trouble with 'stomping' heard from their 1st floor room. We were on the 1st floor and didn't notice a thing. Maybe there was no one up there. Don't think we would have paid full price...not that it wouldn't be worth it in peak season but we just don't spend that on hotels very often. If you can get a great deal though, grab it.

The Mimosas and Bloody Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are a definitely plus. The rooms were big and clean. I am very picky where I stay and Villagio went above and beyond my expectations.

Our room was very large, had a nice porch, huge bathroom, massive king bed and a fireplace. Housekeeping did an excellent job tending the room and provided extra duraflame logs upon request. The location of this Hotel really cannot be beat - you're in the middle of Yountville, across from Redd/Ad Hoc and a stones throw from Bouchon and other great eateries. We did not enjoy the pool or spa services - perhaps next time. Only issue with this hotel is the walls are rather thin and were awaken 1 night during our stay from some loud mattress Olympics above us and another night from loud talkers next door.

Finally, my friend and I decided to try it, and Yountville. We do a girls get-away for 3-4 days each year, and have stayed in a variety of nice places. We were very pleased with Villagio. Strong Pluses: The FOOD ( buffet breakfast, and afternoon Tea, they make their own food and it was all luscious), the SPA ( we each had a fabulous and memorable treatment, and loved the facilities(though very complicated multi-head showers)), the Staff: all friendly and helpful. Our room was also very nice, and we had a decent rate ( for yountville) of 209$ per night. The room was spacious and all the little details were great. It was a 'yes\" kind of place. The flowers around the grounds were incredible. The minus that you will read about: Yountville as a destination is essentially one road (washington street) running parallel to HWY 29, which runs up the Napa valley. The back side of Villagio, and its sister hotel, the Vintage Inn, sits next to the HWY. We were in the middle of the buildings towards the HWY. We heard the highway anytime we were going in and out of our room/ building area. We were not bothered at all by the HWY once we were in our room. Now, I will note that it was raining while we were there, so our windows were closed, and we did not use our little balcony, which would not be true during the normally very nice weather in the Napa valley. But our trip was great and we were very happy and not bothered by HWY 29 at all. We ate at BOTTEGA, one of several \"famous Chef\" restaurants. It was incredible and we would strongly recommend it. Creative and fresh Italian. We hired a driver for wine tasting from a place called: Destination Drivers: they sent a driver to the hotel, and she drove us anywhere we wanted in our own car. It is the cheapest way to get around wine tasting (we have tried all the companies in the Napa valley). It is especially great, since we get tips on small and interesting wineries to visit, some private, so you have to schedule appointments.... this driving company will take you where you want to go. Most tours pick the wineries for you. Try Cliff Lede, which is down the Yountville crossroad. Look at his map of his vineyards: they are each named after an old rock song.

The rooms on the other side of the fountains seem like they would be much quieter and were priced the same. The rooms were nothing special but were larger than most. Other services were also lacking. The website stated: For those who fancy blending wine with technology, Villagio offers complimentary use of iTouch units pre-programmed with local winery maps and tasting routes but the two front desk staff had no idea what I was talking about when I requested one.

We just got back from the Villagio a few hours ago and I couldn't wait to sing their praises. I'm seriously confused as to how this hotel is ranked #4 out of 5 hotels in Yountville; my husband and I found it to be one of the greatest places we've stayed recently (especially when contrasted to the hotel in NYC we stayed in last week - double the price and no where near the service). Now, we went in the off-season so I already felt we got a steal for the hotel room ($225 a night), and then when we arrived we got upgraded to Room 101, which is right by the pool and the main building for the hotel - score! We had a lovely outdoor patio that looked out on some grape vines, a gorgeous king-size bed, a fireplace (which we used both nights and which worked flawlessly), and a spacious bathroom area. The room was immaculately clean and very quiet. The bed was so comfortable - great pillows, incredible duvet. The shower, while sort of tough for a short person to get into, had excellent water pressure, the water temperature was always right, and the provided bath amenities were large enough for two people to use them (I hate how small hotel toiletries always are). We had a bottle of chardonnay (complimentary) waiting in our room and when we arrived, were given complimentary hot chocolate. The location is great - within walking distance to all the major restaurants (Bottega, Ad Hoc, Bouchon, French Laundry) and the pool is heated and warm enough that my husband went swimming yesterday! The spa is supposed to be wonderful, but we didn't check it out this time. Breakfast, as others have raved about, is INCREDIBLE - and included in your room rate! They have their made-to-order omelet station (which had so many great offerings) and some delicious, and different, breakfast spreads. Today they had biscuits and gravy; yesterday they offered a bacon quiche. There are a great selection of pastries, toasts, bagels, spreads, and who will complain with complimentary champagne, mimosas, and bloody marys to start the day off? The best part, though, was the staff - truly friendly and helpful at every turn! My husband and I were going up there to finally eat at French Laundry and I was beyond excited. When we got there, we needed to have his blazer dry cleaned, and they called the dry cleaner to confirm that he could come pick it up and return it early so that we could make our dinner seating. When it was returned from the dry cleaner, one of their staff immediately brought it to our room so that I didn't even have to stress out or worry! Given that I had had a HORRIBLE experience with a hotel dry cleaning service in Austria several years ago (which resulted in us missing the first half of The Nutcracker at the Opera House in Vienna), having this peace of mind meant so much to me! I was going to go over there to check on the dry cleaning at 4:10 (they said it would be back at 4:00), but they delivered it promptly to the room at about 3:55 PM and I couldn't have been happier (also, their prices were really reasonable - $10 for a blazer?!? I'm used to paying twice that at a hotel). My husband also accidentally left his workout clothes in the hotel room after we checked out (he was drying them on the patio and we forgot about them) and they were great about tracking the clothes down and shipping them to us so that we could get those back. When we asked about the best way to get from the hotel to French Laundry, they offered to call us a trolley and when we asked how we'd get back from the restaurant, they said to simply call the front desk and they'd send the trolley to pick us up (we ended up walking but they were just so helpful!). Honestly, when I checked out this morning I asked to be added to their e-mail list. As we live in San Francisco, if I saw a decent price on the hotel on short notice (or even with advance notice), I'd go back up there just to stay by the pool or use the spa facilities. It was an incredible deal - we've probably spent 40-50 nights this year in various hotels and my husband said it was \"one of the best hotel values we've had\". I agree.

The rooms were of spacious, well furnished and very tastefully decorated. The location was perfect with many great vineyards in less than 10 minutes drive. Within walking distance are great restaurants such as French Laundry, Botegga and Redd. Also a few shops to browse and buy unique items and gifts. We enjoyed the spa for a massage and just relaxing. Excellent service and very accommodating. There are two things that could be negatives. We did not like our bed. Too soft. By the third day, I had a backache but it was too late to ask them to do anything. There can also be a bit of road noise from highway 29.

The BEST was the amazing breakfast included in your room rate: unlimited champagne and bloodies, omelet and waffle stations....this meal sets you up for a day of wine tasting! My ONLY warning- CHECK all your bills! We had booked spa treatments (which they actually never put in their book when I called to confirm it so call to check on your bookings), I asked the girl on the phone the exact price which matched what their website says. She said the gratuity was included so I asked her to give me EXACTLY what it would cost. ( I was putting cash aside to pay). When I went to pay at the spa the price was $20 more per person! I spoke to the Spa manager and she handled it PERFECTLY! She was pleasant and refunded us right away. Same at check out- my bill had completely higher room rates then we were confirmed at.

The service was exemplary from the moment we checked in until the moment we drove off the property. The concierges spent a fair amount of time with us sanity checking our winery itineraries and made some amazing suggestions on others. Our first night there, the concierge was able to get us a reso at Bottega for 7pm, which set the tone for a week of amazing food. The included breakfasts were always great, with ample fruit and cereals, an omelet station, pastries and some hot foods. The mimosas and Bloody Marys were free-flowing for those partaking. There was an afternoon tea, which we attended only on the first day, which included finger sandwiches and small pastries. Though the pool area was small, we were always able to get a chair in the sun (or the shade, when we wanted that) and it was always well-attended to. Towels were constantly refreshed, and water, lemonade and iced tea were always on hand, and the wait staff was able to attend to any other needs. There was a second pool we did not use behind the old spa location which is available for guests when not reserved for other parties or events. The grounds were meticulously kept. While we expected the location to be set a bit further back from the street, this turned out not to be a problem at all as there was never any noticeable street noise, and we were a (very!) short walk from all of the amazing restaurants of Yountville. The mens' spa was small, but well-kept and more than sufficient, including an outdoor hydrotherapy pool and a fireplace, which I guess is used in colder months. The staff at the spa were always great. My wife had made the appointments for us and another couple we were with, and all of us were supposed to have had female masseuses, and all wound up with male ones. While not an issue, it was perhaps the only surprise of the stay there and was not as booked. The V-Shops area opened late and closed early, as seemed to be the case with most of Yountville, which seemed a missed opportunity, as we were out at tastings during their entire operating hours virtually every day. We stayed in an interior courtyard room and while the view was as the room is named, it felt very separated from neighboring rooms, quite, spacious and luxurious. While security was never a remote concern, we did think it odd that there was just a single deadbolt on the door. While the bedding was great, I thought the mattress could have used an extra layer of padding, though I guess that's personal preference. Similarly, I found the pillows a bit too soft, but I'm a side or stomach sleeper, so I tend to have issues finding a pillow that I love. Again, likely an issue of personal preference. The hotel uses a ground courier service to ship wine, and we were able to leave the bottles in the room with the form filled out and they took care of it without us having to lug anything to the front desk. Upon checkout, the always pleasant front desk staff checked us in to our flight, pre-paid for our checked luggage and printed our boarding passes for us.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Chester Ohio", "Title": "\u201cClassy But Not Stuffy\u201d", "Author": "joyjim", "ReviewID": "UR116216210", "Content": "This is our second trip to Villagio and I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting the Napa Valley.

The pool was very warm and inviting and the chairs around it the perfect spot to lounge after an arduous day of wine tasting. The breakfast was phenomenal including a generous buffet of fruits, meats, cheeses, baked goods, made to order omelets and waffles, espresso drinks etc. As a confirmed coffee drinker I also made good use of the espresso maker in the room. My favorite thing may have been the bed - it was gorgeous to open the balcony and windows and get a cross breeze and fall asleep in an extremely comfortable bed. My least favorite thing was the strange staff hierarchy. It was hard to get anything done because all tasks seemed to be delegated and take forever. We wondered if it was some strange union rules at play. We hiked on some trails north of this hotel up into the cliffy hills and I would highly recommend that for anyone who enjoys hikes.

The grounds of the villagio are everything you would expect from visiting napa valley. They have their own minature vineyard on the front lawn, and the surround area and gardens are well manicured. its just an all out great feeling to be at this location. Another thing i cant rave enough about is the town of younteville where it lies. The town has some of the best restaurants you can find in napa and the main street to get to them is all walking distance, no matter where you are. There is a market that sells alcohol, snacks and gourmet cheeses and whatnot directly across the street, which of course is another authentic napa experience you must enjoy while visiting. I highly recommend visitng Boatega restaurant in younteville for it is to this day one of my absolute favorite restaurants ive been to in any state or country. the food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is absolutly perfect. Back to the villagio their champage breakfast couldnt do you any better. they offer anything and everything ones heart could desire, and their dining area in the lobby is a pleasant place to start off your day. The made to order omelette station is fast and taste great, and the champagne is pour your own..so enjoy that! :) each day we were amazingly happy with the turn down service to our room. they cleaned and replenished multiple times a day as we came and went. The coffee machines in the bathrooms were a great thing to enjoy, and the complimentary bottle of chardoney apon arrival was much enjoyed. The pool and hottub are big enough, clean enough and comfortable enough. As you can tell this is my absolute favorite place to stay and visit, we have returned three times and will again soon enough, however the price seems to continue to climb so I really must suggest they try and keep it managable for all parties. I would happily pay 300 dollars per night for a regular room here and have in the past. we paid 500+ per night for an upstairs suite our first visit for our honeymoon...but the hotel now is averaging somewhere in between those prices just for a regular nights stay not even in a \"price location\" which unfortionatly is asking a bit much. please management, if you would like your loving customers to continue to make it back, try to keep the prices managebale for all. We happily will travel across the country from massachusetts yearly to stay at your hotel alone, as long as its affordable.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cPhenomenal.\u201d", "Author": "tinat168", "ReviewID": "UR106901481", "Content": "Stayed at the Villagio for a girlfriends' weekend getaway and received a great deal.

This was perfect as most restaurants weren't open and our dinner reservation was not until 7:15 PM.

Since my daughter and I were interested in having one destination where we could have spa services, and based on many TripAdvisor reviews, we chose the Villagio. After making the reservation I called on 3 different occassions and left messages for someone to call me back so that I could make the spa appointments and dinner reservations but no one ever did. Finally I called a fourth time and reached a spa representative. Since the spa is open until 8 I wanted appointments around 5 -5:30. I was told that 4 and 4:30 were the latest appointments available. The woman I spoke to was most unpleasant and when I tried to inquire if perhaps different types of treatments were available later in the day I was told that the spa does not offer any services past 4:30. Since the person who took the room reservation had assured me I could make spa appointments up until 7:00 I was confused but obviously not getting anywhere with the person I was speaking to. I settled on the 4 and 4:30 treatments. When my daughter and I checked into the hotel I confirmed the appointments. Prior to setting out to visit the local wineries we stopped at the concierge desk to inquire about wineries to visit. We were given a few complimentary passes but no knowledgeable information or suggestions on where to go. We rushed back from the wineries for our scheduled spa appointments. My daughter was seen at 4 and I waited in the ladies lounge for my 4:30 appointment. At 4:45 I went out to the desk to inquire where the therapist was but the receptionist was not there. At 5pm I returned to the desk again where 2 young women were chatting and laughing. I inquired about my treatment and their response was that they did not remember I was there or know where the therapist was. They said they would call the manager who did speak to me on the phone. He assured me that I would not have to pay for my treatment that I had not received and offerred me a gift certificate for my next spa visit. I told him I was from NY and not planning on returning. I told him I wanted my daughter's treatment to be complimentary which he agreed to. He also said the general manager of the hotel would contact me to offer me additional compensation but she has never called me. Upon checkout the charges for both spa treatments were still on my bill and it took approximately 30 minutes and many phone calls to have the spa charges removed. I do not expect this type of service from a hotel of this caliber. The physical hotel was nice and the fireplace in the room was a great touch.

In fact, I have seldom stayed in a quieter hotel. We had two adjoining rooms: a pleasant suite and a normal room. Both were well appointed, clean, and no smell of smoke anywhere, including the towels. (My pet peeve is a smoky hotel towel.) The check-in was pleasant and efficient. We were led to the room by a very nice staff member, possibly because the layout of the buildings calls for this when you first arrive. The layout is a series of two-story buildings, mostly, in my view, 2 rooms up and 2 rooms down. There is a slight Tuscan feel to the place. It has immaculately manicured grounds with lush vegetation and water features separating the buildings. The size of the suite is possibly a little small for the price, but you will get a separate seating room, which, by the way, seemed fairly useless unless you want your children to have a separate little play area. There is a pleasant but tiny patio, a nice size closet and a fine bathroom. The size of the normal room was fine and it had the same size (tiny) patio where you could sit and read or enjoy the lemon trees just outside. The rooms are rather dark in the daytime, but that helps with feeling cooler on a hot day. But you won't want to spend a lot of daytime hours in your room while in Napa Valley, I hope! Beds were very comfortable, bathtubs were new in appearance, and the room furnishings were fine. There was a normal-sized flat screen TV on the wall opposite the beds in each room. Nothing was rundown in any way. The pool was perfectly pleasant, if small, with beautiful landscaping around it. Breakfast highlights: an accomplished omelet chef and beautifully ripe fruit. Everything was fresh, even towards the end of the breakfast period when we were there. There was a much better selection of foods besides the usual breakfast fare. Kudos for them having hot oatmeal... such a healthy choice. The location, in Yountville in central Napa Valley, cannot be beat for convenience. It is within walking distance of L'Etoile at Domaine Chandon, and there is, we were told, two great little restaurants across the street. There is, however, no view from most of the rooms.

We have stayed at many 'boutique' hotels as well as high end hotels and this hotel was neither. It is basically a glorified motel off the highway. I had heard that the hotel was under construction and called the hotel a few weeks prior to our arrival to request a room away from the construction. They said my request would be accommodated upon arrival. When we arrived at the hotel, they told us that despite our request, the only rooms they had available were actually near the construction. We didn't get any sort of apology from the manager and we got zero acknowledgment that it was our anniversary (even though when I booked it, I let them know. Unlike our stay in the Hotel Vitale in San Francisco where upon arrival we were greeted with cards, flowers, and champagne for our anniversary). Our room was definitely spacious and had nice smelling molton brown products, but the room was far from clean. There were ants in the room and the furniture & paint was run down. The \"Champagne Brunch\" was terrible - stale bagels, bread, hard cheeses, powdered eggs and over done sausage. We did take advantage of the pool area which was actually well kept. The hot tub was nice and we reclined on the big couch like lounge chairs. On our second day at the Villagio, we received a message on our phone saying we had an \"amenity at the front desk\". Any hotel we've ever stayed at has always had the amenity waiting in our room when we arrived (such as complimentary bottle of champagne). We called the front desk and asked if the amenity could be delivered to our room but they insisted we must go pick it up. We were leaving on a plane so at that point we had no need for whatever it was they were going to offer us. Luckily, we were there in Yountville to tour the amazing wineries in Napa so we didn't spend too much time in our room. The only advantage to staying at the Villagio was that it was walking distance to some of the best restaurants. We ate at Bouchon which was amazing. I would also recommend Auberge du Soleil for dinner (ate the best Risotto ever there). All in all, our stay at the Villagio was mediocre and we were very disappointed with the facilities.

The sink area had a large double sink and a separate room with the toilet and bath/shower (always a plus). The staff was incredibly helpful in arranging last minute dinner reservations and finding us a florist to use. In addition, after a fax I was supposed to receive never arrived, they opened up the business center late at night (around midnight) so I could get what I needed). Included in the price of the rooms was a buffet breakfast (with a decent -- but not a large -- selection of food. There was also high tea from 3-5 (while we did not go, when we the bellperson mentioned tea and scones and my wife said she really anted a scone, he arranged for 6 scones to be in our room when we arrived). And, as if you might not have had enough wine, there is an evening complimentary wine tasting. The facilities are very nice, with a warm pool and plenty of chairs for the sun. We have never used the spa (so we cannot comment) and the business centere is good (2 computers and a printer). I have stayed at both ends of the valley (both in downtown Napa and Calistoga) and prefer the Villagio's central location, making it not too far from any wineries. Plus, there are a number of very good restaurant in walking distance for the last few bottles of wine at dinner (on a related note, get the Strawberry shortcake at Hurley's on Younville during Strawberry season (March-October). We missed it this trip, but it is incredible. To comment on a review about being close to the highway, I have had rooms in the past that face the highway and sometimes you can hear the cars. However, this trip we had an inner courtyard and could not hear anything. Also, a note of caution, they are currently doing construction (I think to expand the spa). We were there on a weekend, so there was no construction going on. As a result, I cannot comment on what time the noise begins and how loud it is.

The free breakfast buffet every morning is nice with a wide variety of items but tables could have been cleaned more quickly as the birds decided to help themselves to the dirty dishes. Included in the room was a bottle of Beringer Chardonnay (chill in the refrigerator provided), a Duraflame firelog, robes, and two bottles of water were provided during the turndown service.

No way. Our first floor room was incredibly dark and and there were touches that were original to when the place was built and just look out-of-date, not Old World Tuscan. If you have been to Italy, you know the theme just ain't so. Upon check-in, there was no mention of our anniversary or even a conversation except for \"we need a credit card.\" They were training someone also. No USA Today was delivered and we never could get the Internet to work very fast and resorted to using our cellphone's blue tooth connection in order to get on. Finally, the noise. While I didn't hear anything regarding the huge construction project, I had the air conditioner running the entire night on high to block out the street noise and took along ear plugs. When sitting on our patio (Room 123), the highway noise was ridiculous. On top of it, housekeeping was rolling those big bins up and down the walkways next to the fountains.

For example, wi-fi service is available throughout the inn (not just the lobby) free of charge. Also, the business center does not charge for access, printing or faxing services. They do not even charge guests an \"extra\" fee for shipping wines back home. Second, the outdoor pool is heated and so enjoyable even during a relatively mild winter, such as this January/February. Third, the concierge (Josh) was wonderful and gave many great recommendations. The restaurant Redd, across the street, was nothing short of amazing. The town of Yountville is small, but appears to be the culinary hub of the valley and so wonderful experiences are all within walking or biking distance. My only complaint would be that neither my boyfriend nor I were impressed by the massages we received at the spa. Also, during my entire massage and while in the ladies dressing room I overheard a conversation, I later discovered was being carried on by two men sitting on a bench just outside the spa doors. How the sound seeped into the rooms I'll never know. But the Villagio is building a new spa expected to open Spring 2008, which will hopefully have sound-proofed rooms.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "carrieag1", "ReviewID": "UR6745525", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful.

While the property is building a new spa (current facility is still open) we were not bothered by construction noise even once (Rm 240 was an upper level interior unit). We slept with the deck door open to fall asleep to the sound of the water fountain (not the traffic as some may claim). The property does back up to a highway portion of Route 29 but I only heard the highway once or twice on this stay and not once on my stay last spring. The beds are by far some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, including my own. Hotel now stocks Molton Brown toiletries which are a little \"manly\" in scent for me but my BF loved them. Bathroom has plenty of space for two to spread out and plenty of towels. The two (very large) Turkish cotton robes were nice when cuddled in front of our nightly fire. (For those complaining about not having \"real\" firewood, Duraflames are much safer and store better than firewood.) Each night we asked for a second log so we could sleep with a fire going all night - really romantic treat. A small fridge is perfect for leftovers and chilling a bottle of wine. Two large bottles of Evian were delivered to our room twice at no charge. The breakfast is amazing, it impressed me last Spring and it was just as good as I remembered it. It is hearty and filled me up past lunchtime each day. Just the right amount of food to begin the day wine tasting! The business center is open 24/7 with free computer and Internet access (didn't bring the laptop this time). Any business traveler will appreciate small benefits like free business center access - even if just to briefly check email and print out a boarding pass. Each visit I've had to ship home business materials and the front desk has always been helpful. Last time they took my 12 bottles of wine and contracted through an outside shipping company to send to my home in PA. I have yet to try the spa portion of this property, the prices are a little high for me. They have a lovely heated pool with poolside cabanas that we meant to try out each evening but never got around to it. One thing I do like about the Villagio that stands out from other properties - you can walk around to lots of cute shops and eateries - from the good mexican place to Bouchon's to the French Laundry. In between the Vintage Inn (sister property) there are also a number of shops. Only one problem surfaced during this recent stay: since the weather was unseasonably cold, we used our heater. One of the dials was broken and took two conversations with the front desk before maintenance came to repair. They did leave an apology note and indicated that the dial had been fixed - which for the most part it was. It worked fine the next two nights. Enjoy your stay at the Villagio.

I requested a quiet room for our six night stay. We arrived to a warm reception and flowers in the front were just great. Unfortunately, when went to our room, we found it to be the second door in from their new construction site. No one mentioned this construction project to us at any point, not upon booking, not upon asking for a quiet room, not upon check in -Never! The only mention of the construction is a poster in the lobby and at the spa with a rendering of the new building and what it would contain. On a visit to another hotel earlier this year, we received a letter and gift certificate towards a future stay in the new section, even though no work took place while we were there. See my review of the Royal Palms in Phoenix. It was Sunday when we checked in and I thought maybe the construction would not be taking place during our stay, that maybe it was just unsightly. Well, 9am the following morning, I realized I was wrong. Now the hours of construction were only from 9-4:30, not really bad if you were out all day. But at $359 per night, being unable to take a nap in your guestroom in the afternoon is just plain unreasonable! I did address this with the desk and they told me that we were indeed in an 'interior' room. They adjusted our rate to that of an 'exterior room' but could not move us as they were fully booked. The inconvenience we experienced for six days was not addressed to my satisfaction. I brought this up to the front desk agent who checked me out, but she was unsympathetic. The room was bare bones, dishes and glasses were constantly not removed during evening turndown service and I totally agree with the review regarding the duraflame log and the tacky fake artifacts. At about $150 less per night these items would not seem so important, but at $359 for a first floor room, this is not on par with other resorts in the industry. The spa staff was very friendly and professional, but the layout was substandard: you had to walk past treatment rooms to use the steam or sauna which is distracting while you are in your service. There was only one shower in the men's and ladies' changing areas with a filmsy shower curtain (not luxurious) and so the lockers (think rollerskate rink, not four diamond resort) would get soaked. There were hairdryers but no brushes. I do hope that they correct these items once the new spa is constructed . My husband requested a female massage therapist, but when we changed the times of our appointments the request was neglected. He lived, but it is indicative of a larger issue. The concierge, Mary, was wonderful and she really should be commended for going out of her way for guests. She was the reason that we did not try to change hotels, although we visited another property across the street that was less expensive and considered moving. The location of the property is wonderful. It is within walking distance to the very best restaurants and galleries in Yountville. We loved Redd and Bistro Jeanty and Mary even got us reservations at The French Laundry. Overall, if the hotel had not set the bar so high with its room rates, we may not have been so disappointed. I inquired about a comment card upon check out and was told one would be emailed to me. I have not received it, but have already received comment cards from wineries we visited that same day.

The fireplace would be charming if you enjoyed the ambiance and chemical smell of the single duraflame log allowed. The Villagio's breakfast, a bottle of champagne set on a continental breakfast buffet, was not what I expect from a \"luxury\" hotel.

I had the concierge (Mary) book us for last second wine tastings/tours every morning and she was wonderful. I called house cleaning and they were up everytime within minutes. The entire grounds were immaculate. However, I did book an upstairs king, so I had no experience with the complaints from people who've booked a ground floor room. The Bistro Jeanty across the street was fabulous. Best Wine Tasting/Tours: Opus One, Mondavi and Darioush. All three were extremely professional to the max. Avoid: Joseph Phelps. I am a fan of their Insignia line and was stunned to witness the two crude, obnoxious cretins they had at their tasting (if management cares, it was Friday July 7th about Noon).

We were delighted to find an internet \"Romance Package\" special on the Villagio's website for $250/night for a downstairs room with two queen beds; the romance package itself seemed to consist of the accommodations and a chilled bottle of champagne. We laughed at the idea of booking a romance package with two young children, but it was a great rate and so we booked it. Afterwards, I read many of the reviews on TA and was slightly concerned. Folks commented on the high cost of the room versus the value offered, complained of freeway noise, and disparaged the rooms as being loud and of poor or Motel 6-like quality. Fortunately, we found ourselves disagreeing with almost all of these poor reports. It is true that the hotel is located extremely near the highway and that, if you are in the pool, the parking lot, or in the rooms on that side of the resort, you will probably notice highway noise (of the zip-zip of cars ilk). This was not an overwhelming roar of noise, but it was obvious and I was glad that we were not in one of the rooms next to the parking lot (for many reasons, of course, but sitting on one's patio would clearly be far less pleasant there). We could not hear the highway from anywhere else on the hotel grounds (including the fountain walkway) except for the pool (it was more muted there, but still audible). We were in a bottom floor room that was the very end room next to the service road and the main Yountville road and heard no noise: no traffic, no persons upstairs, no one walking around the resort. It was peaceful, quiet, and relaxing. We found the room itself to look very much like the website pictures: sort of an Arizona-esque blend of woods and creams. Personally, we liked this very much. The linens on the bed were lovely, with wine-colored duvets, plenty of pillows, and soft mattresses. Our children were delighted to find the beds turned down and decorated with chocolates. There was a wood-burning fireplace (ready with a fire log), a sitting area by the windows (covered with lovely dark wood shutters), and then a dressing/wet bar area, a large closet and double sink, and a separate toilet/tub. The bathroom was very nice with an extra-deep tub, but this would not be my idea of a romantic soaking tub (perhaps I have been spoiled by Vegas and French Polynesia-- this was nice, but nothing that my bubble-bath addicted self was in a hurry to enjoy). Apparently, all of the rooms come with a complimentary bottle of chardonnay; there are also ample coffee and tea making supplies. A pleasant surprise (particularly since we were travelling with the kids) was the empty mini-bar fridge-- we had a place to store drinks and snacks. One of the most pleasant surprises about the hotel, however, was the level of service. We arrived at noon: they checked us in immediately. They provided us with a map and directions on where was best to park and how to find our room. Someone accompanied me to our room, showed me around, and placed the Chardonnay in the fridge to chill. He also asked what time we would like our champagne chilled and delivered that evening. Since we were attending a wedding, we picnicked in the room for an hour (although it seemed criminal to let kids near those duvets): there is a convenient liquor store/market across the street with child-friendly fare along with room service and numerous restaurants within walking distance. We picnicked, filled up the trash can, disassembled the beds, and left. When we returned shortly after nine o'clock, we found our champagne waiting for us (along with two bottles of Evian water) and that housekeeping had come and tidied up after us, remaking the beds, adding more chocolates, and emptying the trash. This was lovely and completely unexpected. The double distribution of chocolate has certainly set the bar for my children (who took to the concept after we explained \"turn down service\" to them). We all ate at the champagne brunch the next morning. It was quite nice and certainly provided all the fixings for mimosas. There were fresh fruit (both whole pieces such as apples and bananas and sliced melons, strawberries, kiwis, etc.), yoghurts, cereals, French pastries, a cheese and antipasto plate, toast, jams, two baked egg dishes, potatoes, bread pudding with poached pears, and a variety of other lovely things. Even my extremely picky seven year-old managed to eat breakfast (we appreciated the less exotic assortment of bananas and grapes in particular... although the buffet is elegantly set up and at first glance seems oriented more towards adults than children, there were plenty of familiar choices when you looked beyond the plating). Coffee could also be taken with you in paper coffee cups; there was always a large, iced display of bottled water by the front door for the taking. Other than walking around a bit and enjoying the many fountains, fish ponds, and little wooden bridges, our kids enjoyed time in the pool. Although you can hear some freeway noise, the main pool is a beautiful, relaxing place (we were slightly horrified to come in with our two kids): there are plenty of lounge chairs, about ten large, curtain draped cabanas, and a number of free pool floats. The housekeeping service at the pool was particularly impressive: they kept all of the lounge chairs and cabanas stocked with rolled, fresh towels and made three sweeps for dirty, abandoned towels in the hour and a half we spent in the pool. This meant that the pool area stayed tidy and that towels were always available. There was also a very hot hot tub that we all enjoyed. We attempted to be respectful of the other guests (women relaxing on the pool floats and loungers, reading) and kept our children somewhat quiet and refrained from cannon-balling into the pool; the other guests seemed not to mind our slightly noisy swimming. It was, frankly, nice to find a place so relaxing and elegant that was also child-friendly (we saw several families of three, with a smaller toddler or baby in a stroller while we were there). In short, if we were ever in wine country again, we would not hesitate to stay at the Villagio.

The highway noise competes with passing trains, upstairs guests' footsteps, running water, a cheap heating system, and croaking frogs for your attention all night long.

The room/suite was large and neat, but not especially clean (the carpet and soft furnishings all had stains on them), and the front desk staff was surly. The service otherwise was very good, although I felt sorry for them trudging from room to room and building to building in the rain (very Motel 6 architecture!). The food was wonderful (buffet and room service), but I'd expect a restaurant on the premises at a resort hotel in this price range.

We had booked and outside courtyard room at $225 and upon arrival they had upgraded us to an inside courtyard room. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous from the moment we arrived everything was taken care of. Check in was a breeze, we were given a great recomendation for an early Dinner at Hurleys except after sitting down to eat the power went out due to a downed telephone pole. The staff lit candles (we were the only two in the restaurant) and we had a few drinks before going back to our room and ordering room service. He had some kind of beef with mashed potatoes and baby vegetables and I being the vegetarian had the pear salad with some kind of cheese and a fantastic balsamic dressing. Are room was quite large and very plush. And the bed was very comfortable. In the evening we opened a bottle of sparkling wine that we had brought with us and moved our two ottomans in front of the fireplace. We sat in front of the fire for a few hours until it started to die out and then we called down for another log which arrived promptly. At around 10pm that evening the front desk called to say that the bellman had a special delivery, I figured they had the wrong room. My sweetie had mentioned it was my birthday on making our reservations and they had sent up a bottle of sparkling wine and two flutes with a birthday card! I thought that was a wonderful touch. The vanity area was very large and the robes were very comfortable. Late that night we decided to try out the tub and ran a bubble bath, with two people in the tub it was pergect with a little room to spare. Instead of going down to the free breakfast in the morning we opted for room service breakfast in bed. I had the seasonal fruit and berries with mint honey sauce and he had the egg and cheese croissant with breakfast potatoes and we both had the fresh squeezed oj.

It was lightly drizzling, but the fireplace in the reception area was warm and inviting. In the morning, the rain continued, but the beautiful champagne breakfast by the fireplace warmed our spirits and encouraged us to go tasting. More rain and our friends had a massage scheduled, so my husband and I dropped them back at the Villagio after just one winery. We decided to try our appointment in Calistoga, and as we pulled into Chateau Montelena, we heard a flood warning on the news. Not knowing exactly where we were in relation to the water, we pushed on. We weathered a 2 hour tour that took us outdoors through ankle deep flood water, but had a great adventure. Of course our trip back to the Villagio was worse, as the rain was coming down so hard that it was nearly impossible to see the flood barriers. We made it back and woke up New Years Eve to find out that some eight inches of rain had fallen overnight. We kept hearing and seeing fire trucks that were going out to rescue people trapped in their homes or cars stuck in the water. No one was sure which roads were open, so after another fabulous breakfast, we ventured out to our appointment at Niebaum-Coppola. It was like Chevy Chase pulling up to Wally World in \"Vacation.\" The gates were locked and no one was answering the phones there. We decided to drive on and nearly got trapped in St. Helena by the flash flood that ensued. We went south of Yountville, thinking the roads would be better. Instead we got about 3 minutes down Route 29 to find the highway under several feet of water. A few cars had been caught in the water and even a bus was floating across Route 29! We went back to the Villagio to find the other guests of the sold out hotel wandering around. We decided to suck it up and head to the awesome outdoor hot tub and heated pool. The staff gave us a bottle of champagne from the brunch, and eventually bent the rules for us to have champagne and food in the hot tub/pool area. If you didn't know that there was a natural disaster going on outside the walls of the hotel, the staff would never have given it away. I have to give Colby the concierge the highest marks, as she not only calmly dealt with the stranded guests, but when our New Years Eve dinner reservations at Domaine Chandon were cancelled (a lot of restaurants didn't have staff to open)she busted her butt to find us another place to celebrate on such a crazy night.

We stayed on the first floor by the pool in a suite with a fireplace. Basically a extra large hotel room, nothing over the top but traveling with kids nice to have a little extra space. We stayed our last two nights of our vacation here and it was the perfect end to a wonderful holiday. One side note to mention...If we are able to go back I would request a 2nd floor room. All of the post are correct in saying you can hear every step upstair from down below.. It didn't really bother us we were so tired and were still able to enjoy the room and sleep but given the choice request a second floor room. Kinda strange side note.. Try the fresh lemonade at night..The lemons are grown right on property. In the mornining they had the best egg salad we have ever had..Never a big egg salad fan but are now.. Wonderful pool area love the queen size chaise lounges and love the view of the fountians down the entire inside corridor on the property. Some ofthe guest are ridiculous... Each morning we were entertained by loud obnoxious showy people. One party were gushing how every bit of the 2,000 dollar dinner was worth it the night before and then the next morning an engaged couple talked way too loud about if they made more money than the people they had asked to be in their wedding. Can we say money doesn't buy happiness or class, but it sure is nice when it helps you stay in nice places as the Villagio.
