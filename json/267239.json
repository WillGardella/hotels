Having stayed in this area of London before in a higher star hotel (four stars and mould on the windows!) I wasn't expecting much but was pleasently surprised. Ok so you have to check in over the road, hardly a hardship as it's not exactly a busy road to cross. What you should be mindful of though is the stairs! We were on the top floor and due to the hotel being a period property there was a lot of stairs! Not ideal if you've not got the best knees and heavy bags. After climbing the stairs we were surprised by the size of our room. There was ample room to swing a cat and a large one at that. The room was clean and had sufficient facilities. The fridge in the room was rather ancient and noisy and not really necessary but I could see that some visitors may appreciate it. Due to our room being at the top of the building it was also very warm, the heating wasn't on and we still had to sleep with the window open and it was only February! the room did have a floor fan and I can imagine it'll be well needed later on in the year. Breakfast was perfectly fine - you can't really go wrong with cereal and toast (and I happen to like Dairylea triangles on toast for breakfast), I do have to agree with the comments about the coffee though - having real coffee (not sachets) would be a vast improvement and would take little effort but would make a big difference! The Hotel is in an ideal location, well within easy walking distance of the tube and close to Hyde Park, there are also a couple of local supermarkets and restaurants nearby if you've exhausted yourself from walking around the sights all day. All in all the Paddington Hotel is a perfectly fine budget hotel and having stayed at the four star Hilton not so far away I know which one I'd return too - despite the sachet coffee!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "BLK82", "ReviewID": "UR124585388", "Content": "Booked this hotel with another couple when we attended the Last Night of the Proms at Hyde Park, and were really disappointed - you had to book in at their sister hotel across the road, the rooms we adequate, although the bathroom felt dirty, and the TV only had analogue TV channels (in the wrong order).

Yes the rooms are on the building opposite to the reception, but it's the one shown in the pics anyway! The trick of the 70X number of the rooms has been clearly explained to us at the arrival so no inconvenience. There is no elevator, but the staircase are easy and wide. Our room, number 9, was much better than expected, for a 2 stars hotel: second floor, large, big window on the street side with light in the morning ( having sun coming in from the window in London is a plus!), bed was bit narrow for two but comfortable, small bathroom but equipped with all the necessary, small safe, fridge and tv good enough for 4 nights there! The location of the hotel is perfect: 100m from the underground on the Central Line, this means that with maximum one change you can get easily close to all the main attractions. The area is filled with hotels and has lots of residential streets, it's calm and pleasant, if you want to be in the middle of the \"action\" this is not the place to be. We found nice to go around and come back every day in a quiet area. Starting the day with a walk in Hyde Park, also 100m from the hotel, saying HI to the statue of Peter Pan, was really nice. We didn't try the included breakfast 'cause we preferred fresh food from bakeries or in one of the nice bars around the city. The staff was friendly and helpful.

The bathrooms (at least both the bathrooms we've had) looks newly renovated. In the room you find a flatscreen TV with lots of channels, a refrigerator and a wardrobe. Basic, but sufficient for us who didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. As for the hotel's location, it could probably not have been better. The hotel is situated 2 min (by foot) from the tube station Lancaster Gate, as well as Hyde Park. Despite it's super central location, the hotel itself is situated in a really quiet street, so you will not be bothered by traffic etc. neither at day nor night. The hotel breakfast is basic yet sufficient and decent. There are toast, yoghurt, cheese, jam, honey, boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. Plain yet very tasty.

I rang them & told them that we would be unable to arrive but I would pay for the night due to the short notice but would be there on the following day. I then booked a additional night over the phone. the hotel was fine, conveniently near paddington station, the room was clean, a bit on the small side but we didn't mind we were out all day & didn't arrive back until late every night. our problem was on the last evening, we arrived back to the hotel at 12:40am & my boyfriend went to collect the key from the reception across the road while I waited, he told me the reception staff wanted to speak to me. I went over & the man at the desk told me that I had to re-register back into the room because of the additional booking made over the phone, i told him that we had been here 4 days and no one had mentioned this to us & that the lady who checked us in first day told me our booking was fine & we had paid upfront for the days booked through the website, i even offered to pay the whole bill but she had told me that we could pay for the last night on checking out. But this man wouldnt let up, he told me that i would have to re-register and asked me to go to my room and get our passports numbers, it was now close to 1am in the morning, our room was across the street, up four flights of stairs & it was raining so i told him no, surely he would have them on record from our initial booking, then he told me me to ring my boyfriend to get the numbers, i again refused & said i would bring them in the morning. I had no sooner got back to the room when the phone rang & the man told me that i was to come over straight away & pay for the room. We explained to him that the lady said we didn't have to pay until check out, but he said if we didn't come over and pay we might be asked to vacate the room. so I had to AGAIN go over at 1am in the morning & pay. we were treated so badly... like thieves... I mean the fact we had offered with no quibble whatsoever to pay for the first night even though it was beyond our control that we couldnt arrive & our offer to pay in full our first day should of said we were honest and trustworthy.

Having said that, I maintain that the hotel's value-for-money ratio is excellent. Location-wise, it is perfect. It is close both to Paddington and the Lancaster Gate station on the Central Line (convenient from Liverpool St station). Five minutes to the Hyde Park, ten minutes to the Marble Arch and Oxford St. Can you ask for more? True, the reception is located in the building on the opposite site of the street. Is that really so much of an inconvenience? The hotel is a Victorian mansion: tall floors, high ceilings, just nineteen rooms in total. But: compared to very many hotels in London and Paris, rooms are of a decent size. I am saying this with a degree of confidence because on our way out we peeked into all other rooms on our floor as they were being cleaned and the doors were left ajar. There is plenty of space for luggage and walking around the room. Admittedly, the furniture is extremely basic and worn out, often chipped. It is, however, clean and in good working condition: the closet doors open and close, the bed is taut and not caved in, the fridge is functioning. The bathroom is tiled floor to ceiling which obviously helps them to maintain it clean. The carpet has seen better days and, yes, is stained but nothing grossly indecent, either. Breakfast was nothing to write home about: a basic selection of cornflakes in a box, skimmed milk, apple and orange juice, toast bread, jam and butter. No eggs, no sausage, no meat.
