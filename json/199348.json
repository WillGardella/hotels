{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pluses And Minues For An Aiport Hotel This is a so-called airport hotel near FRA but it has pluses and minues depending on your priorities, some of these may seem minor, others may be significant.First off, its a LONG way from FRA, nearly a 20 minute ride. They give you a free shuttle from FRA to the hotel but you have to pay 7 euros to ride back. The return rides don't start till 6AM so if you have an early morning flight from FRA, it can get a little tight. The rooms are clean but small and they charge for internet use. Very tiny elevators, tiny bathroom, and narrow corridors.The restaurant, where we had dinner was very nice; I tried their buffet and they had a wide variety of different hot dishes and many nice tasting salads, soups, etc. The staff at the restaurant were quick, efficient, and very friendly, and I appreciated the great service. The deserts at the dinner buffet were outstanding.I can't really complain about the stay here. It seems out in the middle of nowhere, with a big park in the area, so unless you drive, you're stuck in the hotel for the night. That being said, the hotel worked, was clean, and the price wasn't too high.If I have to stay again near FRA, and I didn't need my Marriott points, I'd probably pick the Holiday Inn North, which offers a free shuttle as well and is just as isolated and quet.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR826335702", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ECL"}, {"Content": "Great Staff My wife and I stayed one night and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel and the restaurant.

If you walk out of the hotel and turn left, you will find a large park, where I saw lots of Turkish families who were picnicking. There is also an Ibis and an Esso station (around a 20 minute walk away) and a couple of German restaurants (which were on side roads).If you turn right out of the hotel, you will walk through a lovely, little forest, which is full of walking, biking and running paths. About a 10-minute walk from the hotel is a Lidl grocery store (not open on Sundays), if you don\u9225\u6a9b want to buy food and drink from the hotel.The breakfast in the morning is excellent, with an amazing assortment of German breads.

Heck, I'd come back to the hotel just for the park!However, the hotel's internet plan was one of the most confusing and expensive charges I have ever encountered. The ISP they use offers several plans but, how and when you can use each plan is poorly communicated. I was 'robbed' of 10 euros because I didn't use my pre-paid time all at once.

It took just over 10mins by taxi with an average fare of 15Euros. If you are attending a tradefair at Messe Frankfurt it is only 5 mins by taxi. There are always taxis at the hotel too. Yes, the hotel is dated, however my room was quite comfortable and QUIET! Bed was huge and comfortable, great to have a balcony with fresh air, decent sized bathroom with bathtub, plenty of wardrobe space too! Good wireless facilities, however can be quite costly, particularly if you will be staying for a number of days....eg, 5euros for 30 mins. I think the internet should be free at this hotel because there really isn't anything else to do apart from work, surf the web or go for a walk around the lake that is next to the hotel..The staff are very friendly and helpful.

Although the staff was friendly and accommodating in every way, the condition of the property is not up to the standards of any other Marriott Courtyard I've experienced. The exterior reminded me of the older buildings found in Communist controlled countries in Eastern Germany. Very drab, dated and dirty. Not sure when the windows or general exterior had last been cleaned.The hotel staff was gracious in upgrading my room. I was disappointed to find worn, stained carpeting. Carpeting was pulling away from the wall. The bedroom was extremely small, without a television remote or a working clock. The bathroom was also very small, with a tiny (about the 2' x 2') shower with a flimsy shower curtain. There was a very small vanity which barley held the soaps and washcloths\u9225\u650fothing more\u9225\u6501s a result, I was forced to dress and shave outside the bath to have enough room. The bathroom door had been kicked or badly nicked at the bottom with no attempt by the hotel to repair this. The upholstery in the room was dated and the curtains were in bad need of cleaning--when moved, they emitted significant amounts of dust and dirt. Although most Courtyard properties offer complimentary internet access service, this property charges for internet. There appears to be sporadic availability of T-mobile in the lobby for those with Hotspot access. I had difficulty with this and was told they were trying to enhance the service but many had similar problems.As mentioned in other reviews, the property is far from central Frankfurt, and on the weekends, required up to a 30 minute wait to catch a bus to the train station and another wait for a train taking nearly one hour to get into the city. Cabs can be had for ~10 Euro. I understand this was formerly a Ramada converted to a Marriott Courtyard. I was never given a clear answer as to whether the hotel had ever been refurbished since Marriott acquired it six (6) years ago. I was also concerned to see that the hotel prints a customer\u9225\u6a9a full credit card number on their check out summary (invoice) along with the credit card\u9225\u6a9a expiration date and card member\u9225\u6a9a full address---a definite concern for those of us who work toward trying to avoid identify theft and misuse of our credit cards.All in all, I would recommend that if you enjoy Marriott properties, stay at the one in Central Frankfurt.
