We stayed in a room facing Balboa Park, on the first floor. The room had a very warm, homey feel. Kind of like staying in the guestroom at your grandmothers house. The bathroom was large, with a jacuzzi tub. it was kind of weird that the mini-fridge, microwave, and other kitchen supplies were in the bathroom, but we got over it. There is a Trader Joe's nearby where you can stock up on microwave-cooked foods. The daily breakfast was nice, they were always very friendly when you called and ordered. Always a great job cleaning the rooms when you're out for the day. The Inn is right across the street from Balboa Park. We jogged through the park every night. We walked to the San Diego Zoo easily. There is also a bus stop right there that goes in Downtown San Diego, convenient way to avoid drinking/driving at night. The parking is sreet parking, and it can be tricky, but I stay in North Jersey a lot so it was really no big deal, just like home. There is always somewhere to park, it just always isn't right in front of your hotel. The staff was great and friendly, they were able to hook us up with a nicer room upon check-in for no extra cost. We originally were going to be in one room for 2 nights, then switch to a smaller room for the remaining nights. They ended up letting us stay in the larger/nicer room for the same price as the smaller room.

The room is decorated in a way that some might find \"over the top,\" but I thought it was very fun! The walls are painted to look like jungle plants and there are exotic animals everywhere. There were even a few Christmas deocrations added here and there, which we thought was a very nice touch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching TV while I took a shower in the huge shower built for two. Didn't get a chance to use the huge bathtub surrounded by flameless candles, but hopefully I will next time. The room was VERY clean and comfortable. I did not smell any mold that previous reviewers ave mentioned. The staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The breakfast was more than enough to get us going for the day. Each day we had an assortment of breakfast breads and pastries including a cinnamon roll, mini muffins, panetone (my new favorite!), croissants, and various other things. My husband also ordered cereal each morning and we both had juice. There is a well-stocked coffee bar in the room as well as a microwave and a fridge. This room is adjacent to a beautiful courtyard where we enjoyed our breakfast the first morning of our stay. It was very quiet. I did hear a little bit of noise from our neighbors above us on the first night of our stay, but nothing that was going to keep me awake. The Inn is walking distance from the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park and an easy drive from Sea World. The only negative things I can say about this property are these: They have no parking lot, so you have to park on the street. Some areas are No Parking at certain times on certain days, so you have to pay attention. There was never any hot water in the bathroom sinks, and it took a little while to get hot water in the shower. The Jungle Nook room is great for couples, but the setup of the bathroom areas wouldn't be good for traveling with friends or relatives as there is little to no privacy. (Not really a negative, just something you should know.) And that's it. Everything else was wonderful and I can't wait to go back again.

Our room was the \"Medley Suite,\" a 2nd floor suite with a living room, bedroom, bath, and sizable full kitchen. Other amenities included free continental breakfast delivered to your room with more than enough pastries for 2 adults and a toddler, coffeemaker and coffee, and cable TV (there may have been internet as well but I didn't use or research it). At $149/night + tax it was a bit more than we usually like to pay, but well worth the money for the location and comfort. The property is located at the corner of Park and Upas, literally a 5-minute (if that) walk to the gates of the San Diego Zoo, the carousel and the miniature railroad. El Prado and the natural history and science museums are about 10 minutes' walk, and a playground for our 2-year-old about 15-20 minutes' walk. We rented a car, and were able to drive no more than 10 miles in different directions to get to East Mission Bay, downtown and the Gaslamp, Sea World, and the ferry to Coronado. The airport rental car agency was literally a 5-minute drive, and the shuttle ride back to SAN took about 3 minutes. All of that meant to say - there is very little reason to stay in any other part of San Diego, especially the overrun, noisy and congested Hotel Circle. Just another 2 minutes southeast and you can stay in a quiet, suburban and slightly upscale neighborhood that is very close to all the things most people go to San Diego for, in some cases closer than you can get by being right off the freeway. In addition, by being on the eastern end of the Hillcrest district, we were close to a vibrant and historic neighborhood with lots of interesting culture, a vibe that appealed to a couple of Portlanders like us, and wonderful restaurants like The Tractor Room. Our first impression in the lobby was that is was friendly and comfortable, but a bit on the over-decorated and tacky side (at least for semi-snobs like us who prefer simplistic modern Scandinavian and Asian decor ;)) The staff was wonderful and unobtrusive - the only times we saw employees was when the sweet housekeeping/service ladies brought us breakfast, and when we checked in! The room itself was comfortable, but again, a bit overly decorated with fake plants, mismatched paintings and sculptures and outdated furniture, pink tiles in the bathroom...it actually reminded me a lot of my grandmother's apartment circa 1975. I can appreciate kitschy/hip, but this was just plain tacky. Again, that is likely not important to most people and ultimately wasn't important to us either. Our room opened on to a deck that led to the sun terrace, a large and comfortable spot for taking in the beautiful San Diego weather. really appreciated the full kitchen, complete with 3/4 size fridge, stovetop, oven, microwave, and all the utensils, dishes, cookware, etc. you would find at home. The cleaning staff was even nice enough to do the dishes for us, including the toddler-friendly utensils, cups and bowls we had brought along from home!", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baldwin City, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Christine R", "ReviewID": "UR118463976", "Content": "We spent 3 nights in this delightful B & B.

However, the breakfast was composed of cereal or vending-machine quality pastries (one donut was still wrapped in plastic as you would find at 7-Eleven). The breakfast was similar to those I\u2019ve had at low-end chain motels. A motel that calls itself a B and B should be embarrassed to serve such low-quality food. We ate the breakfast once; for the remaining days we went out. The sofa bed is VERY uncomfortable.

The location is so peaceful [except on the morning of the Rock & Roll Marathon which goes right by the building at Mile 2, and then the location's just plain fun], and the neighborhood's so tranquil compared to the congestion and stress of the big hotels along the marina. Every room in the Inn is different. We've stayed twice in City Lights, which is on the 2nd floor, has a couch & kitchenette, and very nice view out to the street. We've also stayed in the Jungle Room, which is wild, has a much larger bathroom, and is also memorable, but is on the first floor, opens out onto the center patio and therefore has little natural light if you're going to be hanging out during the day. The breakfast that's provided at the Inn is very tasty -- although could use some fresh fruit. It includes cereal, juice, coffee & assorted pastries, and is brought to your room anytime after 7:30 am, which is also a very nice touch [would be better for the business traveler, however, if it could be available by 7 am]. The inn is actually several 2-story homes/apartment buildings all linked together on the corner across from Balboa Park at the Zoo [expect the bathrooms to be 'vintage' as a result], so it has an especially homey feel. You could live there indefinitely and not feel that you're in a hotel. The room across the hall from City Lights, in fact, has a living room, kitchen and bedroom -- it's a full-on apartment. No matter which room you take, if you have to be in San Diego for business or pleasure, couldn't recommend this B&B more! Parking's free on the street -- although sometimes difficult to find -- and the stay will make you want to stay longer.

So we picked this wonderfully charming hotel to spend a few days together alone. We chose the Balboa Park Inn, mostly because of it close proximity to Balboa Park and one of our favorite restaurants The Prado. We checked out a few of the other themed rooms the Inn had to offer, each had its own unique flavor and exquisite furnishings. We were impressed by their attention to details and after much deliberations we settled on their very best room the Tara Suite. The suite was very spacious, beautifully & uniquely decorated, the furnishings were even more impressive starting with a fancy gold silk down filled Sherrill sofa to relax on, a wonderful Empire style Century Furniture dresser for our clothes with the matching desk, a beautiful Theodore Alexander accent chair with the matching console...no cheap particle wood hotel furnishings here. The entire suite was impressive to say the least. As you continue through to the rear of the suite you are surrounded by the romantic aroma of scented candles all around you (all electric and remote controlled). In the corner is a large bar with all the kitchen amenities discreetly tucked behind it, a microwave, coffee pot and wine glasses. But the best part about this suite is the oversized jacuzzi and European style bathroom all so cleaned it looked brand new as if we were the first to use them. The bathroom was unique in that it had no door! Just a simple wall defining the private space. There were two showers next to the jacuzzi one was a big rain shower head which was great to use. The room was so nice we spent more time inside than out. The service was outstanding. The staff is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and helpful at any hour.

I wouldn't recommend this room for anyone that likes spaciousness or have lots of bags. The bathroom on the other hand is HUGE, it's about 1/2 the size of the bedroom! It's got a jacuzzi with bubble oil supplied. The room is well equipped with: dishes, bowls, utensils, fridge, coffee maker, coffee, tea, ironing board + iron and hairdryer.

The croissant and mini muffins were the best, so try getting extras. Conveniently located next to the zoo and close to Balboa park. In fact, it's probably a 10 minute walk to the zoo if you don't want to drive and find parking. Balboa park is also very close by and a must-see.

I found the furniture and decor (including ample bouquets of artificial flowers) pretty tacky/kitschy, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and in any case this did not put me off the hotel, which was very clean, comfortable and homey. Fair warning, though \u2013 if you\u2019re a traveler who enjoys the sleek monotony of a corporate chain hotel, if you\u2019re a design guru, or if you consider tastefulness to be next to Godliness, this probably isn\u2019t the hotel for you.

We were able to enjoy San Diego\u2019s famous climate by keeping the windows open at all times and we slept soundly in quiet comfort. It appears that each suite has a different configuration, so those wanting a large, luxurious bathroom should choose a different suite, but the layout and amenities were fine for the two of us. A hair dryer, iron, ironing board and all such necessities were provided. I was particularly impressed with how well-stocked the kitchen was, with a full range of Kitchenaid pots, pans and utensils, in addition to the dishes, coffee maker, fridge, range, microwave, etc. It felt like we were staying not in a hotel but in someone\u2019s small and old but well-maintained apartment. This feeling is amplified by the fact that the hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood and not the bustling downtown. The location means you can\u2019t just step out of your hotel room and have your choice of restaurants and shops within blocks, but if you enjoy walking it\u2019s a reasonable and pleasant walk to the Hillcrest area which is full of options for eating and shopping. I enjoyed walking past the charming little bungalows and cottages of all different styles that make up the neighborhood. You couldn\u2019t be closer to the zoo, and it\u2019s an easy walk further into Balboa Park.

Everything was immaculately clean (the shade in the bedroom didn't always rise, no big deal). Yes the decor is a bit kitschy, with ample silk flower arrangements, but that's part of the charm. A plus is the ceiling fan in every room, for a bit of cooling when the air conditioner is too much. This year it seemed the breakfast was a bit smaller than last time (no fresh fruit) but at the end of the week I noticed I could have ordered both cereal and pastry instead of just one or the other. That plus juice was more than I needed and even provided a treat for a snack later in the day. The biggest delight was the price- even including cab fare to downtown it was still cheaper than the downtown boxy hotels. (The bus is even cheaper.) Plus, free breakfast and plenty of coffee, tea and cocoa mean trips to the local coffee shop are unnecessary. The location is perfect- between Balboa Park and Hillcrest, an interesting neighborhood with great ethnic restaurants at much lower price than downtown.

We spent three nights in the Beach House room, which was relatively secluded and devoid of outside noise. Getting to the Beach House required a walk through a narrow \"canyon\" between two buildings whose sides are heavily covered with undisguised pipes (for water, gas, etc.). The path continued through a narrow, cluttered courtyard. We noticed that some of the planters still had price stickers still on them. The Beach House room door had frosted glass inserts that were worn in places, potentially enabling outsiders to look all around the room. We tore off pieces of paper and stuck them in the window frames for greater privacy. The room itself was decorated in a mostly tropical theme and there was a mural on one wall. The room also contained a small LCD TV (we could not get any of the HD channels), three fake trees (the one by the bed looked like it was made from an old Christmas tree), an air purifier, and a mini-fridge. Both appliances made a noticeable hum that eventually became distracting. The window fan/heater/AC unit was very noisy and the controls were hard to reach. There are mini-blinds and curtains on the windows. The blinds and sheers close but the opaque curtains do not. That could be a problem for folks who require greater darkness for sleep. There is abundant light for reading, but the two wicker chaise lounges have slippery cushions on them. As for cleanliness, the room was immaculate except for a silverfish crawling across the bedspread (ugh!), some well-worn brochures on the bureau, and a sponge left on the bathroom floor. Speaking of the bathroom, it is spacious, contains lots of mirrors and plush towels, and features a jacuzzi with a mirrored, faux-candle-lit surround. Directions for the jacuzzi are too brief and confusing to be helpful. (A desk clerk was unable to decipher them.) The shower stall is roomy but hot water can be slow in coming. The amenities include body lotion that smells very strongly of peppermint. There are dozens of gaudy, artsys-craftsy fish hanging from the ceiling. We thought they might look cute in a child's room.

I asked Ed does he have a special security system to protect his magnificent pieces and he assures me that people that stay at the hotel are gracious and respectful.. although I know he would know in 2 seconds if anything went missing!

This is an excellent place. The room was a good size, bed was comfortable and all the staff were friendly and helpful. In fact the cleaner even found a necklace which we had left in our room on check out. The hotel provides some nice touches like daily newspaper delivered to your room. I have struggled to find anything negative to mention. However I've come up with some advice should you consider staying here. - Breakfast - Breakfast is a choice of either cereals or croissants and buns. Both options come with fresh fruit. The croissants and buns are particular good, highly recommended. It is nice that they will deliver the breakfast to your room or outside terrace. However after about 3 or 4 days the options do become a bit repetitive. - Water pressure - The water pressure in the shower wasn't as powerful as ideally I would have liked. Although I'm sure this is outside of the hotel's control. - Location - The hotel location is good, but possibly not for everyone. If you don't drive (I don't) please consider the following. I considered the hotel to be in good safe neighbourhood and I felt safe when walking around the area at all times of day or night. It appears to be quite a residential area. The hotel is a 90 second walk to a bus stop for route 7 which runs into downtown. The bus service runs quite frequently about every 12 minutes in the day, and about every 20 minutes in the evening. It takes about 10 minutes to City College where you can transfer on to the San Diego trolley. The hotel is about 10 minute walk south to San Diego Zoo, Rose Garden and a few more minutes to attractions like the model railway museum. 10 minutes walk north of the hotel on to university avenue is Starbucks, 7 11, other restaurants and bars. From university avenue you can catch bus 10 to old town. - Flowers - The flowers in the room are artificial. Not a problem, but might be worth noting. - Pizza delivery - Like a lot of places Balboa Park Inn provides some local information leaflets in the room. One was for the Broadway Pizza delivery service. We decided to use this one night. I have never tasted such a terrible pizza. Obviously this isn't the hotel fault, but I wouldn't recommend ordering from Broadway Pizza during your stay. - Overall - Overall Balboa Park is an excellent choice at a very fair price. I would certainly recommend it and would definitely stay there again. The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hotel is a 10 minutes walk from shops, restaurants and bars. But I was aware of this when booking, so this wasn't really a problem.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWe Love The Balboa Park Inn!!!\u201d", "Author": "MEKWisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR16356546", "Content": "We have just returned from our fourth visit and will most definitely stay here again.

It was a good size for us. It was essentially a very small apartment with a full kitchen (minus dishwasher), small dining room table, bedroom, and living room area. There was a tiny outdoor area too. Not really a deck, but sort of an enclosure. My son enjoyed running his trains and cars out there and I didn't have to worry about him because it's fenced from the street. PROS: --Close to everything. We rented a car and our longest drive was 12 minutes to Coronado. Balboa Park, Old Town, downtown, and the charming Hillcrest neighborhood were all very close. If I didn't have a small child, I wouldn't have rented a car at all. THe public transport there is great. --Very accommodating staff.. There were a few things missing from the kitchen (knife, pancake turner, hot pads) and they delivered them to the room one at a time, as I discovered what I needed. They gave me lots of recommendations and directions to places and were very friendly. And they were willing to let me have housekeeping every other day, instead of every day. I don't like to waste the water it takes to change all the bedding and towels every day (which I would never do in my own home!) and because I feel compelled to tidy up for the cleaning staff, it's less work for me if I don't have to worry about them coming in every day. --Inexpensive. It's hard to find a 1-bedroom with a full kitchen anywhere else in San Diego for under $200. Having a kitchen saves a lot of money too. We ate many breakfasts and dinners in the room, paying only to eat out for lunch while we were sightseeing. --Clean. The place was kept quite clean. --Easy and free parking. In a week, we only had two times we had a hard time finding a parking space on Upas St. Once, on Earth Day, when 60,000 people came to Balboa Park and took up a LOT of parking spaces! And the other on a day when we came back to the room at about 3 pm and there were cars lining the street with parents in them, waiting to pick up their kids from the middle school across the street. In both cases, we drove around the block 3 or 4 times and finally found a space in front of the inn. Not really a big deal. I must say that San Diego in general is a nirvana of free parking. I come from Seattle, land of expensive pay parking, so it was amazing to me that there was lots of free parking at Balboa Park, the zoo, Old Town, Coronado beaches. We never once paid for parking. Try that when you go to Seattle Center or Pike Place Market! CONS: --The rooms in the California Suite were very small. The bedroom pretty much only had room for the bed and night stands. I had a pack-and-play in there and it was wedged between the bed and wall and you couldn't walk around it. The dining area was also cramped and I think it would be difficult to seat 4 people there. The kitchen had very little prep room. For the price, we didn't mind, but if you had more than 3 people, it would probably be too cramped. --The smell of the cleaning solutions they use were pretty overpowering, as several people have pointed out. I opened all the windows and the door to air it out the night we got there and by morning, it was better. The fabulous thing though is that all I had to do was mention it to the front desk and they arranged for the cleaners not to use anything smelly while I was there. Problem solved easily and painlessly. --Noise in our room. Our room was at the bottom of the staircase, right next to the main door for our building, so we heard every guest come in (slam!) and leave (slam!) and haul their luggage up and down the steps (bump, bump, bump). Fortunately, when we had the bedroom door shut, we couldn't hear it. Mostly we just heard it while we were up and around. But if you have a baby who needs to nap during the day, it's something to think about. Overall, we had a great time and I plan to go back to the Balboa Park Inn as soon as I can afford it.

I haven't found a hotel room for $99 in several years so I was expecting \"very average\". What a pleasant surprise! The hotel room reminded me of what you WISH you'd find on the Left Bank in Paris, only this one was perfect! It wasn't huge, but comfortably held a queen size canopy bed with white lace topper (very comfortable), a huge chaise lounge (to die for), some decorative pieces and a built in holding a small refrigerator with a microwave and coffee maker on top. The room was well supplied with up do date travel brochures and information on local restaurants. Great ambiance and charm. Predominate dark green, brown and white make the room cheerful and bright and extremely inviting. I appreciated the lighting, often a neglected item. This room contained a floor lamp, a wonderful reading lamp next to the chaise and two bedside wall lamps with decorative shades. The room wasn't fancy...no marble tubs... but I give it 10+ for the charm, cleanliness and comfort factors. Staff were very nice when I made the reservation, explaining the different rooms, pros and cons. When we were arrived everything was in order; I was asked if I needed a hairdryer, iron or anything and they were brought to our room immediately. Breakfast was simple but plentiful...fresh fruit, juice, cereal, assorted muffins and pastries...excellent hot tea and coffee. We simply called and it was brought to our room within five minutes. We additional had the choice of eating in the lovely courtyard, but I really didn't want to leave the room. Since I live only two hours north, I stay in San Diego several times a year for various reasons. I have always stayed downtown so that I could have a view of the water. Having stayed at the Balboa Park Inn, I'll be forgoing the water view for this cozy get away. For those who don't know San Diego well, this is an excellent location if you have access to a car. Parking is free on the street. You can walk across the street to the zoo if you're with kids...or if you're a big kid. You have easy access to the marvelous museums in Balboa Park, as well as being conveniently located to anywhere else you'd want to go in San Diego. The price for value is amazing; it's a great place for a family to stay. Warning: If you like chain, cookie cutter hotels, this is not the place for you.

Here is my take on the following: LOCATION- very good especially if you want easy access to the zoo and other downtown attractions. But note, they don\u2019t have a parking lot so be prepared to be circling around the block to look for street parking. ROOMS and VALUE - depends on the room. Pay attention on which one you get because some of the d\u00e9cor is downright tacky. And all rooms are very old. The Monet\u2019s room is decent and clean and for $149 per night is a good value. The Greystoke room is good for those that want that \u201czoo\u201d feeling but for $219 per night isn\u2018t worth it unless you love, love, love, stuffed lions! And the Greystoke room is awful, do not pick this room, it is super tacky with a mix match of repainted furniture and odd scary looking fake plants. Service - Not sure because we hardly had any interface with the front desk folks. They seem nice enough. Breakfast - It\u2019s just pastries and juice, not much to comment on.

The staff was friendly and brought us an iron and ironing board with a tasty pastry and fruit breakfast in the morning. They let us check in a little early as well, which was very nice of them. I had the same problem as a previous reviewer-- the heat was on full blast when we first arrived. That wasn't too difficult to take care of, though. The buildings seem like very old apartments. All the floors creak and I can imagine that anyone staying below us would have heard every step we took on those old floors. The paint was peeling, the carpet seemed very old. It wasn't a bad place, just old and probably shouldn't be ranked #3. If you need to be close to the zoo and are only planning on doing the zoo and the museum, then this is a fair place.

Early Saturday morning I called and asked the folks at Balboa Park Inn if they would be kind enough to let us cancel the first 3 nights of our 4 night stay (spent the rest of the trip in Anaheim) - something they didn't have to do based on their cancellation policy. They understood and let us cancel. Although I was unhappy with the airlines, it was a little easier to swallow knowing that the Inn was flexable.

First, It was spotlessly clean, our number one requirement, and we weren't bothered at all by the housecleaning scent (rather assured by it, actually, but if you have allergies to scented cleaners/disinfectants, you may want to stay somewhere else). Also, the price is incredible, I really could not believe we were staying somewhere so great for so cheap. Every other decent place in town for a suite was at least $210 a night. Even though each room in the Inn was booked, it was incredibly quiet and peaceful. It was like having our own apartment, we settled right in. Our 4 yr old loved having her own fold out bed in the livingroom, and there was enough space next to it for our toddler's pack n play (we brought it with us, but the Inn offered a crib for $10 if we had needed it). The livingroom TV had lots of channels and great reception, but there is no TV in the bedroom, so if you plan to relax in that room after putting your kids to bed in the livingroom, you'll want to bring a portable DVD (that's what we did). The breakfast is delivered right to your door whenever you want it in the morning, and it was plenty of food to get us started for our day at the zoo (and for just 2 paid adults, there was plenty to share with our kids, so don't pay for an extra breakfast for little ones). People here that have complained about the quality of the breakfast fare must be very hard to please, as we found it to be perfectly fine. It isn't gourmet, just some cut fruits, juice, and store-bought pastries, but heck, it's tasty and filling and you don't have to leave your room! As everybody else has noted, the walk to the zoo is quick and it is a lovely and safe neighborhood. Both days we came back to the suite and let our kids nap, it was SO quiet, we never even heard housekeeping. Never had a problem finding parking, even though we walked to most places, so didn't have to re-park very often. In addition to the zoo, there are other family things to do within walking distance: Balboa Park museums, a carousel, train ride, and Morley Field, which has a playground and tons of running around space. Great restaurants in this area too: Cafe on Park was recommended by the Inn, and it was great, they love kids there!

The themed decoration was neat though and helped make up for what it lacked in size. The smoke-tinted mirror over the bed was fun but took some getting used to. The bathroom was ok with an older tile lshower, standard single sink, and a tub. They did leave a lovely candelabrum near the tub, filled with new taper candles and a book of matches. That was a nice touch. The toilet was in a separate room, which was all black, which also took some getting used to (even a black toilet!).

The Inn is really easy to find, as it is literally right across the street from the Zoo and Balboa Park, so you can pretty much follow signs from just about anywhere and get there with no trouble. It only took us about 15 mintues from the airport in our rental car. It is also close to downtown. We didn't really venture around the nearby neighborhoods, but on the way there, we saw lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops, so I'm sure there are lots of them around. Check in was easy and despite what some of the reviews here say, we did have help from the staff lugging our bags up to the room. We stayed in the Monet Suite and it was very nice and much bigger than we had anticipated. It was literally like having your own apartment. There was a nice livingroom with a comfy couch, two chairs, a table, tv with dvd player and a nice fake fireplace. It felt very homy and comfortable. The bathroom had fairly new fixtures and was very clean, however the plumbing was really noisy sometimes...but, not enough to be a nuisance. The bedroom was plenty big and had a really comfy bed, dresser w/mirror, a tv, two nightstands with lamps and a closet that fit our big suitcase on a stand. The kitchen was bigger than we imaged as well. it had a table with two chairs, utensils, glasses and plates, a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and large refrigerator. They supply plenty of coffee (regular and decaf), sugar, creamer and hot chocolate. We also had a deck that we shared with another unit, that was nice to eat breakfast on in the morning. Others mentioned the plastic flowers outside and some said that they found them tacky and silly, but to be honest....they mix these flowers with real ones, plus there are lots of trees and such on the decks and patios as well. I didn't really even notice them, to be honest. I don't think I would have even realized that they were plastic, had I not read it on Trip Advisor ahead of time. The breakfasts were nothing special, but they were enough to tide us over for a little while. You got fresh fruit and juice and a choice of cereal or pastries. Like others have said, the rooms are exceptionally clean. We asked directions and suggestions from Robbi at the front desk and she was very, very helpful and friendly. Our room was fairly quiet, the rooms aren't soundproofed well, but we didn't find it to be a problem at all. The only suggestion that I would have for the folks at the Balboa Park Inn would be to put irons and ironing boards in the rooms. It would make things much easier on the guests!! :-) I know that other guests mentioned a cleaning smell of some kind, but I didn't really notice it and I have allergies and asthma, so it must not be all that bad. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It is clean, fun and much more room than you'd get at a chain hotel for twice as much money. If you're looking for cookie cutter, boring hotel room then I would avoid the Balboa Park Inn, but if you're looking for a clean, friendly, cozy place with character.....definitely stay here!!", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Atomictoms", "ReviewID": "UR5762595", "Content": "We stayed three nights in the Mayfair suite, with two adults and one 17 year old.

My only regret is that they won't rent jacuzzi tub rooms to people with children due to insurance issues, so that limits selection greatly. Some type of liability waiver would be great, as I was dissapointed in missing out on the Jungle Room! (Also, a small pool would have been greatly appreciated in the heat!)

If you go stay here expecting the full American B&B treatment, then you will be disappointed. We paid $99 dollars a night for the Aruba room for two nights, and for San Diego that's cheap even by motel standards. Considering what we paid, we thought this place was fantastic! Location wise, this place is just a few minutes stroll from the entrance to San Diego Zoo (best zoo in the world in my opinion), and a short drive from Hillcrest and other sites...it's also close enough to the freeway to get to Seaworld easily. The room itself was small but came with a huge bathroom with a great jetted tub, and an outside table to enjoy the motel's enclosed and secluded courtyard. Breakfast was simple, but served to our door each morning at the time we specified. We thought the 'aquatic' theme in the room (cuddly toy fishes dangling on strings from the ceiling!?), and the colourful courtyard were both really fun! And most importantly, everything was totally clean. Okay, so some of the flowers in the courtyard are plastic, and the room themes are a little over the top...but we thought this just added to the fun of the place...it doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes for a great place to just relax. The owners have obviously gone to a lot of effort...it's just that it might not be to everyone's taste. I'd definitely recommend this as a great place to stay, provided that over-the-top room themes make you laugh rather than cringe. And one final thing...we were recommended a local diner by the lady at the front desk, and I had possibly the best burger ever there...it's called Brian's and it's just a few blocks from the Inn.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent time at the Balboa Park Inn\u201d", "Author": "matt1978matt", "ReviewID": "UR5512369", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Balboa Park Inn while we were in San Diego for the Comic Con, and we had an excellent stay.

There is a giant stuffed leopard opposite the bed under a huge painting of a naked man with a big snake. To make this even worse,the room smelled horribly of disinfectant cleaner and some king of air freshener. It was unbearable. We decided we just couldn't stay there, and went to complain only to find out that someone had smoked in that room the night before and they were trying to cover the smell. They changed us to another room immediately. The next room was all pink and peach floral, basically your standard frou frou bed and breakfast room circa 1980, but with mirrors every wear, I mean every where, and spotlights on the bed. It didn't smell nearly as bad, just a hint of yucky air freshener. To top this all off, the flowers inside and outside are fake.

Balboa Park ended up being a big highlight to our trip to San Diego, and it was great being beside it. We stayed in City Lights, which is a bargain for $99/night. Housekeeping lugged our heavy suitcases up the stairs to our room- those girls are strong! We really liked the room - it was very clean and spacious. The amenities are nice - with tea, hot chocolate, and coffee and all the fixings in the room. There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room, which was great for heating up leftovers, which saved us money. The breakfast is nice. They brought it within 10 minutes of calling every morning. Great service. We did have some plumbing problems in our bathroom. The toilet was having tons of problems, and we ended up getting upgraded free of charge to The Courtyard Suite for the last night of our stay. This suite was so incredibly eclectic! It was crazy with tons of mix-matched pieces of decor, but we liked it. The huge jacuzzi tub was awesome. I don't think I'd pay $169/night for the room though. The smaller City Lights room was just fine. I have to say the beds in both rooms were the best! I liked them just as much as Westin's heavenly beds, which says a lot. If you need to have internet access, good luck. We were able to tap into a free, public wireless connection when we were in the City Lights room but not in the Courtyard Suite. The person at the front desk couldn't help us. My husband ended up sitting on the step outside the building where City Lights is and accessing wireless that way. The hotel should consider offering internet service. Parking was free on the street and if you can parallel park, you'll be fine. We didin't have any troubles finding spots within a block of the hotel.

When our other hotel couldn't accommodate the last day of our stay, I chose this hotel because of it's #1 ranking on the Trip Advisor website, but I was somewhat disappointed with it overall. (We probably had been spoiled by having such a nice suite at the Glorietta Bay Hotel in Coronado - for not much more than the $189/night that we paid for this room). While the staff was nice enough at check in, I thought it was kind of strange that if you wanted to have a hair dryer, iron or ironing board, they 'lent' them to you upon check-in and asked that you take them to your room (were they afraid you might steal them, or could they not afford to provide one in each room? What's next the coffeemaker?) Overall the buildings and our room in particular left a lot to be desired. This hotel is made up of several older homes. The bougainvillea climbing flowers were beautiful in the courtyards, but our room was on the second floor in a building down the street. We were all tired after a long day of sightseeing and weren't impressed when we unexpectedly had to lug all of our suitcases up the carpeted steps by ourselves. The room was awkwardly laid out with a bedroom in what would have been a dining room and a sofa bed in the kitchen. While everything seemed to be clean, the room was hot and muggy. Fortunately, there was a security screen door off the public bedroom (i.e., dining room) that we could lock, but leave open to help the place cool off while we were at dinner. Note, there are no restaurants nearby this hotel, so you must drive to another area to get something to eat. The beds and bathroom were fine, but not as nice as we had hoped for from a #1 ranked hotel. In the morning, I got a little frustrated because we couldn't use the coffee maker and the microwave oven (I like hot milk with my coffee) at the same time without tripping the circuit breaker. We had no problem calling down for breakfast and it was nice that they delivered it to our room. Breakfast was ample and delicious (we opted for fruit cup and pastries), but we thought that since our \"family sized\" room rented for four people and we had 3 adults and a child, they should have given us 4 breakfasts, not just three (it's not like they gave us a discount because we had a child and only 3 adults). We ate outside on the large upstairs deck and enjoyed the beautiful San Diego weather. While there were plenty of chairs, the deck was a bit run down and could use some attention. And, seeing the rats nest of electrical wires that were overhead and going into the buildings, I could understand why the breakers kept tripping. Upon check-out, after multiple trips up and down the stairs to get all our suitcases back to our rental and returning the hair dryer to the front desk, the desk clerk said he wasn't surprised by our microwave/coffee pot electrical problem, stating that these old homes were built in the 1930's and all had a lot of wiring issues.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOne of a kind!\u201d", "Author": "Admin", "ReviewID": "UR5326197", "Content": "I was so glad we made the decision to stay at this wonderful place in San Diego on our recent visit!
