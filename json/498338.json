No privacy what so ever. The breakfast cost \u00a310.98 and was litterly cornflakes or weetabix, coffee or tea. And there were no tables left to sit at so I had to eat it in my room. I had an interview the next morning and the hotel lent me an iron but did not have an ironing board in the whole of the hotel. The heat in my room at night was scorching even with the window wide open. I only got 3 hours sleep. There was constant noise all night. The bathroom door locked itself when you closed the door. The bathroom fan had an unbearable screech to it. The TV didnt tune in and was from the 1970s. The cups for the coffee in the room were plastic cartons. The staff were utterly useless and seemed resigned to the fact that customers would complain. The owners are lazy, greedy, charlatans, god help them if I ever met them.

The room is incredibly small, little bigger then the bed itself. The smell in the room was unbelievable, it wasn't possible to sleep because of the smell. The curtains were horrible and dirty, the furniture was broken, dust everywhere, holes in the wall. No housekeeping or cleaning for 3 days, the personnel in the reception was unpleasant and mute. This hotel made my trip a nightmare, please go to a youth hostel if you want something cheap, but never ever in this hotel.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Olympia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d498338-Reviews-Hotel_Olympia-London_England.html", "Price": "$89 - $475*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">49 Earl's Court Square</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW5 9BY</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "498338", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/92/d9/92d93ba720a614c5b9b1be8cf32520744large.jpg"}}
