The indoor garage is $8.00 per day which you would need as parking on the street is very difficult as most areas are permitted or metered. The continental breakfast was just OK, no waffle maker, no yogurt (although they had bananas and apples), no eggs of any sort, had oatmeal and bagels and danish and cereal and juice. I like Starbucks coffee and even though there was a Starbucks on the corner I didnt go there as the coffee was fine. Breakfast bar opened at 6:30 AM promptly. As I said my rates were very reasonable (used the Entertainment Book discount) and accordingly my room was small but sufficient for only myself. Had to unglog the refrigerator as it was quite noisy - also a microwave in room. I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room free of charge. The internet was a little slow but free. There was no suitcase rack in the room when I arrived but one was delivered promptly. I would recommend a room on the upper level rather than on the main level. My room led out to a courtyard in the back of the hotel with a gate perhaps four feet high leading to the courtyard (no access to the courtyard). The courtyard was protected with barbed wire but I didn't feel comfortable leaving the sliding door open during the night which was the only source of outdoor ventilation. The bathroom area was small but nice and shower was newly tiled. The desk personnel were friendly and helpful and allowed for a late check out on departure day. Didnt use the outdoor pool (was there in the second week of December, 2011) but ate a midnight snack from In/Out Burger (which is next door (had to try it as there are none of those on the east coast) - 24 hr IHOP is across the street as well as a 7/11 - saw an altercation while taking a walk with a security guard from 7/11 and someone who must have tried to help himself without paying for his items) in the pool area. The outdoor pool area was well kept and attractive. About 3 blocks east is on Sunset Blvd is a guitar center that has a walk of fame in front of the building with many famous bands and singers - worth the walk.

Instead, the large window quite bizarrely looked out onto hallway, almost as if the external walls of the hotel are a new addition. The whole arrangement seems rather pointless, as few people will be happy to be in full view of passers-by. However, we just shut the curtains and didn't let it bother us. Other than that, the hotel is generally comfortable, with a large and sunny pool. Breakfast is acceptable, although the use of paper plates and plastic forks is an American custom I can't get used to.

There is a complimentary breakfast of cerial and fresh Bagels and Toast and Cereal and Fruit and of course Juice and Tea and Coffee; it was fresh and plentiful and most pleasant. Seating can be difficult at peak times but a short wait is no real problem The rooms are large enough and the Bed is extremely comfortable. It's location for Central LA for the Chinese Theate and Kodak Theatree couldn't be better really and local convenience shops and Dining makes it well located too. There is an ice dispenser [free] by the pool and also reasonably priced canned drinks machine and a snack dispenser -also reasonably priced. The price to stay is reasonable for LA. A Few Negatives you need to be aware of before you book [so you can make a proper value judgement]: If you are going to stay, a room to the back of the Hotel is better as Sunset Boulevard can and often is 'traffic noisy' at night. The room we had, on the top floor overlooking the pool, had an unpleasant smell to it -a bit 'old peoples home' smell, if that is not too politically incorrect. The shower was useles in terms of delivering Hot Water. We did complain and the Maintenance man attended swiftly but ran thre shower a while and said '..there you go...' -when I tested it with my hand I advised him it was no different, to which his response was '...let it run a while...'. You could run the shower for an hour and it would never get any warmer and it was nothing to do with peak demand -it was like that at all times BUT plenty hot water at the basin. As a water engineer, I can only assume they have Temperature limiters fitted to the showers for some obscure reason and they are set at 38 degrees to 40 degrees max and that is way too cool for a shower. This is assumed to be common to all rooms I guess. The walls are either stud or light block because there is no sound deadening between rooms so you hear the conversation next door [also the snooring] As this Hotel [rightly] does not allow smoking in it's room, smokers go out on the balcony and if they chat whilst out there and it is next to your room you WILL NOT SLEEP if this is late, although Reception do take swift action if you call them and ask them to have a quiet word. The pool is dirty in the base and on that basis, I personally would not use it. Finally if you ask reception to organise you a cab to the airport MAKE IT CLEAR you want a licenced Yellow Cab or they will order you what is losely described as limo service -a bit nicer than a cab but about $15 extra - worth knowing For me the Negatives out weighed the Positives and I would not recommend this Hotel to my friends BUT it is clean and convenient so you need to make your own vlaue judgment.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, but mediocre hotel\u201d", "Author": "HWZJH", "ReviewID": "UR83729384", "Content": "The location was awesome, one block away from many attractions, but the hotel was very basic.

I offered to change my reservation to a later date, and they refused. I also had a reservation in another town with Comfort Inn & Suites and they were very accommodating of my cancellation request. As was Southwest Airlines and Dollar Rent a Car. Those companies were fantastic, but NOT Days Inn. Why would anyone consider booking at a hotel chain who will not cancel & refund or even change a reservation with plenty of advance notice? They are in the travel industry for heaven's sake, where unforeseen delays or changes occur quite often. They had enough notice to rebook the room. It wasn't like we gave them last minute notice or used the room. What an insane customer service policy for a company which relies on future customer bookings, repeat business and customer word of mouth. Myself and my employees travel very frequently throughout the western US. I'm very easy going, and don't expect much from a hotel except a clean place to sleep. I don't complain about things, I run a business and I know problems happen, and a company can only do their best to make things right. But you don't shaft a potential customer because they couldn't make it to your door. If these clowns ran a restaurant, they'd be charging you for meals you didn't eat because you called and changed or canceled your dinner reservation. By grabbing a few dollars now, this company has permanently lost a potential repeat customer and any future dollars they could have earned off of me or my company. How stupid is that? Especially after I even gave them the option of holding my funds as a credit toward a future stay. I have already re-booked my trip, and I will definitely use Southwest Airlines, Comfort Inn & Suites and Dollar Rent a Car, but I guarantee I will never book or stay at another Days Inn. Ever. And I will make damn sure I comment to everyone I meet who is traveling or considering a trip to stay away from the Days Inn chain of hotels. By the way, Days Inn is part of the Wyndham chain (Ramada, Travelodge, Super 8, Howard Johnson) If they treat customers this crappy before you get in their door, imagine how poorly they treat you during your stay. There are plenty of other hotel chains to consider besides this group of companies, I suggest you use one of the many others out there, and avoid this bunch.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Great location\u201d", "Author": "skrsToronto", "ReviewID": "UR53799818", "Content": "Location was amazing.

Fair enough they run a hotel and i can understand them selling the room before i had a chance to book it again... no big deal.

I got there and told her that i thouht we had to be out by 12 at the latest. She took a very judgemental tone and started saying she wanted us out right away. I said this wasnt possible and she started to say she would charge us. I told her about the staff member from the night before and she said she would sack him. By this point i lost my rag with her and suggested she was a misserable person who was not happy with her job and she proceeded to threated me with the police.

Everything may not be five star but all the minimum requirements were there and they all worked. The lobby is clean and decent, the receptionist was friendly and helpful when we asked for: hot water, spoon and forks, a cart for our luggage during different times of the day.

(it's obvious) There is an In and Out Burger and a great shoe outlet store right nearby. You can walk to Hollywood Walk of Fame and we did that.

I generally stay in 2 and 3 star hotels, so my expectations are not that high. But this has got to be the worst hotel I've ever been in. While the location can't be beat, I would recommend you stay somewhere a little further away for cheaper and use the money you've saved to pay for parking or taxis. You'll have a better experience, trust me. First of all, the place is aged and falling apart. The lobby and outside appear to be in order, but the room itself was ridiculous. Peeling and worn wallpaper, huge hole in the carpet, large holes where pictures have been moved/removed, discolored ceiling, and a terrible smell are what greeted me when I walked in the door. Then, while trying to use the shower, my husband nearly scalded himself because the temperature control takes a full 2 minutes to respond to any changes. Now, I'm a pretty intelligent person, but I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out how to use a shower. The drain in the shower was also slow and I was disgusted at what I had to stand in. The a/c originally appeared to not be working and when I brought this up to Juliana, a member of the front desk staff, she snottily asked me, \"Did you press the mode button?\" Like I worked for Carrier and automatically knew that was what you were supposed to do, especially since there were absolutely no instructions and the a/c in every other hotel in the world has an on/off button and temperature controls and that's all you need to know. This girl had someone come to my room to get the a/c to work, but it took him 10 minutes to figure it out. So if it takes a member of the staff 10 minutes to get it to work, why I should I be expected to do it at all? Then, when I brought up the matter of the shower temperature, she didn't actually address me but turned to the other girl at the desk and said, \"That shower works, right?\" I couldn't believe it...this girl actually just called me a liar. I replied that no, it wasn't, because I just told her it wasn't, and the matter regarding the shower was dropped and never taken care of. I brought my grievances up to a different front desk clerk the next morning and asked to speak to the manager, but apparently he doesn't feel it necessary to work on weekends, when hotels are the busiest. As a matter of fact, there wasn't a maintenance person working either which leads me to believe that the management at this hotel is amateurish at best. I have reported my experiences with Days Inn and have put a call in to the hotel manager but have not received a response as of this time.

I stayed over a weekend. Here are my impressions: 1.Location On a commercial section of Sunset Blvd. Several blocks away from the hip clubs and restaurants (ie the Whiskey a Go-Go). Within one block of a 7-Eleven, Starbucks, Burger King. Across the street from an I-Hop and next to an In and Out Burger. A gentleman's club is 2 blocks away for those so inclined. 2.Parking Available, indoors (not used by me) 3.Check-in Smooth, efficient, accurate. No issues. 4.Room Small to medium. Somewhat \"worn\", a few stains on the carpet and drapes, wood was chipped. Quiet enough, but walls were thin. Bed was comfortable, desk in room. TV was modern with HBO and 24 hour news. Air conditioner quiet (modern thermostat). Bathroom had older fixtures, but worked ok (hot water a little slow). Plenty of towels. Refrigerator, coffee maker, iron/board and safe were in the room and free. No mini-bar. Free wireless internet (not used by me). 5.Safety Deadbolt lock, electronic room key, key needed to go up in elevator, no easy access to room from street. Hotel guard in lobby at night. Smoke detectors in room, no sprinkler seen by me. Fire exits marked and easily accessible. 6.Lobby Nice lobby, with sitting area. Convenient to see when my family pulled up out front. 7.Pool Yes, and seemed in good shape (not used by me) 8.Free Breakfast Yes, fruit, cereal, bagels. A cut above the usual. 9. Other Guests Mostly young couples and young families 9.Miscellaneous Tips- I called the day before and booked a second floor room overlooking the pool. Quieter at night, and an excellent balcony with two chairs on to relax. Don't confuse this hotel with the other Days Inn in Hollywood (which the reviews on Trip Advisor have not been so positive). 10. Biggest complaint- Slow elevator. 11. Would I stay there again? Definitely, when visiting my brother.

The neighborhood has a few strip clubs, and I noticed a few unsavory characters walking around at night, but no one bothered me.
