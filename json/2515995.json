This wasn't our initial hotel, our initial hotel was under going renovations, so we were offered this hotel instead. Checked out some reviews on here before we went and there were a bit negative, which didn't instill me with confidence. However, the hotel was fine. The staff were great, the hotel was clean and the rooms were just as good. The hotel is located about a five minute walk from Union Square and there is a cable car stop just round the corner from it, and I mean just round the corner, about a minutes walk. This stop is the end of the line so you get to see them turn the cable cars around ready to set off in the opposite direction. As a result you have a better chance of getting a standing space on the front of the car, as these go straight away so if your getting on at a later stop all of the standing spaces will be gone. We never ate in the hotel as there are so many places around to go to, however the bar is good. The staff bring your drinks to the table for you so you don't even have to go to the bar, RESULT!!!!!!!! San Francisco is a great place, if you go I would definately go to Alcatraz, the trip is fantastic. I would book before you go to make sure you get tickets as it's extremely popular. I would recommend buying a \"CityPass\" as well. This gives you entry to 6 attractions and lets you ride on the cable cars and trams for a period of 7 days. It costs about \u00a340, but when you think a single ride on the cable cars costs 6 dollars each, which equates to about \u00a33.70ish, it's well worth it. Not sure why anyone would write a negative comment about the Parc 55 as I thought it was fine. The hotel is also used by a number of airlines which must say something about the standards they set. If I ever go back to San Francisco I would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!!!!\u201d", "Author": "donna g", "ReviewID": "UR129338520", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay here.

The only peaceful area of that floor was the bathroom in the shower with the water running. Other than that, there were many city sounds and people sounds to keep any light sleeper awake.

Parking at the hotel is pricey ($48/day) but there is a public garage 2-3 blocks away which charges $25/day. The entrance and lobby have clearly been renovated but the rooms have not. While clean the rooms/bathroom were clearly a bit dated. While not the best it was not the worst room I have ever seen. I also agree with other reviewers....the NOISE is striking. I have never stayed in a hotel where so much outside noise comes into your room. Even while staying on the 26th floor you can hear voices, sirens, and just about anything else at all hours of the day. We were able to secure this hotel through bidding on priceline at $120/night which was a great deal. If we paid anything more I would have been a bit more disappointed in the stay.

Checkin was prompt & efficient and allocated room on 27th floor with amazing views over the city. Quite a large sized room with sofa and great big comfortable bed which was very sleepable. Good sized bathroom with big tub & lots of soaps & gels & earplugs (not needed). Noise was not an issue except for police & fire sirens in the night sometimes from street level. Overall a good room and spacious. However club lounge was a bit disappointing as it was quite small and not a whole lot of table & chairs.The breakfast options were limited to cereals & pastries with some ham & cheeses, juices & coffee. When it was busy in the morning it was hard to get a seat & you had to wait for someone to vacate. The cocktail hour canap\u00e9s were just cheese & crackers with a small hot snack, the soft drinks & juices were free but the wines/beers were payable. For the extra $25 that it cost I did expect a little more & was disappointed as I have been in better hotel lounges where all drinks (soft & hard) were free & you had a better experience. Apart from that the hotel was fab, Lobby was massive, 3 free computers by the lobby lifts (6 lifts) to check email & print boarding passes. The location is spot on for tourists & first time visitors to the city, all the BART, buses & tram go along Market St past the hotel & there are stops moments away from the hotel as well as the Powell Street cable car turnaround. The 3 day MUNI travel pass available form the sales desk by BofA is fantastic value @ $21 for 3 days & includes unlimited travel on the cable card, trams & buses. Also check out the tourist information office in Powell St BART subway for free wifi & free local calls from the phones on the walls !!The Cheesecake Factory is just around the corner on Union Sq in the top floor of Macys and stays open very late and has a nice open air terrace overlooking Union Sq.

We got a great rate at this property for $109 USD a night through a Travelzoo deal and it was definitely worth it. The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars are because we had a few hiccups during our stay. After we checked in we wanted to relax for a little while in our room. We went to turn on the television to find it wasn't working. It took a good two hours for maintenance to get up to the room to fix the television. Another problem we had was one of our key cards became deactivated three times during our three night stay (and no we didn't keep it close to our phones or credit cards :) ). To go down 14 floors and wait in a long line to be able to get a new card to get into your room can be an absolutely huge inconvenience. Now for a few good things we especially enjoyed about this hotel (other than its fabulous location): 1) All staff we encountered were extremely pleasant. 2) It was very quiet and not noisy like some others have stated. 3) They have a great fitness center. 4) The views from the rooms are great, even from the 14th floor it was terrific. 5) Rooms are all very large -- especially for San Francisco standards 6) The water pressure in the shower was FANTASTIC!

The only issue I had was when I went to breakfast and the two ladies at the front kept reading something instead of seating us. Until my partner mentioned if we are to be seated and that's when they did. To me, no matter how busy you are, knowing that there was someone waiting, they should at least say \"Hold on, we will seat you shortly\".

My parents worked for the diplomatic core, then I worked for the diplomatic core before my career in education and counseling; so hotels have been a mainstay in my life. I consider myself a novice connoisseur of hotels - self appointed of course. A counseling convention brought me to Parc 55. Upon my arrival, I was greeted with sleek, modern lines, vibrant wall art, and a welcoming 'hello' by every hotel employee who crossed my path. The lobby area was airy and open, very suiting for the San Fran area. The front desk quickly check me in and I made my way up to my room. I'm a Wyndham rewards participant, and had requested a room on a high floor; so I was very pleased with my 23rd floor assignment, offering an expansive view of the city and the beautiful bay. The room was clean, open and accommodating. The bathroom (a pet peeve area for me) was spacious, clean and spa-like. I didn't hesitate to put my things on the counter, nor did I ponder before stepping into the shower. Whew- thank God for small blessings! Within an hour of my check-in, a complimentary tray of fruit, and my preferred beverages of sprite and bottled water were delivered to my room. Now that's how you welcome a guest! My stay extended over three nights and four days. My room was always clean, and fresh. The nightly turn over service was like clock work - and always done with a smile and small talk. The room service, was delivered with the same level of warmth; although I felt the menu options were a bit lacking for the San Francisco area, but they were able to accommodate my requests. The room offered a soft hum from the city, but it was welcomed as it served as reminder of being a new place. Not once did I see any signs of untidiness in the hotel, nor was anyone every rude or impolite. I think my visit to the hotel markets sums up the quality offered by Parc 55 Wyndham, San Francisco: Having flown for 8 hours, with a connector, and a 2 hour delay due to rotting fish - I was tired and my ears had not yet acclimated to being on the ground again. Every word that I said echoed loudly in my skull as if my it was empty, cavernous. Every attempt to dislodge the trapped air was met with shooting pain. I needed the warm end of a q-tip and of course I didn't pack any. I made my way down stairs to the hotel market. I was greeted by an aging man with a youthful smile. He welcomed me and asked if he could help me find anything. I explained my dilemma, and we began dialoguing. Before I knew it, we had shared our professional journeys, our travels, and our passion for inquiry and people - he was so gregarious and joyful; respectable traits to someone who was intrinsically introverted. His exuberant small talk made you feel hopeful about the world... a big statement for such a small act I know. While paying for my travel sized pack of q-tips I noticed that we hadn't even exchanged names. I looked to his name tag. \"Nice to meet you Warren. It was a pleasure speaking with you\", I said with a grateful smile. \"The pleasure was all mine Ms. Graham. You have a nice day and enjoy your conference.\" The warmth infused into the simple task of helping a customer find q-tips is not at all uncommon at Parc 55, and I think that's what make this hotel exceptional. I love quotes, and I recently came across this one, \u201cTruly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget.\u201d I visited the store one more time before leaving, with no intention of crossing Warrens path again, but I would be remiss in saying I wasn't hoping to get a little bit of his sunny disposition before heading back to the east coast. He wasn't working that day, but the experience provided by Warren and the entire Parc 55 staff is \"hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget\".

Having visited San Francisco several times, we are familiar with the city, and thus decided to save a little by bidding via Priceline. We got the Parc 55 for $160. per night. Not a huge savings, but considering conference/convention season is in full swing, we were happy with the price. Upon arrival the doorman and bellhop greeted us and offered their service. The woman assisting us checking in was also friendly and polite. The only (slightly) odd thing about checking in is that you enter the lobby, then go up one floor. We soon realized having a separate lobby from the check-in & concierge made sense because this hotel frequently hosts conferences, meetings, tour groups, and is used by many different airlines as crash pads. This kept the check-in area free from the large groups clogging up the space. The airlines even had their own self-check in kiosk. We knew that booking via Priceline often means getting the least desirable rooms. That's why when we use that service, we only bid on the highest star-level available. With those hotels, the least desirable room is still usually better than an average room at a lower-star hotel. At the Parc 55, we were given one of those rooms, #814 (standard non-smoking King). Our room looked into the \"courtyard\" aka looking out at the back of the other buildings. I consider that a \"plus\" because those rooms are usually quieter than street side, (if I want a view, I don't use third-party booking agent). Pretty much everything about the room could be described as standard and comfortable for the star level. We found the bed to be a bit firm, but otherwise it was your average hotel pillow-top. The only thing that made the room sub-par was that the maid's access hallway ran right behind the wall our bed was against. So, from the time we checked in (around 6:30) to the time we left for dinner (8pm) we heard the trolley carts rolling like thunder through that hallway several times. When we got back from dinner, around 10pm, we heard nothing until around 9am the next morning, well after we were already up. This was no big deal for *us*. We live in an urban setting, so we're used to some noise. Plus, our sleep habits were not interrupted, and we didn't spend much time in the room by day. That said, I can easily imagine this room could be a nightmare to others with differing habits. The hotels seems aware of this, and a pair of earplugs are provided :) The bathroom: Average sized, Bath & Bodyworks products are nice, hot water comes on quickly and seems a bit hotter than normal (yay!) and the shower is fantastic. The only downside is poor lighting over the shower. I like a well-lit shower for shaving. Overall: Yes, I would book again via Priceline, and if the price was right, direct with the hotel.

The breakfast offered was very substantial (2 fresh cut fruits, yogurt, granola, cereal, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, juices, coffee & tea). A quiet lovely environment with outstanding views. Also enjoyed other Club amenities - appetizers and wine, and later desserts and wine. Most definitely worth the extra money, especially considering the prices in SF.

The hotel is basically at the intersection of Market and 4th-5th street. It is right outside of the entry location for the cable car. The hotel has an awkward entrance. When you enter the hotel you are on the ground floor where only a bell hop station is located. You have to go upstairs to the second floor to registration. If you have luggage, it's easier to go around the corner and use the elevators to get upstairs verses using the escalators. The only complaint is that the hotel doesn't have a door man to offer assistance when you arrive. I stayed in a Club Room King which puts you on the upper floors and gives you access to a club lounge. The views from the upper rooms are worth the extra money. I stayed in a corner room on the 31st floor that gives you a front and side window. If you can book room 3107 you won't be disappointed. The onsite work out room is well equipped with a lot of machines and free weights. There is a Starbucks on site as well as a roomy restaurant and a side bar. The food was good and the Martinis were excellent. When you rent a club room, you get a continental breakfast every day in the private lounge on the 31st floor. Sunday through Thursday the club room offers a full highline bar, hor'devours and desert from 6pm until 10:00pm. This is worth it. As for the hotel room, it is updated with marble and wonderful beds and coverings. The bathrooms are well appointed and a nice size. I would like to see more pressure from the shower. I was really impressed that as busy as the hotel was, the elevators were always available and quick even while staying on the top floor. A few pointers. Attached to the hotel right outside the door is a coffee and donut shop when the lines at Starbucks are to long. Internet is pricey at $14.05 per day, but you can purchase a weeks pass for $49.00. Bottom line is that this hotel was worth the money. It's great for a holiday location and doing business at the Moscone Convention Center.

Room is large - two beds and still room to walk around without bumping into the beds or furniture. Beds were very comfortable and quality sheets. Staff are very friendly and helpful! Did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on the food. The hotel has an adequate work out facility standard machines (no sauna/hot tub etc) but it is complimentary and open 24 hours. Hotel is easy walking distance to Union Square, shops, trolley and to the convention. Now the NEGATIVE items: Stayed on the 14th floor facing the North: We would get up each morning between 6 am - 8 am and there was never any hot water for a shower. The water was so cold (even turning straight hot water and letting it run for over 5 minutes and still no change - the water stayed cold) We learned to take our showers at night! Very noisy, in fact (thank goodness) the hotel provides ear plugs by the complimentary items in the bathroom. Needless to say after the first night we were using the ear plugs because of all the noise (for example there is a popular pub down the street and about 3 am they are dumping their bottles out usually 3-5 times and by the sound they have to be using those huge 33+ gallon trash cans). So if Parc 55 Wyndham hotel's price is reasonable and you know the negatives that I stated above then by all means stay there! If you have to have a hot shower in the morning, can not sleep with ear plugs, need a high end modern work out facility then I would stay somewhere else.

I booked this hotel via Expedia Unpublished Rates - So I didn't know, I got the Parc 55 until I had actually paid it and I was pleasantly surprised it got to be the Wyndham. Check-in was extremely fast and very nice, attentive staff at the front desk. I noticed the Valet sign at curbside when we pulled up - $50 for Valet! I have stayed at many 5 star Deluxe hotels- and resorts around the States and never have I had to pay a ridiculous $50 pr. night for Valet at a presumably 4 star hotel - That ain't right! The room was in very good condition, slightly dark and late 70'ish. Nice big flat screen Full HD TV, very comfortable beds (two queens) and the bathroom was nice, good water preassure even on the 24th floor - YES 24th floor and the view was to die for, literally, hit the street at that height, you're a goner. ;) No joking aside, when I asked the lady to give us a view, she certainly did. The entire skyline of San Francisco with the bay behind opened up in-front of us. Truly spectacular. We only had breakfast at the lobby restaurant one time; needless to say, this was very good. We had a la carte, didn't go for the buffet and it was very good, inexpensive and the coffee was very nice, good beans and freshly ground. Croissants were very tasty, bagels amazingly soft inside and a little \"crust\" on the outside. Jam was world-class stuff. It was a simple breakfast, but boy did it taste good. The cinnamon rolls; THE best. Pros: Free business center with computers and a printer, the small gift shop, SWIFT elevators, SWIFT Valet apart from the pricetag, the VIEWS from the room, breakfast. Cons: A LOT of homeless people just outside the hotel and even some inside the hotel on the ground floor, of course the $50 Valet, slightly late 70'ish look (rusty, gold, beige colours) ain't working so well in 2012. To many \"weird\" looking fellas hanging out outside the entrance by the cars, thought that was so strange. If you can hit it via Expedia Unpublished Rates, do it.

The reception lady on checking in was very courteous and friendly. As others have mentioned - you can hear street noise below, but that's city life for you. The Hotel have very helpfully provided ear plugs which worked like a treat for light sleepers like myself. I did not try the Restaurant as there were so many other options in Union Square and I was only there for 3 nights. The Airport Shuttle bus, stops outside the hotel several times a day and you do not have to pre-book it. I left on Superbowl Sunday and was slightly concerned that the city would come to a standstill and the shuttle bus would be delayed. This did not happen and I made the airport in plenty of time. I found the Hotel lived up to the positive reviews on TA and I would definitely return. Another thing I would highly recommend, is purchasing a travel \"passport\". This pass allows you unlimited travel on the cable cars, trolley cars, buses and BART. The scenic trolley cars (the ones with outside seating) are $6 per trip one way.

Great beds, great bathrooms, my only beef is that they charge for Internet access (like most of the major hotel chains except for Residence Inn and Courtyard - in my opinion this is a goofy thing to do in the age of the Internet - like charging for cable TV access.) Lots of great places to eat near the hotel, it is literally half a block or less from the Muni and BART Station at Powell, there's a decent pastry and coffee shop just outside the hotel on the same block as Parc 55 heading towards BART, and you're only blocks from Union Square and all the shopping any human could stand. Also very close the Theatre District. Let me say it one more time - outstanding customer service. Everyone from the front desk staff to the hotel operators to the cleaning staff - everyone was great, friendly and nothing but helpful. I recommend Cafe Mason (on Mason) for excellent dining for all three meals - really a superb place to eat only 2 blocks from the hotel. Santorini just a block away walking North is great Greek food as well. There's a Starbuck's just before Santorini's, heading North. There are other excellent hotels in S.F. - of course.

This hotel has been very good to us. It truly feels like a home away from home while giving us a lot of perks. We love the rooms on the upper floors. The sweeping views are always breathtaking, no matter what direction you are facing. You might see the bay to the south, you might be staring at some of the most beautiful architecture, but it won't matter because you'll find yourself peering down at this magical city with awe. I like the layout of the hotel, the color scheme and the zen vibe. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. On several occasions, we chose to extend our stay (because we actually DO love staying here) and they bent over backwards to make it happen even during a \"sold out\" weekend. The reception level is beautiful and inviting with high ceilings, wood flooring and gorgeous orchids. Don't pass up the citrus infused water near the bar/restaurant entrance. If you want to grab a cocktail before venturing out, the bar has some great 2 for 1 deals on wine and specialty drinks. We have not tried the concierge/upgraded package yet, but plan to do so soon. When we were checking out last weekend, we noticed a different key card on our agent's desk. She explained that the tippy top floor rooms have special amenities that include breakfast and cocktails in a spectacular viewing space. I can't wait to book that package on my next trip. The only negative I can point out would be the beds. Although comfortable and elegantly dressed in fine white sheets with large Euro pillows, the mattresses aren't top of the line. You can tell that they are springy and not plush. It isn't a deal breaker though. Being near the Powell St. BART station has its pros and cons. It is lovely to go direct from SFO and be about 20 steps from your hotel, especially when toting a lot of luggage. The slight downside is dealing with people hanging around the BART entrance, both the panhandlers and the crowds of tourists buying tickets for trolley rides. It can get quite chaotic and loud, but once inside the Parc55, you don't hear the street noise below. You'll be hard pressed to avoid any unwanted street activity at most SF hotels anyway. Walk across the street to Nordstrom, their cafe is yummy with gorgeous views back toward the Parc55. Take a jaunt down Market street to the amazing Ferry building, especially on the weekend when the Farmers Market is bustling with energy from both locals and tourists. Our favorite secret find is jumping on the Sausalito or Larkspur ferry for only $5 (with a Clipper card) and boating across the water to have a reverse view of this amazing city!

BART and MUNI are a 1/2 block away; cable cars 1 blk. away; 2 blks. from the F-Line that takes you on a scenic route through the Financial District all the way to Fisherman's Wharf. From the Wharf, you can catch the cable cars straight back to Parc 55. I checked the hotel's website and booked directly with them and got a steal on the room rate! Always check their website for specials. Vicky (one of the hotel operators) and Mike (one of the bell hops) were extremely helpful in providing transit suggestions to get around the city most efficiently. San Francisco is a great city to see on foot, so equally important, Mike advised me of streets to steer clear of. Searching for parking around the city is extremely unpleasant, so using the MUNI or street cars is essential. Don't miss taking the N Judah MUNI train (outbound) to the Academy of Sciences at the Golden Gate Park (get off at 9th and Judah - a 20 min. ride). The Academy is an impressive planetarium, aquarium, and natural history museum all in one! Great, fun experience for the whole family. The deYoung contemporary museum is a few steps across the away. There are 32 floors at Parc 55, so ask for a nice view of the city in the upper floors. Noise is expected in such a bustling city, so an upper floor will help if you are a REALLY light sleeper. I am a light sleeper, but I didn't have a problem and I slept soundly each night.

The hotel was very nice. We stayed in a club level room, which was ideal because the free continental breakfast in the club lounge made it worth the extra money. Plus having a room on a higher floor meant a better view of the city. The club lounge also has free appetizers and desserts in the evening. Cocktails are on the honor system, but other refreshments are free. We stayed over a long weeked, so the club lounge was closed on Friday and Saturday evenings. The reception staff was friendly and helpful. The concierge was also great. It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we used the concierge for advice on several occasions. I was surpised at other reviews that mentioned the noise level. This is a city hotel, so one would expect a lot of outside noise (sirens, car horns, etc). Honestly though, it wasn't very disruptive. There was minimal noise in the hotel hallways, and we had a \"conference\" of teenagers staying at the hotel at the time, so if they weren't noisy then I can't see the noise level getting too high! The room had a comfortable king bed, flat screen TV, desk, chair, sofa, and a good sized bathroom. Plenty of space for 2 adults! I actually expected the room to be smaller, so we were pleasantly surprised. We never ate at the hotel restaurant, but it looked nice and was usually busy. The hotel does not have free wi-fi, except in the lobby, which was disappointing, but we were on vacation so it didn't matter much to us. The business center was small, with a handful of computers. At the time we went, the computers weren't working properly and none had printing capability. However, the concierge was helpful in getting our boarding passes printed for our flight. The location is great. Only a few blocks to Union Square, which was decorated nicely for the holiday season. You can also pick up sightseeing tours at Union Square. The hotel is a block from the BART and the Powell-Mason cable car, so easy access to transporation. Muni transportation is very close as well. Plenty of restaurants in the area within walking distance, but you can easily hop on public tranportation to go elsewhere. Taxis are also available at the hotel entrance. We went to Candlestick Park for the 49ers game and caught the bus just a couple blocks away (very covnenient!) Parc 55 is a block from the Tenderloin district, so it is reasonable to say going beyond Mason St. at night is not a good idea, but there really wasn't anything we wanted to do on that side anyway.

We didn't take advantage of room service or eat at the restaurant but there's a cafe located next door where you can grab a quick bite to eat for breakfast or lunch.

If you are on a budget, ask before you book so you know how much you'll be spending.

The lobby always reeked of cigarettes either from the street or from the bar, even early in the morning. The room was smaller than I expected but tidy and comfortable. I couldn't get the in-room safe to open upon arrival and asked for someone to check it. \"Engineering\" came to the room and flipped the power switch which was inside the fold of the door and looked at me like I was a complete moron. I tried to sign up for the high speed internet ($49/week) on my Ipad and got on just long enough to pay the fee and then it crashed and never worked again, despite 4 calls to the \"customer support\" number. I wasted at least an hour collectively -plugging in the tablet computer, checking the IP address, adding the Wi-Fi, checking the network connection with multiple different support staff to no avail.

They acted like they had never heard of this problem and offered not even an apology. This was finally fixed that day while I was out. Finally, on the last night, my bill arrived with a charge for two bottles of water that I didn't drink. I had to have the charge removed rather than just checking out and RUNNING for my life out of this hotel.

Having read the reviews on this site prior to booking the hotel, I made sure that we got a room on the upper levels as I had read that the street noise was quite annoying on the lower lever floors.

Having travelled quite a bit, this is the first time I have heard anything like this, it felt as if the outside walls and window were paper thin. Our only other complaint was that it seemed difficult to get a taxi in the evening to go out for dinner with there being lineups for taxis and having seemingly little taxis driving by the hotel (could wait 10-15 minutes before getting a taxi). Apart from that, the stay was great and the staff was helpful.

Mind you it\u2019s not terribly far, but this is just false advertising, plain and simple. On my stay I paid big bucks for a Club Level room. The room was decent, but the Club (3 floors up) was disappointing; primarily the food. The evening fare was sparse: a cheese assortment, a lettuce only salad, and meatballs. Later in the evening they offered just two desert items that were virtually identical. Compared to other hotel club offerings, the food variety here was mediocre at best. But the real outrage was the fire alarm testing that occurred on several floors \u2013 obviously mine. Upon checking in this was NOT mentioned. When I got to the room there was a written notice, but it implied that sometime between 11am and 3pm, someone would need to access the room and check out the alarm siren. In reality, the alarm siren IN MY ROOM (incredibly loud even with ear plugs) went on and off for 4 hours. Work or rest was impossible.

No worries about safety here, big burly security guards everywhere with the suits and earpieces (which is a bit much for me, but im sure the Simpleton traveler will feel secure)....the price of the hotel may seem a bit high,but compared to other hotels, especially the lower starred ones, its a great bargain....The drawbacks of the hotel is parking is expensive, but unlike other hotels and garages, you get to go in and out, so its not bad. The hotel store is a bit small (and they are aggressive trying to unload their goods...just say \"hey man, i want a pack of smokes and THATS IT\" to offset this)...stay here for sure, if you dont you are blowing it..... i might look like a plant or a mark with this rainbows and waterfalls review, im not.

This is a very large hotel with the feel of a busy airport. The ground floor restaurant/bar lacks any kind of atmosphere or intimacy. If we had paid $125 like a previous reviewer, my review would have been less critical. But paying over $200 (with taxes), I noticed that the carpets in our \"clean air\" room were stained and when I turned over the cushions on the 2 chairs, it was obvious that the undersides had not been vacuumed recently. The bathroom electrical outlet was grubby, although when I called housekeeping, they were ready to change it immediately. When I pointed out some small black dots on the edge of the bedskirt, we were moved to a Club room. Why? Because the management of the hotel takes even a remote possibility of an infestation very seriously. I have to give them full credit for this: they offered to launder all our belongings (not necessary, since we had just arrived), and sent someone to move our luggage to a new room. We were repeatedly told that they take this issue seriously and we could see that this is really the case. Several men wearing gloves came into the room as we were leaving, and proceeded to take the room apart. I think that their quick and decisive actions were admirable and speak to a high level of operational efficiency. We LOVED the Club room that they upgraded us to; it also included evening snacks, desserts and an honor bar, as well as a lovely breakfast in the 31st floor Club Lounge with a gorgeous view of the city. I would totally recommend paying $30-40 more per night for a Club room; it's well worth it!

The room was nice, hotel staff nice, but I wouldnot pay above 200 a night for this due to the location, unless part of your itinerary includes massages, buying drugs and or getting into fistfights with homeless people. Also, another huge negative, we were on the 25th floor and we could still CLEARLY here the constant sirens, so either SF has super sirens or the glass windows were astoundingly cheap.

It's HUGE, so you don't get the personal service of a small, boutique hotel. We checked in and had a room with two beds, I asked to be moved to a room with 1 bed and was denied citing \"We're really full\". Funny that a friend of mine staying in the same hotel on the same dates was switched from a 1 bed room to a 2 bed one with no issues. I suppose it's the luck of the draw on who you get at the check in desk. Our room was okay, typical hotel room. The high speed internet had issues and my husband (who was working from the hotel room for the week) had to call tech support because the connection kept dropping. The ability to have a wired connection was the main reason we chose this hotel and the connection was still unreliable. I should add that this hotel charges for high speed internet access, which is terribly annoying since most places offer it for free these days - and to have it be unreliable only added to the annoyance. The area of town (Union Square) is noisy as I found staying in the area last year. The hotel provides earplugs in the bathrooms as an amenity. I found a sound machine app on my phone worked better than the earplugs. The walls are also paper thin in this hotel. We didn't hear much during the week - perhaps our neighboring rooms were quiet business travelers or unoccupied. Come the weekend, though - we heard EVERYTHING in the rooms next to us. I even knew the cell phone ring of the occupant in the room next door and could hear every word of his conversation. That's no fun, especially when your neighbors come in at 1AM from a night on the town and want to loudly tell one another stories. Not a pleasant way to be woken up in the middle of the night. One more thing - the internet charge is not per ROOM, it's per DEVICE that you use to connect to the internet. We had two laptops and had two charges on the bill and had to get that resolved. I even called down to the front desk at the beginning of our stay to confirm that the charge was per ROOM and not per DEVICE. The phone was answered by someone who did not understand the language well and she just kept saying \"Yes\", so I repeated my question and just got a \"yes\" response. Upon check out, I explained my conversation, cited the date and the extra charge was removed. I am still annoyed greatly that (1) there is a charge for high speed internet access (2) the connection was unreliable at best and (3) the charge is per device, not per room. I think that's a bit greedy, if you ask me. Oh, and our TV didn't work, so we had to call for assistance with that, too. The cable was bad or something to that effect. It was still annoying. I have an annual conference in SF and I probably won't stay here again. There are too many other hotels in this area to deal with the annoyances I experienced in my week here.

You have to look carefully when booking rooms in expensive cities such as SF, especially if you feel you need to get a car. If you are coming for pleasure and are staying in Union Square, you don't need a car. The parking in the hotels garages are very expensive. You have the trolleys cars, the Muni, sightseeing tour buses, and if you like walking you don't need a rental car.

This had been done earlier in the day. He then suggested it was a staff member checking to see if we had used the water for sale in the room but they did not mention this or ask to come in the room to see for themselves (we also had read on the website that water was complimentary but it actually costs $4.50 a bottle)! Finally, the manager said he could check to see who last used a key in our door but he never bothered to contact us again. He did give us a $25 voucher for use in the bar where the staff were extremely nice. We decided to cut our stay short and left the next day.

I can't comment on the price because my organization had a group rate negotiated for us. The rooms were nice and put together, clean, and housekeeping left a message every day making sure that we didn't want any services done. That being said, it seems that when Wyndham bought this hotel, the changes were mostly cosmetic. You can tell from the old discolored outlets and vent in the bathroom. And other reviewers weren't kidding when they were talking about the street noise, there's no soundproofing at all. The first two nights weren't bad from being pretty tired, but the others were filled with piercing sirens that even cut through the earplugs that we had brought in preparation for it. The hotel does provide complimentary earplugs too, which is nice. It's a rather busy part of town, and they are aware of it. Sirens are one thing, you may be thinking, but that's pretty common. Well Foley's Irish House (amazing, I'll review it soon) is a block away, and at 2 AM you could hear the Saturday night revelers emptying into the street as it shut its doors for the night. Luckily, I didn't seem to have a problem with noise within the hotel, even though I had a connecting room. I didn't use the in-hotel restaurant, but I was in the ballroom for the majority of the time. It's large and has good sound and presentation equipment. I kind of wished there was a main large projector screen in the middle rather than two smaller screens to each side of the room, but that's a small complaint. My biggest complaint is that it was so cold in there! Apparently the day before I arrived it had been rather warm, so they cranked up the air conditioning. Unfortunately they overdid it, it wasn't all that warm outside, but it was even colder in the ballroom. I had to wear two jackets and a scarf just to keep from shivering. I don't know if anyone complained to the staff; I would hope that if they did the staff would have done something. The business center was a little disappointing, but it wasn't totally the hotel's fault. I liked that it took a keycard to enter, but there were only five computers, one of which didn't have internet, and the others were taken up by people on facebook, while I needed to check-in to my flight. Printing from the computers was very easy though.

The front desk gave us a $25 coupon (which was unneccessary, but VERY kind!) good in their restaurant/lounge and said they'd move us the next morning. They also sent a air purifier to our room which actually helped the situation... totally cleared the smell in a matter of an hour... so we ended up not switching, and appreciated their attention & concern to the situation. The hotel was in easy walking distance of great shopping and eating! HATE the \"oversized vehicle\" charge of $66/day for our SUV... but I know parking is a premium in the city.

Two security guards had been dispatched because the 0.30am calls (we thought they were prank calls) had not been answered. At first, when we heard that security was knocking on our door, we believed that the hotel had come under attack or that there was a fire alarm, but then we were treated like criminals. For someone who spends up to 6-7 months a year in hotels I have never experienced hostility and poor service at this level. I advise the travel industry, write for travel magazines, and do scenario planning for airlines, and frankly this sort of treatment is totally unacceptable. What made it worse was the manager O's response the following morning. Rather than apologise in a situation when both me and my business partner were clearly distressed, he argued that sending out security at 1am is a proportionate response (because the hotel experiences travellers who don't settle bills). I asked him if this is a hotel policy for all guests and he answered 'yes, in these circumstances'. So if you are going to stay at Parc 55, make sure that all their internal communications and accounts departments are up to speed with your Expedia bookings, otherwise you might expect a nasty wake-up at 1am. He then offered a coffee and a sandwich (which he forgot to order from the restaurant for us) as a respite. His follow up email to the situation (4 days later) invited us to a free upgrade next time we choose to stay at the hotel so 'we can better feel about our property'.

We booked through the hotel website and upgraded to a \"view room\" on the 24th floor. We took the BART from the airport, which has a stop right in front of the hotel. That was very convenient. Renting a car, driving in horrible San Fran. traffic, and paying crazy $50 parking fees didn't interest us. We spent about $60 in cab fare getting around the city for the entire 4 days. Anyways- Check-in went smoothly and the woman at registration was very pleasant. We headed to the elevator bank and waited with about 50 other people. After finally getting into the elevator with around 12 squished people, it took about 5 minutes to drop everyone at each floor. I thought- Uh Oh! My boyfriend is not a patient man... We arrived at our room, set directly behind the elevator and ice machine. I was a bit worried as many reviewers complained about the noise level. (Indeed there are a set of earplugs offered as an \"amenity\" in the room.) The room itself was fine- tastefully though blandly decorated. Our \"view room\" gave us a view of the city, though it looked out on the not so nice side of town. The bathroom was average- nothing special. The outlets and wallpaper look to be 25 years old, but the fixtures where relatively updated. After dropping our luggage, we went down to get a bite to eat. Another 10 minutes in the packed elevator, stopping at every floor.... and we were down. Cab service was convenient and always available out front. Overnight- The bed was comfortable enough. We didn't have any problems with elevator or ice machine noise, but there are always sirens at night from emergency vehicles. I think this is more prevalent as we were so close to the not so nice part of town. I am happy to say the elevator situation became much less busy during our stay, so either there was a big convention that left or maybe some elevators had been out of service. Who knows. Anyhow, if you need a hotel that is reasonably priced downtown, Park 55 isn't bad, but it certainly wasn't a luxury hotel to me.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "juicylala", "ReviewID": "UR115068824", "Content": "great hotel except for your next door neighbor(s) you can hear them talking and the TV and the outside noise was horrible. please wear your eye plugs.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery impressed!

Seeing I never go outside the city when I am in SF, I have no need for a car and take cabs or bart/muni. It is very easy to find a hotel and coming from the SFO, it is only a $8 BART fare and all you have to do is go up the escalator from the bart station and cross the street and you are at the hotel. Same if you need to use the muni. The rooms are good sized for that area and recently renovated. This past stay I had a really nice corner room. The by request welcome gift waiting in my room was very nice, a couple diet cokes were waiting for me on ice when I entered the room at checkin along with a couple bottled waters and a generous tray of organic fresh fruit. I have seen others complain about the internet speed but I had no problems with it. I used my IPAD to connect and the speed was fine.

Housekeeping is swift and they look at the details (for example room service trays do no stay in hallways for hours or up to the next day ....as seen elsewhere). Very good sleep quality : no noise from inside, very ecceptable noise from outside. Only two negative remarks: - parking is valet only, so it takes out some flexibility. Besides, the parking area is not that big and can be busy. The valet parking personnel however are veru efficient to clean up the are as quick as possible. - internet . As expensive as other places (15$/day ar 50$/week). However, they have a real capacity problem. At peak times, the speed is awfully slow to non-existent (from 54 to ....1 or 0 bps).

Staying in San Francisco is expensive, and we got a great deal on this hotel. Overall, I'm glad we stayed here. We were kind of frantic when we arrived at the hotel because we were due to return our rental car any minute (we had just arrived from Sonoma), but we wanted to drop our stuff of first. The staff helped us unload the car and get in and out quickly so we could take care of business. While some people on here claim that the hotel looked dated, it looked nice and modern to me, but hey, what do I know? The room was a size that you would expect for a major city, maybe even a little bigger. There were no king bed rooms available yet when we arrived, so I took a 2 double bed room rather than wait. It was less comfortable, but it was my own choice I guess. There was some street noise (we were on the 14th floor), but no more than you would expect from staying in a downtown area of a major city, and not anything that would keep you from falling asleep if you're at all acustomed to urban living. If you want total peace and quiet, why on earth would you stay in downtown San Francisco? The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing. The cable car, street cars, buses and the BART are all within a block of the hotel. You can walk to Chinatown, Union Square and City Hall. It simply could not have been easier for us to get around the city. Some people on here complained about the neighborhood. San Francisco has a homeless problem. It's not a secret. From what I observed though, the problem is all over the city, and not just in the area surrounding the hotel. If you exercise common sense and ordinary street smarts, you should be fine. Or you can just stay in a hotel by Fisherman's Wharf and not leave Fisherman's Wharf (but why on earth would you want to do that?). Or you can just not go to San Francisco. There were a few things that irked me. On the first day, housekeeping inexplicably took all of our towels but didn't replace any. We had to call down for towels. This did not happen again, though. Also, I am a Wyndham Rewards member, and should have been entitled to perks like free wi-fi, free domestic calls and a welcome basket. None of that was given or offered to me, although I admit that I didn't ask either. We did have a good experience with the conceirge.

Check in is a smooth process, as valets are readily available to park your car and help with luggage. The room was pretty standard in size, but the furnishings were top-notch (I can't think of a softer bed.) There really isn't anything negative I'd have to say about the hotel itself- the rooms, the lobby, the bar, all were immaculately maintained and guest services was readily available to offer advice on getting around the city (which wasn't difficult as the hotel was only a few minutes from a trolly turnaround, bart station and bus stops- but if you want a cab, the doormen are more than happy to flag one for you.) The only hang up that I can think of would be the valet fees, which over the course of 4 nights, added up a bit- but there were no issues with the car or the contents- which is a plus considering some of the horror stories I hear of valet.

It ranks, to date, as one of the best Priceline values I've ever gotten. The standard rates are reasonable too and I would pay the advertised rate for a room here (which is not something I often say). The staff was incredibly pleasant and check-in was a breeze. The lobby is strange (on the second floor), but very nicely appointed. We had a room on the 7th floor that wasn't huge (which is to be expected in SF), but space was used very well. We had a decent view considering our room was on a lower floor. The room was clean, comfortable (great bed) and even a bit stylish. While we never ate at any of the on site restaurants, we heard good things. The reason we never ate on site is due to the location. It's very good. It's immediately adjacent to the Powell St. Transit hub (BART, Muni Metro, F-Line- Buses and yes, the Cable Car all right there). It's a great jumping off point for tourists, and also ideally located for business travelers. It's about 2-3 blocks to Union Square and shopping. A nice, easy walk. As has been noted, the Union Square area quickly transitions into the seedier tenderloin. While I never felt unsafe at the Park 55 (the entrances are strategically oriented towards Powell Station and Union Square while turning their back on the Tenderloin), you'll encounter some panhandlers (who congregate around transit hubs and busy areas) without a doubt. This is true no matter where you stay in San Francisco. It should be noted, that the Tenderloin isn't as horrible as it's often made out to be. I've been to a few good bars over there and had some great eats (late night tacos without going to the Mission). In fact, I'd go so far as to say it has a unique flavor/character all of its own. Still, it's not what most tourists want to see when they visit SF and it IS right next door. A bit of advice. San Francisco is a walking city and has good public transit. Parc 55 is right on a transit hub too. Parking in downtown SF can be expensive. I would suggest NOT renting a car for the duration of your stay (you will pay $35+/night to park downtown) and renting one only for when you need it (i.e. a 2-day window where you head to Napa or down to Monterey/Carmel). There are a bunch of car rental places (everything from the big chains like National, Budget, Enterprise, etc. to smaller, local companies) within a block or two of the Parc 55. Save money on nightly parking and only rent on the days that you NEED a car. When you're in the city, you won't need one. In the end, Parc 55 is a great hotel and pretty reasonably priced (even if you don't use priceline/hotwire). It's wonderfully located.

They also delivered a minifridge minutes after we asked for it. Thanks to Winnie For helping to make our stay a great one! Pure Rooms- very clean, very comfortable bed, decent layout, great views. Furniture is not super modern,but they do have flat screens with a ton of channels including movie channels. Business center- was able to scan a doc to my thumb drive at no cost. Windows- we love fresh air and most high rise hotels do not have windows that open. The parc 55 has a luver at the bottom Of each window that Allows fresh air to come in. Simple, but Great invention!

The best thing about the room was the view; we were on the 26th floor and could see right down to the bay. This could have been the reason why we experienced no noise from outside. In fact, the thing that constantly woke us was other residents slamming their bedroom doors when leaving; why some people seem unable to close a door quietly is beyond me. However, as average and acceptable the hotel was we would not return due to the dodgy, and at times, scary location. We found some nice bars near the hotel but it was like running the gauntlet between them in the evening because of the beggars and pan-handlers. It was like a scene from shaun-of-the-dead every time we left the hotel!

Upon checking in, the front desk clerk said I was a club guest but then proceeded to put me on a NON-club floor. The interior decorations look very 90s, the bathtub is out of the 60s, so I called to ask if there was a renovated floor. The operator said all the rooms were recently renovated (yikes!), and only the club floor rooms are bigger. Telling him my room was small, he said that I was not on a club floor. Then told him I paid for a club floor room, he checked my reservation, said I was correct and put me in touch with someone in the executive offices. She quickly told me I should have gotten a club floor room and would send someone to move my belongings. A bellman soon came to the door. My belongings were waiting, basically in easily movable form, and he told me he wouldn't move my shoes. What? He told me I had to pack them up. He had a giant travel cart and couldn't put my shoes on it? So I took a laundry service plastic bag and packed them up. He finally took them. I arrived on a Thursday night, so I enjoyed the gym and then got some sparkling water in the club room. It is then that I see the placard stating that EVERYTHING except breakfast is UNAVAILABLE Friday through Sunday. No dessert, no free soda, no quiet views - nothing that I paid for except breakfast. That should be stated in large letters before one books through the website or any vendor. Finally, to add insult to injury, I woke up Sunday morning around 9:30 am and got to the club room breakfast at 9:45, 15 minutes before the place was closing. The pickings were slim. No more bagels, no more croissants, the dregs of yogurt. So I asked if there were any more croissants, and the Wyndham employee looked at me like I had asked him to donate the contents of his wallet to me. It seems to me that I paid for this breakfast, and everything should be available at the end of the meal time as it was at the beginning.

The street are very noisy (even late at night) and the windows not particularly sound-proof (they're vented, which is good when you want fresh air, but not when you want quiet).

Room was spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, big HD TV etc with a great view of the city (from 24th floor). Only noise was occasional firetruck or ambulance but it's a city so that was to be expected. Room serviced & fresh towels daily. Very impressed with housekeeping particularly on 1st morning @ 5am (major jetlag!) when hairdryer was broke & a quick call had replacement at door within 5 minutes. Hotel is perfectly located near Union Square. Opposite Bart, Cable Car & Westfield Mall. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and wil be back. Despite reading some other reviews, we felt very safe in the surrounding area. The staff were pleasant & very helpful. Special mention to the lovely doorman who found us a stretch limo to the airport when the shuttle was late - for only $45 plus tip!!! A couple of minor negatives - (1) Wifi - very expensive daily charge which we didn't opt for. There are free PCs on floor 2 lobby and in business centre complete with printers (great for online check in) but would have like free Wifi in room. (2) Security - elevators & floors accessible without using room key. Can make you feel a little vulnerable. PS - a lot of reviews mention the homeless people around the area.

Two small things that I must have that you will not have in this hotel is a microwave or a refrigerator. I was told that the refrigerator would cost $20. Before I touch anything in a hotel room I do a small inspection of countertops, toilet, windows etc., just to see how well the room was cleaned. I noticed that the desk in my room had stains from someone's greasy arms and food stains. Same situation with the remote control that I had to sanitize about three times to get the grease off. Also, if you are someone who likes to use the gym, this one is pretty bad. The Gym has about 8 treadmills and only 2 are in working condition. Dumbbells are in an area where you cannot do anything overhead due to ceiling height. Bring your own water bottle because the only water available in the gym is from a drinking fountain.

The rooms were really nice too...comfy bed, flat screens, showtime, amazing views from the 28th floor, Bath and Body Works Bathroom lotions and shampoo, Coffee Pot....etc... Door guys were great too...very funny and helpful with any of our questions. I also asked many people why they called this place Parc 55 and no one knew. I finally figured out that after taxes and tip it cost us about 55 bucks to park here each night, so maybe that is where the name came from. Also the first elevator I have ever seen that stands up for a cause...it is repectful to vertically challenged people...the numbers go in opposite directions on each side. One side starts at 1 and goes down and the other side starts at 34 and goes down...confusing to us tall people at first but once I figured out I wasnt crazy I thought it was very cool and caring to others. There was also a really nice health club...this was the first time that I did not have to wait for a machine...I went down here at 5am and 6am and there was never a crowd. The equipment is new and has a TV attached to each one.

Grabbed the vintage MUNI Streetcar across the street for $2 and took it down to the end of Market Street. Got off (after taking a transfer from the driver) at the Ferry Building. A really nice place to spend lunch looking in fun \"foodie\" shops. Got in the rather long line for the Roli Roti porchetta sandwich and was not disappointed. Worth the 25 min. wait. Got back on the streetcar to Fisherman's Wharf. Walked around, took in the sights and took some pictures. Grabbed the trolly at the turnaround by Ghiradelli Square and took it to the other end which was a block from the hotel. A perfect way to spend the afternoon in SF when you don't have a lot of time! As a business traveler we were offered a \"free\" breakfast which was from their \"Grab and Go\" bar. Included a selection of pastries and fruit along with coffee.

Although we enjoyed the convenient location of union square, we find the hotel accomodation and service disappointing for the following reasons: 1. Upon arriving at the entrance, we were told by the valet staff to \"unload your bags and leave the keys\". there were no concierge staff or luggage carts to assist. Better service would have been a hotel staff member with a luggage cart meeting us at our car to help with our luggages in. 2. Checking in was smooth until we got to our rooms and discovered that the rooms had one king bed each instead of two queen as requested. we called the front desk and were told by Jeff, the manager, that there were no other rooms available and the options were to have another bed brought in or stay where we were and got changed the next night. we told jeff the choices were unacceptable. we were then told to wait in our room until concierge call us back. after half an hour wait, we went down to the front desk, waited in line for another half an hour before talking to another manager, Tasha. she then was able to change our rooms without any problem. Instead of the run around, better service would have been to switch us at our first request. 3. A club room stay included continental breakfast between 6 am to 10 am. At various time, the room was packed with no seats. There were people standing with breakfast in hand while eating. ?Requests to take breakfast to the room to enjoy was denied. Better service would have been to use a larger room for breakfast or allow guests to bring their breakfast to their rooms or have more than 2 hotel staff to clean tables and have them ready for next guests. 4. I used the gym once at 5 am during our stay and was disappointed at seeing used towels on the floor. at that early morning, the gym is empty but should have been clean. Better service would have been a staff attendance to clean the machine and pick up dirty towels. A nice touch would have been a water dispenser or some kind of refreshment corner for guests to enjoy. Instead, the hotel had a vending machine. Guests usually don't carry money when going to a hotel gym to exercise. 5. Room was comfortable, limited storage place, had two 12 by 12 inch drawers for clothes storage. Better service would have been more than 2 drawers that size. We ended up using our luggages as storage. Internet use was $13 /day. The hotel boasts its reputation for business/leasure travelers. Better service would have been free internet. 6. Upon checking out, we found out that the hotel charged us for parking anyway, despite confirmed reservation for free parking. The staff was quick to fix the error, but again, at our inconvenience of waiting in line for a resolution. 7. Security was poor. Anybody from the streets could have walked into the hotel, taken any elevator to any floors. Room access requires a key, but the hotel halls and bathroom facilities are open to all. Better security would have been a room key access at least to the elevators.

Along the bottom of the windows in the room there is a lever to open and close a narrow space if you wanted fresh air, and perhaps those folks who found it noisy had that open without knowing it. The thermostat in my room worked perfectly if I wanted more heat on a cool night. The location couldn't have been better and very safe for walking to restaurants, theaters, shopping etc. The tenderloin is just West of the Hotel and I would avoid that area as there is nothing to see there anyway, [except for a great restaurant/bar 'Farmer Browns' close to the hotel] and as is the case in SF panhandlers are out in force around the West side of Union Square but only want spare change and will not hassle you if you pass them by from a distance.

If you are arriving by air, the BART should take approximately $8.25 and it's a 30minute ride or thereabouts, when you leave the station, it's easy to spot. Looking over to Market St, you have the Westfield Shopping Centre with all the stores you could possibly need for a spot of retail therapy. The Powell/Market cable car stop is at the end of the line or beginning, however you'd like to look at it, is nearby the BART station and hotel. There are various restaurants in the Union Square area and surrounding streets of the hotel, so there are lots to choose from and you will find something you fancy. As you enter the hotel on the ground floor, you can take the lift or the escalator to the 1st floor to where the reception area is, along from the reception area is the Cityhouse bar and restaurant, the bar have some great cocktails and bar snacks it has to be said. Check-in was of the usual professional standard that one expects, efficient yet courteous. After a long day of travelling from the east coast, we wanted to relax and unwind. The room was located on the 24th floor, we had booked a deluxe king room which was very spacious and afforded some nice city views - namely of the Transamerica Pyramid and a bit of Union Square. There was no complimentary wi-fi available in the rooms BUT, located on the 4th floor at the business centre are a bank of computers where you can check emails etc. There are also 2 additional computers located on level 2 opposite the gift shop, however there was no codes or passwords to enter so it seemed that anybody could walk in off the street to use them. Be mindful though, that there are a fair share of homeless people in and around Union Square, so of course, near the hotel, every city has it's problems but to me, this is something that is very noticeable. Having been to San Francisco on a few occasions, I accept this and don't let this bother me or get in the way of having a good time. The hotel is conveniently situated for anyone who is looking to use the cable car a lot and do a lot of shopping and of course use the BART/local transport.

I thought I would regret the decision I made. I thought the Parc was going to be too large, too impersonal, and overall, just not live up to my standards. I was ready to be disappointed and regret my decision to stay here...boy, was I wrong! Valet parking was a breeze even though the hotel was booked to capacity on the dates of my stay. The cost of parking for a SF hotel was reasonable ($41 + tax per day). Check-in was easy as well. The hotel lobby was nice and spacious. When we got up to our room, we'd found that we'd been given a handicapped room. It would have been fine but we found the sliding bathroom door did not close all the way. Since I was traveling with my partner and this was only our second trip together, I did not find this to be acceptable. I went downstairs and the front desk staff was apologetic and searched for another room. Within a few minutes, they were able to locate another room (higher floor, same bed size, corner room! upgrade!!). They also rerouted our refrigerator that had been sent to our original room to our new room. There were no hiccups with our special request and they never acted like I was bothering them at all. Our new corner room had two windows, a large TV, and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was large and very clean. The shower pressure was awesome! We never heard another peep from the neighbors except for the occasional door closing. We did hear sirens from the streets below (we were on the 23rd floor) but this was to be expected. This was not an extremely large room but for traveling with one other person, this was a good size. No complaints here whatsoever with our room. For such a large hotel, I never had to wait long for an elevator. Even though the hotel was bustling (a good feeling), it never felt crowded. The valets were quick to respond and extremely pleasant and helpful. We never had to wait long for our car to be pulled around. Staff was also helpful with organizing cab rides at the taxi stand conveniently located near the entrance. The concierge was also helpful with directions and maps. The front desk graciously gave us an extra hour to checkout as well. Finally, the hotel is conveniently located to the 80 freeway making it very easy to get in/out of the city. I've been to SF many times over the last 15 years and have no worries about staying near the Tenderloin.

I fervently hope this hotel goes out of business before one of the smoking guests (whose convenience they obviously value more than the health/comfort of nonsmokers) falls asleep with a lit cigarette and burns the whole place down.

Needless to say, they agreed to take our $390 (room rate, valet parking & taxes) for one Sunday night. We were not upset with the rate, or parking - because we knew that location was where we wanted to be.

You also have access to the business center which made it easier for us to print boarding passes or check some information on internet. Well worth the few extra dollars. Our room was on the 24th floor, large, bright with robes and plenty of towels. I enjoyed our 4 night stay there and felt at home. One drawback, there is no minibar/fridge. We did not have too much noise as we were high enough but it is true that if you close the small vent just under the window, it will be almost silent. Plenty of good restaurants around - good shopping on the door step and right in front of various transports. The staff was efficient at check-in, you can do an electronic check-out.

Now for the rest of the review: You could hardly do better than Parc 55 in terms of location. Right next to BART and the turntable for the cable cars. By taking a gamble on Priceline it was priced right. I would not have paid published rates. Due to such high traffic all the carpet and common areas look soiled and well worn. The place is so sterile and gray it seems fairly institutional and depressing - very stark. My children had a hard time believing we were actually in a hotel until we made our way to the room. If you're not planning to hang at the hotel all day - who really cares? The location really does make up for a myriad of deficiencies. The room was nice and of a decent size with an excellent view from the 16th floor. If you do have children who seem to be more interested in the hotel pool than they are in the Golden Gate Bridge - this may not be the place for you. Although, knowing there was none, we didn't hear the constant usual nagging as to when we might be able to swim. It seems they are very short staffed on housekeeping. We'd been gone from all day - 8a-4p. When we came back, no one had been to tidy up at all. At 4:30 they finally showed up and wanted us to leave so they could clean. 4:30? Really? We politely told them never mind but they kept interrupting us every half hour until about 7 to make sure we really meant it. Bottomline: If you can get it at near half published rates go for it.

I had booked it 5 months in advance from the cracking photos of rooms and reviews on the website, in the event we arrived too early for the room at 10.30. they couldnt say when it would be ready and offered another room which as we were tired after the long flight we accepted. They also rang up later to see if we were OK which was nice. The room on 24th floor was perfectly adequate if not as cracking as the website, it was of reasonable size, great beds and linen, good tele, coffee maker, desk, nice bay window with slight glimpse of water through buildings and small table and chairs. The bathroom was a good size with good shower and fitments but the bath was very low indeed which made it difficult to use without flooding the floor and there were bath requisites with soap bars rather than shower gel. There was very little drawer space which didnt matter too much to us on a short trip, there were two suitcase frames for suitcase living. There was a connecting door but this didnt impact on us. The decoration was a little tired as were the public areas, we saw a lot of cleaning going on but I dont think the colour scheme helps.The room was quiet (high floor helps) and we slept well. We taxied in quite reasonably from the airport, and the hotel luggage attendant offered us a stretch limo back for a little extra. A couple of niggles about unneccessary meanness : there were 2 bottles of water in the room which were charged at quite a high rate, complimentary wouldve been a nice touch: The room wifi charge was high, OK for business users on expenses but annoying for poor tourists, there was a free business centre with 6 ish PCs and 2 printers and a further 3 or so and a printer in the corridor but it was generally clogged with facebook refugees from the room wifi charge. I had to join a queue at various times including trying to check in, might be worth designating a pc and printer for checking in like other hotels. Also it would be nice to have more seating by the door area while waiting for taxis tours etc. The location was great being near Union Square but also near the vintage cable car terminus and the interesting trolley buses stop, both for Fishermans Wharf. A favourite trip was trolley bus to either the Ferry building and/or Pier 39 and then cable car back from the Mason Street terminus. We breakfasted at the Sunflower Cafe in O'Farrell Street a block up from the hotel and we liked Swiss Louis on Pier 39 for its views of the Rock, the Bridge, the sealions and their food and service .", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable Stay\u201d", "Author": "Taqone", "ReviewID": "UR76689830", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and enjoyed it very much. As stated by other reviewers it is very easy to commute from SFO by BART underground system to Powell Street station (which takes 30-40min). The station is very close to the hotel within viewing distance, (2min walk). The reception staff were very nice and so were the cleaners. Our room was on the 10th floor at the back of the hotel, which meant that we didn\u2019t have much of a view, but we didn\u2019t suffer from any traffic noise that some reviewers had commented about. The room was also larger than I had expected with a king size bed, large flat screen TV, desk, sofas (one of which was a sofa bed). It also had a wardrobe which contained the typical safe and also an ironing board and iron which was a first for me. The bathroom was clean and adequate and the shower was nothing special. It is also worth mentioning at this point that it seems that this hotel is favoured by airline companies. We have noticed large groups of staff from BA and Lufthansa waiting for their rooms . We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the restaurant which was very good. It had a selection of cold meats cheese, cereal, juices, smoothies and also a selection of hot food with egg, bacon etc. Just behind the lifts were 3 computers which were free to use, with access to the internet, which was very useful. The hotel location was great near all forms of transport, almost on Market Street, which has all the top end shops. It is near the Westfield shopping centre, near Union Square and near the tram that connects Market Street to Fisherman\u2019s Warf, which is a big attraction for tourists. Just one note I would like to make here. If you are new to San Francisco please look up the areas that you should stay away from (its easy to do with your search engine), as for some reason the top end hotels seem to be in or next to areas that are not very nice and you wont want to take a wrong turn to these places which is easy to do. SF also seems to be full of homeless people who are on the whole harmless but when it get darker can make you feel unsafe. (don\u2019t let me put you off I just want to warn you what to expect, the people in the city are nice) Over all we thought the hotel was great but we would suggest if you are new to SF to try to find a place near the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, which is more pleasant and offers more activities for you to do away from the shopping area and safer during night time.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cI love parc 55\u201d", "Author": "lovelynurse", "ReviewID": "UR76372833", "Content": "i took my boyfriend here for celebrated 4th of July i picked this hotel cuz i came here befor with some of my friend last year which i really had a good experian with this hotel the room was so nice and clean and close with eveything ,shopping,transportation,union square.....etc but the food kinda expensive though...", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, hip lobby, not so good service\u201d", "Author": "StrangeTripper", "ReviewID": "UR76133535", "Content": "So, i read a few other recent reviews---and there were some familiar issues...........

My trip was for a wedding and I stayed 2 nights. When i got there, the clerk told me the only room available was a SMOKING room. I'm thinking: WHAAAT?????? I thought smoking in public buildings was banned in San Fran, or even the whole state! She told me the Parc 55 somehow loopholed its way around the smoking ban... And since it was booked thru Priceline, there's no guarantee of what type of room you get, so she said.... OK, so i accepted it. The entire 8th floor is smoking, so when i got off the elevator, it hit me like a ton of bricks.... The room was a bit better, but when i woke up the next morning, i had a headache... Meanwhile, my wife learned of my situation and called the Parc 55 to raise hell. The manager said she will make sure i have a non smoking room my 2nd night. Well, she came through with her promise and it was great! In conclusion, eliminate the smoking floor, and you have a great hotel in a great location. The rooms (and bathrooms) were roomy and not gloomy. The beds were comfortable. The lobby was kinda cool and hip, as was the restaurant, from what i could tell....

I loved every single thing about the Parc. I might add that most of my co-workers that stayed at the HIlton were so jealous that I had a view and better accommodations. Tip for those of you that may have a conference at the Hilton stay here! You can walk out the side door near the Thai restaurant and cross the street and you are at the back door of the Hilton. So convenient and you don\u2019t have to deal with the conference crowds. First thing off the escalator I was greeted by Elmer and his smiling face. This was such a joy after a long flight and a horrible shuttle ride. Thanks to you guys here at Tripadvisor I knew to ask for a room on a higher floor due to the noise. So I asked Elmer if he could put me on a higher floor and boy did he! I was on the 28th floor with a wonderful view and an air purifier. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I never had a problem with noise at all and I would sleep with my curtain open just to have the view in the morning when I woke up. My bed was so comfortable and the air purifier was such a plus in helping me sleep that I am actually going to buy one this weekend. Now some important info for the ladies :) The bathroom was stocked with Gilchrist and Soames shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, scope mouthwash, facial soap and bath soap. The shower had great water pressure and was so relaxing after 8 hours of classes and 4 hours of site seeing. I did have an issue with my keycards constantly being deactivated but this too was not a problem and Mavis always fixed me right up. I have to say being a single female staying here made me feel completely safe and this was in part due to the keycard issue. Once I explained to Mavis that my card didn't work and my driver\u2019s license was in my room she was very kind and helpful with getting a security guard up to my room. The additional times it happened she still checked my ID and never failed at protecting my safety. In addition, there was a housekeeper cleaning my room one day during my lunch break and I told her I didn't want to startle her but I was there for lunch. She said she needed my key and of course it did not work. :) She jumped right into action and said I could not come in and called security. She was too cute guarding my stuff until security got there and I might add in less than a minute. She continued to apologize once my identity was verified and I told her that I was very pleased to know that I am safe here and don't have to worry. I wish I knew her name but I do not. If management reads this please give her recognition for her bravery and fast response to a potential crisis in room 2815 on 08/10/10 (I think that is the correct date). My only complaint is they give you 2 bottles of wine (additional charge) but no corkscrew and believe me I tore that room apart :-P I also have to say that I never once missed the internet as I have seen complaints on here about the charge. You are in SF get out and enjoy and if that email is that important they have computers on the second floor. I walked by numerous times and they were empty and I never felt the urge to get on. At home I am on this thing nonstop so I guess it was a much needed break. Finally, I highly recommend the Parc 55 because it\u2019s clean, comfy and SAFE! The staff here is the absolute best hotel staff I have ever encountered and I travel all over the world. I really am just overwhelmed at the kindness and professionalism of all the staff including front desk, security, restaurant, housekeeping, concierge and valet they all treated me with the utmost respect and courtesy.

I thought going from one 4* to another would be an easy transition to comparable accommodations, but it wasn't and it quickly became clear to me that this hotel is not a 4*. At check in, I was told I could only have a smoking room, which is totally unacceptable to me. I asked if there was anything else non-smoking available, but the attendant said that because I used Priceline I had to have the smoking room (number of beds was not an issue to me as a solo traveler). While I have been using Pricline for years and do realize that this is a possibility, I have never actually had a problem getting a non-smoking room. She said she would check with a manager, but for whatever reason she did not need to and was able to open a room on a lower floor for me. She made me feel like I should be praising her for going out of her way, and that I shouldn't really be getting a non-smoking room. So, I had to settle for the horrible 5th floor you may read other reviews about. On top of my neighbors playing music literally 24/7, the view was horrible (eye level to an AC unit), and the beds were just awful. I hope they're better on the other floors, but if not this hotel should really look into upgrading them. They're super springy and not comfy at all. Had horrible sleep and wish I had just splurged for the extra night at my other hotel. I will say it is a great location for shopping and BART, but I definitely don't think it's 4*. I think if they upgraded the beds and lighting in the halls, and addressed the sound issues (the ear plugs they offer are mearly a bandage to a larger issue), they could get to 4*, but IMO I would say this is a 3-3.5* property.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst hotels I've ever stayed...\u201d", "Author": "Jason H", "ReviewID": "UR75134400", "Content": "One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in.

We got a fantastic rate and it was just behind the boutique Hotel we staid last time (Hotel Abri). Now the reality! Check-in ======= Be prepared to hand over your credit card, they wouldnt take a cash deposit for our room - I've never had a problem at any other hotel before (if you are travelling to multiple destinations you know how annoying it can be if all money is tied up in pre-authorisations). What was most concerning is that the check in lady simply started swiping away and charging my card before she'd even told me what she was doing or what the amount was Then on checkout we saw the fineprint on our bill that the hotel policy is that the funds dont get released by the hotel for up to two days after you actually checkout. Rooms ====== I STRONGLY suggest you ask for a room on a high floor or you wont be able to sleep. The rooms were clean and neatly appointed. Other things worth noting ================== Gym - Really good - good range of machines and free weights, all brand new. No Pool No Guest Laundry No in room safe - small deposit boxes (passport size) are available at reception Location ====== Generally good, the hotel located close to shopping in Union Square, Westfield San Fran Centre, cable cars, and street cars. If you catch the train (the BART) its easy and cheap but so you aren't shocked, there are a heap of homeless people that congregate around the BART station, it can be quite confronting if you arent expecting it. The area behind the hotel is pretty seedy as well worth being careful Overall ===== If I had to compare this hotel versus Hotel Abri where we stayed last time I would hands down choose the Abri.

Hotwire has this hotel set as a 4 star, which I disagree with... I would give it max 3.5 stars. That being said, the hotel has its good (and best) point: location!! The BART station is right in front, the cable car turnaround is a block away and there is a streetcar stop right across the street. All your necessary means of transportation are at your disposal. Though I do see what some reviewers said about it being on a \"seedy\" part of town, I never felt unsafe walking around, though the latest we were out was around 10PM. The outside/public areas of the hotel are gorgeous. They have these amazing San Francisco \"scenes\" (cable car, painted ladies, gg bridge, etc) carved into the walls outside by the entrance behind the valet parking attendant. The lobby is also very big and modern. The service is ok. The staff are polite enough, but not overly personable. If you are looking for that, I wouldn't stay here. That doesn't bother me so much, so it wasn't an issue. I did, however, feel that because we were \"pre-paid\" customers, that we weren't \"worth\" getting our room request. It ended up working out in our favor but felt a little snubbed, lol. Another note, this hotel has smoking rooms. I'm not sure if this is the norm in San Francisco (I thought the city was generally about good health!) but that surprised me. We almost ended up with one but luckily a non-smoking room turned up! (Phew). Ah yes, about the noise, we asked for a room AWAY from the cable car turnaround and heard nothing at night or during the day. Earplugs not needed! The rooms are ok. Very clean, which is super important. Modern-looking, really very typical. Big enough, it had a small double couch in it, though made it feel a little tight. A few things though. The room did not have much drawer space at all. There is a closet to hang stuff but only a few hangers. It also did not have a safe, which really surprised me. I had thought that was the norm in hotels these days, maybe I'm wrong. The hotel does have safe deposit boxes at the desk but seemed annoying to have to go up and down to get things so we didn't bother with it. Actually, housekeeping was great and didn't really throw ANYTHING away unless it was obviously supposed to be so I actually had no problem with leaving stuff unlocked (though I didn't leave it out in plain view, of course)! There also isn't a fridge in the room. This may be expecting too much. But when we walked in, the TV is on a huge stand that when opened looked like a fridge should have been in it, but just had open space. Maybe it was supposed to be there? No idea. Anyway, overall this hotel isn't a bad choice. The location is great, the rooms are clean and the staff is polite enough.

But if you looked at the little details...the outlets were old and discolored and dirty, the frame of the mirror in the bathroom had some touch-up work done with a paint that doesn't match the frame. The patches stood out like a sore thumb. The towels were hard. There was a phone in the bathroom which was a nice touch except it looked like it was from the 70s. It looked oddly out of date. The heating/cooling was loud and didn't work very well. It was the little touches that separate a good place from a great place. Also there was no safe in the room. That being said the staff was all very nice and did their best to accommodate with the exception being that I called and asked if I could get some utensils sent to the room and it took an hour. They were very nice about it but I thought it was excessively long. The other being when I tried one night to set up a wake-up call and the front desk wasn't picking up. I let it ring over 20 times and had to call back 3 times before someone picked up. House keeping I have to say did a very nice job. When I came back to the room at the end of the day it was nicely freshened up. I had a \"special rate\" for the conference I was at, which looking at their current posted full rates for this week were actually higher, which of course is annoying.

Really great workout room. When we checked in, we were offered a room one or two beds. We honestly had no preference and were given a 2-bed room not knowing it would cost an extra $20 per night.

SERIOUSLY??? that's the best story you could come up within 3 blocks worth of time? my take is that the valet driver probably almost ran someone over and didnt want to tell the truth in fear of the consequences... and come on, no windshield could be smashed the way ours was with someone's hand without flesh bits and blood smeared all over our car. the police came and filed a report, and even they did not believe the guy. \"why didnt you call us at the time of the incident?\" they asked him. he gave no real response. these valet drivers have been trained to have a police report done ANY TIME there's an incident, so this driver's failure to abide company policy was quite suspicious to me. but i thot, \"whatever. as long as they can fix this situation and reimburse us, i'll let bygones be bygones.\" boy was i wrong... management (atrocious): i informed the valet manager that we expected to be reimbursed for the costs of windshield reparation and that i wanted a refund for my night's stay as compensation for the inconvenience of this whole ordeal. he said that he would have to talk to the hotel manager about this. fine. 45 minutes later, the hotel manager came up to me and said, \"so i hear you expect a refund.\" WOW no introductions, no apology, no explanation.. nothing. she claims that the hotel should not be responsible for the actions of its valet department... ooo-kayy. and the timeline for reimbursement for the windshield supposedly is indefinite as such claims are in yet another department that is third party. allllrighty then. conclusion: so it's been about 4 months and about 20 phone calls had been made harassing management for reimbursement since the incident. the check for windshield reimbursement finally arrived and cleared a couple days ago. so the last thing i must do to FULLY right this wrong is to write a horrible review of the hotel.

My room was on the 18th floor in a corner view room, it was nice the bed was decent not the most comfortable, but the thing that caught my attention was the Ear plugs that are provided on the bathroom counter i just thought they were for picky guests. That night i soon realized why the yellow ear plugs are put in the room. I was 18 floors up and it sounded like my bed was on the shoulder of the freeway with firetrucks driving by every 10min or so, i used the ear plugs all 4 nights. On saturday night i was woke by the fire alarm going off, so i got dressed and went into the hall and asked an emploee if there was a fire they said they werent sure and to go back to my room!? not the most safety conscious hotel after this incident i had a drunk guy knocking on my door half naked for 15min until security finally came up after the 3rd phone call to the front desk, worst hotel experience i have ever had.

We went to \"our\" room only to find that the desk clerk gave us the keys to an already occupied room, needless to say we were all horrified to walk into someone else's room, a complete violation of customer safety and privacy. After informing the desk clerk of his mistake he rolled his eyes at me and acted like it was no big deal. We spoke with another desk clerk and what do you know we get a room with a king bed.(The ones that apparently didn't exist only 15 mins ago.) We couldn't sleep at all because the hotel is made out of paper. We could here every single noise from the streets below to the rooms on all sides and we were 25 stories up! and yet could hear conversations on the street like they were in the room with us. To top off the already less than satisfactory experience I got my car from the valet only to find that they damaged my brand new car's paint job.

Somewhat met expectations, but some caveats for you: LOCATION: Very convenient walk to tourists' heaven = On the outer edge of Union Square shopping and very close to Market St (street trams) & Westfield Shopping mall, as well as Powell St Cable Car terminus. Plenty of restaurants in the area. It is also however, on the edge of the Tenderloin district ... which can be gritty and touch-n-go at night especially. Hold onto your wallets and children! (I exaggerate a little) ROOM: Spacious, clean and comfortable, but minimalist approach. Some background: Asked for a corner room, which with some additional 'nudging' we finally received from a somewhat reluctant, unsmiling front desk. Probably didn't help that I booked thru Hotwire at low rate for SF. When asked a second front desk person to see if can change room to higher floor facing away from Market St (due to some street noise), was only offered lower floors ... again, probably due to rate. Went with original. The room was on 13th floor, overlooking Market St. Room included a full-sleeper sofa with coffee table, desk & chair, flat-screen TV with connection panel (remote was worn out with no #s on many keys), and king bed. NO SAFE in room, and no minibar/fridge, but coffee-maker was available. Toiletries provided were tiny, used up very quickly ... not even enough for one person, esp. body-wash, shampoo ... bring your own or need to ask for more! Decor was basic. Bed was comfortable, though mattress a tad hard. Couch was comfortable for 2 sitting. Sink drain was plugged up, and could not raise stopper, so water filled sink quickly ... though did go down slowly .... DECOR: Lobby had a large set of stairs and escalators to 2nd level registration/front desk, but just 4 chairs for guests for such a large area. Front desk area had a small semi-couch, and then it was bar/restaurant. No decor, colors ... drab ... almost sterile and uninviting. SERVICE: Very disinterested staff at front desk, from check-in to check-out. It wasn't that busy, so not sure why not friendlier, welcoming ... maybe us? but same to others. Did not use valet, bellhop, room service, gym/spa ... so cannot assess. OVERALL: We would have rated it 3.5 stars/circles instead of 4 if available. Would we stay here again? Maybe, on the likely side. Depends on rate. If you're looking for a relatively comfortable, somewhat basic hotel, close to many conveniences (i.e.-Cable Car, shopping, BART, restaurants, etc.), this will do. Our suggestion: request a corner room, highest possible. Street noise not an issue, but we're from a large city .. so, no biggie.

We decided before the trip that instead of taking a taxi, we would take the BART. It was more than half the price cab fare would have been and it was fast, easy to use, comfortable and convenient. We noticed that a lot of other travelers were also using the BART. If you take the BART to the Powell Street station, the hotel is just across the street. It doesn't get more convenient than that. Check-in at the hotel was a breeze. Mavis helped us with our room and she was very friendly and chatted with us about our stay. She put us in a corner room on the 17th floor with lovely views of the City through the two large windows on two sides of the room. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, closet with an alcove for your luggage, large flat screen TV, writing table, coffee table, and couch. The bed was very comfortable and after long days spent walking around town, it felt really good to sleep on such a comfortable mattress. The shower was very good too with a massaging shower head and plenty of hot water. The room was always kept in excellent condition by the cleaning staff. At night there was street noise like police sirens and car horns honking but it was never so bad that you couldn't fall asleep. It was more like background noise than anything else and didn't have any negative impact on our trip. The hotel was very modern looking, clean and impressive. The elevators were always very fast and you never had to wait long for one. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is close to everything - BART, Municipal transportation, cable cars, shopping (Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Tiffany, Bloomingdale's ... just to name a few) and restaurants. Everything is just steps from the hotel which made the location ideal. We went to see \"Wicked!\" our second night there. During the daytime, we had walked to the theatre to see how far it was from the hotel It was a bit of a walk and we wouldn't have minded walking there to see the show but we noticed that along the way, there were many (and by many I mean A LOT) of homeless people and people smoking pot. For some reason the theatre is located in a very shady neighborhood. This is coming from someone who lives in New York City and sees shady people on a normal basis and thinks nothing of it but what we saw there took it to another level. In fact, there wasn't a single day where we didn't smell someone smoking pot or where we weren't standing near someone who reeked of it. It was nasty. Also, we've never seen such a concentrated mass of homeless people anywhere either. Anyway, not too many of them approached us or bothered us but a word of advice would be to take the BART from the hotel one stop to the Civic Center and get to the theatre that way. That's what we did and that's what many other theatre goers did as well. It's cheap, fast and safe. If you plan on going to Alcatraz and booked tickets, you can go right onto Market Street by the hotel and take the F-line Streetcar right to Pier 33 where the ferry to Alcatraz is located. When you get back from Alcatraz, you can take a short walk to Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf). There you can find shopping and a whole lot of restaurants. Then when you're done, just take the F-line Streetcar back to the hotel. If you plan on going to the Golden Gate Bridge, you can take the Municipal Bus there and just ask your bus driver for a transfer ticket although they really do automatically give you one. The transfer ticket is good for a few hours so you can hop on and off buses until it runs out. Not bad for two dollars. You'll need to take the 45 bus (we hopped on while in Chinatown) to Chestnut and Laguna and then get off and transfer to the 28 bus. The 28 bus will drop you off a few steps from the Golden Gate Bridge. That's what we did and it was pretty easy and convenient. We walked part of the bridge until it started to rain and we had to turn back. When going back, be aware that there are two 28 buses that stop there. You need to make sure you get on the 28 bus headed to Fort Mason and not the one headed to Daly City. The Fort Mason 28 bus will bring you back to Chestnut and Laguna where you can get off and transfer back to the 45 bus. As for food, we didn't have the best of luck finding good food while in town. We ate at a Chinese place by the hotel called Tian Sing. It was the most expensive dim sum I ever ate in my life! We had one plate of vegetable lo mein and about 6 different dim sum and a pot of tea and it cost us about forty-five dollars! I almost fainted. In NYC that would have cost us like $20 maybe. So yeah we wouldn't recommend eating there. We also wouldn't recommend Blondie's Pizza. Being from NYC, we know what good pizza is and Blondie's was inedible. It was too doughy and had practically zero tomato sauce. We had pizza another night (because nothing else was open) from Pizza Prada and that was much better. It wasn't too doughy and had a decent amount of sauce. I know this is going to sound absolutely insane but it's so true ... the BEST pizza was at the airport! I swear to you. It was from Firewood Pizza and it was amazing. They make it fresh to order and it was like brick oven pizza with a thin, but not too thin, crackly crust, a flavorful generous heaping of sauce, mozzarella and fresh sliced tomatoes with basil. I know ... the airport?! But yes ... the airport. Crazy but true and trust me ... you have to try it! Okay so back to town. We also ate at the hotel's Thai restaurant (Siam Thai) twice. The food was good but sometimes they could have used some more spice or something to make the food more flavorful. They could have also used more sauce in their pad thai because it was too dry. We ate at Boudin Bakery where we both had bread bowls filled with soup. One word - Amazing. The bread is fresh, flavorful and so good and the soup was just delicious. My fiance had the clam chowder and I had the rustic tomato. If you're going to eat anywhere, we positively recommend Boudin Bakery. They have a location at Fisherman's Wharf and another location bu Ghirardelli Square. There was also a location by the hotel and on Friday night we wanted to eat there so badly but when we got there at 7:00 it was closed and we were so devastated and that's when we went to Pizza Prada. We also ate at Bellini and had the bruschetta, garlic bread and the capellini pomodoro. The food there was really good and was actually much better than I thought it would be. We wanted to see the sea lions but while we were there, reports on the news stated that the sea lions were gone and that scientists believed that they left due to the dwindling food supply. In the end, we would definitely recommend the Parc 55 Hotel.

The lack of WiFi is a pain--we were able to hijack some nearby company's WiFi with a few attempts at the most obvious passwords so it wasn't a real problem.

We bought a five-day MetroCard and it worked great with the iPhone's googlemap feature. Try MOMA, the Tea Room in Yorba Linda Park by the Metreon, and the Press Club, a really upscale wine tasting bar just down the street.

We normally do this every year and have stayed at various hotels, however, this hotel became a favorite of ours in the city. We found awesome rates on the web and decided to give this hotel a try. We live about 2 hours south of San Francisco and decided to stay for the weekend in downtown. We stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel and I was simply amazed how nice it was, and how close it was to almost everything! This was our first time staying there, and we truly enjoyed our stay . Upon check in, the woman that assisted us was very kind and informative about the hotel. This hotel was recently renovated and re opened a couple of months ago. What was even more nice was she even upgraded our room to the 28th floor belonging to the Executive Level. Having a room at the Executive Level provided awesome views and complimentary breakfast at their clubroom on the 31st floor. The rooms had a nice contemporary look to it, plenty of space, and were very clean! The beds were very comfy as well! The hotel is situated in a widely popular centralized shopping area. It's right acoss the street from the San Francisco center and Bloomingdales. And right around the corner, not even a block away, is Powell St. which leads you to Union Square as well as Market Street. So you can imagine all the shopping and dining you can conquer being that the hotel was so close to everything! At night we walked up about 2 blocks up Powell Street to the Sir Francis Drake hotel where they have a nice dining lounge at their very top floor with amazing views of the city called the Starlight Room. There are also so many others that are only a walking distance away! The only downside we experienced was the valet parking. It was way too much. They charged $45 a day. So even though we felt we scored awesome rates staying at this hotel, the cost of valet makes it even more costly. But that's usually what you should expect in the city. There are parking garages nearby for half the rate, however they're not as close as you think and you'd still have quite a walk to the hotel. Overall, this hotel is awesome. If you want to stay centralized to everything, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

The location was perfect for the sights we wanted to see. The parking at the hotel was about $50 a day with tax but most parking in that neighborhood is $40 or more. The vallet guys were quick and careful, thanks! Check in was hassle free and the concierge was very helpful. If you are going to the King Tut exhibit or Alcatraz tour, get your tickets in advance. The room was clean and comfortable. I wasn't crazy about the mattress but the kiddo and hubby didn't mind. We ate at the Italian resturant right next door, Puccini & Pinetti. We all really liked it. The pumpkin cheesecake was great! I read other comments about the riff raff around the hotel but that's all over downtown. My husband and I have stayed a few times at the St. Francis and we saw even more homeless types being right across from the square.

Of course we heard sirens at night, but it's not a bed & breakfast in Vermont, it's a downtown hotel so you should expect that. The CityPass was a great buy. the Muni 7 day Pass is a must.

Our room, on the 12th floor, was our base for exploring and for take-out food at night. The room was very clean and well-maintained (one evening housekeeping brought a bed bolster that we never knew was missing). Large LG flat-screen TV was fine, on a credenza with multiple electronic media outlets and two cables in drawer. View was reasonable and nicely lit up at night. Loveseat/sofabed combo, small coffee table, desk and desk chair all allowed comfy seating and relaxing/snacking. Water bottles provided in room at $4.50 USD for 1 liter each were pricey: instead, run to the corner and half a block east to Walgreens and grab a sixpack of H2O. We didn't use the small coffeemaker, but ran to Starbucks and local coffee places each morning (expect 15-20 minute waits, coffeehouses stay busy). Air conditioning (internal unit) was responsive, audible but not too loud. By the way, there are vents under each window that roll open to allow fresh air in! I didn't notice these until the third day. We didn't visit the hotel restaurant but it looked elegant and the menu was appealing. There are numerous restaurants within a block or two: Indian/Pakistani, Thai, sushi, Irish, Italian, pizza, etc. (Punjab was our favorite, on the southwest corner behind the hotel.) The bartender did pour generously on our visit to the bar, and the space was welcoming with relaxing chairs and careful lighting. The Parc 55 is located near the Powell Street transport station, so it's near buses, underground, surface rail, and streetcars. Easy walking distance to shopping, museum area, Union Square, and a bit longer hike to Chinatown. Taxis are queued for longer trips. On noise: San Francisco is a busy city. You will hear traffic, fire engines, police sirens, and sometimes loud voices frequently during the day and night, no matter WHERE you stay.

I had wanted to go up to SF for a couple days but was tentative of commiting to the purchase a hotel room due to the threat of a BART STRIKE...Getting into the city would of been VERY problematic. (see parking tip) Now, since my trip was Last minute (No Strike, but I was told many Bay Area people took that monday off because they expected horrible traffic issues) I was having issues making a SF purchase on Priceline with the usual hotels I like. Usually I try to pay between 80-100 = taxes.. I tried the PARC 55 site which has a room for 125ish a night without taxes. I kept clicking around for specials on their site. I found a NON-REFUNDABLE special for the same room for 102 a night (two nights with taxes was 235...PERFECT!!). The hotel is close to the POWELL STATION...I knew it was SAFE, CLEAN and though VERY large doesn't feel so which is why I liked it the last time I visited. My biggest issue my last visit was the lack of consistent Internet...I actually called PARC 55 to ask them if it was more stable. They said they thought so. They also mentioned that the Internet cafe around the corner I mentioned in my last review is closed for 6 months of remodeling ( FYI) The hotel has done a remodel since I visited last. Check in is now in a much more modern area on the second floor. They let me check in early at 12pm which was pleasant since I had been driving from LA and on thr BART for 40 min . The lobby was full of people but not a long wait. Originally they were going to put me in a 13th floor room but I asked my receptionist if they had anything with a view..She upgraded me to the 23th floor which was VERY appreciated by me.Sometimes being pleasant, asking with a smile makes a difference...AlsoTheir new lobby/close by bar area welcomed the NEW York Mets...I heard this is a hotel for a lot of the teams... My room was as I remembered, big bathroom with a cimfy bed, I did like that they no longer used LATHER for products which I though were sucky on my last stay. THE INTERNET was $12.95 a day but WORKED perfectly. they had both wireless and plug in. I was VERY HAPPY! AREA COMPARISION: Since I know the city better this time around I can confidently tell you that this location is WAY better then the Union Hilton and Hotel Nikko. Though they are only a block away sometimes you can feel it in a city such as SF. Plus both those hotels looked SOOO BUSY. **PARKING TIP: Go to the BART SITE, buy an extended parking permit ($5 a day,not 24 hours) Then take the BART into the city. Parking in SF can be 35-50 a day depending on the area. 3 days of parking (15) + a roundtrip from pleasanton (10.55) was = $26 bucks... Also If it is a three day weekend, that Monday parking is free! ***Dining. Hotel is super close to a SUBWAY, WALGREENS (buy water), COLDSTONE, PIZZA PLACE within a block. There is a nearby Chinese Resturant. My fave is PUCCINI & PINETTI off Ellis and Cyril Magnin..GREAT happy hour ($3 champagene but not boozy.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ABQ", "Title": "\u201cReview with cheap tips for travel on a budget\u201d", "Author": "Planbhorizon", "ReviewID": "UR38906353", "Content": "Location: My girlfriend and I decided it was time for another San Fran trip.

The view was amazing! but you have to pay a lil extra to get the best sides. There is no fridge that is free or even a small microwave so all our leftovers always went fast. The shower was blah and high pressured. the drainage was HORRIBLE .. before you know it you were standing in 4 inches of water and a load gurrggling sound of the drain desperate to make way for the dirty water. gross!

I am a regular traveler, staying in hotels about once every other month or so for several days, and I have stayed in several other hotels in SF that are rated the same as the Parc 55. The biggest difference between these hotels is that the Parc 55 really doesn't seem to value customer service. There was a convention going on during my stay, but from what the staff said there is usually a convention going on. This might have had an effect on my service, but if conventions are a regular event, then I doubt the service improves much from week to week. The good: I got a Club room on the 29th floor and the room and view were beautiful. The breakfast was delicious and varied and I was very glad I upped my reservation for this alone. The bad: The service in general was awful, but be especially wary of the bell staff. When I first arrived my luggage was loaded on to a cart and taken up to meet me at the 2nd floor registration. During the 5 minutes of travel time a small bag containing cash and other valuables went missing. When I pointed this out I was asked to check my car, person, etc. to make sure I had not misplaced it. I did and the bag was just gone, but I know for a fact it was on the cart. This was dismissed by the staff when I brought it to their attention and I was not even offered an apology. Then, on my last day, I had a bellman up to my room to collect my bags and AGAIN during the trip from my room to the bell staff area downstairs THREE items were lost. I was again told to check my room, person, etc. to make sure I hadn't lost these items. Unlikely, as the missing items were a fedora hat, a foam pillow and a t-shirt that was on the pillow. I did as I was asked, but my items were nowhere to be found. I was then berated by a bellman who insisted that I had lost the items on my own. I asked repeatedly for the bell staff to check the service halls and elevator for my missing items, but I was told they were not there. I spoke with managers, bell staff, housekeeping, everyone they could shunt me off to, but no one was helpful at all. I finally had to leave without my items, but I took the names and phone numbers of those involved. I called the next day and spoke with another manager who SHOCKINGLY said, why yes, those items are sitting here in our lost and found.

Had a double with two full beds. - No functional problems with lights, heating/cooling, internet. The Not-So-Good: - Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at noon (completely understandable). I was told by the attendant that a room had been set aside for me but needed to be cleaned; I should return at 3pm. When I returned at 3pm, I was checked in by a different attendant, who informed me that the first guy had never tagged the assigned room for cleaning, so the room was still not ready. After a short wait, however, she was able to find another room for us. - They have a limited number of small storage lockers in which guests can lock their computers when leaving luggage on your check-in or check-out day. However, if all of the lockers are already taken, they would not take the responsibility of checking my computer bag, and I was stuck lugging it around hilly SF on my check-in day while waiting for my room to be ready. I made sure to check my computer bag early on my check-out day to avoid a repeat of that situation. - No minibar/fridge. Very small in-room safe. Very limited drawer space, though the closet was sizeable. - it's never a good sign when the hotel purposely provides earplugs in every room. Having read the prior reviews about thin walls, the sight of the earplugs was worrisome. However, I never had any problems with noise during my stay. The Just-Plain-Weird: After an extensive recent makeover, you would think that this reasonably handsome hotel would try to exude a cooler vibe. Yet, on my various trips through the main lobby area, my ears were greeted by songs like the theme from Footloose. While I don't mean to insult Kenny Loggins, it just seemed odd for a hotel in an enviable location in a chic city - nothing wrong with this, just odd.

With some reviews I've read, it wasn't supposed to be good, but it was far better than I thought. I'll mention four things I noticed that others may want to know. First: Service. When we checked in, the first lady I met wasn't too friendly, and I feared the worst. Having been there too early to check in, I went into the city to sight see before coming back to check in. The second lady I had was very nice, welcoming, and interactive. Many of the staff I had encountered from then on were exactly the same. Even in the morning, the house cleaning lady was very persistent to clean our room (Someone took our Do not Disturb sign) but that was a nice sign too. Second: noise. My response, \"What noise?\" yeah, there was the sound of traffic outside, but it wasn't too bad in my opinion. Given I was on the 10th floor, it shouldn't be too bad. On lower floors I can see it being a problem, and they know that too. That's why they provide ear plugs in the restroom. You could possibly ask for extra pairs if needed. The only reason my friend needed it was in the morning when the building next door was doing construction work. There was a crane outside our window! haha that's the only bad thing that we noticed noise-wise though. Walls aren't as thin as others claim. The hotel was pretty busy but didn't have any bothersome sounds through the floor, roof, or walls. Third: Area. If you're a music lover,then you'll be happy. The hotel is roughly 4 blocks (don't quote me on that) away from the hotel. My friend and I walked to the concert hall 45 minutes before the concert, and got there 15 minutes early. The area has a few interesting characters, but we did notice that the BART police and SF police did patrol the area and so we felt fine. Fourth: Look. The outside doesn't look like much (to me anyway), but on the inside it is beautiful. The bar and restaurant area is a beautiful area to hang out and relax, and the staff there is very attentive. and here are a few prices you may want to know: The water in the hotel room are $4.50 + tax, and they're 1 liter. The internet costs roughly $12 and it is good for 24 hours. Parking is roughly $55. and they put a $50 deductible on your account when you check in (as many hotels do) Also, any purchases at the bar (I'm not sure about the restaurant, but it should be the same) are charged directly to your room, so no need to fuss with money at the moment. You just enjoy your time. All in all, it was a fantastic stay. I certainly enjoyed myself, and I plan to come back again.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Groton, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Alxmaoboc", "ReviewID": "UR35314828", "Content": "The perfect hotel with a great location.

Our weekend started out rockey, cancelled flights, placed on stand-by, missed a lunch cruise but, our stay and weekend was perfect. We stayed at Parc 55 this past weekend for the 3rd and 4th of July 09. This was our 4th wedding anniversary. Deciding to stay at Parc55 was decided after a few calls late night calls to the hotel with questions, and each time we were transferred to the front desk staff and based on the helpfulness of this staff I booked two nights. The questions I asked were not just hotel matters but, on items such as getting around and things to see and do. They made recommendations for Breakfast, Lunch even Dinner, none of which disappointed us. Although they will not grant early check-ins, I was told that I could check bags with the Bell desk for keeping if we were going sightseeing until we checked-in. We arrived back later that afternoon (Friday July, 3) at the front desk and to my surprise the hotel had upgraded us to a premier view suite with a balcony on the 30th floor due to it being our wedding anniversary. The room was five stars all the way with everything down to the Turkish bath robes to the King bed with feather pillows with chocolates. The front desk person was one of the most pleasant people I met during our entire stay in San Francisco. The people at the front desk really took the time to provide the care that is not often found with a large hotel especially when they cater to a large volume of business from airlines and conventions; CISCO was having a convention at the time. Although I was extremely satisfied with the staff of the front desk and bell desk and quality of the room... I cannot say the same about the hostess and host in the Cityhouse restaurant / bar, our waitress was wonderful. I typically wear Jeans and Polo shirts with jogging shoes and can afford to dress however I like and have no need to impress anyone, the Hostess especially, made us feel like I she was advising us that I may not have enough money to eat or drink in their restaurant and could I afford it? The Host just ignored us than looked the other way and walked away almost offended? Go figure, I\u2019ll spend more on lunch than he makes in a week. We chose to have a couple of glasses of good red wine and eat at one of the upscale restaurants in town. I am giving this hotel a 5 star because the view from our room was wonderful, the staff, excluding the hostess / host in the restaurant, were first class and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Also, the location the location could not be better. The F-Line electric buss go to Fisherman\u2019s Warf and the Powell- Hyde cable car line is across the road which gives access straight to Union Square (only a quick walk away anyway) right down to the piers on the waterfront for $5 a ride (if you are in San Francisco more than a day buy a mutli-pass 3day ticket it\u2019s $18.00 it is not sold on the cars only at a ticket window). Tourist Information office is just adjacent to it too, as is the giant five floor shopping mall with many upscale stores in it. Going to and from the Airport is a fun ride on the BART for a round trip cost of $16.00 and takes about 60 minutes. The BART Station is a block away from the hotel.

When reporting the complaint to the desk they did not resolve the matter after continuing to hear the noise and disruption for another 20 mins, I called again, finally speaking to a security personnel who resolved the matter.

The sirens are the biggest culprit at all hours of the night, but it's something you get used to pretty quickly. The hotel is really nice and the rooms are comfortable. The views are amazing. We are certainly in the category of budget travelers who were pleasantly surprised that this hotel showed up on a Priceline bid. We were double upgraded at check in. Our Priceline rate assured us a Deluxe Room (up to the 19th floor with a king bed). We asked for a high room and got a 20th floor View Room (20th-26th floors) with two double beds. The double beds are considered an upgrade at this hotel....at least price wise. We were very satisfied. No problems at check in, but we did not get in until 8:30 p.m......no line at all. We liked the 37\" flat screen TV and the 5 soft pillows on each bed. The noise kept us up the first night, but we did better with our sleep from there. No problems with housekeeping. The room was very clean. Thanks to the great information on Trip Advisor, we knew not to rent a car. We were glad to avoid the very high nightly parking rates and the hotel is right on The Powell Station for BART and the cable car turnaround. It was easy to get around town. We bought a City Pass at the Visitor's Center at the Powell Station and it was a reasonable value. We did not use the Internet service or the restaurant. There was a nice mall acroos the street with cheaper dining options. The business center would have cost us $20.00 to print out our boarding passes, but the Concierge did it without charge.....and we tipped for the courtesy. The bellman was very accommodating and held our bags after checkout so we could sight see with free hands up until 2:30 p.m. when we needed to head for the airport. We were pleased with the hotel.

The rooms have been upgraded with new furniture and linens, but they left the old carpet (really, just change it), and the rather old wallpaper. However, they are clean and neat.

Well of course I opted for the suite, BUT when I got there, it was a bit nasty - stained carpet, horrible view - not so great bathroom, so I went back downstairs and asked if I could see the Deluxe I reserved. They said sure, and when I went to that room, it was much cleaner, nice view, just better overall - I kept that room and told them no thanks to the upgraded suite. During check in, after they took my id and credit card, they informed me that they just charged my credit card and extra $100. per day - surprise! Apparently it is their policy to charge this for any incidentials that you might rack up during your stay. For me it was an extra $500 seeing I was staying for 5 nights. I protested a bit letting the clerk know that she really should not charge one's credit card without their knowledge. It is unacceptable to inform me AFTER the fact. With that she said she would reverse that charge, and just have me pre-pay for the room. I still don't know what that was all about. But I did not feel too comfortable with all the charging and reversing she did on my credit card, so when I got settled in my room, I called my credit card company to see what just went on. Well I am glad I did because she charged me twice for the room and twice for the incidentials and only reversed one of the incidentials charges. I call the front desk and explained what I just learned and at first they were a bit pompus and said they will explain how a credit card works. When I told them I was clearly aware how a credit card works and didn't need their lesson, they did indeed correct the charges (as I verified the next day with my credit card company).

We bought the City-Pass, and it was the best thing we did. We could get on and off of any type of transportation, (trolley, cable car, bus anything except taxi's) without paying extra, and it included coupons for many attractions. This also can be purchased right across the street at the Visitors Center. Take Lorries Shuttle from the airport to the hotel for about $16 pp, and they will give you a coupon for your return trip for $12 pp The bellman services were exceptional.

Firstly, the executive lounge located on the 32nd floor is tiny and bleak. It can be a real scrum to get breakfast first thing in the morning, and about 50% of the time, it wasn't even possible to get a seat in the lounge. The staff in the lounge aren't particularly helpful either. There's nothing executive about the experience. The staff aren't particularly helpful either. The number of times we called the front desk to speak to a manager and were told they were either in a meeting or unavailable was extraordinary. They always promised a call back, and without exception (on 3 occassions) that call never came. WARNING: use the in-room safe. The hotel publicity states that safety deposit boxes are available at reception, but they are actually in the room. We had over $200 stolen from our room and whilst the wannabe cop who is the director of security was initially helpful, we never had contact from him again. Customer service in the hotel is a real let down, which is a shame, because the hotel is in a fantastic location and comes at a great price. All in all, my advice is don't spend the extra money on the executive floor. It really isn't worth it.

The location is extremely convenient - it is around the corner (less than a block) from the Powell St BART station and the beginning of the cable car route (also Powell St)! Taking the BART to and from SFO was SO EASY and definitely recommended at $5.35/person each way (much less than taking a shuttle or taxi). Union Square is only a few blocks away and Market Street is a half block (not even) to the south. The hotel staff was very polite and accomodating. They were very helpful in booking a rental car for us for the one day we left the city. We had a GREAT room on the 31st floor (2nd from the top) - with an amazing view of the city and the bay! The room was clean, plenty big enough and the (king) bed was very comfy! The only complaint is the lack of drawer space, but we made it work! The bathroom was also a good size and very clean! Also since we were so high up, we heard barely any street noise, with the exception of the occasional sirens. They also provide travel books/magazines in the rooms with GREAT suggestions for places to eat -- we found some of our best restaurants in them! The lobby is still under construction, however aside from having to head to the 2nd floor to check-in (which is very easy to do), you wouldn't know it! I never heard any noise or encountered any issues! The 2nd floor lobby area is very nice and looks as though it is supposed to be there! The restaurant was nice, but we didn't eat there - just stopped in for a drink one night before heading up to our room. Drinks were about average price for the area. There is a great bar/pub a block up from the hotel - Foley's Irish House - we frequented this place the 2nd half of the week - great beer and they ususally had live music! Overall, this was a great, convenient place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone! Insider tips: 1) Buy the Muni Passport (I believe they come in 1, 3, 5 or 7 Day passes) - it pays for itself very quickly (Cable Car ride = $5 each way)!! We used the cable cars, trolleys and buses every day - which is a very convenient way to get around! 2) Although the lines get pretty long at the cable car turn-arounds -- they usually move pretty quickly - or you can head up a block or two and jump on!", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rate, Great Location, Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hjmover", "ReviewID": "UR27892272", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel from 4/10/09-4/12/09 over Easter weekend. I landed the hotel on Priceline for a rate of $72 plus taxes and fees. Parc 55 webrates were in the mid 80's so I saved just a few bucks. The hotel was very busy when I arrived and the hotel front desk said the property was full. There was alot of activity but I am always surprised when my Priceline bid is accepeted at a hotel that says they are full. The hotel entrance is located right near the Powell Street BART so its very convenient to take the subway from the airport to the hotel. It costs $5.35 each way for about a 30 minute ride. It is is very easy to use. I got off the part and walked across the the street onto Cyril Magnin. The hotel entrance is right on the corner and one has to take an elevator up from the Cyril Magnin Street entrance to the registration desk on the second floor. I had to wait a few minutes for an elevator since their was a line. Their was a small line as well waiting to check-in but I only had to wait a few minutes. The clerk was very gracious and greeted me kindly. She made no mention on Priceline and honored my verbal request for a room on a high floor. I knew from reading tripadvisor.com that a room on a high floor would be less noisey with a nicer view. I was assigned room 2957. I was a bit disappointed when I got off the elevator to see my room was very close to the elevator and right across from the ice and soda machine. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to see a sleek, well appointed room. The room had a large king bed with nice sheets and a quality duvet. There was a flat screen tv, a small couch, a desk, three telephones, coffee maker, and a large window that had a partially blocked view of the bay and civic center area. I could see what I thought was Alcatrez. I was even more satisfied when I laid down on the bed. It was very very very comfortable. Since I am diabetic and did not see a minibar to place my insulin, I called down for a refrigerator. Housekeeping brought one to the room very quickly for no charge. I quickly umpacked my clothes for the weekend and noticed there was not to much drawere space for clothes. There were a few hangers in the closet along with two robes, but storage would be a problem for a longer stay. I checked out the bathroom which had all the stardard amenitites, a free bottle of water, a nice tub and three large, fluffy bath towels. Some of the bath amentities included ear plugs for noise and mouthwash. After checking out the room and the view I hooked up my computer via a wireless connection for $12.95 per 24 hours. The connection was strong. After checking emails, I went to the gym, which is free of charge, to work out.. The fitness center was great, It has lots of aerobic equipment, free weights, and weight machines. The room was relatively empty and I had a great work out. After the work out, I headed via BART to the Mission District for some burritos. The tacqueria's in the Mission make great, really large burrio's. I grabbing a carne asada burrito at El Farolito near the 24th and Mission BART stop for under five bucks. The burrito tasted amazing. Although there was a chill in the air I took the long walk back to the Parc 55. It took about 35-40 minutes. I walked along Mission to Gough to Market whcih is a very colorful neighborhood. Maybe there is shorter way but it was great to exercise after the filling carne asado burrito. I got up at 9 AM the next day and planned for a free City Guide walking tour of the Yerba Buena area. The tour started at 11 AM in front of St. Particks church by the Contempary Jewish Museum. I drank some fo the in-room coffee, took a long bath, and planned for a fun day exploring San Francisco. Yerba Buena Gardens is a short five minute walk from the Parc 55 so after getting dressed I headed outside. It was a bright sunny day and Union Square was packed with people. I made my way over to the St. Patricks church and there were a few people waiting for the free walking tour. The tour started at right on time and the guide was a local resident of the area. She had a real love for Yerba Buena and it showed it her presentation. She explained the history of the area and how it went from an inpoverished but nuturing community with many single occupancy hotels to a thriving area with large hotels, museums, shops, and a dynmic public garden. The tour lasted about one and one half hours and was terrific. I decided to go to another City Guide tour of the Embacadero area. It was such a nice day so I walked down to the Embarcadero. The walking tour started at 2 PM so it gave me time to grab some lunch. The pier has lots of places to eat and is very touristy. There is a fresh farmers market in front of the pier building and I would have been wiser grabbing some fresh fruit from a local merchant. Instead I went to the San Francisco Sea Food Company stall and had some fish chowder and fried oyster loaf. It costs abit over $16 and was less than enjoyable. After finishing up lunch I headed under the clock to meet the tour. There was a lot more people waiting for this tour and the area was pretty crowded with people. The guide was not as vibrant about the area but did his best to describe theis salty,sea port area of SF. This neighborhood has a colorful history and has gone through significant redevelopment. We walked in and around some of the buildings near the Embarcadero but I did not find the guide very engaging. I left the tour after about one hour and headed back to Union Square. I wanted to check out the easter flowers at Macy's which were really spectacular. Then, I headed back to the hotel to prepare for a facial appointment I made a LeBelle Day Spas which is located at 233 Grant Avenue. I had a facial at LaBelle three years prior and it was fantastic. The facialist Stella has great charisma and it was the cleanest my face has ever felt. I thought about that facial for years and could not wait to go back. I was excited for a similar experience. The spa has three levels and is not quite as male friendly as I would like. The male changing room is small but once you are ready, well, LaBelle is very pampering. After changing, I went to the waiting area where my feet were placed in a bowl on hot water. I ate some sweet honeydew melon as I waited for Stella Relaxation started to overtake me. My facial was fantastic. I am not sure how Stella does it, but my skin felt clean, fresh, and hydrated. Although, this was a bit expensive at $150+, well, it was worth every penny. It truly was two hours of bliss that ended with a clean skin and a relaxed mind. I walked back to the Parc 55 as releaxed and comfortable as I have ever felt. Later, I grabbed a quick dinner at King of Thai Noodle Shop. The duck and rice plate which was under ten bucks was fantastic. I headed back to the hotel for another quick work out and then to read before bed. It was a truly great day between the walking tours, facial, and inexpensive, delicious dinner. I slept soundly again. I woke up at 9 AM and drank some in room coffee and watched morning TV. Slowly I got up and began packing for my weekend getaway was soon heading to an end. I did have one more place I wanted to visit, so after packing most of my clothes I headed out to Chinatown to grab some dim sum at a small take out place I read about called Delicious Dim Sum. Its located at 752 Jackson Street. It was a long walk up a steep hill via Powell but I made it to Jackson. You really need to have stong legs to make it up that hill. I found Delicous Dim Sum which truly was a small little hole in the wall. I order shu mai, har gaw, and some sticky rice. It cost $5.40 which I thought was a bargain. The woman put the dim sum in a container and gave me a fork as I walked outside. I walked across the street and sat on the curb by a small alleyway. It was really interesting to sit on the street corner. watching people walk through China town as I ate this really delicious dim sum. The har gow and sticky rice were very good and the shui mai was some of the best I ever tasted. I was smiling brightly as I walked back to the Parc 55. I got back to my room and finshed packing. I looked out at the beautiful view and tried to breathe in the last parts of my nice weekend as I left my room. It took a while to finally get from the 29th floor to the ground floor with all the stops but the sun was shining as I headed across the street to grab the BART to SFO. It was a nice weekend and the Parc 55 really helped in making for a very pleasant, affordable stay.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethpage, New York", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Starting Point for Vacation\u201d", "Author": "NYGrlWnts2Trvl", "ReviewID": "UR27887290", "Content": "The Parc 55 is immediately on the corner opposite the BART (best deal to travel from SFO) and around the corner from the cable cars running on Powell Street. Although the lobby is still under construction, the signs directing you to the 2nd floor were easy to find and the bellmen were quite helpful offering to take our 1 large bag and 1 carry-on for us, as well as directing us to the elevators. The gentleman who checked us in, I think his name was Robert, was also very nice and helpful. We initially had difficulty checking in - we booked our trip with Travelocity (got a great deal on airfare and 6 nights hotel stay) but we were told Travelocity had canceled our room. After sorting everything out by calling Travelocity we were able to check in. Robert attended to us the entire time I was on my cell dealing with the issue instead of asking us to step aside so he could help someone else. The room was very nice, up on the 26th floor facing City Hall. The only street noise we could hear was sirens passing by. You couldn't hear the traffic or construction. The room was nicely decorated, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was very big. There wasn't a full dresser to put your clothes away, although this wasn't a big issue for us. The concierge was helpful in booking a rental car for us to use on the one day we planned to visit Muir Woods and Sonoma. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but had drinks one night after dinner elsewhere. The prices were comparable to if we had stayed at the restaurant for another drink. There was a great bar up the block called Foley's that had live music most nights so we ended up there a lot. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again myself. The only real negative was not all of the elevators were working, so you had to wait a few minutes at times.

Their list price is about $200-250 a night, and I paid less than that total for 2. Their website did have some specials very near to the rate I got on priceline, so poke around to find the links to the coupons and special rates. I liked it enough I might intentionally book through their own site. The desk clerk let me check in early! I was very happy about that since I had read other reviews indicating that they would be unhelpful in that regard. I also did not look like their normal clientele, but did not seem to get treated differently at all. Most of the people checking in and out were wearing suits and fine designer dresses, and I showed up with a backpacking backpack and REI fleece. This was my third trip to SF, but the first time staying in a hotel-- I used to stay at a friend's place. Some of the reviews here complain about the noise level, but, the noise level is about the same if you are staying in a residential area. San Francisco is just noisy at night. I came primarily to see Wicked again and to see the Bhutan exhibit at the Asian Art Museum. Both of those are one stop on the Muni. I also took the bus system to the Legion of Honor and once again, this hotel was a really good central starting place. It also helps that the websites for all these locations have muni directions on them from multiple places in the city. The only complaint I could make is that if I paid the full price for the hotel, the room seemed rather small. But once again, in San Francisco, there are so many people crammed into such a small area, this might be pretty standard. The Westfield Mall is right across the street, so you have plenty of restaurants. I went to the Bristol Farms grocery store at the bottom level and stocked up on fresh fruit and tea.

The good: great room, very helpful concierge, courteous staff. The bad: weird entrance, location too close to tenderloin district. First, I'll discuss the good aspects of the hotel. Upon check-in, I requested a room as high as possible, to minimize the street noise and maximize the view, and the reservation desk gratiously offered me a room on the 18th floor, provided I didn't mind waiting until it was ready at 3:00, and I accepted. ( I should explain that when you book a deluxe king room through Priceline, you can get a room only up to the 18th floor. The rooms above that are more expensive \"view\" rooms.) It was only 12:30 p.m at that point, so we went to lunch at Lori's Diner down the street and enjoyed a lunch at a 50's theme diner, very fun. Lori's is a great spot for breakfast too, $11.25 for a huge breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes,sausage, bacon. When we returned to check in at 3:30 p.m., the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a view room on the 22nd floor. Wow! Really nice, big room with big bay window overlooking city. The bed was oh so comfortable, the bathroom fantastic. Even a couch,and a flat screen tv with HBO. We loved the room. During the course of our stay, the concierge gave us helpful tips on visiting places, and they even printed out our boarding passes when it came time to leave. Very helpful and courteous, as was the rest of the staff. The maid kept the room sparkling clean, absolutely no complaints at all. Now, for the bad. The main entrance to the hotel seems to be where the garage is. You enter where the bell man is located, then have to go up 2 floors to reach the main lobby. Very weird, and it takes away from the impression you get upon entering the hotel. If you visit the Westin St.Francis, you'll notice what an amazing impression the entrance area can make. Now, there is a side entrance, which seems to me ought to be the main entrance, but people just stay outside those doors to smoke, and the doors don't even have real handles to pull the doors open, just strange knobs. Fine, this may be an unimportant criticism, but the location of the hotel is a legitimate beef. I know that there are tons of hotels right next door to the Parc 55, including the Hilton, the Abri, the Bijou, and many others, but because of the ridiculous number of homeless in the area, and the proximity of these hotels to the Tenderloin area, I would not choose to stay in any of these hotels for a leisure vacation. The homeless problem is terrible in this area. If you just move east a couple of blocks, the area becomes substantially less seedy. Hence, the title of my review. Don't get me wrong, the area is close to everything, restaurants, shopping, cable cars. Very convenient location. In fact, having looked around San Francisco, I am very glad I didn't book a hotel in the Financial District (too sterile and business-like) or Nob Hill (the hotels like the Fairmont or Stanford or Mark Hopkings are amazing, but I could not face the hills each morning) or the Wharf (too touristy). I like Union Square, however, I just would like to be a few blocks east of where I was. Now, would I stay here again? For business, definitely. The rooms and service are fantastic. And, the hotel seems to cater to quite a few airline crews and business meetings.

Next morning, we checked with the front desk who confirmed that those guests had checked out. Whew!! Next evening, the same mayhem, so we checked again with front desk only to be told that they had checked back in!! Insisting on a move, we were given a larger corner room on the 25th floor, with a City view, which was considerably less scenic than our previous Bay view. Overall, the standard of the rooms was very good, but in the second room, we had a shower which leaked all over the floor and also an air extraction vent which never switched off and in fact blew cold air out 24/7. There were also 2 occasions when our magnetic room keys barred us from entering our room. The front desk never really explained why that was happening to us, but merely gave us replacements and on the second occasion, the same lady who initially checked us in actually asked us for proof of ID before handing over our new keys!!!", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BobbyCAZ", "ReviewID": "UR27072602", "Content": "We have stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel numerous times.

I arrived around 1:30pm on a Friday I had no trouble checking in, they set me up with a corner room with a king bed, which is the way to go, 2 big panorama bay windows on separate walls with spectacular views. Furnishings were nice with dark cabinets and desk, (see hotel photos) nice color schemes, well designed. Nice big flat screen TV, nice bathroom a little smallish but well laid out and not at all cramped feeling. On a side note I booked through a \u201cname your own price\u201d type website and got a weekend rate of $78.00 per night, so at that price I\u2019d be hard pressed to complain about this joint. The beds were very comfortable with nice soft white sheets and comfy pillows. Also the \u201cbedspreads\u201d were nice fluffy duvets with white removable covers, you may read this as clean as opposed to bedspreads with who knows what on them, big plus if you ask me. I had very little interaction with the hotel staff aside from check-in, bell desk and the valet parking attendants who were a constant as they happily whisked my car in and out of their lot over and over again. By the way parking here is on the spendy side at $44.00 plus taxes and fees per night, ($50.00 total, and don\u2019t forget tips) but considering my use it seemed alright to me. I think the parking staff got the drift and kept my car close by as after a few trips my car always seemed to be there moments after I hit the lobby doors, proper tipping doesn\u2019t hurt in situations like that which may have explained why I seemed to fly by others waiting for cars to be brought up. All in all I liked the hotel, stylish and clean room, desk with a view, nice couch, convenient location, little need to interact with front desk staff. I think a corner room with a king is the difference between my experience and the poor reviews I\u2019ve read. Have a look at the hotel photos and you can see from the exterior shots the 2 windows on the corner rooms, and if you look through the photos you will see an interior shot of the corner rooms with 2 windows. remember some people only review hotels they don\u2019t like\u2026 \u201cgrrrrr I\u2019ll show them\u201d, I take really nasty reviews with a grain of salt but hey that\u2019s just me.

I had chosen it because of its location, and that certainly didn't disappoint. A block to the trolley cars and to Market Street, a couple blocks to Union Square - it was all so close. This is clearly a hotel made for meetings, conventions and airline staff. Us other folks were pretty much ignored or stared at by the staff - somewhat disconcerting. I went looking for the hotel restaurant one morning, taking the escalator right next to the bell station and the four or five bellmen there just stared at me as I went up, and then again as I came down a few minutes later. Here is a thought: instead of staring why not mention that you can't get to the restaurant that way? Why not move the big sign for the restaurant from next to the escalators and put it next to the elevators, as that is the only way to get there? I also got the stare when I tried to find a way into the hotel from Ellis Street. In fact, despite seeing lots of people struggling with their bags, the only thing I ever saw the bell men do was stare blankly at people... If you are going to stay, try and get a high level floor. I was on one of the lower floors, which provided a lot of traffic noise and no view. I am used to that so I wasn't too upset by the former, but the view provided gave me a direct look into the apartments of the people across the street. Another problem with low floors is that it is impossible to get on an elevator on your checkout date. I waited for almost half an hour, watching full elevator car after car go by, unable to get me and my heavy international suitcases in. I finally ended up taking a car up and then coming down again. All of those things are sort of expected in a hotel, so I could put up with them. The one thing I did wish was fixable was the thickness of walls. On my last night there was a large Christmas party being held at the hotel, with many folks staying over. The people in the room next door returned to their room VERY noisily around 3 a.m. and were quite active for a while after (he likes to the called \"the King\" if you get my drift).

It had been stated in the original booking that it was our anniversary and to make us a more romantic weekend - but not one \"happy anniversary\" or anything! *I came down around 3am to talk with a manager because I figured there would be no wait at the front desk. the night manager said that I should mention my concern to the daytime manager and also mentioned that booking with expedia you are not guaranteed your original booking... which I thought was completely absurd - shouldn't the hotel take good care of every guest - no matter who made the reservation???!?!!?!? *while staying on the 25th floor we got thirsty for a sprite - so I walked down the hall and put 2 dollar bills and one quarter ($2.25) for a sierra mist out of the vending machine and the money was stuck - so I called the front desk as referred by a hotel staff that noticed this, I called and was rudely told that I would have to come downstairs to the front desk and ask for a refund and you don't think that's sort of an inconvenience?? I would have bought a soda at the store if I had known there would have been such a problem! *for an evening of trying to make a terrible weekend turn a key - we decided to stay in and get a bottle of red wine to enjoy while we watched the view. I called to have some \"Kim Crawford\" pinot noir, it was listed in the menu in the room, I called room service and was told that they don't have that wine but they had \"Chalone\" pinot noir and that the bottle price wasn't listed but that it would be $40.00, when the bill came with the wine it was 55 dollars and was never informed what the $15.00 overcharge was for.

To there credit they were able to switch our room when a complaint was made. Overall I was very disappointed in this hotel. For what was paid I would expect much more than what I could receive from any roadside Motel 6. Rooms are lacking the basics. No microwave. No refrigerator. I'm not asking much, but when paying $200 dollars a night, I would expect more. Bathrooms are small. Wall paper is bubbling in areas. Outlets are old, faded, and dirty. Not what I would expect from such a \"luxury\" hotel. Next time I will stay at the Hilton across the street. The only positive is that the staff seemed to be helpful when asking questions or addressing complaints. Parc55 is also central to downtown.

We booked two rooms: One for ourselves, and one for our sitter, who was watching our young kids while we were out to dinner. LOCATION It's centrally located, close to Union Square. It's easy to get to. It's not the greatest neighborhood, but it's not all that bad, either, unless you're accustomed to living in one of those places where you never lock your doors and everyone, um, looks the same. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the area again. ROOMS Our room was nice. It was adequately sized (a little small with two beds, but not cramped). Our sitter scored the excellent room: When we checked in and mentioned that she would have our kids for quite a few hours in the evening, they upgraded her to a deluxe room that was huge. She had plenty of room to entertain the kids without going completely bonkers. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were nicely appointed, and in general the decor was pleasing. There was no minibar/fridge in the room, which was disappointing, but not a big deal since we were staying just one night. The room was quiet, which is always a plus. AMENITIES The hotel lobby itself is fairly small, but there's a lobby bar upstairs that looks nice. (We didn't have time to linger there, unfortunately.) Other common areas were clean and well-kept. The workout room was rather large by hotel standards, and in good condition; I managed to get a decent workout in. We ordered room service for the kids and sitter; the food was good and service was prompt. Mind you, we were ordering for kids, so I don't know how good some of the more complicated items are. In general, the hotel had everything we needed for a one-night stay. STAFF Staff was very good - as good as or better than that of other SF hotels we've stayed at. The treated us and the kids very well. Reception/front desk staff was particularly helpful. Bags were deliverd and picked up promptly, and we didn't have to wait long when our car was brought around. Since we'd already made all of our plans before arriving, we didn't use concierge services, so I can't comment on that. MISCELLANEOUS Parking was outrageous, but you expect that in San Francisco. Still -- ouch. SUMMARY We liked it, and would stay there again. We paid a significantly reduced rate through Priceline, and it was an excellent value.

I wanted to explore the city outside of Union Square but I stayed here due to their easy access to public transit- the BART station is about 50 steps from the front door of the hotel.

Paid for standard room on Expedia, and we got a corner room on the 7th floor, huge room with a massive bed and enormous bathroom. 32\" flatscreen TV and coffee making facilities (which seem to be rare in the US) topped it all off perfectly. Tried out room service on the first night, and it was seamless. Was referred to by name on the phone, they knew exactly who I was and which room I was in without asking, taking away a lot of the awkwardness associated with room service. Food arrived in 15 minutes and was very good indeed. Tried out the hotel bar, which is a fabulous setting. Great service and ambience, although I think the same piano music every night might get to the people who work there eventually. Only blip came on check out, was billed for $350 when I had paid for the room outright on expedia.

Even with the earplugs in place that were so thoughfully provided, we could hear street noise. Fire trucks, police cars, motorbikes, and yelling reached our rooms. Then, at 2:15 a.m. on Saturday, we were awakened by a group of drunken guests making their way back to their rooms. Nice! No fault of the hotel, of course, but just added to our annoyance. On Saturday evening, we were entertained into the wee hours by a prom that was taking place in the 4th flloor ballroom. Nice of the hotel to advise us that such an event was taking place. My husband had to call the front desk and ask when the thumping rap noise might cease. I would have gladly paid more for a higher floor had I been advised of the noise issues and the party. The room was OK. Decent size, clean, nice bedding, comfortable beds, good sized bathroom with very good water pressure, very prompt maid service. No fridge, lousy coffee maker, no key for the in-room safe. I would not stay at this hotel again. I prefer the quiet and super comfortable Orchard up on Bush. You pay more, but the rooms are a delight, breakfast is included and you get a really good night's sleep.

It was priced similarly to the Hilton (about $220) but this hotel was rated higher on this site. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is perfectly located for a lot of things -- easy walk to Moscone, close to shopping on Market St, BART station, streetcar, and the financial district, and also close to our favourite restaurants in the opposite direction. Check in and check out were fast and painless, with no unexpected charges. We were initially offered a room with double beds, and the desk clerk said there were no king beds, but we did get a queen which was fine. The room was on the 20th floor which would not have been our initial choice but it was very nice. The view was fine, and we had a bay window with a little loveseat. You do have to pay 12 or $13 per day for internet acess but the $45 per week is a much better deal if you're staying more than 3 days. The internet connection was tempermental, sometimes fine and sometimes slow. We initially signed in as \"wireless\", and when that was slow or not working, we had to call IT. They told us to sign in again with a wired connection, pay twice, and he'd get the front desk to reverse the charges. True to word, there was only one charge on the final bill. By the way, the hotel does not charge for 1-800 calls. We seemed to have got one of the \"renovated view rooms\". The furniture was new enough although the decor was a bit beige. The bathroom was small but nicely finished with tiled walls around the bath enclosure and granite counter. The bath isn't huge but my husband, who is 6'2'', found it fine. The water for the shower is high-pressure and instantly hot at any time of the day. The room size was decent (bigger than the last place we stayed in SF). Our room had a flat screen TV. Strangely, there was no minibar which we usually use for milk or soy milk for coffee, so we had to use the ice bucket to keep it cool. Initially we didn't like the location near the elevators and ice machine, but the soundproofing is so good we didn't notice noise at all. The gym was clean and very well-equipped with good-quality treadmills, ellipticals, free weights and a variety of weight machines. The hotel has a lounge with live music several nights, and there are a couple of other restaurants in the building. Room service menu was pretty standard with average prices. Our only tiny complaints were the lack of minibar/fridge in the room, and the strange little coffee maker which used up a new plastic tray every time (and the paper cups rather than real coffee cups). These certainly didn't wreck our experience. One huge benefit -- the whole hotel is non-smoking, so you won't accidentally get a stinky room.

My partner, an urban planner, was enthusiastic and we sat on the couch by the window both nights and enjoyed the view.

We were surprised at the lack of decent restaurants within a two block radius, but within a five block radius choices were unlimited. On the negative side, we were a little shocked by the number of homeless people that come out at night around the two blocks of this hotel. Also, the \"extras\" that the hotel offers - concierge service, fitness centre - were lost on us, whereas the \"extras\" that we usually take full advantage of - free high-speed internet, continental breakfast - were absent. Internet would have cost us $15 a day, and the two rounds of drinks we had in the hotel bar ran us up a tab of $50.

Upon checking in, we found out that parking was $45 plus tax per night (more than a third of our nightly rate!) so we parked down the road at a parking garage for $20 flat per night. The lobby is fine, though very bland...reminds me of a typical business hotel. Everyone was very courteous and business like. At the front desk, I requested a corner room due to previous reviews of such rooms being larger, and the woman was very helpful in pulling a high floor for me and reserving it even though it had yet to be cleaned. Later when we were able to get our keys, we walked into the room and it felt more like a suite. Upon walking in there is a small room without furniture and a very large bay window. To the left around the corner is the large bathroom, next is the closet, and then beyond is the bedroom with a bay window at the end of the room and a very large bay window over the desk. There were views in every direction. From one window you could see the transamerica building, from another you could see the very top of the golden gate bridge, and from the other you could see the southern part of the SF bay. The room itself had been renovated nicely, though it felt very corporate. Still, the bed was very comfortable and the furnishings were fine. They advertised a plasma tv in the room, but it was a standard box tv (not that we cared much). The bathroom was spacious with good amenities by lather, and the shower had excellent water pressure. Room service was very good, quick, and reasonably priced. We ordered both dinner and breakfast on occasion and it was presented very nicely and was delicious. The location is incredibly convenient. Literally a block from both the subway (Muni and Bart) and the Powell Street cable car. The walls of the hotel also seemed to be very thick because when in our room, we felt like we were in a sanctuary, unable to hear anything or anyone else other than ourselves. If you like the chain-type hotels, you will surely love this one. But even if you like the more stylish independent boutique hotels, you may find that the value and comfort at this hotel is more than satisfactory. I would definitely return. The only downside that I could find was that the gym was being remodeled and there were only three treadmills that had been stuffed inside a very small room on the second floor. They did, however, offer a free pass to a gym a few blocks away, but neither my partner nor I wanted to hike our stuff up there and back.

Back up to our new room and we discover that a makeup bag is missing. We speculate it was left in the handicap room when we moved in and back out so quickly. The front desk has already reassigned this room and cannot, or will not, allow housekeeping and/or security to check the room without the new occupants permission. (even though the bag is unmistakable and has been described to them in detail.) The front desk indicates they do not have a lost and found, only housekeeping keeps things left in rooms. OK, we agree to try later as it is our fault the bag is missing. When we come back from a late night out we check again with an extremely helpful night manager at the front desk who tells us she will check lost and found and with security again.

When booking, I opted for a room on one of the top floors as previous reviews have mentioned about traffic noise. The top few floors are named as an \u2018executive\u2019 section, and as such this allows guests on these floors to enter the \u2018executive room\u2019 on the top floor that has a small self service honesty bar, serves a continental breakfast in the morning and has a great view across the city. The room itself was very large, clean, fresh and in an excellent state of repair. I was fortunate enough to have a room on a corner of the hotel so had two large windows that gave me two different, but good views of San Francisco. The room had a large comfortable bed, large bathroom/shower, large wardrobe (and iron), sofa, TV and desk/chair. Daily maid service was excellent as was the turndown service. The room was quiet, and I didn\u2019t experience any noise either from in the hotel or from outside. Checkout through the TV was simple and I just dropped off the key in the box in the lobby on the way out. I have to admit that aside from my speedy check in, I didn\u2019t interact with the staff at all as everything was to my satisfaction and all of the services that I used could be self activated and were easy to understand and follow. I guess the only downside is that, as mentioned in a previous review, the amenities in the business centre are very expensive. I used the internet, which was somewhat pricey, but had no intention of using the printer which had an outrageous price per sheet. San Francisco is well known for its homeless population, and a great number congregate around the BART station area just around the corner from the hotel. Whilst they may be an annoyance, I found them to be harmless enough and not in the least bit aggressive. In fact, one of my evening forms of entertainment was going to a convenience store around the corner from Parc55 to buy some chocolate and join in with the banter from the people hanging around outside. This may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea for an hours entertainment in SF, but it demonstrates that these people are approachable and not out to kill us all. Parc55 is in an excellent central location. As mentioned, it is very close to the BART station, so great for the airport, and is also close to the trams that take you to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and the cable cars for exploring the city.

What constitutes a four-star accommodation in a metropolitan city with more hotels than pigeons? Four star hotels position and price themselves as \"superior\", but, in my experience, there is very rarely any superiority to them. I rate Parc 55 \"Okay, but some problems\". And I mean exactly that. I booked a non-smoking room with a king bed. Our room was only ready by 4 PM on check in day, but we were initially delighted to have obtained a \"20-th floor room with a city view\". Unbelievably, street noise was almost as loud as at the street level, and indeed very disturbing during the night. To add to our discomfort, the mattress was horribly uneven, and every single spring could be felt through the thin mattress top. Pillows, on the other hand, were very small, too soft and of rather inferior quality. Our bathroom was relatively spacious, but all fixtures and decor were outdated and in a need of an upgrade (i.e. chipped wall tiles, chipped mirror and rust stains on fixtures). The bathtub drain was extremely ineffective, and we had to stand in a bath half full while taking showers. We had a desk, a chair and a small sofa with a coffee table in our room. To our disbelief, there was no mini bar and no room safe in our room. The TV was very old and small. The hotel very enthusiastically nickel-and-dimes you at any opportunity. They charge you by the minute for using their business center, and a printed page costs you more than $2. We paid a total of $11 for the luxury of checking in for our outbound flight and printing two boarding passes. When I called the front desk in the evening asking them to have a taxi for us at 5:15 AM next day, I was bluntly told that cabs were available in front of the hotel 24/7. Indeed, we had to crawl to Market Street and look for a passing taxi next morning. Altogether, they provided us with a bed and bath. I however would not recommend staying there.

We chose this hotel because of its reasonable price and its close proximity to Union Square and various restaurants. I have read previous TripAdvisor reviews about the hotel being in an undesirable or \"seedy\" location. I found the hotel's surroundings to be fine, especially during the day. Cyril Magnin Street, where the hotel is located, is very busy with vehicles and pedestrian traffic. However, as with any vacation, it is always important to remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. The check-in process was quite easy. This is a rather busy hotel which is heavily used by the flight crews of various airlines, convention attendees, and business travelers. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful, except for one of the bellmen who seemed to be having a bad day. The seven elevators were rather efficient, timely, and spacious. Our ninth floor room was typical but very accommodating. The bed was very luxurious to sleep in. The bathroom was clean with sufficient ammenities. Street noise was heard throughout the day and night, mainly from police and fire vehicle sirens. But that's typical for any downtown hotel. A temporary fitness center was created on the second floor while the regular fifth floor location is being renovated. It is heavily used by guests and only offered five (5) cardio machines. Free weights and/or resistance training equipment were not available. The only complaint that I had was the hotel's valet parking. Guests are charged $40 dollars a day (plus tax) with in-and-out privileges. This fee could add up if you plan to stay several days. Also, allow between 10-25 minutes for the parking valet person to obtain your vehicle. One day that I waited about 20 minutes. After complaining about the long wait, I was informed by the valet supervisor that my vehicle had been parked at an alternate lot because their hotel garage was full. If you arrive back to the hotel late in the evening, chances are that your vehicle will be parked at the alternate lot. If you're looking for a convenient hotel that provides affordable daily parking, you might want to consider the Cathedral Hill Hotel, just a few blocks away on Van Ness Avenue. They provide a discounted room/parking package. The daily parking fee would be about $10. Better yet, you park it yourself and leave at your own convenience. Overall, my friends and I had a pleasant stay at the Parc 55 Hotel. I would recommend it to any traveler who would like to be in the heart of Downtown San Francisco.

Stayed at the Grand Hyatt last year (also club floor) and paid more than twice this price and I really feel the Parc 55 is superior. One reason being that I had a rental car for both stays and where the Grand Hyatt you have to pull up in the street in a lot of heavy traffic to hand the car over to valet parking, the Parc 55 has a circular drive off of the street and it was a cinch. Yes, parking was $40 a night plus tax plus I tipped them each time I got the car out, but it was still cheaper than staying at one of the other hotels, given the $111 Club Level room rate here The Club Level breakfast was teriffic!

After numerous attempts to request a front city view I was turned down with typical answers such as \"we're fully booked\", \"your room has a spectacular view, why do you want to change\", \"try again tomorrow morning\". Apart from overlooking the construction yard and hearing all the noice in the morning the stay was quite ok. Nothing special, rooms are big but the bed was not really comfortable, carpet was/looked dirty, bathroom ok, amenities ok. Cleaning staff were superdb but the front desk were really bad and counldn't be botherd. Same for the conierge who weren't very helpful and looked quite bored just sitting there. The hotel caters for a lot of business travelers and lots of airline crews! Didn't bother with any of the bar/restaurants as the are so many at close proximity. Location was great though, oposite from the Shopping centre and the Bart/cable car stations that was very convenient. Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was so much better, great rooms and views, superb beds, nice touches such as an ipod docking station, great bath and bathroom products, a lot friendlier staff. Wish I had stayed there for all part of our SF stay. Not worth the view upgrade unless they can guarantee a city view.

The 'bay' window style gives the room greater depth. Furnishings are pretty standard but of high quality and the room has a large closet with iron and ironing board. Altogether very comfortable. The bathroom is equally spacious with plenty of ameneties. The only thing which concerned me was the provision of earplugs - that didn't bode well!

That being said, however, the rooms are not well sound-proofed, and as the hotel is in the 'heart' of things, it can be a very noisy place to stay.

However, the decor was somewhat dated and didn't feel at all 'fresh.' The even more dated, large hotel bathroom somehow felt a little grimy -- perhaps because of its dated fixtures and circa 1980s tiles, but it also might have felt that way as a result of the the fact that some of the floor tiles were dirty. I like things really clean when I stay in a hotel (my husband would say I'm too picky), so the dirty floor tiles bugged me.

The Cable, trolleys,buses etc. are across the street. We were only a few blocks from the theatre and Union Square 2 blocks away with all the shopping you could want. The service at the hotel was excellent, we had a real sweetheart at the desk that could not have been nicer. Stayed on the 26th floor with a gorgeous view of the city. The room was spacious, nicely decorated and very clean. The bed was comfortable. I would recommend staying above the 19th floor because there is city noise and construction noise that may bother you. We had breakfast at the Club room each morning and it was wonderful with great service, they also had drinks etc. in the evening with a fabulous view from the 31st floor. The concierge desk is very helpful with all your needs and directions for what to see being taken care of. The only down side was $40. a day to park. We flew in so that was not a problem and after our stay we headed back to the airport rented a car and finished our trip to Napa,Reno and Tahoe. We figured we would not need a car in the city. Also if you will be there a few days or more get a pass for all the transportation for a flat rate. It was $18 for 3days, where as just a cable car ride one way was $5. so a very good deal. For safety reasons if i were a woman in the area on my own I would not be out late alone, San Francisco does have a lot of homeless so take cabs if necessary. I would definitely book again online and stay at Parc 55 and recommend anyone else to do so. You will not do better anywhere in the city for your money.

But he did not see in the system that our promotional rate had free breakfast vouchers included in the rate. He took another 15 minutes to verify that and we got our vouchers (needless to say that the folio under our door the next morning prior to checkout had charges for those breakfast vouchers that were supposed to come free with our promotional rate. They fixed that when we came down to complain). On to the good part -- the room was the cleanest room i've ever been to. Not a stain was anywhere -- which is great in my book, and redeems the poor front desk service. The hallways are spacious and clean; as are the common areas.

However, the windows wrap around the corner rooms so you probably get more light in the morning, but that didn't bother us. They had two sets of curtains, but light always finds a way :) The room was clean and spacious with cool decor. It had a separate room with a closet and enough space to store your luggage. That room led into the bathroom. The bathroom was fine, nothing spectacular. I did like that the shower curtain curved out to give you more room in the shower. I didn't like the smell of the shampoo/conditioner, but they got the job done. The bed and pillows were comfortable, check the closet for the extra pillow.

If you plan to cover a lot of the city in one day you can pay $11.00 for unlimited rides on the cable cars, buses, and trolleys. A one way trip on the cable car is $5.00 so we cabbed it a lot. It was cheaper to take a cab from Parc 55 to Fisherman's Wharf. We had a great meal at Sauce ( It's on Gought St. I think it's in the Pacific Heights section) Alcatraz was cool-we happened to go on their annual anniversary event so there were scheduled speakers (former inmates, guards and family members that lived on the island) Before we went I searched a calander of events for things going on and found a lot of time specific things to do. i.e. The Nihonmachi Street Fair in Japantown.

The entrance to the hotel is not striking; as a matter of fact we spent time trying to figure out where the front door was! The lobby is elegant, although in kind of a wierd layout. In the room things were clean and the furnishings were nice and looked new. The bathroom was serviceable but somewhat small and the amenities were basic (soap, shampoo, creme rinse, no shower cap.) On a low shelf in the bathroom was a one-cup coffee maker that you apparently put on the bathroom counter and plug it in there if you want in-room coffee. The two full-sized beds that we requested and got were comfortable with lots of pillows. The TV remote did not work. As far as I could tell, none of the rooms at the Parc 55 have a breathtaking view - it's mostly rooftops and other buildings. The biggest thing that I didn't like was the inconsistency of staff coverage. When my parents drove up into the valet driveway, there was no one there to come and take their bags. So we had to commandeer a cart, pack it with the luggage and bring it inside (which we later found out was \"against hotel rules\", putting us in a no-win situation.) Another day, we needed a taxi. But there was no one at the valet station to call one for us. We ended up walking down the street until we found one. These are not horrible things, but they are basics that I expect from a 4-star hotel. On the upside, the hotel is in a safe location to walk to Market Street, including the cable cars, the \"Union Square\" Amtrak bus stop and the Powell St. BART station. From this hotel, you can ride transit and get just about anywhere in the city. Just be careful not to walk west of the hotel via Ellis St.: it will take you straight into the Tenderloin neighborhood which is not safe. Would I stay here again?

My overall rating mostly reflects a very comfortable room in a great location (right at the Powell Street BART station on Market Street, near Union Square.) Room 2763 is a very good size, with two double beds looking towards Union Square (visible a LITTLE bit between the buildings) and the Coit Tower in the distance. Nice-size bathroom with many toiletries -- but no hair dryer that I could find. Spotless housekeeping. The desk (chipped on the edges) could be a good work surface, and there is an internet connection (with an ethernet cord in the room) for $12 a day. We paid extra for this room with entitles the guest to the club lounge, breakfast, and evening snacks. While not bad, I'm not sure I'd upgrade again. The lounge itself is nice enough with an excellent view (same as our room, but on the 31st floor), tables and lounge chairs, nice continental-plus buffet breakfast of pastries, cereals, fruit, juices, etc. The evening has cocktails ($6 for wine) and hors d'oeuvres, which were not that impressive -- small assortment of hot hors d'oeuvres and really mundane cheese selection. There were a few complimentary newspapers around to be used in the lounge (I think, since there were so few.) Like any Club lounge I've seen, it can get a little crowded at some times in the morning. I could deal with these minor imperfections if not for the issues with the Club lounge management. When we first stopped in, the manager and assistant seemed more concerned with talking to each other than greeting guests. We would also find that guests often had a problem with their pass key-cards to enter, which often meant guests would knock (pound) on the locked door. Rather than assume that these were guests with key problems, the attitude seemed to be that these were Club-crashers. This could easily be verified since Club guests have a different color card. But no -- the Manager scolded anyone who might open the door, but he was VERY slow in trying to come to the door -- leaving the guest outside pounding the door, and those inside having to listen to it. Couldn't an assistant manage something? Further, I believe that the staff should be able to have their meal break, but this sometimes meant that NO ONE was minding the door -- again resulting in a guest, sooner or later, pounding the door. Also: the evening hors d'oeuvres were scheduled to go until 7:30. When we stopped in at 7:10 to grab something quickly, the food had all been cleaned up, and an evening dessert was not out yet. The slips continued. I met my sister at this hotel, where she would check in the following day. I reminded the staff about this at my check-in. Supposedly they entered her name. The following evening, I stopped by the desk to remind the desk staff to expect her later that evening. When they checked, there was no record of her name. They dutifully re-entered the information. When she checked in later, there was STILL no record of her name, which resulted in a late-night call to the room to give permission to send her up. To top it off: they gave her a room key-card that did NOT correspond to a Club level -- which resulted in problems at breakfast the next morning in the Club lounge until we got it corrected. (Also \"funny:\" the desk clerk mentioned, \"You don't have the same last name as your sister,\" I think questioning her story. We are in our 50's, and I'm married. Are different names of married sisters so surprising???!!!???) The hotel has a nice, sunny second-floor public lounge, bar, and restaurant. We didn't eat here or have drinks, but it could have been a nice possibility. There are free newspapers for guests in this area -- stocked much better than on the Club lounge!!! The take-away: we'd be happy to stay here again since the room was like a good Marriott-quality place at a better price, and the location is excellent if you want to use the BART from the airport and be convenient to Union Square. I'd still check other options for price/value, but I could return here and be pretty happy if I could overlook the service slips. I understand the need for security at any hotel, but this place gets a bit undiplomatic ans slipshod in trying to manage it. Further, the Club lounge was not very impressive, and there are other good-to-much better alternatives for breakfast, drinks, etc. nearby.

There were homeless people and some panhandlers around Powell Station, but they were totally harmless. Traveling frequently to NYC, we probably look more streetwise than some of the other reviewers not used to the city. No one ever approached us, even walking through the Tenderloin towards Civic Center. I do not recommend this area to anyone not used to being in major cities. Room on 29th floor was great. Nice and large and very clean. Good bathroom products by \"Lather\". Bed was extremely comfortable. Fresh air vents were great (but of course give you a little more noise). At times we turned off the AC and just opened those vents. Noise level really was minimal, even with the building going up next store. Besides, noise is intrinsic to cities. Anyone who can't stand noise should take a country vacation. Housekeeping does like to knock a lot, to check whether the room is ok. It seemed like overkill to us. Breakfast in club lounge was adequate. Fresh fruits, meats and cheeses, hot and cold cereal, bagels, breads and danish. Starbucks coffee was a real kickstart in the morning. The afternoon snack was ok, no where near what other hotels put out in their concierge lounge, but the Parc 55 also cost a fraction of what those other hotels charge. The evening dessert was a nice touch, and perfect since we usually don't have room for dessert at that evening's restaurant. Speaking of restaurants, we tried the Siam Thai Noodle both in the hotel (many restaurants were closed for the 4th of July) and across the street. Both were fantastic.

It is a small coffee shop across from the Sir Francis Drake. It is classic old SF! And simple good food. For quick food on the go it is fun to pick something out at the food market in Bristol Farms (on the bottom level of the San Francisco Shopping Center).

This is not a boutique hotel-- it's a high-rise with a large lobby and hundreds of rooms. 3. It is right by Union Square-- homeless people are a staple for that area and not a fault of the hotel. Now, to the experience-- hotel is very centrally located (right by Powell BART station-- take it right from the airport for a fraction of the taxi cost!). Restaurants, shops, museums, the cable cars, (and yes, even the homeless people)-- it's all there. The lobby is spacious and can look deserted at times. We had no problems with staff. Rooms are much larger than usual for Union Square-- we had a sitting area with a couch in ours and a king size bed. Spacious bathroom, fantastic linens and even complimentary ear plugs ( we were on the 10th floor and could not hear the street noise but appreciated the gesture anyway.) We did not use room service but stopped by at a hotel bar on the second floor-- a typical boring sports bar on a smaller side with an ambiance of a moth ball. In summary. Pros: great location, spacious, clean rooms, awesome beds for a very good price. Probably one of the best deals for your dollar in Union Square.

If you must stay here, don't expect luxury services at all. Bring copies of your confirmation and pay attention if they are trying to pull a fast one on you.

So I cancelled my reservation on Mariott's web site, and recieved a cancellation email and number. Then I got my February credit card bill and found a charge for one night at the hotel. I dug up the cancellation email and called. My first call was after business hours, and I was told to call back during business hours. The next day I called during business hours and explained the situation to someone in the accounting department. That person told me that the problem was my cancelling on Marriott's site rather than calling them. I never understood why that was a problem, since I cancelled well before they dropped off the Mariott's system, but in any case I expected that they would credit me immediately. Instead I was told that it would take several days to research it and I should call back if I did not receive the credit. It would seem to me that if the Parc knew they were having a problem with cancellations on Mariott's system, that THEY would take the initiative to research no-shows. Instead, I find that it is taking a considerable amount of my time to avoid being charged, when the hotel seems to be at fault for losing the cancellation - and that is in spite of the fact that they are apparently well aware of the problem.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "sfbness", "ReviewID": "UR6940899", "Content": "Parc 55 had everything we needed, easy access, spacious room and bathroom.

The room was clean, the beds were comfortable - soft pillows, feather comfortors. I even had room service bring tea - a charming Chinese gentleman delivered it with new years wishes and lots of giggles. BUT - and this is the big BUT - we were not given our room until 2AM!!!!!!! We checked in at 9 PM. Fortunately, my mom and I checked in the day before, so we were able to put our 2 young sons to bed in her room. My husband and I waited 5 hours in the lobby, mostly standing in line with about 25 other very hostile guests, waiting for our room. There was a couple who had spent 25 hours traveling from Caracas, VZ, a man with Parkinson's disease who desperately needed rest, and a long list of other stories. In addition to all of this, the hotel staff repeatedly double assigned rooms. They would send a relieved guest up to a room, only to have them return to say someone was already in it!!! Can you imagine how mortifyingly embarrassing that must have been for both parties???? This happened at least 4 times by my count. When we were given our room assignment, we made the staff call the room before we went up. The other part that was so awful was that we were told 3 times that our room would be ready in 30 minutes, and to come back. It took at least 1 hour to get through the line. My question is, why didn't the staff let people know what was going on? They knew the rooms wouldn't be ready, with only the small night cleaning staff and a number of very late check-outs (Singapore Air has a regular contract, I guess). Really unconscionable!

We decided to give it a shot and were absolutely impressed and satisfied. LOCATION and TRANSPORTATION: Renaissance Parc is located in Union Square and I discovered that it was close to many forms of transportation including both the BART and the MUNI. And while cabs are scarce in San Francisco, I was pleased to see that there were usually at least 2 cabs waiting outside by the street. If there aren't any cabs there, I know that there were always a line of cabs outside of the Westin Hotel a few blocks away. Literally right outside Parc hotel is a shopaholic's dream. It's blocks away from Saks, Macy's, and other department stores as well as unique boutiques and stores along the way. There's also a new Westfield Mall right by there on Market Street which has a Nordstrom and Bloomindales. I also took a walk to Chinatown from there, and while it's not that far, make sure to wear comfy shoes. Somewhat southwest of the hotel further down Market Street, the area gets a little bit shadier and seems to crawl with even more homeless people (San Francisco as a whole has a huge homeless population), but it's nothing to be wary of. As for places to eat by there - we ate at a dim sum place called Tian Sing right outside which was great! The place was clean (cleaner than the ones I saw in Chinatown) and the service was very attentive. We also ate at this trendy spot across the street from Tian Sing called First Crush. The place was okay, but not exactly worth the pricey tag. I'd just go there again for drinks or a cocktail. SERVICE and CLEANLINESS: We checked in around 11am and found out from the hotel desk that official check-in time was not until later at 3pm; however, before even asking, the woman checked to see if there were any available rooms and checked us in to a 14th floor room. The man who brought up the luggage to our room was very helpful and pointed out what was what right from our window (whichwas a breathtaking view!). The room was clean. The bed was very comfy and cushy and had a plethora of pillows! The bathroom was big and absolutely not cramped like some hotel bathrooms I've seen. The only problem I seemed to have was with their shower curtain- no matter how much I tried to close the curtain, it seemed as if water would always be seeping onto the floor. BOTTOM LINE: The place was exactly what we wanted. A clean hotel with genuine and friendly service right in the heart of the city. As for price, it was mid-range, but well worth it.

Room service dinner was good and not overpriced. My main complaint was the telecommunications. First, there's the usual $10 per day charge for high-speed Internet access- a ridiculous nickel-and-dime charge when you know most of your guests will need it. I couldn't get connected after we arrived and spent 15 minutes on the phone with Tech Support. They said they needed to check some things and would call back- they never called back. I called again and they said the modem was bad and would be replaced. It was 8 PM Sunday. I went off to my meetings Monday morning (still no modem) and finally when my husband went to the front desk and requested a new modem they sent one up. The second problem was the phone lines. There was some kind of feedback on the line that made it hard to hear. I had to resort to my cell phone for the tech support calls. I tried participating in a teleconference on Tuesday morning on the hotel phone (800 call-in #) and the sound quality was so bad I had to disconnect and use my cell phone again.

I have traveled to San Francisco more than 100 times over the last five years and sampled just about every major upscale hotel in the area. I would stay anywhere but this place. The disappointment begins with the area that the hotel is located in, which, although centrally located, is the seediest part of the city and abounds in threatening looking characters. I felt at risk just stepping out of the hotel! The overall ambience within the hotel is gaudy early-eighties and an absolute assault to the eyes and senses. Rooms are small, even by San Francisco standards, and missing the nice balconies that hotels like Hilton and Meridien have. The overall feeling is of clutter and claustrophobia, exacerbated by windows that don't open adequately and leaflets touting all manner of hotel services. The beds are comfortable but nothing unique to the upgraded beds available at almost all major chains today. By the way, almost every pictures on the hotel website is highly unrepresentative of reality. Hotel infrastructure is in need of serious upgrading. Heating and air-conditioning system is ineffective and noisy. Water pressure is weak and hot and cold water mixing is problematic leading to uncomfortable showers and shaving. To cap it all, the hotel charges a usurious rate for internet service and only offer service from noon-to-noon regardless of when you check-in and check-out. Bathrooms have a dated feel and look. And there are marks on the wall of amenities that were once attached to walls and are now gone. Hotel staff service levels are nothing special and a little below average. The concierge lounge is absolutely below standards of typical hotel properties and closed on weekends unlike most other major upscale hotels in downtown SF. Overall, the quality and feel of this hotel is a better fit for Fairfield Inn than Marriott's top-of-the-line Renaissance brand.

We tend to stay at either Marriotts, Hiltons or Hyatts so I was a little surprised when the Marriott Renaissance Parc 55 showed availability at a decent price. What was even a bigger surprise was that I was able to use my Marriott points which left us more money for shopping! We arrived at the hotel around noon and fully expected to leave our bags with the bellman and check in later in the day. To our surprise a room was ready and we immediately checked in. The front desk could not of been more helpful. Our room was non-smoking as requested with two very comfortable beds. We were given a room with a \"bay view\". We were on the 17th floor and the view was of the bay but not much of it. Too many other high rise buildings in the way blocking the view. The higher you go, the better view but this was not an issue to us. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was just fine. They could use more counter space for storage. The biggest drawback was the ability to hear people in the rooms on either side of us. I wonder if the guests in those rooms knew that we could hear their early morning conversations about getting ready for their flights or their late night giggles, etc. I was surprised that we did not have evening turn down service, this would have been a nice touch. The location of the hotel was perfect. Just around the corner from Union & Powell streets you were at the beginning of the cable car system or just steps from the BART station. You are also within walking distance of all the shopping around Union Square. The front desk and bell desk was very helpful with maps, where to go and where not to go (the tenderloin district) and dining options. We never did dine in the hotel so I cannot comment on that. Too many places around the hotel to eat so why bother with hotel dining. It was suggested that we buy a 1 day pass for the cable car which we did. It use is good for the cable cars and the bus system. It was also suggested that on our return trip to the airport we use the BART system. Since we had to pay a $42 (incl. tip) cab fare to the hotel from the airport on our return we used the BART system. $5.15 one-way. It was great! Only drawback to this is the ticket machines don't really have instructions on them and most people are either too busy to help you or are in the same boat as you. We did find a nice lady that was getting her own ticket to help us out only to have a very rude lady come up from behind and start yelling at us because we were holding up the line!

Prior to our arrival, I spoke to Donna (at the front desk) who was very helpful and made arrangements for two adjoining rooms with lovely views of the city. After reading many reviews about small rooms in the city, I found these rooms to be quite spacious with a sitting area where we could enjoy our coffee in the morning while enjoying the view. We found the beds very comfortable, the bathrooms good size, and the water pressure for showers was good. They had a great holiday room rate, $119/night, which was appreciated since parking is expensive $38/night. Everyone at the hotel, from the bellman to the room service waiter, was very courteous and friendly and we would definitely stay there again. We walked to Union Square and did some shopping and took in many San Francisco events. First, be prepared, everything in SF is EXPENSIVE. The first night we attended a concert at Davies Symphony Hall (excellent venue and fantastic musicians). Afterwards, we had dinner at the Italian restaurant across the street from the hotel(Panetti's)and it was very good. I recommend the eggplant parmesan. The second day we attended the 2pm performance of the San Francisco Ballet's Nutcracker at the War Memorial Opera House. This is an experience you don't want to miss. Beautiful scenery and dancing, it was truly breathtaking. I think we should have stopped with those two events, because the last one (Holiday Lights Tour) on the motorized cable car was a bummer. First, the only holiday lights you see are at Union Square (which is where we boarded). It's the standard (canned) tour of the city, nothing more, which we may have enjoyed more during the day, but at night, you miss a lot. Not recommended. After the tour, we couldn't find a place to eat that wasn't packed to the gills with shoppers, and it was 9pm. We finally got a table at Johnny's, where it was cramped and hot and the server had an attitude. Expensive and not very good, I wouldn't recommend Johnny's either.

Good views from the lounge due it being several floors higher than neighbouring buildings.

It gets busy in the mornings as it caters for 3 executive floors as well as overspill from lower level rooms when the exec floors are overbooked.

We booked a standard room with the government discount and was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a huge, beautiful corner room with windows all around.

Perhaps the only flaw in this room was that we booked a room with a King sized bed and instead got a room with a full size bed.

The bathroom was clean and had a few nice touches like a heater which came in handy since it was cold at night, a phone and a movable vanity mirror. Directly outside of the bathroom in front of the closet was a seperate changing area, which I thought was a nice touch.

Here's a tip - they don't always fill the car up at the terminus, so go to the next stop up the line and you'll probably get on the first car to come along. After you've done the calble car thing once, you'll probably find the Market Street tram or the #30 trolley bus the best way to get to Fishermans Wharf and the Ferries to Alcatraz.

It tends to take a lot of time and it can be difficult dealing with the parking staff. That was not the case here, the staff were very professional and swift.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the class of hotel and its great location, for the relatively low price I was able to secure online. For all of you that have girlfriends or wifes that love to shop, this hotel is very very centrally located in Union Square, near all the shopping that San Francisco offers. Just as a tip, ask for a high floor. Our room was on the 23rd floor and we had an awesome view of the city from our room. The hotel is also located right next to one of the BART stations (BART is the public train system in San Francisco). This made it extremely convenient traveling from the airport (we landed in Oakland). This option was significantly cheaper than hiring a taxi. We paid $3.15 per person for a BART ticket vs. $55 taxi fare. The rooms at the Renaissance were very clean and modern. The standard room was also well sized, especially for San Francisco. The bathroom was also very clean and good sized. If I had any complaints at all, it would only be the length of time it took them to respond to our request for more towels. Also, we had breakfast included in our rate, however, the order form was never brought to us after the first night. We had to call the front desk and have them deliver it to our room each night. Other than that, it was a great stay in centrally located area. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants all the hustle and bustle and shopping that San Francisco has to offer. Oh yea, we discovered on our last night that the restuarant, directly across the street from our hotel, was a great italian restaurant. Its called Puccini and Panetti.

I made the reservation last minute so I couldn't book it any less than what their website was advertizing (i.e. $269/night for a conceirge room which included a bit of free food, soft drinks, coffee, etc.). As others have stated here, the valet parking at $38 plus tax/day is steep. So, for a combined price of $300/night...it was certainly nice, but I was expecting that for the price. The location was excellent and it makes it almost impossible not to jump on a cable car (at or near the \"turn-a-round\") which is a lot of fun. It costs only $3 each way to Fisherman's Wharf which is a good 15 min ride up and down the hills of SF through Nob Hill, North Beach and Chinatown. Great shopping nearby and a ton of places to eat. The homeless problem is getting worse in San Francisco, so I am not sure if you can avoid it at any place around Union Square. But, as the doorman suggested, don't wander to much around the \"back\" of the hotel (near The Tenderloin District). It's easy to avoid, but worth knowing it's there. But please, don't let that piece of information make you weary of the location. It simply exists. As in every large city I have visited. For the concierge level reservation, we were offered a room on the 29th floor (out of 32 total floors - I think) and we had a great, slightly wrap-around window view of the city and bay (by the way, the windows do not open - although there is a slight metal flap at the bottom of each which allows about 1-2 inches of fresh air to come in. There was a good selction of Cable TV channels (i.e. Free HBO/CNN/MSNBC/ESPN/ETC plus Pay-Movies) and the bathroom was large and spotless. There are two restaurants we ordered from in the hotel (Siam Thai) and a brew-pub (I can't recall the name). Both were decent and one was a lot cheaper (Siam Thai) if you took the elevator trip down to the 2nd floor yourself and picked up the food \"to go\" rather than ordering room service from the same restaurant (e.g. Thai Fried Rice was $5.95 to-go instead of the same rice dish would have been $13.95 plus tax/plus gartuity/plus room delievery fee of $3). So, for the 30 second elevator ride (as even on the 29th floor the lift seemed to instantly arrive each time), it was an obvious deal. If we could have gotten the hotel for around $150 - $200 night w/parking, I would have been \"blown-away\".

I also definitely recommend dinner and drinks at the Clift Hotel on Geary St (a few blocks walk away) - a great vibe and awesome food for quantity and quality. We felt quite safe walking around the area, however we were told not to venture down 6th St after dark. We spent a lot of time riding the cable car between Fishermans Wharf and our hotel, right up until midnight with no concerns at all. Cabs were convenient for where the cable cars didn't run and were inexpensive. During our stay, the hotel was full at all times, yet we had no problems getting in and out or getting access to one of the 8 lifts.

The area has a seedy feel\u2014lots of homeless people sleeping on sidewalks and urinating in the street. Conversely, it is in a good spot for shopping, with Macy\u2019s, the Gap and many other chains within five minutes walking distance. It\u2019s also a half a block from the cable turnaround and several bus lines. The attractive lobby is spacious with lots of seating areas. The front desk clerk was very friendly when we checked in. We asked for a smoking room, as high up as possible and she put us on the 15th floor \u2013the highest in the smoking section, so we had a good view of the city. The rooms themselves were not that big, but you find that a lot in large cities. We had two double beds, an armoire with 27-inch TV, and two comfortable overstuffed chairs, and an iron and ironing board. The bathrooms were small and nondescript, but they did have hair dryers, and provided shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, a shower cap and shoe shine mitt (but no sewing kit). The conditioner and moisturizer, both from Bath and Body Works, looked identical and one morning I put the moisturizer in my hair instead of conditioner. I wish they would distinguish the bottles in some way or make their products in different colors! The bath mat looked as if it could use a good bleaching, with a brown something or other on it that made me uncomfortable enough that I never put it in the tub. Sometimes there were hairs on the bathroom floor that they never cleaned up when the housekeeping staff made up the room. The towels were fairly thick but not soft. The bed linens were nice but the beds were not triple sheeted. The comforters were thick and done in beautiful rust tones which matched the fabric on the chairs, and the windows were expansive offering a great view and pretty window treatments. The hotel is supposed to be known for outstanding service, but one morning when we asked the concierge to try to get us a reservation at Boulevard, a popular San Francisco restaurant, she laughed at us. She ended up getting the reservation, and called us on our cell phone to let us know, but we felt that was somewhat demeaning to have her laugh. She could have said, \"Well, Boulevard is a very trendy restaurant, but I'll try my best to get you in.\" It was in the middle of the week after all. Another time, a different concierge seemed less than enthusiastic when we asked for directions to a sports bar so we could watch Sunday morning football. There was a pad of area maps on his desk, but he merely motioned with his head when describing where this bar was. \"It's over on 4th Street\" he grumbled. And when we asked, \"Well, where is that?\" he hastily said, (nodding his head toward the map which we were trying to read) \"Where that grey area is.\" as if he was annoyed at us for not knowing the streets! A good concierge would have highlighted the area on the map for us and told us how to get there. The hotel does provide complimentary coffee and tea on the second floor, each morning.

She outlined an alternative route that took us deeper into Marin County, away from the cliffs and was absolutely beautiful. Every day as I chatted with her, she also spoke to my kids about the area as well. My only two travel advisories are 1) don't walk directly west of the hotel, as within a couple of blocks you are in Tenderloin (not a great neighborhood) and 2)make sure you ask for a room on a higher floor to escape the immediate street traffic. In many ways the hotel is well positioned, right across from the cabel car turn-around and from a BART station that will take you to the airport ($4.95, have exact amount).

But God it was worth it...At the end of the day after walking all day, you need your cold beer to relax! The staff were very helpful, especially the front concierge where they can book tours for you. They were able to get us some tickets for Alcatraz.

The 4 star rating should be 3.5. The room was large and clean with an ok bath (not luxurious by any means). We had a high floor so no city noise. Corridors are bright and newly carpeted. Our dealings with the hotel staff were minimal, so I cannot fairly comment on the service. Superb location near the Powell Street Cable Car, Nordstrom (and 2005 the new Bloomingdale's), Abercrombie, Gap, and two blocks away from Union Square with almost every luxury retailer you could want. BART within 30 yards and one block away is the Market Street trolly. However, San Francisco is loaded with beggers, panhandlers and homeless people. Interestingly, NONE of them are of Asain descent...ponder that. They seem to congregate near the subway area (big shock!) but are not aggressive. Not a plethora of restaurants near the hotel, and the doorman did advise (read: warn) us not to venture onto the streets toward the rear of the hotel. We took his advice and had a great safe trip. Fisherman's Wharf is little but T-shirt shops and mediocre tourist restaurants. Don't miss the cable car...even if there is a long line.

So maybe the room worked out to around $120 a night (pretty good!). We did not know anything about the hotels in SF. We used this site and people seemed to say some good things about Parc 55. I travel on Business and usually like to stay in Marriott\u2019s. This Hotel is owned by Marriott so that ment it would meet a minimum acceptable standard for me. Some general thoughts about the hotel. 1) Star rating - the hotel is listed as a 4 star hotel. I think it is a little shy of that - maybe a 3.75 star. Only a little better than a standard Marriot. 2) Room was good sized, clean, comfortable bed, and quiet. 3) Staff - not too bad. Cleaning ladies came by often to see if room was cleaned. Concierge messed up and was supposed to have flowers in the room BEFORE we checked in - but came up afterwards. Food was okay. 4) Views - ask for a room on the 12th floor or higher to get a decent view. They gave us a corner room on the 12th which was pretty good. 5) Bums and Panhandlers - In general, SF has a lot of homeless people. Be prepared where ever you are walking around to be asked for money. They are not mean or aggressive - but they are every where - not just around this hotel. 6) Location - right next to the Powell Street Bart station. Was able to save money and just take BART to hotel. Again - the Bart Station has alot of bums, but during the day there are plenty of regular folks too - so it was safe. Also this hotel is kind of on the edge of the \"Tenderloin district\". Know where you are going when you head out for a walk - talk with the bellmen. However, you are right next to an upscale mall, and the cable cars, shops and resturants. Bottom line on this hotel? Good value for the money. Clean, comfortable, above average. Looking for something more upscale and willing to pay (double/triple) for it? Look to the Mandarin. Also let me share quick thoughts on SF in general. City is a little dirty - to much trash in the streets. To many bums. Commercial Architecture is a little boring. Restaurants - If you can afford $75 per person - try Aqua and Boulevard. They were FANTASTIC. Go on a NAPA valley wine tour. Bus will pick you up at Hotel. Loved it! Go on a bus tour to Muir Woods and Sausalito. We went to the Muir woods in the morning but they were only going to let us spend 30 min in Sausalito. Get off the bus in Sausalito and spend the afternoon there- take a ferry back to the pier warf. Skip Fisherman\u2019s Warf for site seeing. Sausalito is MUCH better. One last thing - If you are looking for an alternative trip - instead of SF - come to Chicago !
