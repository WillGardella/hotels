The hotel was recently renovated to modern and very chic standards. The choice of rooms varies but in all by Paris standards the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The staff are always on hand to assist with taxis, internet, (power converters as I always forget!) and they are extremely welcoming each time that I return. This hotel is ideally situated between Miromesnil, Madeleine and Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e Clemencau metro stops, buses and velib stops, making getting around the city much easier. I highly recommend this hotel for both business and tourist visits to the city.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai", "Title": "\u201cNot up to its website pictures\u201d", "Author": "Chinesechou", "ReviewID": "UR121830208", "Content": "I was looking forward to stay in this hotel, but I went from one disappointment to another: - room incredibly small althought I booked a DOUBLE room and paid higher price to be in bigger room.
