There was complimentary breakfast which consisted of cakes and you made your own coffee in the room. There was a lift. Although the hotel is on a main road we had a room near the back and so the traffic did not bother us. It was easy to get buses to Fisherman's Wharf and other parts of San Francisco. There was a bicycle rental shop three or four blocks away which we used on two occasions. The hotel is also very close to Cow Hollow where there are lots of restaurants. If we go to San Francisco again I would be quite happy to stay here again.

One of the aspects that drew us was the free parking, which is great in the middle of San Francisco. We asked for a quiet room and we were not disappointed. Our room was spacious and clean, with a full sized refrigerator! We didn't need it, but had we been staying longer than a night, we would have taken advantage of this. There is an elevator as well as 2 sets of stairs and motel style rooms, which open directly to the outdoor tiered walkways. The free donuts in the lobby were a bonus when I checked out.

(deposit to assure the return of the TV remote control. I guess we fit the remote stealing profile) Requested a microwave in each room and there was only a microwave in one (honestly never used the one we had) Locked gate to the roof (dont know that we would have spent longer then a few minutes anyway...took some pictures and came back down) BIGGEST COMPLIANT Paper thin pillows...you know, the type you have to fold in half so you can at least feel them under your head and only 2 on each queen size bed.

Also just up the road (literally) is the top of Lombard Street, the world's windiest road. We stayed in room 38, which is on the 3rd floor directly facing Lombard. There are exterior stairs and an elevator close by. The room was clean enough and had adequate facilities, including a shower/toilet separate from the vanity area; a refrigerator; and a TV. You pay a deposit for room keys and the TV remote. The staff is friendly and always available. When our toilet stopped up they had a guy up to fix it within 5 minutes. They also offer donuts and pastries there at the front desk in the morning, which was nice and unexpected. They have free Wi-fi, not even a password, though it is extremely slow. The fridge makes a loud-ish rattling sound so I unplugged it at night and propped open its door. Also due to its location on Lombard, there is traffic all night long outside and this is fairly noisy. Walls are thin, as expected for a lower-end motel. The morning we checked out, there was no hot water at all, so no showers for us. They said the hot water heater had stopped working for everyone, for some reason. Many places charge for parking but Redwood's is free, and they guarantee you a space; if you come back from somewhere and there are no spaces they say they will take your keys and double-park you in the lot until a space opens up. They are also close to bus lines in case you like using transit to get around.

Room had 2 double beds and a rollaway. Pros = Value, we got this room at $150/night with free parking and doughnuts/muffins in the office. Microwave, frig, large room on the corner (room 49) of the top floor. For 5 people, in this city, this was pretty cheap, given what I was finding. The front desk woman was helpful. There was an elevator, albeit very slow, that really helped with all our bags. Bathroom was small, but adequate - overall the room was spacious. Neutral = Location was safe, and not too far from Ghirardelli Square - maybe 7-8 blocks? But with kids, it's not totally ideal - next time I would probably stay at Union Square, where there is a cable car turnabout right there. You cant catch the cars near the hotel, according to the desk. But that said, it was a reasonable walk to Ghirardelli and not that bad to the Wharf. The cleanliness of the room was fine - it wasn't blowing me away, but it wasn't dingy either. It is definitely a budget hotel, and if I weren't in the heart of SF, I would not have considered this as big a bargain. Cons = For those who don't like entering your room from the outdoors (motel style), this isn't for you. My wife doesn't like that - so that was a negative. We were reluctant to open the windows, because it just opens to the catwalk outside where people are walking. There was a sign outside the office that I didn't see until we left that said something about a health issue regarding asbestos. WTF? Since we were leaving I decided not to think about it. Also, the cable had pretty limited channels. There was HBO but no ESPN. Overall this was a good value in a decent location with free parking, which is huge. I might stay here again if I were alone or with buddies, but with my family I would probably look for something a bit closer to the cable car turnabouts or where I was closer to the Wharf or Union Square - if I could afford it.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Howell, NJ", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "cfisch", "ReviewID": "UR17619252", "Content": "We stayed at the Redwood Inn from 6/27/08-6/30/08.

They helped us to book tours and followed up to make sure our bus would pick us up without us asking them to. They were like family when we returned and wanted to know if we enjoyed our tour. The hotel is within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, markets, gas, and resturants. There were also some laundramats close by, if needed.

This place is a standard motel. But clean and comfortable. Be sure to ask for a room in the back as Lombard st. is very busy, even into the late hrs of the night. Mai at the front desk was just wonderful! She helped us out so much with directions and suggestions. You can take the stairs to the roof and see part of the Golden Gate Bridge. This location is away from Union square and fisherman's wharf, but only a short busride. They have free parking but the parking lot is very tight. Thank goodness we ditched the car the first night back in SF. All rooms are non smoking and they do not allow pets. However,There is a doggie day care down the street. As far as accomodations, the room has a/c, a nice size refrigerator, coffee maker,tv, but no alarm clock. (I found that odd.) Free internet, and HBO. They do not provide toiletries like shampoo or conditoner. That was no biggie to us since we always pack our own anyway. One thing that did irk me is, they never bothered to throw away the tiny sliver of soap that was now half the size (and we all know how BIG those motel soaps are..lol) that we used to wash our hands with by the sink. You would think they would have replaced that. We diddnt have breakfast there so I cant comment on the continental breakfast. I really have no complaints about the motel. It served our needs as a family of four. We diddnt stay in the room much anyway. Would I stay here again? Probably. But first I would like to try some other places in San Francisco.

We thought staying a night in San Francisco would be exciting. I was looking for a moderately priced hotel that would accomodate four people comfortably. I found the Redwood Inn while searching the internet for a hotel that would meet my needs, and reserved a room based solely on the reviews of other guests. Making the reservation was a challenge because it does not have a website or published e-mail address. There was no way to make my reservation online. Also, there were no pictures of the hotel on the internet. When we arrived in San Francisco, after 6 hours of driving, we found the hotel relatively easily. It's a little tricky with the rules on Lombard street. While the front office staff were friendly and helpful, to the point of offering concierge services for tourists, we were a little dismayed at being charged a $50 deposit and assigned a remote for the tv in our room. The one elevator on the property is small and confusing to operate, but we made our way to our room and washed up before walking several blocks down to Fishermans Wharf. The room was adequate, but nothing special. We had a double queen bed room, with a table & chairs and a small refrigerator. The other amenities of the hotel included free parking and pastries for breakfast. There is also a small observation deck on the roof. Overall the hotel served its purpose, but I think it's seen better days.

I must say, this is the best bargain I've ever had in San Francisco - and I have gone there several times over the past 14 years. First of all, the staff are very friendly and polite. On the first day I got there, I noticed that one of the light bulbs in the bathroom was burned out, so I notified the front desk. Not more than one minute later, one of the maids was knocking on our door to rectify the situation. Now, this is my idea of prompt customer service, if it still exists anywhere! Without asking them, we were given an upper floor room towards the back, away from the traffic noise in the front. I slept very comfortably all 3 nights I was there. The hotel room itself was kept very immaculate by the maids. Also, a great plus for the room was the mini-fridge, as mentioned by the past reviewers. The reason why this is convenient is because some of you may not want to have their free donuts and small muffins for breakfast (this limited choice is their only downside), and may opt instead to buy stuff like yogurt or juice. My friend and I walked to Fisherman's Wharf with no problems. The neighborhood seems nice and quiet, safe enough to walk around at night. If you're game for an uphill walk, you can even make it to the crooked street to take pictures. (I would avoid driving to the crooked street by car in the late afternoon or evenings, because there always seems to be an endless line of cars stretching for blocks). I took the advice of one of the past reviewers and took in the amazing views at the rooftop of the hotel. I was so impressed! Overall, this is quite a gem of a hotel.

The good points: -the location. It was a little off the beaten path so in general was quieter than, say the Union Square area, yet it close to Van Ness Ave. where you can catch a bus to Fisherman's Wharf or to Market St. We actually walked from this hotel to Pier 39 and found it to be a pleasant walk. Also there were no homeless people as there were near hotels in other areas. -the room. It was a good size and the beds were comfortable. It was also very clean, as was the bathroom. -the extras. The room had a mini-fridge, which came in handy when we decided to buy milk and cereal at the gas station food mart down the street. Also, it had A/C. I know people say that it doesn't get hot in SF, but when we were there it was quite sunny. The rooms would get stuffy so we appreciated being able to cool them down with the A/C. -free parking. After spending a few days walking and using MUNI, we spontaneously decided to rent a car to drive over the Golden Gate Bridge and see other areas. It was nice to know that we could park for free at the Inn. -the elevator. Although we had a room at the fourth floor at this exterior hall motor inn, we had no trouble getting our luggage up there because of the elevator. The only negative was the Internet service (which is free). My husband needed to check e-mails and found the connection rather slow. Also, he would lose the connection if we turned on the TV. If you need Internet, we advise you to ask for a room near the front where the wireless connection is better. However, we expect that many vacation travelers would not need the Internet so much, in which case this would be a good hotel choice. (It isn't a business hotel, after all). As I said, overall we were happy with it and would stay here again if ever we needed a downtown SF hotel again. We paid $100 for a one queen-bed room and felt it to be a good value.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Redwood Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81249-Reviews-Redwood_Inn-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$75 - $125*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1530 Lombard Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94123</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515985", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/05/16/19/san-francisco.jpg"}}
