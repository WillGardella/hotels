The staff are wonderful - Caroline, the assistant manager greeted us warmly on our return from a few days in Provence. She has a gift for making one feel special. The front desk staff are very helpful, arranging taxis, answering all our questions, even helping me get wi-fi access to my new Ipad, which I'm just getting used to. The location is perfect for sightseeing, most attractions being either walking distance or a short taxi ride. The rooms are adequate but don't look for huge - this is Paris after all. But they are clean and comfortable. The shower had the best water pressure I've ever seen in a hotel. What was really nice was that after a day of galleries, shops and sightseeing we could retire to the lounge for a scotch (Glenfiddich) or glass of champagne - no charge. Our package included a driver to and from the airport as well as a very nice cheese tray. It's nice to see your driver waiting for you as you step out of arrivals, holding up a card with your name on it. Pampering like this I could get used to!

Breakfast was excellent and mine was included, as was pickup and return to train and airport. The service was mediocre in my opinion. Many of the front desk personnel were inattentive, untrained, too busy. Any thing that was not a very common tourist request was unknown, too difficult or simply impossible. Most of the time I simply ended up doing it myself (a St Martin Canal trip, a restaurant that could accommodate a vegetarian, etc, not too odd ball at all) although the rooms were generally clean, several times things were just forgotten or not done, including leaving large pieces of glass from a glass broken by housekeeping on my bathroom floor.

If I was to go there again, I would probably choose either a standard room or the larger suite on the first floor that does not have a terrace. I say that because there is so much road noise (lots of scooters and motorcycles) in Paris, that leaving the window to the terrace open at night was out of the question. We did enjoy a lovely lunch out there though, with lovely finger food purchased at the fresh market that is just around the corner from the hotel. We indulged in the champagne in the afternoon and before bed - the open bar is a very nice touch at this hotel, whether you want champagne of just water or a soda - it makes it seem that you have a large family home in Paris!

The blocks around the hotel simply breathe of luxury in hushed tones. The creativity that goes into Parisian window displays \u2013 whether to front a high-fashion house or a neighborhood chocolatier \u2013 is unmatched anywhere in the world. This is one of the best neighborhoods to experience window shopping, where a medieval maze of streets have trend-setting boutiques, old shops like Poilane, as well as, larger stores like Au Bon March\u00e9. Between the church of St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and that of St-Sulpice, hides a little restaurant La Petite Cour and just a little further is great dining at Helene Darroze. All of this adds to your stay at Esprit Saint Germain. The hotel interior has the same panache - subtle but its detail, detail, detail. The cozy fireplace in the living room just lures you in like being in a private club. Wonderful candles add to the glow and fresh aromas. Everything has been thought out. As the hotel is small - efficiency rules and the space is utilized very smartly. The bathrooms are perfectly fitted, sleek slate, great lighting, mirrors with storage behind, and a deep soaking tub.

The property is warm, modern and ideally located in Saint Germain, and the staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible, including by making reservations (and providing mapped directions to the reserved locations!) and arranging transportation. All of the staff were very nice and genuinely happy to help. The room was great and the bathroom was excellent in comparison to comparable hotels. Extra touches such as the fact that every day fresh fruit was left in the room and the open bar in the room and downstairs reflect the hotel's thoughful attention to detail.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cA perfect hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "TheVastMachine", "ReviewID": "UR5378543", "Content": "This hotel is brilliant from start to finish. Check in was fast and friendly. The guy who checked us accompanied us to the room and explained all of its features. The room itself was small but incredibly well appointed. Lots of storage space for a room of its size. Clean, modern lines, and everything in the room worked perfectly. Internet is wireless and free, albeit kind of slow. (The only issue was for some strange reason I could not access gmail or american express from my laptop, though I could from the hotel's PC in the basement.) The free bar in the comfortable lobby certainly doesn't hurt! The area is chock full of good restaurants. Except for the slow internet and the lack of soda water in the bar (!) this hotel is perfect!", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, CA", "Title": "\u201cFIRST CLASS home away from home\u201d", "Author": "mwellsVenice_CA", "ReviewID": "UR5336128", "Content": "The Esprit Saint Germain is set in the most fashionable district of Paris so it puts you in the heart of everything. There is no \"check-in\" desk at this hotel, only lounges where upon your arrival you are served with complimentary beverages and a snack as you check in. We booked a standard room (the lowest priced of all their rooms) but there was nothing standard about it. The room was spacious and light-filled with a huge King sized bed (beautifully made up with down comforter and incredibly soft sheets), a desk and small lounge chair. It had a nice bathroom with a deep soaking tub and all the modern conveniences found in great boutique hotels. The staff was so friendly, well informed and always provided maps whenever we asked for directions to areas of interest. The continental breakfast was adequate but good (French food tends to be good in general) though there are numerous cafes where you could venture to eat. This hotel is excellent for visitors who have already been to Paris and want to \"live it up\"! Can't beat the location, the energy of the neighborhood and its proximity to all things you would want to discover and know about Paris. Highly recommend this hotel!!!", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cpili very good front desk\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4499909", "Content": "very nice hotel and very friendly staff specialy Pili, We will come soon.

If you are tired of the big super Luxe hotels (and many of us are) this is a nice alternative where you don't feel fussed over - but you do feel cared for and well-attended. I am a frequent traveller to Paris, and most of my experience has been with the Ritz, Plaza Athenee, and Le Bristol. They are all fine properties. But my attempts at finding the right, small left bank hotel have all been disappointments - until Esprit Saint Germain. Very intimate without being too familiar, chic enough to make you feel comfortable if you are used to living well, and well-located in the 6th, steps from everything. With all the services you have come to expect, but none of the pretension - and a few extra special warm touches to make you want to come back sooner rather than later. Staff - professional, warm and charming people; Rooms, small, but well-done and cleverly laid out to smartly use the space; CLEAN; QUIET; This does not feel like a hotel as much as a small, quiet, private club.
