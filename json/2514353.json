The room was very small and unclean there was no space for 4 people and luggage. We were also told that this hotel was recently renovated I don't think so. We complained to staff and we were given another room which was bigger but the smell of mildew was enough that we all felt sick. A fan sat outside the room so I guess they had a water issue but of course failed to inform us. We didn't stay the night, we left for another hotel which was lovely and clean. When we phoned Best Western customer service to complain they said there is nothing they can do because this hotel is independent, well guess what I won't stay at another Best Western again", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI love the room and breakfast is excellent.\u201d", "Author": "MojiOkubule", "ReviewID": "UR127311424", "Content": "It is very clean, full service provided and the breakfast is excellent .

We took the subway to Ground Zero to see the 911 Memorial which we hightly recommend. The hotel was clean and had a nice bathroom with good shower pressure. We thought the breakfast buffet was a little expensive at $15, atleast for us, so we ate breakfast at McDonalds. The only problem we had was the parking. We had trouble finding the hotel's parking garage. Once we finally found it we were told our vehicle was too big (we drive a Yukon) and had to go to the other garage, which was even farther away and more difficult for us to find. With all the fast pace traffic in NY you really nead to know where you are going to be ready to turn. We went by it a couple of times before we were able to get into the right lane to turn into the building. But it finally worked out and we had a great time. We recommend this hotel when visiting NY.

Honestly, the lobby and hallways look like you have entered a brothel.These spaces are decorated in purple plush and leather. The lobby offers beer, wine and cocktails for $5 to the public. I did not feel unsafe there, but it was not a lobby I would be comfortable relaxing in. Our room was not decorated in purple, but in a Presidents theme with Mount Rushmore over the pull out bed and a lighted bust of George Washington in the other room. I awoke to pictures of Gerald Ford and John Kennedy for three days. The room was clean, and the maid service excellent. When you book a room in Times Square you expect noise, energy and action.

The hotel looks very boutique which I would not have expected from a Best Western property. I got a terrific rate and the location is fantastic if you are going to be Broadway show hopping, which we were. Upon check in, I was sent to a room that had HAIR in the shower. Being that I'm in the hospitality industry, and I didn't want to be ungrateful for my great rate, I just asked to be moved to another room. I was moved to a corner room where there was more hair in this bathroom than the last. I was kind of disappointed, but nevertheless, asked to be moved again. This time I was going to be moved to a courtyard room that smelled of smoke, so I opted to go back to the corner room and have housekeeping come up and clean the bathroom. The security man who was on duty was very nice and assisted me as well as a member of the housekeeping staff. The rooms are teeny, tiny but overall for the 4 nights I was there, I had a very cozy stay with my daughter. The Pros: Great Location, trendy lobby, nice housekeeping staff and bellstaff (or door staff) not really sure what their function was, in-room digital safe was convenient, great shower pressure. Cons: Front desk staff is NOT friendly or welcoming, unresponsive to guest concerns, seemed overwhelmed by the amount of check ins, blamed other members for issues, for example: DO NOT STAY IN A CORNER ROOM if you NEED internet access! Internet DOES NOT work! I was told, \"Yeah, that's because you are in a corner room why your internet does not work because of the metal\". Really? I didn't get any apology. Advise guests of this. I heard from other guests that internet was generally slow except in lobby which is why, I imagine, lobby was always packed with people on their laptops. Hallways are too hot, A/C unit in room is extremely loud, elevators are too small and take forever. Upon my check out, the agent did not smile or thank me for staying-she seemed annoyed that she had to walk to her bank to refund my deposit.

There are lots of pros and also a few cons about the hotel. But overall I don't regret my stay there and I think if you are realistic you won't either. There are lots of hotels in Manhattan that charge significantly more. Pros: 1. Location. If it's your first time in Manhattan and you want to be in the middle of all the touristy stuff OR if you're going for the theatre, you really are supremely well located. A minute walk and you're in either location. The benefit of having a hotel in the heart of the city is that you can use it as a base and return to freshen up or drop off stuff if the need occurs. 2. Subway lines: You are a couple of minutes from several subway lines. Very convenient. 3. Restaurants: kind of expensive, but a reality of any downtown city resto, you can choose from an enormous amount of restaurants 4. Staff: I saw a lot of complaints on the site about the staff, but my experience was ok overall. It's a busy hotel. The staff were courteous and helpful. 5. Rooms: It's a hotel room in NYC. Really how much time do you want to stay there? My room was clean. Bed/sheets were clean. Floor and toilet as well. I felt comfortable walking barefoot. A couple smaller things weren't cleaned well: There's nothing like reaching for the TV remote control and having a hand full of dust. I guess previous occupants didn't really use it too much, but little details like that stick out. If you can live with little imperfections you'll be fine. 6. Price: It really is decent value for Times Square. 7. Did I mention location? Negatives: 1. Small towels. 2. Internet. Sometimes I was able to connect, sometimes I wasn't. It was 50/50. That was annoying. It's better in the lobby though. 3. Cheesy decor. No seriously. It's beyond words. 4. Had booked a queen bed but it looked more like a small double bed. Sofa bed is also small. 5. Noise. I was on the 8th floor and you definitely heard stuff from time to time from the street. It wasn't a big deal for me cause I'm a city girl but it's something you may have to deal with especially on the lower levels. Overall, this is definitely not a five star hotel.

Dear Sirs My partner and I stayed in the Best Western President Hotel, Times Square, New York under the above reservation number on 5th December 2011. I don\u2019t know where to start\u2026 from start to finish the whole stay was just a disaster. For a hotel trading under the Best Western name I would never have imagined to have the problems we experienced. We booked a King Deluxe room and upon checking into our room I noticed that the room was poorly cleaned. As my partner and I began to unpack our belongings I noticed the bed did not appear to have been cleaned properly, upon pulling back the covers it appeared they had not been cleaned at all and had several stains on. Not the best start to our stay!! I called down to the receptionist and advised her of this, to which she offered me an additional room, the only other room available which was not a King Deluxe room or if it was as the receptionist had instructed it had half of the amenities missing! Upon viewing this room it also seemed unclean and terribly small. We opted to stay in our first room, room 918 and asked that someone come up to our room and replace the bed sheets while we were out. When we returned to the room the sheets had indeed been cleaned however in the meantime the bottom of the air conditioning vent had fell down, exposing all of the wiring and being as it was so dusty and decrepit had deposited a lot of dust onto the floor. Not only is this very hazardous and totally unacceptable it was very unsightly. Had we had our children with us this could have jeopardised their safety. All in all it was an awful stay. The room considering it was advertised as a King Deluxe room in a newly refurbished hotel was not what we received. The room itself was run down with marks all over the wall and unsightly stains on the skirting boards. Upon check out it was the same lady who check us in, who I had spoken to about the bed linen being unclean, who had offered us the alternative bedroom, I also informed her of the air conditioning unit to which she just thanked me for letting her know and she made a note of it. We were not even asked if everything was ok with our stay which is I believe a Best Western standard policy. I have stayed in many Best Western hotels all around the world and am actually booked to stay in one in Paris in January although I have to admit I am now very apprehensive about this booking after staying in the Best Western President Hotel! Look forward to hearing from you. The hotel manager contacted myself and my partner to offer us an upgrade... when we would never wish to stay inn that hotel again. I advised him that we lived in the UK and would not be likely to returning to NYC, my last two emails have been ignored...

The hotel decor is really funky but totally let down by the standard of cleanliness not only in the rooms but in the communal areas. I feel no matter how much you pay or the star rating of the hotel it should, at the very least, be clean. Everyone in our party seemed to have issues with the temp in the rooms - they were so hot!! The heating/cooling system is so old and in most cases didn't work so we left our window open the whole time. The staff on reception seem to only want to provide the bare minimum of customer service, don't expect any empathy when approaching them with an issue - it's frustrating to say the least.

It's very artsy and well decorated, and somewhat gaudy. When I first walked in, I thought I had inadvertently entered a trendy restaurant because of the decor. I was turning to leave and a doorman approached me to ask if I was looking for the BW. I expected he would send me somewhere else, but to my surprise he told me I was in the right place. There's a beautiful fish tank behind the check-in desk. Staff were all very polite, but reserved. 3) The value was good, but please read the cons as well. Through my company, the hotel was half the price of others in the area. The room was nicely decorated and clean. 4) Internet speed was good, 10M down 4M up during the afternoon. Cons: 1) The biggest problem was the heat. It was HOT in the middle of January. I can't imagine this place in the summer. I walked in and one window was slightly opened, and the room was 85F. I turned the AC on high and set the temperature to 40F. The room would not go below 78 with the windows closed and the air on. The entire floor was warm, not just my room. The room did have a portable fan. Before going to dinner, I opened all three windows, and put the fan in one. I hoped a pigeon didn't fly in because there are no screens. Returning I was pleased to find the room temp had dropped to 63. I dropped the AC from high to low, and closed the windows to try to sleep. Around 2am I woke up sweating because it was back up to 80F again. I opened the windows to breath, but even on the 14th floor, that lets all the noise of NY city in. There must be a boiler room below on the 13 floor, because even when I turned on the cold water, it came out hot. After running for a few minutes it will get cold...but it comes out hot, not warm. 2) The building itself is very old. There are 2 very old and narrow elevators, and 1 updated elevator. If there were ever a fire, I would not expect to get out alive with small elevators and staircase. On several trips in and out there were bags of rubbish in the hall, and several paint cans on a cart. I wouldn't call it unsafe, because it's probably \"grandfathered\" up to code, but it's not nearly as safe as a new hotel in my opinion. 3) The room keys are sensitive and stop working. During my two days there, my key stopped working, and I saw several other guests having the same problem. 4) There were no face cloths or hand towels in the room. I left a note for the cleaning staff, and returned to find the note was gone, but no face cloths or hand towels. I then asked at the front desk, and some were quickly sent up. 5) The room was tiny. Similar to staying on a boat. You have to plan ahead to move around. You won't fit in the room with two large suitcases. Summary: Overall good value for the price and great location. Probably the perfect place to stay after the ball drop on New Years eve, and I promise you'll warm up quickly. I would never consider staying here in the summer. The location and decor were great, but when I travel on business, I don't want to even think about the room, or temperature, or keys, etc. There are so many places to stay in the city.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBad attitude service, bad maintence\u201d", "Author": "veronica d", "ReviewID": "UR123619960", "Content": "For this price in manhattan, don't expect it to be anything good.

Suni greeted us upon our arrivals and departures but she got to know our names which made the experience more personal and warm. We will definitely visit the hotel again and hope that Suni is working during our visit.

I should have realised something was wrong when I was checking in. There was another line of people all complaining. I had booked a double room when I booked into and paid for this hotel 4 months before my visit. The room we were given was so small I realised something was wrong as there was only a bedside table and bedside light on one side, but having crossed the Atlantic I was exhausted. This was a single room and the bed was quite narrow. The receptionist rudely said it was considered a double bed. But it was definitely a single room. My broom cupboard is bigger. They offered me another room provided I repacked my luggage. The next room was not much bigger but it did have bedside tables on both sides of the bed. However the temterature in the room was like a sauna and we could not switch off the heat. I demanded to speak to the manager but he refused to meet me but they did provide a better room. with a double bed. One drawback there was only a single bedsheet to cover us. I asked to be moved to another Best Western Hotel and was told that they were a privately owned hotel and had only some sort of association with the Best Western Chain. The corridors of this dump of a hotel are extremely narrow yet they are permanently crowded with laundry carts and huge waste collection bins on wheels. If there was ever a fire in this hotel there would be a serious risk to life in a smoke filled space. The corridors are also extremely dirty and never seem to be cleaned or vacuumed. It is obvious that there is no proper management in this hotel. Although it enjoys an ideal location the fact that I joined several disappointed guests trying to get what they had been promised in the promotion of this 'hotel' definately took the shine off the stay. Let me offer advice to the owners. 1 Fire the manager. 2 Dedicate one room per floor for laundry carts and dustbins. Train reception staff on how to deal with genuine complaints.

Finding the hotel on the street is quite easy - just look for the only dark spot :). Male concierge was no help at all. On our first evening we went to him to ask what we can do at that time, hoping he could recommend a restaurant or something like that. He said: you're in the centre of New York, you can do anything... On one hand he was probably right, on the other - not the answer I would expect in a four star hotel. We also had a problem with the airport shuttle we had booked in a hotel. Concierge (female one) advised us to take a shuttle that leaves 3,5 hour prior to our flight (from JFK). If went straight to the airport, that might have been OK, but we had to pick up people from other hotels (and they were late), so we ended up driving through our street 50 minutes after we left it. Traffic is obviously not a driver's fault, but when we got to the airport he started to drop off people from the last terminal (our's was first), which costed us another 10 minutes. After all we got to the terminal 1 hour 30 minutes before departure (to Europe) and almost missed our flight.

We are in our late 20's and this was just enough for us. We have stayed in four-five star hotels before and I would say this hotel rates about a 3. We had a couple minor issues that we more or less bit the bullett on and just went with it due to the fact it's NYC and we got a great deal. Going into our trip I had read some horror stories and been a little nervous before getting there but was relieved when we saw the room. The location could not have been any better. Literally 2min walking to the heart of times square and subway stops within a couple blocks to anywhere. It was 15 degrees with the windchill and we were happy the entire time. The lobby staff were receptive to our needs as best they could and were very friendly most of the time. The only issues we had were #1 the thermostat in the room seemed to blow hot air constantly....I quickly figured out setting the thermostat to ON and turning it on 70 would keep the room a little cool at night but the auto function was wayyyyyyyy worse....set it to on and 70. #2 we ended up being on the second floor and I read about the noise close to street level so we downloaded white noise apps on our phones and ran one through the iPhone docking station(turn it on airplane mode or it'll pop off and on) and sat the other on the other side of the bed and used earplugs at night. In four nights we never we're woken up by a car horn or sirens. #3 if your going for the free wi-fi....go elsewhere or live in the lobby. Our room on the second floor managed 1-2 bars intermittently, if any at all, but towards the center of the building and the lobby we had full service. But you're here to take in NYC; not look at Facebook and keep up with the world right?lol. #4 our shower curtain in our stand up shower was too short by about half an inch so when we showered the tiny bathroom flooded due to the curtain passing over the ledge and water running off. I made a complaint and asked for a longer curtain and immediately the front desk staff notified housekeeping to come down via walkie talkie. When we came back I could tell they switched the curtain but it was the same as before. So we took the metal basket in the bathroom and sat it on the ledge at the back of shower for the magnet in the curtain to stick to....rolled a towel up and sat it on the middle of the ledge and that kept the curtain from passing over the ledge. Honestly these were very minor problems that were manageable like i said. If you expect a 4-5 star at the price you're paying.....wake up Alice. If you're wanting to stay some where at a price that real people can afford with just enough ammenities... then stay here and experience NYC. I was was very happy with our stay. If this were any other city I would have been slightly aggrevated with our problems but this is NYC, look at the prices of the hotels surrounding this and realize you can sacrifice a little and gain a lot. Location was excellent, people friendly, and a great price. My wife and I would def stay here again. Had an amazing trip and a good stay.

Also, be careful, because a lot of the rooms are facing an ally way and have no view at all and can be incredibly small and dark. One of the best things about coming to New York is having a room facing the street. There is something therapeutic about laying in bed at night and having city street noise. This is, in fact, the city that never sleeps! The front desk is extremely friendly with the exception of a few bad eggs. One in particular went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. I don't want to mention any names, but I can say that it sure made our trip \"Sunny!\". If you have any issues, don't bother calling down and speaking with the operators. They seem like they are burdened by the phone calls and really don't give you a chance to speak. What ever happened to customer service? If I were the front office manager (which I have been at a different hotel chain) I would find nice people to answer the phones, and that actually want to work. (There are plenty of people out there that need a job!) On to the guest rooms. Very Very Very Hot! Even though it was 28 degrees outside during the night, the window had to be open a good 4 inches to regulate the room temperature. This however, is very unsafe if traveling with children, because the windows do not have screens. The rooms can be small, but it is a city hotel in the middle of Times Square, so that is not a big issue. The rooms are also well decorated with nice figures, presidential art, and gnarly headboards. (Thats right, I said gnarly) The television is a joke. There are only a few channels, even though they offer over 100 in the guest room book, and the (flat screen television) is an ancient model with terrible sound and no HD hook up. There is nothing special about it. You can't look at your bill, or watch a movie with the family. Two departments that need acknowledgement is the Maintenance department, and the Housekeeping department. They answer to calls quickly and are probably the friendliest in the industry. Hats off to all of you hard workers! However, the room attendants need to learn that fitted sheets go on first. They forgot a fitted sheet on the bed! There are two adjacent restaurants to the hotel in which you get a discount, however, they don't offer room service. One is a Vietnamese restaurant, and the other is Japanese. That could make the dining a little difficult if you are not into asian cuisine. The website also states that there is a bar. The bar is only open for a few hours at night and the bartender just sits on a chair texting on her cell phone, and is burdened by having to get up to make a drink. It also only stays open until 11:00PM. If you are looking to stay a few days in the middle of busy Times Square, and don't want to pay 300.00+ a night for a room, I would recommend staying here. Just remember, you get what you pay for! For such a small hotel, it is rather busy, so if you have questions about the area, the front desk may not be there to answer them, because they are busy checking people into the hotel. If I were the hotel manager, I would go around to all the guest rooms and make sure that everything is in working order, because there were a lot of stuff broken in our room. (dresser, toilet paper holder, shower head, blow dryer, and ironing board to name a few). Also, If I were the manager, I would go around to the Front Office Manager, and insure that they had friendly staff that were answering phones in the back, because they are the first person people talk to when calling the hotel for the first time, and people can tell when someone isn't smiling over the phone and hates there job.

Although the hotel's decor is funky, the pictures are deceiving and the hotel actually doesn't look as polish. But that is not the worst thing... the rooms are tiny. My room had a double bed- not a queen, not a king - and I barely had speace, in addition, the walls were scratched and did not look as clean. As soon as we checked in and entered the elevator to go to the room, there was a funny smell a mix of beer and weed. When we got on the hallway the smell of weed was incredibly strong and it was the same even inside our room. We told the front desk agent about it and asked if he could send security to check the rooms and he said there was not security. We asked for a manager on duty and there was none so we decided to check out and even explaining the situation the agent told us we were going to be charged the whole stay because we were within the cancellation policy and we actually did.

I really don't know what people are complaining about! The hotel is located directly off times square (you can get to times square in literally a 2 second walk!). It is uber modern and looks gorgeous from both the inside and out. Myself and my friend came to NYC for a 5 night stay, we are both 22 and wanted lots of partying and shopping. We found the location to be perfect as there is a subway station just a 5 minute walk away which is the main central subway station to get anywhere in the city. We spent most of our time in the West Village and only took around 5 minutes to get there via subway (Tribeca, Greenwhich, Soho and Meat Packing). However if you wish to get a cab, it can be difficult in this location as it is so busy, i would recommend turning left when you come out the hotel and walk to the next block where it is quieter if you wish to take a cab. The hotel staff were very helpful, and didn't bother us at all, we frequently came in at 5 in the morning and they were just as happy to see us as when we were off out in the day. The room was small but so are most rooms in NYC, we had lots of luggage and we are both very messy but it was not too small for us. We asked for a room with a good view and were given a 10th floor room with a balcony over looking Times Square. The room had a very good sized bathroom with a bath and shower, a double bed, safe and wardrobe. The bed was incredably comfortable and the room was very warm, but with air con available if you wanted it. I can see in some reviews people complained about the wifi, but it was free and worked fine for us up on the 10th floor!

We stayed at a B&B on the Upper West side for 4 days and at this hotel for the second half of our trip. The sign for the hotel was hard to see, lobby looked like a wannabe dance club, our first room was disgusting, gross, and dirty with a TV that didn't work and needed to be \"reset.\" I was seriously so very sad when I checked in to the 13th floor. I was afraid to take my shoes off for fear that I would get some disease from the carpet. We got the room for $166/nt through Priceline which, to me, was pretty high for such a scarily disgusting room. The accent pillow in the middle of the bed had some burgundy stain on it and there were dust/dirt/marks all over the walls, tiles, bathroom sink. We requested to move to another room due to the bed size. The front desk person told us she would upgrade us to a \"premium\" room which turned out to be a slightly cleaner room with A/C that was loud and did not seem to work. The second day in our \"premium\" room on the 10th floor, we were locked out and front desk gave some lame excuse about not having our cell phone numbers on file. There was a bit of noise from outside just because of the tourist location. Thank goodness it was our first time in New York so we were always out and about, but seriously, I was amazed at the poor condition of our first room. My fiance thought that any hotel room under $200 in New York was probably in similar conditions. I hope he's wrong. Positive was the location, between Times Square and Hell's Kitchen with easy access to subways, restaurants, shopping, Dave Letterman show theater, Broadway shows, and numerous other attractions.

There is an option for a continental breakfast or a full breakfast in the entry lobby. It is not a deal and you would do better to go to one of the small delis or an Europa cafe.

With modern common areas, great decor and refurbished rooms. However, not all rooms were fully refurbished and redecorated. First I was put in a small room, which at first sight had been restored, thanks to the new wallpaper and modern decor. However, the bathroom was not redecorated, seriously in need of work. The sink taps sometimes just lay cold water, while other times the water only came out hot. Everything was old. Poor air conditioning, too old, whose temperature I could not regulate and the noise was unbearable. A few days after arriving (and with very negative temperatures on the street and as air conditioning that didn't work properly) I tried to turn it off (despite the cold) but the situation only worsened. The noise grew louder and I had to ask to fix that. Although initially seem that the situation was resolved, the air conditioner started to make noise again and pour a lot of steam water (like a sauna). During the night, when I finally had fallen asleep, I began to feel a few drops of water falling on my body. The air conditioning released so much steam water that allowed water to accumulate on the roof, causing rain in bed. Faced with this situation, I went to reception and demanded immediate change of room. The new room had an air conditioner that worked properly and the room was more spacious.

The service of staff were polite with a bit of that new yorker twist :) they have a great little bar in the lobby and the staff there were great as well. Considering you're in the heart of the action, the price for the place was fair and justified considering other hotels adjacent to it were overcharging by at least $80 (US).

The BW Plus President is an excellent location between 8th and Broadway on 48th. Walk one-half block from this hotel to Broadway and all Times Square has to offer. Walk up two blocks to Stardust Diner where the aspiring singers and dancers will entertain you while you enjoy typical diner breakfast, lunch or dinner. The hotel has two restaurants flanking the hotel, Aoki and Saigon 48. Although I didn\u2019t eat there, the menus and prices looked reasonable; the hotel offers full American breakfast in the lobby for a fee. Room service for B L D. This hotel is older, the rooms are tiny by American standards. My bedroom was small (pictures posted) but adequate for one or two guests; it had one queen bed with nice crisp white sheets and duvet. The hotel recently underwent an extensive renovation and the carpet throughout looks new. Large flat screen television, ample plugs for electronics, modern lighting, double window coverings, a blackout shade and a decorative privacy shade, coffee maker, a small closet with safe, iron and ironing board and free local calls as well as free wifi. The tiny bathroom had a very short tub (4 1/2\u2019max). The shower was good, water pressure strong, hot water hot and a curved shower bar for added comfort. Good bathroom lighting, makeup mirror and hairdryer attached to the bathroom wall. Again, an average size traveler will have no problem in this small bathroom. I observed guests at reception who were wanting king rooms but paid standard double and a family of three who paid standard double and expected two double beds. The lowest price gets you one double or queen bed. I am told the hotel has king beds in suites and queen beds in some rooms but I didn't see those. The hotel has 44 suites with a bed and sofa bed, they also have Presidential suites with outside patios; I have only seen those in the brochure. Through a travel agency, I booked a vacations package with air and hotel at a very reasonable price. When I arrived the room was paid as agreed, I provided a credit card for incidentals ($3.80 for bottled water from the lobby bar). Remember with free internet throughout the hotel, paying for water is still a good value! The hotel has two small elevators that were fairly fast and smooth. Elevator service better than in many older hotels, but not as spacious (with 9 people was packed) or as many as in newer hotels. Hallways were dark with wallpaper and carpeting that added to the dark effect. I did think the maid cart should have a different home than always in the hallway but there probably isn\u2019t any place to store it when the hotels is completely full which it was. The large aquarium behind reception desk was a delight to the kids. By contrast to the dark corridors, the lobby is white and bright and airy. Caution to any traveler, you are buying a clean hotel with friendly personnel service and location, location, location. It is easy to pay two or three times the money for other hotels only blocks away. Value for money, this was hotel is perfect especially if you are one or two travelers only per room. I will stay here again and will recommend to friends. Remember Best Western hotels are not cookie cutter design they are independently owned properties unique to each location.

Our suite consisted of a good sized bedroom with a large tv and small fridge, and a similar sized sitting room with bed settee, again with a large tv. The bathroom had a large walk in shower. Overall the accomodation was very good. It was good to see the improvements that had been made since our last visit, but we were saddened to hear of the death of Manny, who was a porter then and who was a very helpful and really nice man.

When I arrived (at 10:30 am) the exceptionally RUDE woman at the front desk told me my room would be ready at 12. Although I didn\u2019t expect my room to be ready, I did want to check in and leave my luggage so we could set out on our journey through New York for the rest of the day and most of the evening. She would not let me check in, in fact, she was snippy and didn\u2019t welcome us nor did she even look me in the eye. I felt like I was an annoyance to her. We left our luggage and decided to do some shopping and have some lunch and then check in before we hit downtown \u2013 since the room would be ready by noon. We arrived back at the hotel at 1:30 and the same snippy woman said \u201cyour room is not ready, come back at 3\u201d.

Around 3 I called to make sure our room was ready, and it was. Upon arrival I was greeted by another woman who checked us in. We took the elevator to the third floor and was shocked by the stench and the bags of garbage sitting in the hall way. THE FLOOR STUNK! We got into our room and were pleased that it did not stink and was very clean and cool. I decided to get washed up and my daughter decided to play some music in the IPOD station. The whole window side of the room was without electricity. No working lights or IPOD station! I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to fix it. I also requested some towels and shampoo. We decided not to wait and left the room to do some shopping \u2013 which was already delayed by several hours. We returned to drop off some shopping bags and the stench in the hallway was even worse and now there were about 6 overflowing bags of trash right outside the elevator doors. We were happy however to find the lights and IPOD station working, but still no towels or shampoo. 2 calls later and towels and shampoo arrived. One positive note is that the bed was extremely comfortable, the air conditioning was great and the bathroom was clean. Woke up refreshed after a good night\u2019s sleep and my daughter went down to the gym while I ran out for some coffee. Once again I had to make my way around the overflowing bags of garbage and bear the disgusting smell of trash to get to my room from the elevator. When I returned my daughter was already back from the gym. She said the gym STUNK and was too hot. At that point we decided to check out instead of prolonging this experience any longer. I was annoyed to see the same woman who gave me such a hard time Monday morning at the reservation desk. I handed her my key and asked for my receipt and she told me you don\u2019t get one, if you want one you have to go through Priceline.

It was pouring rain when we got there. I had an umbrella but the kids didn't. Thankfully the staff allowed us to borrow an umbrella until we bought another one. They don't usually loan out umbrellas but it was nice regardless. We went shopping at midnight in the rain and had the best time!! When the kids left we moved to a room that was a closet. It was awful but again the concierge came to the rescue and moved us a few doors down with the window view as requested and it was extremely nice. Internet worked the rest of our stay. Every discomfort we had they dealt with immediately and kindly. But again we are sort of demanding. The location was very close to Times Square which was a wonderful surprise. We walked everywhere from our hotel. Great location!!

A tiny bathroom with no tub, just a standup shower. Elevator was down for most of the weekend. The decor was gross. When I read the review on their website, it said they just went through a $15 million renovation. That's physically impossible because I've stayed in the middle of no where and seen better renovations. The hallway was dark and purple with no lighting ( looked like a porno shoot) and stupid room service carts all over the place the WHOLE time. There arent any noise barriers either.

Our room was very small and many of the amenities that the hotel website claims the room to have were not provided. We were also situated next to what must have been a smoking room, and the smell often found its way into our room, something that I wasn't too comfortable about. The lobby in itself was beautifully decorated, but there was often other people's rubbish left around the seating area and most of the lobby floor space was taken up by \"stored\" luggage from holidaymakers who were leaving on that day. Most disappointing, in my opinion, was the service I received from the Front Desk staff. Although there always seemed to be a different person at the desk, it was rare to find someone who was not rude and uninterested. I feel that I was not provided with adequate information, for example, when check-out time was, which meant I was charged $100 for checking out 30mins late, after house-keeping had been holding up the room and preventing us from packing. Worse still is that we were not informed of this charge (\"just try and check out as soon as possible\" when we told them about house-keeping) and only realised what had happened when we returned to England and found $100 missing from our bank account. We are currently taking this up with Best Western Customer Service, but feel it displays the lack of communication that the staff wish to have between themselves and the customers.

Although Best western Platinum Elite member, I was offered one of the most lousy rooms which was extremely small, no decent view and was not clean. Phone calls to my room from outside were not patched through as front desk does not bother to answer the phone when they are busy and people calling from outside cannot directly dial your room number; they have to go through the front desk!! A package that was sent to me from Maryland was kept at the front desk and repeated enquires about the arrival of the package from one of the Best Western Hotels in Maryland where I had stayed earlier was met with a standard response that no mail was received on my name.

The staff was unhelpful, uncooperative, rude and some of them were probably not fit to be in a hospitality business. I have communicated with customer care of Best Western who are normally very prompt and responsive to address this issue.

Reached around 4pm, check in took 5 minutes. The room was nice and clean, but really really small. You have to set your expectations right. Since we were there for only a day, we did not care that much about the size. The bathroom was really small too with a small tub for shower. The AC was a little noisy and the room had some street noise too, but nothing out of the ordinary for Times square hotels. The bed was a comfy but small (again the room was tiny) I am attaching pictures of the room too. I believe it was about 100 sqft. The hotel is so close to times square. Only a block from the action. We requested a late checkout the next day and out check-out time was extended till 1 PM. Again great staff we checked out at 1 PM, went to the busy lobby and wanted to keep our luggage at Concierge and had no problem with that. It was just one dollar per bag, which is the cheapest i have ever seen in NYC. We wanted to see a Broadway show and right opposite the hotel is one of the theaters.

I have already recommended this hotel to my other sister and my friends who are planning to take a trip to New York. This location means that you will be in the centre of everything. We literally just had to cross the street under the Crowne Plaza car park to go see Chicago (the broadway show). Public transport and taxis and realily available. Here you will be close to broadway, restauants, all the amazing shops, souvenier shops and everything that a tourist desires from a destination. The houskeeping staff were great. The maintainance guy helped us sort out our European adapters. The staff at reception were lovely.We chose a smoking room because we are both smokers. But smoking and non smoking options are both available.

The Hotel is in a good central location, but the area is very noisey. There is a fire sattion on one corner and it seems the garbage trucks collect all night long. A higher floor may be better, but found it very difficult to sleep. The room we had was a suite and not really large for a suite but it was clean and bed bug FREE. The hall on our floor was always very cluttered with garbage bags, vacuum cleaner, laundry carts etc. I was cold when we came back from an afternoon of sight seeing, tried to get the heat to work and it wouldn't. When I mentioned it to the front desk people they informed me that the heat only comes on if the temperature falls below 40 degrees. To me that is getting pretty cold, I like my heat to click in if it falls below 60 degrees. Wanted to print our boarding passes, was told to go to a place in the basement, it costs $5 for 20 minutes and the computers are so slow, you will be lucky if you can get it done in 20 minutes, the printer wouldn't work and the letters are pretty well all off the key board, so unless you are a typist and know where all the letters are on the keyboard, good luck. I asked for help 3 times, because the printer wouldn't work, the first 2 people told me to go back up stairs, the third said someone will be here in a few minutes, well I only have 20 minutes before I need to put in another $5. No one ever showed up, my time ran out and I wasn't about to put anymore money in the thing. When I went upsairs to find out where the guy was that was going to fix the printer, they finally agreed to let me print from the front desk, but those keyboards also had most of the letters missing.

The manager and the people at the desk (William, Suny, and Tricia) were kind and helpful and with that they made up for what I tell in the \" the ugly\" part written below. Breakfast at the hotel is good and both restaurants associated to the hotel are fine and with good prices, specially Aoki. The room was very clean. For people wanting to be close to Times Sq. and the Theater District, the hotel's location is perfect. I don't like Times Square, at all. I'd have picked a hotel far from there but my client chose the hotel for me. The bad: The decor is tacky, to say the least. A lamp/bust of George Washington? Come on! Pictures of Jackie O and JFK? The room was on the small side, but it seems that most hotel rooms in NYC are like that.The AC's controls didn't work, same for most of the functions of the TV remote. The wi-fi is so crappy that they shouldn't dare to advertise that they have wi-fi. When it works, the speed is what you got with dial-up connections ten years ago. The hotel should make a serious investment in increasing bandwidth. I could look the other way in regard to the tacky decor, but not to the lousy internet connection. The ugly: I have to take a pill for the proper functioning of my thyroid gland every morning, so I brought with me the amount of pills needed for the whole of my stay in the U.S. The first morning I took one pill and left the rest on the bathroom shelf. The next morning, I noticed that they were gone. Yes, GONE! Someone had stolen the pills from my room. The hotel manager assured me that the housekeeper had been with them for twenty years, and that it was pretty impossible that she had any involvement in the \" misplacement\" of the pills. Anyway, anyone familiar with how things work in the U.S knows that it is impossible to get prescription drugs without a prescription filled out by a doctor with a license to practice for the state you are buying the drug in. It seems that because of that, there's a huge black market for drugs. I couldn't take the pill for over a week. In the end, the hotel manager found a pharmacy chain that provides a walk-in doctor service where I could get a prescription, but for that I had to ask my personal doctor to fill out a prescription, scan it, and then send it to me, and the appointment cost me over USD 100, plus the cost of the drug. I have to say, the manager was very helpful and I ended up having breakfast six times at the hotel for free ($100 worth). So, beware, keep your prescription drugs in the safe box at all times. That applies not just for the President Hotel, but for all hotels in the U.S.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Wa", "Title": "\u201cBell Man went above and beyond\u201d", "Author": "CherrySlurpees", "ReviewID": "UR99145296", "Content": "We stayed here for just one night on our return from Europe (our flight from Ireland arrived too late for us to catch a flight to the west coast-ish).

On arrival we checked in very easily and quickly and went to our room to get showered and get out and experience NY, just a note but we carried our own bags through the main door and to our room without the offer of any assistance which was fine but I was a little surprised. On our way to the room the corridors just felt small and a little claustrophobic and to be honest they were a little shabby at best, the staff were cleaning and the cleaning trolleys and bags probably added to this but for the duration of our stay there were cleaning bags and supplies lying around at all times and it didn't look good. We got to the room and were immediately disappointed with the size and cleanliness and it was freezing cold. We turned up the air con and had showers but the room was still freezing and having checked the windows found one of them broken and the blinds and shutters in poor condition, we decided that we were going to ask to be moved and to be fair they moved us without any trouble even taking into account we had showered and our first rrom would need to be done up again. Our new room was as small as the first but we decided to make do and that's what we did but its not something you should have to do. The bathroom was tiny, I could put my left hand on one wall and my right hand on the other while trying to stand in the middle of it!, in order to open the door I needed to step back and have the toilet between my legs so the door would open and I could get out. The shower was good and there was no problem with the hot water( the pipes were extremely loud even when we weren't using them). The bed was very small too and the covers on the bed not great, it was comfortable though. The view from both of the rooms we were in was awful but that wasn't too big a concern. On previous visits to NY we have stayed in The Westin and The Sheraton Towers and while I accept that we paid more for both of these hotels they were much much nicer hotels and the rooms were far superior. A proper bar in the hotel would have been nice too. On the website there are two images for the Primary Lounge which makes it look really nice but the truth is the first image with 4 seats at the counter is all there is too it, that's the size of the bar and it is located beside the check in desk and right beside the main enterance. Its not really a lounge its more a counter beside the check in desk?!?. We didn't have any food at the hotel and there was no room service available. Everyone says you don't spend time in your room when in NY and that's very true but I think I would prefer a little more comfort. As I get to the end of my review the next question is would I recommend the hotel and honestly I'm not sure. Its location is great, the customer service was very good but we were disappointed on arrival with the rooms and the general cleanliness. I guess I would recommend it but only for its location and I would warn about the roomsize.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat if you're looking for location!\u201d", "Author": "ColmHalpin", "ReviewID": "UR91616359", "Content": "As you'd expect with a New York Hotel, the room was tiny but that's a given in New York these days.

My gf lives in NYC, and initially our plan was for me to stay w/her in her apt. A last minute change in plans necessitated that we book a hotel room, and she picked out the Best Western President Hotel at Times Square. She booked us a room using her IPhone as we walked the few blocks from the bus stop (where she met me) towards Times Square. Upon arrival at the Best Western (which is located only minutes away from the concert venue) we were notified that our reservation hadn't processed yet. (A third party website was used for booking, and only minutes had passed since the transaction had completed.) The clerk, whose name escapes me at the moment, was made aware of the fact that we were pressed for time, and he then took action. He told us that not only was he going to re-book us in ASAP, but he was bumping us up to the Penthouse! My gf and I were elated at this service, to say the least. That action alone would make for a five star review. However, I must mention the room itself. Room #1601 has a 1950-60s luxury feel, fully restored w/ a presidential theme. The door opens into the sizable main living space. The suite has 2 separate, sizable balconies- one off the master bedroom, the other located off the living room. (Both have enough room for at least a dozen people to hang out on, and give gorgeous views of the surrounding buildings.) There is also a bathroom located off of the main living room space. The bedroom (also w/a balcony) is moderately sized. The master bathroom is entirely marble, has a screen-less double shower, large flat screen TV, jacuzzi, etc. One of the largest master bathrooms I've ever seen. Luxurious. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in or near Times Square. The prices are competitive, considering the location.

Luckily, we could switch rooms, but the front desk never apologized or anything! When we got settled into our new room, we began to shower and get dressed. The one blow dryer we used kept blowing the fuse. The maintenance man yelled at us and told us we could not use our blow dryer again.

It was a great discovery--wonderful location, attentive staff, great management, clean, efficient, and interesting guests! The entire hotel (lobby, rooms, restaurants) have been remodeled. It is clean and well functioning. I met people in the hotel lobby which only increased my enjoyment of being in New York. The two new Asian restaurants flanking both sides of the hotel are a great treat and offer discounts to hotel guests. I enjoyed having the breakfast buffet at the hotel each morning, too. The concierge was cheerful and friendly. She assisted me to get around the city and its suburbs as well as provided me with great advice about where to go and what to do. As you may know, it is centrally located close to the theater district and restaurants. Taxis are plentiful and there is no better place to get on a subway in NY than where the hotel is located at W48th and Broadway.

The hotel reception area is fantastic- a very positive impression on entering the hotel. I was very impressed, especially since last year when under rennovation [which was not mentioned at time of booking] it was chaos and very unattractive. The hotel floors now have an expensive boutique look about them and my room was plain but bright, clean and functional with a balcony [albeit lacking in space to put clothes]. The bathroom was also just ok. The bath/tiles need to be addressed- the grout was grimey. The toilet seat was broken. Had it not been for the dirty tiles, i would have rated accom as excellent. The location is excellent for Times Sq and Broadway as you are about 100 metres from Times Sq which is hectic. You are also a block away from the starting location of one of the city bus tours. My BIG negative was the reception staff. The house keeping and most of the door staff were very nice and friendly but the front desk staff were rude and snooty. There were either several of them standing around when people needed served and they were 'looking' too busy or there was only 1 person on and a queue of 4/5 people waiting to be served. While checking out I had to wait for at least 10-15 mins whilst one of thefemale staff was very rude to the guest in front of me. She obviously could not understand what the guest was asking but she was very abrupt and obviously lacks in any customer service principles when handling a customer. Had she spoken to me in the same manner, I would have escalated the incident into a complaint- I was not impressed by the attitude. Overall, the hotel is excellent value for money.

My husband doesn't believe this and calls them again 5 minutes later, .... miraculously there is a microwave downstairs where breakfast is served, but they will have to do it for us. - I head on downstairs with the leftovers and lo and behold you can use the microwave its right there. Of course it was a dirty microwave with no turntable even though it needed one. - There is parking across the street for about $36 a day, anywhere cheaper? oh we have a deal with the other one about a block from here for $30 a day. - I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because of poor service and the blatant lack of cleanliness, the price notwithstanding.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "mdmilburne", "ReviewID": "UR73232311", "Content": "Great location in Time Square.

On entering it smelled musty and old, but to be honest I was so exhausted from the 9 hour flight and still had a presentation to prepare, so I just had a shower and climbed into bed with my laptop. Wifi worked - thank goodness. With a warm day just gone, the ventilator was freezing cold and on calling reception a maintenance man kindly came to my room and showed me where the buttons were to reduce the chill. Only one cup of coffee in the coffee percolator, and the head of the front desk is as tough as they come. There was no breakfast included in our room which again was part of the request. Early that morning, as I left for my meetings, I put the sign on the door to ask them to clean it, hoping it would take away the smell - but on returning late that evening, the smell remained. I had locked my door key in the room and had to request another from the reception. It failed to work after he programmed it and I had to travel down the 14 floors to ask him to do it all over again. The night before when I arrived, I had heard a guest complaining of the same thing. Wifi worked but they were unable to offer any additional business services. Their business centre equated to sticking 5 dollars in a machine to secure a print job. Not ideal for the delivery of an important presentation. However, a great location as I was very close to all my business clients and very close to Times Square. Great recommendation for sushi around the corner at Bluefin from the front desk.

I had been in contact with the staff there before arrival who were incredibly helpful and reassuring. On arrival, check in was one of the most straightforward I've had taking only moments. The reception staff were all pleasant and welcoming. I didn't spend much time in the hotel itself, but it's a lovely location for a pre dinner glass of wine, or a little night-cap before bed. The room was small but perfectly formed. As it was just me, I only requested a single room and this was perfect, had everything. It was beautifully decorated, with soft lighting, flat screen tv, ipod dock, clean bathroom with a powerful shower. But the bed. The bed was the cherry on top. It was the perfect level of softness - the perfect cosy respite on a weekend escape. The location of the hotel is great if you want o explore - just off of Times Square it holds the balance of location and calm (the noise didn't drift over), and you're seconds from some of the biggest shows on Broadway. Couple of blocks' walk south brings you to Macy's, Penn Station (from where I arrived) and a host of other stores. Equally you can stroll up either Broadway or 7th Avenue up to Central Park to wander around. 5th Avenue with Saks, Bloomingdale's and the shops of 57th street are all an easy walk away, as are the Rockefeller Centre, Radio City, Empire State, MoMA. If, like me, it's your first visit, then there are a range of buses (public and private) to explore the city in all directions. Everything is within your reach here. After a late night up in Yorkville (upper east side) it was only $8 to get a cab back to your door. And for when you're leaving, the reception staff will get you a cab or give you any advice in terms or directions and timings for your flight and airport. All questions answered!

It's right next door to a fantastic bar, Hurley's, and on the same street as two Broadway theatre's, where we stumbled upon an autograph signing with Kelsey Grammer at the end of a show. The area felt very safe and there's plenty of bars, restaurants and shops nearby and away from Time Sq, if you want to head in the opposite direction to the crowds. The hotel is contemporary styled for a Best Western and the lobby interior has a cool designer's touch to it. Unfortunately, the staff at reception didn't always match the bright and friendly feel of the decor. We arrived to another guest complaining (unecessarily so) about the room he'd been allocated and whilst the receptionist was firm but respectable to him, we felt we bore the brunt of her anoyance as the next guests in line to check in, her frustration was obvious and she was a bit rude, although check in was quick (probably so she could go punch a wall or something). There were also two receptionists checking people in originally but the second must have been clocking off her shift as she did that frustrating thing where you're wating to be served but she just shuffled paper before wandering off, leaving a line of guests waiting to check in. This may have been an isolated welcome though, and in no way reflects the attitude of all of the staff. We forgot our room safe code late at night and the male receptionist was really helpful and sorted us out extremely quickly. The bell boy service was also excellent. There is breakfast served in the lobby each morning and a restaurant attached for lunch and dinner but we didn't use either service, there was too much choice elsewhere. There is a small lobby bar open in the evening but the prices are pretty steep....three bottles of beer and a JD & coke came to $35. The room we stayed in (1329) was small, the bed pretty cramped for American & UK standards and the bathroom was tiny but it was all very clean and room service came daily. We had a 32\" wall mounted LCD TV, with lots of channels and the room had an iron/ironing board. I think there should have been tea & coffe making facilities, as friends of ours had this in their room but ours was without. We got woken during the night once by an almighty row going on next door with some other guests, which lasted some time and the room was shaking with the noise of foul language and running about the floor. Although this was annoying it didn't reflect the normal standard of guests and I don't want to give the impression that this is a hotel with a problem crowd, as we didn't see any other examples of bad behaviour. Any other noise was minimal, apart from the odd siren and car horn, which was surprising seeing as we were so close to the hustle and bustle of Times Sq. Our room was also next to a lift and we didn't hear anything in the way of mechanical or people noise. The air conditioner is window mounted and a bit blowy but hardly a sleep-breaker.

I found the hotel through trip advisor and the price seemed reasonable enough. Firstly, the hotel is remarkably close to Penn Station. So if you\u2019re arriving by train it\u2019s only a 10 minute walk to the hotel- Very convenient. Secondly, the hotel is only a block or two away from Times Square and the theatre district. My girlfriend and I were seeing a show and the location was perfect for us. The show began at 8; we left the hotel at 7:15 and arrived with plenty of time to spare. The best thing about this hotel by far is its location. It seems to be right smack dab in the center of midtown Manhattan. But there is a caveat- it\u2019s an incredibly busy area. I have stayed in New York a bunch of times but usually in the Upper-West Side, a much quieter, neighborhood type of area, but I must say the location was a refreshing change especially since our main objective was to see a show. Also, the location is perfect for getting a drink at basically any time of the night. Restaurants surround the hotel, both to the left and right, and one feels quite as ease leaving at midnight to get a drink and expect to return home safely. There\u2019s something about the sheer number of people around that leaves you believing nothing will happen because you know no one is going to lurch out from behind some bush. As for the hotel- the entrance is beautiful. The d\u00e9cor is a great example of modernity. The front desk clerks who I dealt with were very nice and helpful. Checking into my room was quick and simple. The hotel only has two elevators and they seem to be extremely slow. Again, not a big deal but certainly a little annoying. The room we stayed in was extremely small. I mean open the door and the bed was right there. I wish I would have known more about the size of the room because I definitely wanted to upgrade. That being said, we were only going to be there for one night so not really a big deal. Now, the d\u00e9cor in the room was as crazy as anything I ever saw. The ceiling was purple and there was a picture of JFK and Jackie O on the wall. But you know what? I kind of liked it. It was different, unique, unlike anything I experienced before. As my girlfriend said, \u201cwe will never forget what this room looks like.\u201d Is it worth staying here? I think so. It really depends on the length of your trip. We were there for one night and even still I knew that we wouldn\u2019t be in the hotel for that long. It was perfectly adequate for what we required. That being said, I cannot fully say yes or no in regards to whether or not this hotel is a good fit for a lengthier trip because our room was so small and I didn\u2019t get a chance to see anything bigger. But as I mentioned before, if anything, staying here might be worth it because of the location alone. So close to everything touristy- and I mean that in a good way. The iron didn\u2019t work but then again the people at the front desk seemed nice enough that if I would have complained they probably would have replaced it. Again, it\u2019s worth staying here if you\u2019re in town for a few days and you don\u2019t plan on spending your vacation in a hotel- but then again, why would you?", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in NY?

This was a surprise for my husband's 30th birthday, so wanted something nice. The hotel had been newly refurbished, and when I booked it in Sept '09 I requested that we got 2 new rooms (we went with another couple). This was noted on our booking. Upon arriving at the hotel we were upgraded to the next size room. Although it was stil just a room with a bed and chair there was a bit more room to walk about. When you stay in NY you don't expect anything other than a bed and wash facilities. We had a 37\" flat screen tv, an ipod dock alarm clock and a chair&footstool. This was plenty. We didn't spend much time in the room as we tried to make the most of our time in NY. We were in room 306. We had to run the hot water for 5-10mins every morning before got hot water, but that wasn't really that annoying. Gave you time to wake up. The bath didn't drain so well though which was a wee bit annoying. Our friends in 304 had hot water, but bath didn't drain that well either. When my husband looked at the hotel directory, it said they used the fitness suite across the road for $20 a day. Their website said they had their own. We should have checked this out sooner. On the 2nd last day we found that the glass elevator at the front of the hotel went down to basement where they had their internet and fitness facilities. My husband and my friend's husband would have used this in the mornings had they known. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on that, but on looks, the food looked nice. We had to ask for extra pillows and towels and they were brought to the room pretty promptly. Only thing I would say would be that having a kettle and a fridge in the room would be beneficial as not everyone likes coffee, and somewhere to keep drinks cool be great. The hotel had a central location being 1 avenue away from Times Square. Yet once in the hotel you couldn't hear a thing. It was perfect. If I wanted to go back to NY and stay centrally then I would definitely stay here and definitely recommend it to anyone else going. Just note by the way that it is much better to arrange the shuttle from hotel to airport rather than taxi and train it to airport. Was $18 per person to Newark Airport.

Plus, the beds were a dream, everyone in our group said we slept better than we ever do at home.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ledyard, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Beds, Cool Lobby Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "BLUEFLOWERS2005", "ReviewID": "UR54425933", "Content": "Booked last minute during a busy time and had a great experience, Drove into manahttan ...the hotel was easy to find on the edge of Times Square. The bellman picked up my bags as I parked the car. Check in was quick and they accomodated the early check-in which made my life easier. The room was average size. The hotel looks fairly new. The queen bed was really nice and I slept like a baby. I stayed a few days. Hotel staff very nice. The ticket office for disocunted Broadway Shows at TKTS was around the corner and got 50% off two plays for me and my wife. Lots of shopping in the area . Oh,.. The lobby bar is pretty funky at night had a nice time, I will return The hotel was nicely priced for the quality received and found it to be a very good value.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Great value\u201d", "Author": "dare2burbest", "ReviewID": "UR54306535", "Content": "I traveled from Australia to USA by myself over the Christmas New Year period 2009/10.

My room was very comfortable and appeared to be newly refurbished. The computers and printers in the business centre were not working and the rooms could have done with a full length mirrow. All and all i was very pleased with this hotel and would definately stay again. However i don't feel it is family friendly.

We enjoyed the \"presidents\" theme of the decor (JFK and Jackie art on the wall, George Washington bust lamp), and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom not quite as nice (not much surface area to put stuff, weak water pressure for shower), but not horrible. Some small details amiss: temp knob on heater/AC was broken, sink faucets were labeled \"cold\" and \"cold\", etc.) Couldn't get a wi-fi connection in the room; only a minor annoyance on this trip, but it would've been a real problem if I needed to get any work done. Lobby small, but attractive (and wi-fi worked there). Desk staff was friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the $15 breakfast buffet in the lobby.

Tried to talk to the manager - 4 times - 2 not here - 2 too busy to see me. The building has been partly reno'd, but not the old plumbing. This allows the cold water pressure to dominate the hot, even several rooms away, and it cannot be adjusted properly. I'm a Western Elite points member, with a lot of travel. And they gave me a room they knew was uninhabitable, then switched me to one they knew had no hot water. This hotel does not deserve to wear the brand.
