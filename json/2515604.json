This trip I had planned to treat myself and stay at the Wynn. My friends had free rooms at th Fitzgeralds and Four Queens so I decided that it would be more convenient for us if I stayed downtown also. I had not stayed at the Nugget for at least 4 0r 5 years so I was not sure how it had changed. I was pleasantly surprised. I had a room on the 16th floor in the gold tower. It was very clean and had a view of the pool. My first night I went up to get ready for dinner at VIC AND ANTHONY'S(which is one of my favorites)and my key would not work. I went back down to the VIP lounge and by the time I was back up a man by the name of Billy appeared and cleaned the lock. He was so courteous and prompt. On Thursday morning I went to get help printing a boarding pass for Friday. They not only printed it out,but waived the fee. It was'nt about the money since I had just spent 400.00 at Vic and Anthony's on Tuesday night,it was about the service.

Can't stand the strip -- love downtown! My room in the Rush Tower was so nice and comfy. I asked for a high floor not on street side so it was very quiet. The data port is a little difficult to find but it's in the front of the area where the 2.50 per cup of Keurig coffee pods are. There's a Starbucks downstairs right at the street area, so that's nice. Grottos is a great restaurant. Ask for Jose if you sit at the bar (plus, I think the service is much better as people were coming to the bar to get drinks from their neglected tables). They have the best Margherita pizza EVER! They also have happy hour 2 to 6 weekdays and you get a deal on pizzas, wine and beer. So even though the wine is already reasonably priced and for a nice brand (Columbia Crest), you get a big glass for five bucks! That won't happen on the strip, believe me! Forget the buffet except for maybe b'fast. I called the kitchen to see if they had nice salad greens on the salad bar and the guy told me, \"Yeah, they're mixed greens.\" I specifically made sure it wasn't iceburg lettuce. He replied, \"No, it's not iceburg.\" So as I was craving a nice salad bar I ventured down there for the great sounding mixed greens. It was iceburg lettuce! I could have asked for my money back, but there was some spinach citrus salad, but there was not much selection to put on your salad at the salad bar. Very lame salad bar for a buffet, but it was okay. Since it was late, they brought out the dinner prime rib and it was not very good. I would stick with the Grotto. I had the half a chix there with potatoes and spinach for 21 bucks. Plus, the spinach salad was awesome! you can get a half sald that's not listed on the menu. The pool is very crowded and I went to the gym instead. Bring your headphones if you want to watch TV while you workout. The ABC store right out the front entrance to the left is very reasonably priced. Don't bother walking down to Walgreens to save a few cents -- not worth it. Also, Walgreens does not sell wine or beer or anything. I would also suggest you not bring your real good shoes for walking downtown. the streets are really dirty. My rubber flip-flops were very black on the bottom and I had to scrub them. The Carson Street Cafe also has an issue with what is a mixed green. I went there to order the Chinese Chix salad and the menu said \"mixed greens.\" When it came out, it was nothing but iceburg lettuce, so I refused it. Seems like the whole place doesn't know the difference between mixed greens and iceburg lettuce! I will definitely stay here again. I have stayed here many times and we are never disappointed. The service was good and the room was very clean and comfortable and quiet. Also, don't take Bell Trans from the airport to downtown. They were very inefficient and it took 50 minutes to get me to my room. The driver was criss-crossing the strip everywhere!

Overall the hotel is actually pretty nice. Its older, thats for sure, but depending on the tower you stay in (gold tower for us) the rooms are remodeled, clean and well kept for. The pools on site are very nice, certainly the shark tank is a unique site to see! The restaurants in the hotel are very good (we ate at The Grotto as well as Vic & Anthony's). Really, for the price of the hotel it is worth your time. Our biggest concern was around customer service. From the moment we arrived it was clear that this hotel is understaffed at their front counter. We waited a long time in line (and it was early, around 11am) to checkin and every time we passed the front counter during our stay, there was a very long line of customers (even at 3am!). Also, we had an issue with our in-room safe one evening and it is here that the customer service really seemed to fall apart. It was late in the evening, we were needing to get into our safe for something that we needed before we went out for the night. The safe suddenly (after 2 days of use) displayed an error and would not open. We called the front desk, who said they would send maintanence up right away, and this is where the waiting began. We waited almost 45 minutes before going down to the lobby andf waiting in the aforementioned line to speak to the employee live. At that time, she said she would call maintanence again. Back to our room and we waited again. This time almost an hour passed. We called the desk once again who supposedly contacted maintenance again. By the time anyone arrived to help us, almost 2.5 hours had passed. They got to our room and told us that the first call came into them only a short time before they arrived. All of this means that either the front desk staff of the maintenance staff was lying to us. But no matter what, we missed all of our plans that evening. It was incredibly frustrating and no apologies were offered for any of it. A few tips to make your stay at the Golden Nugget More pleasant: * The shark tank swimming pool is very very cool. But dont expect to be able to enjoy it on a weekend AT ALL! Word has clearly spread about this pool and because of the shark tank in the middle, it is quite small. You will have a hard time finding any room to enjoy the pool, let alone find a seat around it. *The adults only pool is VERY small. Its a nice looking area, but the photos online were deceptive about its size. Also, you have to PAY just to use this area. They force you to rent a chair or cabana, *When checking out you will encounter yet another long line of people. We were offered a speedier approach by a manager, provided we did not need a receipt. I wouldnt choose this option. When we got home and saw our credit card charge, we learned that they had overcharged us. This was a bigger issue than it needed to be and could have been corrected had we waited in that line. * Pretty much all of their restaurants are busy, so reservations are handy. Especially if you are headed for Vic & Anthony's, this place has a long wait most nights. They all work with the website 'Open Table' to allow reservations.

Downtown generally feels a lot more like classic Vegas - cheap food, seedy bars, panhandlers and hawkers that put the timeshare people to shame, and the sort of party atmosphere you'd normally only find in a nightclub. Don't expect to get to sleep any time before midnight; between the Fremont Street Experience, the live bands that are always playing, and the masses of people gathered until the wee hours of the morning, there's going to be way too much light and sound going on to catch any shut-eye. So consider whether or not that's the sort of atmosphere you'd enjoy before you book a hotel downtown. With that being said, the Golden Nugget is by far the nicest property on Fremont Street. There are four towers in this hotel: Carson Tower (the oldest and the cheapest), Gold Tower (old, but nicer than the Carson), Spa Tower (the largest and most expensive), and Rush Tower (the newest). I stayed in the Gold Tower, while a good friend stayed in a Rush Tower suite. The room itself was appointed fairly nicely, and included a comfortable sofa, a lounge chair, and the noisiest, most obnoxious air conditioner I've ever seen. I was forced to turn it off so I could sleep, which wound up making the room uncomfortably hot. And this was in mid-April - I can't even imagine how bad it would be when July comes around! Luckily the air conditioner was the only source of unbearable noise, and my only real complaint with the hotel. The casino is a little tricky to navigate, but it has an excellent variety of games with friendly, competent dealers and reasonably low minimums. There's a good selection of restaurants to pick from, and the prices are usually cheaper than what you'll find on the Strip. Of particular note is the Chart House, a seafood restaurant with a view of the Nugget's famous aquarium, and the Grotto, a classy Italian restaurant with some unique dishes. If you're planning to stay on Fremont street, the Golden Nugget is really your best bet. They offer the nicest rooms, the nicest casino, and the nicest restaurants you'll ever find downtown.

But we simply could not let this one go. We are avid travelers and always go into any vacation with the attitude of \"we are going to have a relaxing fun time\". Unfortunately after 20 years of travelling the world we can honestly say the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas was the worst hotel experience ever. We can start off at check in, but where? After being passed by twice by hotel porters while dragging our luggage we were appalled that neither one even had the decency to say good afternoon nor welcome let alone ask if we needed any help, FAIL! We proceeded to drag our luggage through the casino to try and find the front desk, two of which were closed, what a joke, FAIL! When we finally asked a cleaning lady where a front desk that was open she finally pointed us in the direction we needed to go. Front desk - No good afternoon, no welcome just \"you are checking in, I need to see a driver\u2019s license and credit card\" we did manage to get a please out of her, good grief miserable and rude, FAIL! She gave us our keys and I was more than happy to walk away. The Room - holy crip the Carson tower is a complete sxxx hole. The halls and non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarettes, and I mean bad, carpet stains, old worn out bedding and an eye level view of the top of the parking garage through a small dirty window. OK enough was enough, FAIL! Contacted the front desk and said we need to be moved, so they said they could move us to the rush tower, for a ridiculous fee of course. But the hotel was already paid for so I did not have much of a choice but to upgrade. Rush tower rooms were nice, clean, updated and a great view of Fremont, so we thought... If you are in the rush tower on the Fremont side and would like to go to sleep before 2am good luck. It was louder in our room than down on the street itself, acoustics I guess... Warn people before sticking them in these rooms, holy crip some customer service here... We sucked it up and pressed on, actually wearing earplugs any night we went to bed before the craziness was over at 2am. Ear plugs on vacation, now that\u2019s a first for me... Maids - they cleaned the room just fine, except every day they would not leave new coffee cups, when we asked they said there is a special person that handles coffee and if we don't buy their keurig cups (we bought our own k-cups at a convenience store) they would not replace the paper coffee cups for us, are you kidding me!!! OK so the staff and hotel rules at this point are trying my patience. The pool, what an awesome concept, primary reason we picked the GN and so disappointed. Great idea but you simply cannot pack 750 people into such a small space without making everyone feel invaded. You couldn't walk in the place let alone relax and grab some rays. Nothing like laying out reading a book sitting only 6 inches from some stranger next to you, I think a previous airline designer must of helped with the design of the tank, I can hear it now \"I think we can squeeze in at least 200 more chairs\"... What a great concept ruined!!! FAIL! The adult pool what a JOKE, before 5pm it's $20 to simply enter??? There wasn't a sole there all week. The adults would all crowd up on the third floor deck in the small 18 and over area where we could be adults and not worry about kids running all over and not pay $20 to do it. Give me a break $20 to sit in the adult area, does GN really need that extra $500 a day for such a huge inconvenience for its guests, stop the nickel and diming. Don't worry GN you'll get your money back from me at the tables later on but dam!! Bartenders - horrible, rude!!! Every single one we met burnt out and rude! Security - complete A holes, sit back and be glorified mall cops and leave the paying guests alone. So who was nice, pool waitresses Excellent!!! Fun, polite and busted their axxes to make the guests feel welcome and catered to. And that\u2019s about it! Casino - OK at best, as long as you enjoy smoke, smoke and more smoke... how about some dam ventilation in this place... OK so I think you get the picture about the GN.

This year we decided to stay downtown, and picked the Golden Nugget. We booked with Southwest vacations. We stayed in the Rush tower in a king room. Checkin was smooth and courteous. The room was cosmetically pleasing but the functionality was lacking. For example there is a beautiful dark wood built in cabinet on the wall opposite the wall, but it has no outlets ! Not even one outlet for their own coffeemaker ! There was room for multiple outlets and charging stations, but none to be had! On the nightstand there was a single docking station, for the other phone.....into the bathroom (with the coffee maker LOL) and i crawled around on the floor to use an outlet for my iPad. The linens were great, and loved the gilcrest and soames toiletries. It was a nice touch to have robes in the closet. I was initially disappointed with our view since it overlooked the huge HVAC turbines on the roof, but after dark the little slice of Freemont street we could see made up for it. The pool and slide were very fun. Two draw backs were lack of poolside food and beverage service (we were asked once in 4 days). Also only half of the pool deck is in full sun at a time. We had to move at least once each day to stay in the sun. I had one issues with noise on our last night, and on complaint the desk person handled it very professionally and graciously comped our last meal in the buffet. I definitely plan to return TIPS: 1.Pack your own keurig k-cups and to go cups to avoid the hefty charge 2.Bring plenty of $1.00 bills so you can pose with all of the \"characters\" 3.Le Bayou had loose slots and great drink service, they have machines where you can pull the lever and \"cash out\" real coins......lots of fun. 4. We enjoyed the buffet at Main st Station, just a quick walk 5.

Cabanas on the strip are $400-650 while at the nugget they can be had for 175-250 on many occasions. They have the greatest sushi bar, noodle shop, buffet, room service.....I cant say enough good stuff!!! The pool has a slide that goes right through a shark tank!! Outside of the nugget, theres a light show with live bands playing nightly and you can easily walk to another hotel if you choose! You wont need a car at all!! You can walk to 10 different hotels with kiosks all over and stores to purchase drinks etc. Its the best!! Im a vegas veteran and have been to 10 hotels on the strip but always find my way back to the nugget.

The room itself was clean and fairly newly decorated. As for the hotel facilities, the pool is free to hotel guests. It's a pretty unique pool, with the shark tank in the middle of it, but the water was a bit chilled for April, which was disappointing - it was too cold to stay in. It was nice that they had loungers up the stairs on the balcony where no children were allowed - we spent an hour or two in relative calm up there. There is also a private pool and jacuzzi facility, but this costs money to get in to. The pool can get fairly busy, even on a week day in April, so if you are going in peak season, it would be advisable to turn up when it opens to grab a lounger. The most frustrating thing about the hotel is that they are constantly trying to sell you stuff. There was a bottle of water in the room that cost $7; they advertised the 'custom made' mattress as buyable; you could buy your dressing gown for $50; and room service was extortionate. This got a bit annoying after a while - when we were offered a free gift in the lobby after arriving we stopped to hear about it - but of course they were really trying to sell us a holiday on another of their resorts. I was also frustrated that, unlike most hotels in the US, there was no fridge in the room - I can only have soya free milk, which needs refrigerating, but had to throw it away in the end because there was no way of keeping it cool. This is obviously so that you spend money at the hotel's restaurants/bars rather than storing your own food and drink. That said, the rooms are very cheap and the hotel does feel rather luxurious. They're clearly trying to make up for the cheap room by getting you to spend money at the overpriced bars and restaurants and at the casino.

The result: I was able to get between Caesar's and the Golden Nugget in 10 minutes! Most of the Casinos have free parking since they can rob you gambling inside. No need to pay for parking! One of the best aspects of the Golden Nugget is it's size. Although I'm fit and enjoy walking, many of the large strip hotels are so huge, (Caesar's, Mandalay Bay) that by the end of the day you feel like you've survived the Bataan Death March.

This was only our second trip to Vegas and first time to stay downtown, and will stay here again. We had an early flight and were able to check in early (10am), so had a chance to nap before hitting the strip later in the day. We stayed in a standard king room in the Rush tower (non smoking). Floor was pretty quiet, room was clean and modern. Found out a mini fridge was extra $, so we skipped it, and had to call a few times to get through to fix the in-room movie/check out service on our TV. Otherwise, pool area was excellent, although a little busy with families there for spring break. But, being parents, it didn't bother us and we spent part of 2 of our 4 days poolside with great weather. Drink prices were a little high at the poolside bar, so you might want to try inside and bring the drink out with you. At check in, we asked if there were any coupons books, and snagged a 2 for 1 deal on the buffet for 2 meals, and discounts for a few other things in house, including a few free cocktails. The Grille next to the Sports Book was also a pretty good place to grab a bite to eat in house. Just a few steps outside to Fremont Street and lots of free entertainment and people watching. Took a shuttle (Ritz) from the airport and back, and the hotel is near the route for the bus system. (Take the Strip-Downtown Express if you want to avoid all the stops on The Deuce). We are not big gamblers, but my wife took a lesson on 3-card poker and the staff member was very friendly and helpful.

Although the coffee in the room was not free, as a matter of fact it was a Keurig system and they wanted $10.00 for 4 pods and two bottles of water in the room were $7,00 each. Needless to say we did not drink any coffee and bought a 6 pack of bottled water for $3.65 at the ABC store a few doors down on Freemont street. The casino takes a bit to figureout your way around but is not as confusing as some of the huge hotels on the strip. The pool is awsome and the loungers in the 18+ area on the 3rd floor is the place to hide away from all the kids. Who brings kids to Vegas anyway?

We have stayed in the basic rooms twice over Freemont Street and once facing the mountains \u2013 mountain facing rooms are quieter. You look on top of Freemont so you do not get any benefit from the screen \u2013 just the noise. This hotel did not have to work out any new hotel issues - first class from day one. CHECK IN \u2013 courteous and friendly staff. Our room has always been ready and Never a problem. RUSH TOWER \u2013 we stay at the rush tower for two reasons \u2013 it is newer (they have central air where the other towers have loud walls air conditioners) and it is closer to entry and exits to outside and pool. If you exit the rusk tower from their main lobby you walk approx. 50 feet to the pool, where from the main hotel you have a long and disjointed walk. ROOMS - All rooms are non-smoking and feature upgraded pillow-top mattresses, feather down comforters, 42\" plasma televisions, and contemporary decor. You can purchase their bedding and beds from the hotel \u2013 best bed I have ever slept in. The new Rush Tower larger than their other tower rooms. Hallways are H shaped \u2013 allowing for fewer rooms down shorter hallways - you hardly run into other guests. Not once did we encounter any rowdy drunk quests in the halls. They are carpeted and so you do not hear other guests. They do not have wheelchair designated rooms \u2013 however I have been in their non- accessible rooms and they are so large they were perfect ad well. All rooms have been accessible for me. POOLS \u2013 only sat at the regular pool once \u2013 I am not a fan of children so we stay at the Hideout. For $50.00 a day you get a king size day bed / lounger with a small relaxing pool with food and beverage serve. This would cost you over $200 - $500 on the strip!! Outstanding service there. They also have lounger for $25.00 per day or cabanas for $250 as well with LCD TV\u2019s and fridges with lounger outside your door. Wheelchair accessible RESTAURANTS \u2013 On site -Lillie's Asian Cuisine offers a fusion of traditional Cantonese, Szechwan and Pan-Asian flair, plus the excitement of Teppanyaki tables - amazing food and entertainment. - Red Sushi offers traditional Japanese cuisine hand-crafted sushi and sashimi - Rush Lounge \u2013 great drinks with fantastic entertainment \u2013 do not pass this little place by. It used to be the home of Frankie Moreno who is now THE hottest act in Vegas. FREEMONT STREET \u2013 is right outside your door. As many time as we have been to Vegas we now enjoy staying here rather than staying on the strip. You have access to many restaurants \u2013 such as Fitzgerald\u2019s for breakfast for 1.99 and free internet just down the street. CASINO\u2019S - I find the casino\u2019s downtown are cheaper and tend to pay out better. I am not a huge gambler but I love to play blackjack. So I play at Fitzgerald\u2019s and Binon\u2019s for their $1 or $2 tables. I can play for 4 hours for $20.00 and get free drinks.

I have to leave town on business for the next 2 months. I tried to put something together that would be fun for one and all. Vegas! Who doesn't love Vegas? (actually, a bunch of my friends don't. They are all boring). This last Summer we switched up our hotel for our annual trip to Laughlin, NV. We always ended up at the Golden Nugget eating at one of their restaurants. It seemed to be way less \"white-trashy\" than the other joints that we frequented. We couldn't have been happier with the switch. I decided to test my luck and try the Golden Nugget in Vegas. First off, I love downtown. It reminds me of the way that old Vegas used to be when we went there as kids on vacation. The Strip is a bit much for me and has way too many people meandering about. People watching is unparalleled on the Strip, but the masses of humanity are bothersome. We checked in mid-day and the process was super quick and easy. Dude at the front desk was very nice and personable. He had me away from his desk within 2 minutes with room keys. Me and the boys were on our way to the top floor! The room was muy grande. Lots of space to be had. That is good for us as we tend to sprawl a bit. A good start. TV was large and worked fine. As I laid in the bed, I figured out why the room had so much space. Double beds! I haven't stayed in a double bed for I don't know how long. This is the only reason that I did not give the property a 5th star. Golden Nugget, enough with small beds. Upgrade to Queens! Bathroom was very functional. Bathtub. Check. Clean everywhere. Check. No foreign smells or smoke. Check. So far, so good. We headed down to the pool as it is the boys's favorite thing. We were not disappointed. It was rather crowded even though there were 30 MPH winds whipping through the whole place. It was a bit on the chilly side as well. The kids don't seem to notice the cold. We jumped in and figured that we would give the legendary water-slide a try. Water was warm. Good start. I slid down the water-slide and was immediately shocked at how fast I was going. This was no sissy affair. On the first turn you really picked up a head of steam. Like, butterflies in your stomach speed. It was awesome! The gag on the water-slide is that you go through the middle of the Shark Tank. On my first run, I didn't even have time to check it out. I was trying to figure out how to slow it down a bit! Pool was fun. One of the best attributes of the Golden Nugget is it's location. You can walk out any door of the property and be right in the middle of everything that you need. Fremont Street is super happening and way more low brow than what the Strip has to offer. I am low brow. It is good for me. My one hot tip is to go out the doors on the Fremont Street side. Directly across the street (diagonally) is Mermaids. Go in and try the following: chocolate covered banana, fried Oreos, and fried Twinkie. All of them are served for 99 cents. The were all unbelievable and a bargain at twice the price! Also, head down to the Golden Gate and get a $2.99 Shrimp cocktail. It used to be 99 cents, but inflation has caught up with it. Staff was friendly. Room was clean. Parking was free. Location was epic! Pool was great.

We had connecting rooms which was awesome. Only one washcloth and two towels for room. That was weird. Tv channel selectin was horrible. I'm guessing they want you to be downstairs gambling. 13 dollars to rent a movie. Beds are doubles, not queen. 7 dollars for a bottle of water, 10 dollars for coffee packs. No fridge or microwave. 20 dollars to get a crib. They really do nickel and dime you for everything. I thought after reading reviews there would be coupon books with buffet coupons.

I must admit we will probably choose a different hotel in the future as it is too frustrating to myself the tour guide and the client waiting on the bus.

I prepaid the first night at the time of booking (several months in advance). The week before his arrival, I contacted the hotel to pay for the remainder of his stay with my credit card. I made several attempts to fax the image of my credit card to the hotel but they weren't receiving legible copies. I sent one last fax indicating that I would take a scan of my credit card and send it via email the following morning. Since I never heard back from them, I assumed that with my email, they had received all the necessary documentation. Somehow, when my son arrived and without my knowing it, they let him check in for his 4 night stay without a credit card and without having processed my advanced payment. At 3:00 am Eastern time on the last morning of his stay, I got a call that the hotel's night auditor needed to secure payment for his room. In a sleepy stupor, I waited to receive a new Credit Card Authorization form from the hotel via email which I filled out and rescanned along with my driver's license and credit card. The next day, I asked to speak with the Supervisor of Reservations to determine why the hotel had not processed my prepayment and why they had waited until 3:00 am on the morning of my son's last visit to alert me to the situation. They told me they'd look into and get back to me. The following day, I got a call from the Reservations Department explaining that they had in fact received my prepayment but that it had been filed and not processed, so according to their records, they had only the first night prepaid. They went on to assure me that my credit card had gone through fine and that everything was all set. Their focus was making sure I knew the room was paid for as opposed to the ineptitude of their reservations staff. In my opinion, heads should've rolled.

It was pretty cool with it's red wallpaper in the main room and the black and white in the bedrooms. Both bedrooms had deep jetted soaking tubs with an integral shower. While I used the tub, I did not shower in the bath since the main room had a half-bath with a shower only. I have seen some reviews that the doors don't have privacy hangers but we had them on all three doors. The maids waited until I had pulled them off to check and see if we wanted our rooms cleaned.

There were several extra wine glasses in the cabinet next to the fridge that you could pull out. Having read about the $10 coffee pods, we came prepared with our own pods.

Well I did not have to be asked twice as I love Las Vegas and had just been here 5 years ago and wanted to see all the changes that have taken place since the recession etc. After having stayed at the Luxor on The Strip I was not sure how staying in a downtown hotel was going to be. I read a few reviews about the \"Old Las Vegas\" and the older properties and resorts on Fremont Street and some were not very flattering, but my friend decided to go downtown as he was taking his father with him on a early birthday father son trip and his father loved to gamble and had been to the Golden Nugget some time ago. Forget all the negative things one reads about the downtown Las Vegas Area. Yes it is a downtown area so there are all the traffic jams, there are homeless people and all the bad and good things that a downtown major metro area has...BUT the REAL Downtown Las Vegas...not all the places south of the Stratosphere Resort that people think of as Las Vegas...and officially not in the city limits but in a Census Designated Place (CDP) called \"Paradise\" is where all the best things happen. The Golden Nugget is as they say the \"King or Queen\" of resorts on Fremont Street. It is one of the oldest having been around since 1907 and also the largest resort casino downtown with over 2300 hotel rooms. It has consistently for over the last 32 years earned the AAA 4 diamond distinction award and one look inside here and it is no wonder. We stayed in the newly remodeled Rush Tower hotel rooms. Everything is modern and up to date. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. House keeping did a wonderful job everyday making sure we realized we were staying in a 4 diamond resort. The Breakfast Buffet in the restaurant is amazing and ranks up there in size with that of a Golden Corral restaurant buffet, with alot better food and atmosphere. The pool is often said to be one of the best features of this hotel, but I was not able to take advantage of it as I was too busy seeing the sites in the Las Vegas area to stay in the hotel for more than sleeping,eating and gambling in the late night. The only downside to the pool is that (and I may be wrong but I did not see any other option) there is a charge for reserving chairs to sit on. I am sure people who want the resort experience are use to paying this fee perhaps but coming from Florida where there is no charge for parking at the beach or anything else I found this a little pricey, but it is Las Vegas and Water is at a prime level of want and need with the drought southern Nevada has been in for the last 10 years. Over all I loved the location of the hotel. The Fremont Street experience with it nightly video presentation on the worlds largest movie screen is amazing as is the people watching along Fremont street with all the acrobats and jugglers and others who are trying to make a living or make a break into the world of show business and think that doing well or being seen on Fremont street may be the big break they need. For those interested in the program on the history channel called \"Pawn Stars\"...the Gold and Silver Pawn shop at 713 South Las Vegas Boulevard is just a short 20 minute walk about 8 blocks away from here. Another great thing about the location of this on Fremont street is that within what would be the confines of one of the HUGE casinos on the strip you have over 8 casinos all along Fremont street and each one has its own little unique niche as to what games they offer, the chances of winning and what type of clientele they attract. It was awesome here because at the Corner of Fremont street and Las Vegas Blvd where the Golden Nugget is there are also 3 other resorts...the 4 Queens, Binions, and The Fremont Casino. No where else in Las Vegas can one go to 4 casinos in so close proximity to one another. This trip really sealed the deal for me in future trips here. I will go to Las Vegas hopefully many many more times but I think I will always decide to stay at the Golden Nugget and just go on side trips to see the new resorts for fun.

Room was in the Gold Tower. Unless you like a long walk, stay in the Gold or Rush Towers, Carson Tower is just too long a walk. the addition of new restaurants adds to the property and they're all very good. Buffet is good, but not like when Steve Wynn owned the place. Room was always made up before noon. Nice tv, bed ws great and I slept well. Minimal noise in hall, een late at tnight when the drunks are all out. Service in restaurants was fine, een bufet. Bartenders are another story, they can walk by you without even acknowledging you. But I've seen this in many casino bars. Gambling is getting tough. Tables are opened only when its decided its absolutely necessary. they want filled tables. So finding a table with only one or two other players is very difficult, even late at night into the early morning. (1:00am to 6:00am) but this is the way it is in all casinos now.

Valet at Rush Tower greeted us, the bell desk grabbed our bags and we did not see them again until we were in our suite. VIP check-in was quick and easy in front of the elegant floor to ceiling aquarium. I had booked a Jr. Corner Suite and the extra bucks were well worth it...very elegant suite with all the goodies and perks, not one but two big screen televisions, nice living room area, gorgeous large bathroom with a deep soaking tub and the bed....oh, the bed. A king size cloud to sleep on...heaven, simply HEAVEN with cool, high thread count linens (yes folks, it matters), six or seven fluffy pillows with various degrees of softness and the entire Rush Tower has this \"spa like\" aroma....not the icky stench of cigarette smoke. Part of my husband's VIP treatment was a line pass I'd purchased for $28 and well worth it....the line was long at the Cafe but we walked right in and were promptly seated. Same at the famous Golden Nugget buffet upstairs. The food was a bit pricey (as is most of Vegas restaurants) but delicious and a nice selection. We discovered Dupar's restaurant in the Golden Gate. Golden Gate Casino is at the end of Freemont on the corner right before you cross the street to Union Plaza....excellent food and very reasonable. Dupars is famous for shrimp cocktails and the best I've ever had...I had two actually. Husband and I enjoyed prime rib dinner with all the fixins' including dessert for $9.99 each and this restaurant is open 24 hours...do not pass on a piece of pie and cup of coffee for a late after gambling treat.

I always stay on the strip. Have been to vegas like 9 times, but this was the 1st time we stayed downtown. We did this because we needed a suite to accommodate 3 people and this was a good location for the race. Room was decent and big. Bed was nice and 2 bathrooms are always a plus. We like to have a separate seating area in the room if we stay more than 1 night. Hotel is the nicest down along the Fremont St Experience and you will pay a little more. BUT when you go out to a casino on a Sat nite and find a $5 roulette or Craps table it's a definite plus. The table games at the Nugget seemed high for me. Also get a Coors Lt on the strip and you'll pay $6 each, downtown they are like $3. The pool was nice as well but get there early to get a seat in the sun. Waterslide was epic, even for a 41yo. Room service was decent, even at 2am. Also ate at Chicago Brewery, it was ok. Got a pizza to-go from Uncle Joes, that was amazing. It's at the end of the experience, across the street. The downtown area is fun for families but staying down there for 3 nights got a little boring. Once you see the light show and all the impersonators, maybe do the zip line, your pretty much set as far as downtown stuff. But again if you can deal with some old school vegas, with lights, cigaretttes, cheap gambling, drinks and food, downtown isn't so bad. A couple of more points: The cab ride to the strip (Venician) was $25. The cab to the airport from Golden Nugget was $35 before tip. You can take the shuttle bus but keep in mind those buses stop at every casino dropping/ picking people up.

We stayed at the new Rush Tower and were very pleased. The room was just like the pictures, the bathroom was spacious and very nice. Everything new and in working order. Walls were not thin, didn't hear doors slamming or people talking---just occasional obnoxious folks in the hallway on their way to/from wherever but that is Vegas. Room darkening shades were the best I've experienced, hands down. It was so dark you couldn't see under the door or even your hand in front of you. We actually kept the bathroom dimmer on low with the doors partially closed to see to get there in the middle of the night. Beds were great, not hard and just right. The air conditioning worked great and we didn't even hear it kick on. Loved the huge leather sectional in the room and big new flatscreen t.v. We were on the 9th floor in the back and never heard Fremont Street. Some people on the elevator said they were on the 7th though and heard morning traffic to service the hotel (trucks beeping as they backed in, garbage truck, etc.) but we didn't hear that. The hotel/casino itself was nice as well, food ok pricing for Vegas. They have two Starbucks in the hotel itself. We went to the impersonator country show which was just \"ok.\" I'm not really into that. Willie Nelson was perfect and hilarious, the rest were a bit weird to watch. We heard they are different every night and they don't pre-announce who it is. The buffet was typical, if you like seafood that might be your speed but we don't so everything else tasted the same. Desert was the best part. Others at the show told us the Rio buffet and even down the street at The Main Street Station was better. There was a McDonalds and Subway in the hotel next door to us which I think was The Plaza that just reopened. We just loved that the Golden Nuggest is so quick/easy to get to the street (Fremont Street, of course) where the activity was. Friday was busy but Saturday was packed and we still loved it. So much to do and see. The street shows were great but not for kids (pole dancing). The staff was all great, we never had any rude people and the valet will help you with directions even if you aren't wanting transportation and you are just walking to get somewhere. There are some homeless folks out at night but they do not bother you and not nearly as many as you see on the strip. Also, no one flicking stripper cards at you on Fremont Street. Any feedback I might offer on the somewhat negative side is that the pool chairs are side-by-side and packed into a very small space. Also, despite Rush Tower being nonsmoking, everything else in the hotel is smoking so it hits you when you get off the elevator. The ceilings are low throughout so that doesn't help. So, if you don't swim or you do smoke, this hotel would be a '5' for you. We would stay there again. We went to the NASCAR race and they had transports directly outside the hotel that left timely with no hassle whatsoever. The Deuce (city bus) picks up a block away at Binions. We found that we were traveling opposite of most since we were going to the strip at night and back to Fremont even later wheras most the Deuce traffic was coming from the strip to Fremont St. Also, don't try walking to the Pawn Stars (gold & silver pawn shop) as its a hike from the hotel. Take the Deuce to Bonneville and walk two blocks, go early or you'll wait for hours to get in. If the buses are packed to get to the strip for whatever reason, check the map and take the WAX route. Tthe loudspeaker recording says its for airport and locals will tell you it doesn't go to the strip but it stops at the Tropicana (again, look at the map), right across the street from MGM. And don't pay for a cab to get to the airport, take the WAX bus route. Cab to the Golden Nugget was $40 without tip taking the shortest route then the valet told us about this for the way back. Also, the North Premium Outlets were much nicer and newer than the South---the North are just two stops up from this hotel on the Deuce or the SDX routes but not walking distance due to the railroad tracks out there. Also, SDX stops at fewer hotels than the Deuce if you are going to the strip and want to get there quicker.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longboat Key, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Downtown Las vegas Hotel bar none.\u201d", "Author": "Jeffrey C", "ReviewID": "UR125992075", "Content": "Having stayed at the Luxor when I stayed on the STRIP several years ago - This was a pleasant Change for a more Quaint, non- mega strip hotel.

Once found I was checked in quickly and efficiently and was able to get into my room at 10 AM. The VIP lounge is a joke - just a small interior room with a small check in desk and then a sitting areas for about 6 people, with odd victorian decor. I think ther ewas a mini-fridge with free beverages for VIP guests. The room itself is very nice, though it isn't really that large - almost too much furniture packed into it. They could lose the bench at the end of the bed. The leather couch was nice though. The sitting chair was a recliner but wasn't particularly comfortable. the TV is huge, and there is a DVD player too. The wood TV wall is neato, but it does make for a dark part of the room sinc ethey don't have adequate lighting built into it. The decor is very nice, modern masculine feel to it. I wish the rooms in this hotel hard larger windows. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom has significant design problems. It is long and narrow, and the only closet in the room is in the bathroom and is hard to get into. The bathtub is plastic cheesy and nothing special at all. They call it a deep soaking tub, but it is not that much bigger than a regular tub. The glass door for the tub opens only on one side as the other panel is immediately adjacent to the toilet and is glued (!) shut. There is a small TV in the mirror, but it is sort of hard to see the screen unless you are right in front of it. The fancy sinks are fancy. I was traveling by myself and I felt crowded in the long but excessively narrow bathroom. The Gold Club rooms cost about $20 more that a Rush Room. For that $20 I got a smaller room with similar decor and a smaller bathroom. What makes it worth the $20? Well I did get two free $8 bottles of water. I got free snacks and free coffee in an area next to the elevator. I got a free VIP pass to the work out center, which I had good intentions but never did actually use. I got VIP passes to the buffet and to the show line, neither of which I used. I also got charged for $10 in coffee that was never in my room to start with (I just got my bill in the mail and found that one out and will need to call them up). Next time I think I will try a Rush Room. The Carson rooms I have stayed in before were just fine too. Overall the Gold Club room just wasn't that special. The hotel itself is great. I ate at the Carson Cafe and the food was good The hot tub was hot, and there is a very nice sitting area next to the hot tubs with gas firepits. The people working there all seemed very nice. And it has great location on Fremont Street, which I always try to stay overnight on my trips so I can stay up and watch the bands play.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat room for a low price\u201d", "Author": "Ckickert", "ReviewID": "UR125753727", "Content": "This hotel seems to have it all. Great rooms, several swimming pools, restaurants bars etc. First off I have to admit that I was upgraded to a room in the Gold Tower, we got a suite with a separate living room and kitchen. Totally unexpected but of course more than welcome! Your mileage may vary. The hotel itself has a great location on lively Fremont Street. Different than the Strip but to be honest I liked it more. There are so many things to do within walking distance that I never felt bored. The Strip may have classier establishments but to be honest to me it's all the same kitsch. That was what I was going for anyway. Because I did so many things during the day I never had time to relax in the pool but it certainly looks exciting. Don't expect olympic size swimming lanes, but it's nice anyway. The restaurants looked ok, but I have to say that their buffet was horrible.

The room size and quality was similar to ones that I've paid $160-$200 per night in metro areas, like Nashville TN, Springfield MA, or Poughkeepsie NY. This was simply the most luxurious $49 room I have ever slept in. While undersized, it has a great pool area with a fire pit, outdoor bar, different levels, and a water slide that goes through a shark tank. The Golden Nugget is located in the center of Fremont Street, which is the best free freak show on earth. I felt safe but I'm 6'4\", 265 lbs, and ugly. If you like psychedelic music from the 70's or 80's hair-band rock then Fremont St. is for you. The \"Experience,\" the street, and the people were very entertaining. I had a great time even though the scene is not really my cup of tea. The Bad Stuff: Everything cost extra: High speed Internet $13/day, lounge chair at the pool $20/day, fitness Room $20/day, three minute long distance phone call $26, bottle of water in the room $7, 4-pack of coffee in the room $10. Their business model is simple: Inexpensive rooms to lure people and then expensive amenities throughout the hotel. Just be aware that the hotel is not a good value if you are looking for more than a room to sleep in. Consider that it'll cost $80 for a family of 4 to reserve lounge chairs by the pool. Unlike the hotels on the Strip, the Golden Nuggets casino ceilings are low, the ventilation system is poor, and this hotel attracts smokers more than the typical casino. I was prepared for a very smoky casino area and it was far worse than I imagined. While I've never smoked, I wanted to start just so I could get the benefits of nicotine since walking through the casino was no different than having two lit cigarettes in your mouth. Other stuff: The breakfast buffet becomes a brunch on Sunday and they charge dinner prices. The hotel has three Starbucks including one with an outdoor seating area where you can enjoy the Experience and \"people watching\" without rubbing elbows in the crowd. The restaurants were good. The buffet was good, but it does attract buffet lovers, so be prepared to battle with very large people who cut you in line as if they are starving. Believe me. I know the type. I am one of them. The buffets at the Bellagio and Paris had much more normal people. In the morning there are plenty of $5 blackjack tables. I went in February and the place was hoping with activity. Its certainly not a dead hotel or on the verge of going out of business as some describe. Conclusion: Surprisingly, I would stay here again. Comfy bed, clean bathroom, big room, plenty to do and see. Just be warned that you are in smokers\u2019 heaven and the inexpensive room rate is not indicative of the high price for basic hotel amenities. Everything costs extra, but that's a reflection of the entire town, not just the Golden Nugget.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Franklin, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNew Rush Tower is Fabulous!

We arrived about 4pm on Friday and we were immediately assisted by the valet at the entrance on Casino Center. We didn't want bell service, so we unloaded our bags and headed inside. One big surprise immediately inside the door is there was no ramp around the small set of steps into the lobby. While a nuisance for wheeled luggage, I don't know what they do to accommodate wheelchairs or scooters. We waited with the luggage while the guys went to check in. There was no wait, but check-in seemed to take longer than usual for a hotel. The guys didn't complain about the staff or service at check-in, so I presume it was nothing awful. We did get the room type that we reserved -- non-smoking king in Carson tower. We headed up to our room on the 16th floor. The elevators were quick and available(which was the case for our entire stay). We were in the far end of the Carson tower, so it took a few stops to read the signs to figure out how to find our room. I had already seen pictures of the rooms in Carson tower, so there was no surprise. The room was clean and reasonably spacious, but it would feel pretty crowded with 2 queens in the same room. We had an awesome view of the valet parking garage as well as other parts of downtown. ;) We both slept as well as usual on the bed. There was nothing noticeably uncomfortable about it. They provided the usual assortment of toiletries and added a second set when housekeeping came through on Saturday. Only surprise was a Keurig coffee maker. I had specifically looked at the hotel's web site on room amenities and there was no mention of a coffee maker in the rooms, so I didn't bring any coffee. Of course, there was a charge for the coffee -- $10 for a 4-pack of k-cups. So, if you drink coffee, bring your own k-cups!!! Hubby got in the pool and tested out the slide. He said the slide was great and the pool water was a good temperature. The pool is a bit small and has a lot of shade, so it would probably be unsatisfying for a day of laying out by the pool. But it's probably perfect for sitting on a chair and watching your kids play around in the water. And watching the shark tank! We never got over to the adults only pool. We didn't eat there at all, so I can't comment on food at all. We ate at Binion's steak house which was awesome and at Hash House at the Plaza which was very good. We also ate at the Chicago Brewing Company at the Four Queens and it was nearly awful. We really didn't interact with any of the staff at Golden Nugget at all, but the few we did talk to were very nice and gracious. We did most of our gambling at other casinos downtown, especially Fremont, since the table minimums were lower. For us, the Golden Nugget was mostly a home base for the other things we were doing. I think it all comes down to expectations. We didn't expect it to be like a luxury suite on the strip. We've stayed in regular rooms at the Luxor and Monte Carlo and our room at the Nugget was just as nice as those and in some ways nicer. Noise from the hall and other rooms kept us awake all night at Monte Carlo. The Golden Nugget was very quiet up on our floor. We never heard people in the hallways or from the rooms around or above us. The room doors were very quiet when they opened and closed instead of the slamming you hear in other hotels. As far as we could tell, the whole floor might have been empty! Maybe we don't expect much, but as long as things are clean and the bed, shower, sink, and toilet are usable, we are generally satisfied. In general, I enjoyed staying downtown more than on the Strip. I liked the smaller feel of the area. I liked that I could walk 50 feet down Fremont street and go buy a bottle of water at the ABC store for less than a dollar. I liked that it was less crowded for walking around than many places on the Strip. The free entertainment at the stages on Fremont street was generally decent, some better than others. The drinks were definitely priced much better than anywhere on the strip (we paid $20 for a beer and a rum/coke at Caesers!!!). Fremont felt more like wandering around at an outdoor mall while the strip often feels like being herded like cattle. There are definitely sights worth seeing on the Strip and I absolutely recommend a trip down there for anyone new to Vegas. But I think Fremont street and downtown is a better choice for casual hanging out and drinking and gambling. Everything is so close together and it's not a major expedition to go to someplace outside your hotel. I think our main complaint about the Nugget is the lighting. They may be going for ambiance, but the halls and rooms were a bit too dark for our taste. I kept trying to find a light in the room good enough to read maps and papers. The \"Elevator\" sign was also hard to see -- a small spotlight on the sign would do wonders.

The staff very friendly. Its location is convenient being smack in the middle of Fremont Street. Food choices are very good. I ate at the buffet, very price-worthy with and witrhout the coupons provided at check-in, the 24 hour cafe, tasty and good value, and Lillies Asian House for Japanese Hibachi which was as tasty as it was entertaining!

The pool area/aquarium are pretty cool and the pool was quite refreshing and thepool staff friendly. THE MEH: The casion while large is a bit confusing and spread slightly haphazardly. You will eventually get used to it but being an old school casino, they try to modernize anyway they can and it can get a bit crowded and cramped. Signage is a bit confusing with poor contrast but again after a few days you should get used to it.

Love the Fremont experience - light show, rock bands, easy to walk in and out of casinos AND we win more downtown than we do on the strip. Stayed in the Rush Tower. Very nice rooms - like the double sinks, and fairly spacious. While many strip hotels charge a \"resort fee\" the Nugget goes not BUT we had to pay $10.00 if we want coffee in our room using the little one cup canisters. Would rather have good coffee from Starbucks. Fitness Center was $20.00 a day. We chose to walk Fremont and get exercise for free. There were hardly any plugs for appliances in the rooms. With two cell phones, IPODS, Kindle, etc they need to update this so that items can be easily plugged in. I just bring an extension cord where ever I go since some hotels still don't have enough plugs. The biggest issue we had with the hotel was the noise factor. The rooms must be made of paper. We were awakened at 3:00 AM by our neighbors playing loud music and singing at the top of their lungs. Now....yes this is Vegas and we were out and got home late too but did not choose to sing and play music for all to hear...so why don't the hotels have better soundproofing in the rooms since they know this will be happening on a daily basis. We decided to put up with this for about 45 minutes hoping that the neighbors would fall asleep or pass out but no luck. Finally at 3:45 am I decided to call the front desk only to be told all operators were busy and I was number 3 on hold. I held for 15 minutes and finally just left a message. Their message says they will call back. At 4 AM I pounded on the wall loudly twice and it worked.....silence after that. No call back ever from the front desk and no one ever to answer the phone...what if it was an emergency????? At check out I was charged an extra $90.00 by mistake on my bill. If I hadn't looked it over carefully and kept my original reservation booking, I would have had to pay this. As it turned out, I was told they switched over to a new computer system and the price had incorrectly transferred over. I was given a $90.00 credit back to my credit card but haven't seen it yet so hopefully I won't have to fight this one out with them as it was their mistake. However, even with these issues, I still feel this is the best hotel to stay at downtown. Service is generally good. Nice bars and entertainment. Free parking. Nice budget rent a car in the hotel making it very easy to rent a car for heading out to see the sights.

Typical high priced mini bar items, but there was a well stocked gift shop right off the elevator with everything you could imagine including bottled booze. We like downtown, it has a different vibe than the strip and everything is so close. There was a Walgreens right around the corner for those things we forgot and three other casinos on the same intersection we were on. Plenty of other casinos line Fremont Street, plus there are bands every night playing for free as part of the Fremont Street Experience. For low budget gamblers like us, your money goes a lot further downtown. The slots pay better and you can always find a $5 blackjack table and often a $3 table.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNothing to fault..\u201d", "Author": "Dee1828", "ReviewID": "UR124744693", "Content": "Huge rooms and clean.

Also, the table minimums on the strip have become unaffordable unless you want to gamble at 7:30 AM. Downtown is not a glitzy as the strip but you can go from one casino to the next within a minute so very convenient. The table minimums are also much lower so your stake lasts a little bit longer.

Thus we get to experience all of Vegas during our stay. We are retired seniors and travel 3/4 times a year to other parts of the country and Europe and consider Vegas our \"budget\" trip. We stay at the Nugget off season when the rates are low (we averaged 60 dollars a night for the week this past trip); we take advantage of some of the downtown deals - 2 for 1 buffets, etc. We have always stayed in the Carson tower because it is close to the self-parking garage; this tower is far (a long walk) from the casino, but the walk isn't as bad as some make it out to be! This tower (I can't speak for the rest of the hotel) advertises \"king\" size beds, but they are really queen (and their queen beds are really double). I don't understand why they do this...but the beds are very comfortable. Our room this stay was very clean when we arrived and the daily maid service was wonderful. The two chairs in the room weren't very comfortable and one had quite a few stains on the arms and seat. The flat screen TV was a nice size; the lap top did not work. We like the addition of the Keurig coffeemaker; we took our own K cups. We were on the lowest floor (third) and weren't bothered much by any street noise. Occasionally we'd hear a rowdy vacationer in the hall but overall, the tower was quiet. We usually eat at the Grotto once or twice during a visit; but didn't this trip. We did enjoy happy hour at The Chart House.....a great deal on fantastic appetizers (that made for an inexpensive evening meal). We had lunch at the buffet; it was adequate/ good (not great).

Having stayed here several years ago, I was curious to see if it's still as nice as I remembered. The hotel did not disappoint. Check in went smooth with very nice customer service at the front desk, the walk to the room is relatively short, and the elevators were quick, with little wait (maybe it's just me but long elevator waits and rides are infuriating). We stayed in the south tower(furthest from the Fremont Experience) and between the front desk and our room was a busy bar(I believe it is called The Ice Bar), the pool(more on that in a minute), the hotel cafe(again, more on that in a minute ) , clothing store, japanese restaurant ,convenience store, and a starbucks. The room was nice and is comparible to any standard room on the strip, unlike most of the other rooms downtown, which can be quite small and dingy. Most importantly the room was clean, quiet, and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom is...well, a bathroom. It is clean with soaps, lotions, shampoo and conditioner. The only issues I had were the air conditioning unit which rattled a little but a piece of paper wedged in the vent fixed that easily, and while the coffee maker was a Kuerig, which was nice, they charge for the coffee (I guess the days of free coffee are over at the Golden Nugget...booo!). The tv is a nice flat screen but I don't watch much tv so, not a priority for me. Being that this was winter, we didn't spend any time at the pool but it is very impressive looking for such a small area. There is a bar outside near the Jacuzzi and fire pit, as well as gaming tables. There seems to be plenty of seating and lounge chairs, though in the summer it might be kinda tight, as well as a pretty awesome looking water slide that goes right through a huge shark tank! If we ever stay here again (more on that below) I will definitely try it. The hotel cafe is great. The service is friendly and quick, (except for the keno girl, she seems to be on sloth time) and the food is great, though the prices are a little expensive. The snack bar next to the sports book is great too. I highly recommend the hot wings, they are pretty awesome. The casino is nicely decorated, not too crowded, and a lot less smokey than most places downtown. Though, my two main interest, the sports book and poker room, are unfortunately only average. They are both small, crowded and smokey (yup, even though the poker room is smoke free, it is right next to a very busy bar and people like to hang out near the rail and smoke, ugh). Overall The Golden Nugget was again a great experience. Unfortunately I probably won't be staying there again ,and I blame the downtown experience. I have always loved downtown and almost exclusively stayed there (I have stayed in every downtown hotel many times) when I visited. It was busy, loud, kinda rough, walkable, had a real party kinda feel, and was just a lot of fun, but it has spiraled into just a weird freak show. 1st, the zip line is kinda cool but the structure is giant and kills any view looking east on fremont street. 2nd, there seems to be a lot more unsavory types, homeless people, and worst of all, character peddlers. It used to be a handful of characters, most of them pretty funny, an odd looking Mickey here, a grubby Buzz Lightyear there, but now it has degenerated into dozens of them and most of them are just nasty and are becoming quite aggressive for tips. The final straw came when I saw a family with small children (Vegas with kids!? No thanks) wedged between a dominatrix leading a man in a bikini with a leash and an old man dressed as cupid wearing nothing but wings and short shorts with the butt cut out. And while they are down on the strip, they can easily be avoided unlike in the small area of downtown. Lastly, downtown was a great deal. That doesn't really exist anymore. You can still find cheap stuff but the quality of what you get has tanked. No more cheap gambling, food can be had for cheap but don't expect much, and room rates keep going up, yet the hotels aren't improving.

We stayed 3 nights at Harrah's before moving to GN for a change of pace and to check out Fremont Street at night, as we've always stayed on the Strip. So glad we did. After reading the reviews, we decided to try it for a couple of days - made reservations with our Landry's membership and got a free upgrade to Gold Tower room. At VIP check in we were offered choice of Carson or Gold Tower so looked at Carson first. Carson rooms are great but beware; If you like to drink and gamble, you need hiking shoes and some provisions to make the trek as it is a LONG walk. A very long walk. Conversely, the Gold Tower rooms are right off of the casino floor and near the pool and the valet entrance. Our room overlooked the pool, was quiet and so .... choice. No king beds were available so we had doubles (NOT queen, but full size beds) but the room was perfect. Although the bathroom was relatively small, the room was clearly larger than the \"mini suite\" we stayed in at Harrah's and the furnishings were much better. Leather club chairs, granite topped dresser, end tables and vanity, 40+ inch flat panel TV etc... I loved this room. Overall, the service was very good, and Damien at the VIP check in is a consummate professional, incredibly patient and cordial. All of the staff were great but it was a little tough to get a drink on Friday evening if you were at a machine. The restaurants are all a little pricey, but you've got to expect that. But it doesn't matter since you can run over to Binion's, Fremont casino, Las Vegas club or the like and find specials all day long on the cheap. For non-strip gambling, the location is great. Binion's, 4 Queens, Fitz, etc... all had plenty of lower end games ($3 craps tables, for instance) and the machine payouts seemed to be radically better than the Strip. Even though it was 70 degrees, people were at and in the swimming pool. Wish we had been prepared as the pools are amazing but too crowded to enjoy in the summer. Next trip we're probably going to spend all 5 or 6 nights there. We've stayed at 8 of the casino resorts in Vegas, and so far Golden Nugget is acutally the nicest and the best value.

Maybe this helped me enjoy my experience at the nugget :-) My husband and I stayed at the Golden Nugget mid January of this year. We usually stay on the strip, but my dad and his wife suggested the Nugget since it's their favorite place to stay. He's been going to Vegas for 50+ years, got married there, loves poker, says it still has the feel of the original Vegas. Thought we'd give it a try. We stayed in the Gold tower at his suggestion because the elevators are right by the front desk, near the front door and drop you right out by the casino. Apparently the Carson Tower might be a further walk from what I understand. We were on the 9th floor, overlooking the pool. Not in use in January, so that location was completely quiet. Good insulation, can't hear rooms next door. Summer might be different with noise level from pool. Rooms are very nicely remodeled, clean, flat screen TV. My best advice if you are coffee drinker, take your OWN Kuerig coffee packets. They have a one cup Kuerig maker, but if you break the seal on the 4 pack they have in the room, it'll cost you $10!! We took along our 12 pack, $7 coffee and brought along our own half and half packets and wa-la, had the best morning cup of coffee for almost nothing. They do have sugar/creamer packets if you don't want that hassle. Also, water in the room is like $7 a bottle, get one free on the floor before you go to your room! Bedding was awesome, slept like a baby. Downside, small bathroom, but who spends time there!!?? I booked the room thru Golden Nugget, was $70 a night. Think they might be one of the few hotels who don't charge a resort fee. With that we also received a coupon book which was totally worthwhile, so make sure to get that as the front clerk did not offer it until I asked for it. Inside are buy one get one free breakfast buffet. Reg. the buffet is $10.99, not bad for the vast amount of food you get, but 2 buffets for that price is awesome! The food was great, made to order eggs, also some lunch foods, salad, pasta, desserts. Drinks are included so all the oj, milk, coffee you like. A great deal!!! Get there by 9:00 to avoid the lines. We walked right in each morning at 8 and then watched the lines form. You can also find a McDonalds down the street at the Union Plaza hotel and a few other fast foods inside some of the other hotels. Other coupon in the book was for the Grotto, Italian restaurant right inside the casino. $5 off a $20 purchase. Fills up fast, but we sat at the bar, got excellent and quick service. Hubby and I shared Lasagna, had all the bread and dipping sauce we wanted, I had a glass of wine, he had water, and our bill was $17, not bad! Also, between 2 and 6 weekdays, the Grotto has happy hour pizzas, $7!! They have wood oven awesome pizzas and worth every penny, easily feeds 2. Have a $7 pizza with water and then go sit at the slot machine for free drinks. Can you tell I'm frugal yet??? We really enjoyed our stay at this location. Downtown has such a different vibe, more laid back, little more middle class, not so ritzy, not so big. I like being able to pop into all the other casinos so quickly with not much walking. We also enjoyed the Main Street Station casino just around the corner. Binnions is nice. They are all smoky and get worse as the day goes by. We found ourselves gambling more in the morning and nighttime not so much, just because of the smoke. We had dinner one night at Hugo's Cellar across the street I think in the Fremont and had a wonderful dinner. Feels very old Vegas. Expensive, but a nice treat when everything else is so reasonably priced. You can easily split, but even with the plate charge will save you money. Also, there are coupons you can find for 25% off meal, can't remember what or where they are, but they do exist. Another tip, right next door to nugget is a store called ABC I think. They have anything you need, liquor, toiletries, snacks, trinkets, and all priced regular prices. This was probably what I noticed most, downtown prices were much less than those on the strip. Not a lot of options for shopping, but thats not what I go to Las Vegas for. Last but not least, the shark tank is really cool. This place has got to be a whole nuther world in the summer!! Would be great for kids, but I could also see it being overly crowded. Just know if you are downtown, your experience will be different than the strip. Buskers in the street, people just hanging out, lots of people watching opportunities. I felt very comfortable and at ease downtown. Fun in a different sorta way. First Vegas vacation that was really relaxing. I highly recommend!

Until December! We checked in late as we were driving in from Disneyland and were told only smoking rooms were available (we reserved a non smoking room, always have), it was me, my husband and 4 year old daughter. I asked if they could check again and nothing was available. We went up to the room and was shocked at its condition. The wall paper was peeling from the walls near the window big time, the carpet was stained all over the place, the toilet seat had peeling paint all over and had exposed wood (there was no way I was using that thing), the tub had rusty everything, I could go on and on, but the main thing was it was extremely smokey, really bad. I did not want my daughter sleeping in there. I went back to the desk to ask again, I was very nice, they didn't care. Back to the room, daughter had fallen asleep, I was crying that my baby had to sleep in that stinky filthy dirty room, it was a nightmare and not a 5 diamond star room (did they lose their rating?). I couldn't breathe, was breaking out in a rash all over my chest, DH had the window open, door open, everything, nothing made it better. It was about an hour later, went back down and asked nicely again if anything was available, told him I was getting sick, couldn't breathe and showed him my rash, didn't care or even blink an eye. Went back up, crying some more, back down and hour later to see if something opened up, nothing. Finally I couldn't handle the thought of my daughter in that room for another second, I put her in her stroller and took her to the looby to sleep. I check again, nothing available, it was about 4am so I parked ourselves on the couch near guest check in, hoping if something became available they'd come get me, about 4 or 5 hours later I checked again (it was now about 9:30 I think) and a room was ready. Now you think they would have said excuse me, I was right there and they knew why I was there. They didn't care at all, I really wish we would have went to another hotel but my daughter loves their pool and was so looking forward to it and other family members were checking in to join us the next day. I took pics of the filthy room and plan to send it in the the diamond review. We would have paid whatever amount was necessary to get to a non smoking room, money was not an issue. Now as to the rest of our stay, The Buffet, check the plates before you put your food on them, the majority were dirty, very dirty and we ate at the buffet for several meals, there were always lots of dirty plates in the clean stacks. As for getting a drink while gambling, don't expect much, they never hardly came around. I had to go to the gift shop to buy a bottle of water I was so thirsty. The staff also was so rude all the time, no mater if it was in a restaurant, in the casino, whatever it sucked! I am really disappointed in what as become of the Nugget. It really was our favorite, go to, place in Las Vegas. We told everyone to stay there, and I mean everyone. Being from hawaii, everyone goes to Vegas for vacation. I don't know if we'll ever stay there again, it's really sad, we thought of it as our vegas \"home\".. So sad, we've stayed all over the stip and preferred the Nugget over everywhere.

There was a desk in both of the rooms I stayed in; one of the rooms was a mini-suite that I was upgraded to. But the lights come from the top of the integrated unit that also housed the TV, etc. There was no desk lamp to be found. I called the front desk to inquire but they said there is no desk lamp in the entire resort. That's unfortunate and not indicative of four star service. The first time, I was able to drag a huge floor lamp over to shine onto the desk area but this last time, there was no floor lamp to use. It really cramped my ability to read small print docs, etc. Otherwise, the hotel was fine; very good values available downtown as compared to the strip. I wasn't gambling so I can't comment on the casino. The Charthouse restaurant at the foot of the Rush Tower is very nice and had lots of good fish options, as well as a beautiful, huge circular aquarium. I also liked being able to be dropped off at an entrance very close to the dedicated Rush Tower check in desk.

It is more like one of the \"Strip\" hotels in that it is more upscale than some of the surrounding hotels on Fremont Street. Depending on the experience you desire, this may not be a good thing. I say this because one of the reasons to stay downtown is to get away from the glitz of the \"Strip\". Downtown is more old-school Vegas, with smaller, more manageable casinos. However, while I enjoy the grittier side of downtown, I like to seek refuge in a nice, clean room. Hence I stayed at the Golden Nugget. When I checked in I was offered an upgrade to the Gold Tower or the Rush Tower, but I didn't think it was worth the extra fee. I hear the new Rush Tower is beautiful, but they only offer King-size beds, and I was traveling with a friend and I wanted a room with two separate beds. I stayed in the old Carson Tower, which has been renovated. I was on the 17th floor, and I had a so-so view of the mountains and a great view of another wing of the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. No frills, but serviceable. The Carson Tower rooms are far from the main casino, so be prepared to walk. I didn't mind because the walk includes a pass by the lovely pool area with the shark tank, which is always pleasant to stop and watch. The bathroom had the old-fashioned tub/shower combo and the awkward shower curtain, but it was clean. The water pressure in the shower was really something to write home about! I love taking a hot shower to wash the casino smoke off of me, and this shower was amazing. Again, there was no special shower head, it was simply powerful water pressure. Since I tend to sleep late in Vegas, I was concerned that I might miss the maid service, but I needn't have worried. I saw the maid in the hall and informed her I was leaving, and the room was cleaned when I returned a short time later. The Golden Nugget doesn't charge those annoying \"resort fees\", but it does charge extra for in-room coffee or internet access. The restaurants in the hotel are a bit pricey for what they are, but there are plenty of more reasonable options a few steps out onto Fremont Street. To recap, the Golden Nugget is a nice \"Strip\" alternative when staying downtown.

Our room in Rush Tower was all that and more. Room Details: Positive: rainhead shower, two robes, two sinks, blow dryer (in bag on shelf in closet), large tub, full length mirrors, iron/board, flat screen TV, couch, safe, all Rush Tower rooms are smoke free, and nice decor and layout. Also, we felt the price was very reasonable: $79 (Dec 26 - Dec 30). Negatives: charge for coffee from coffee maker ($2/cup), Fiji bottled water was $7, and no free internet. The first room we were given overlooked Freemont Street and we knew from reading the reviews that it had the potential to be noisy so we asked to change. Our next room looked toward the Strip and besides a lovely view, there were no noise issues. We usually cut corners on breakfast and lunch, then eat dinner out. We took a small water boiling appliance and instant coffee, instant oatmeal, and some instant soups. Then we went to the Walgreens (east to Freemont and Fourth) and bought fruit and bottled water. Also, there is a Subway in the Four Queens Hotel and a Jason's Deli (west on Ogden to City Parkway). For our trip to the Strip, we took the SDX (Strip and Downtown Express) bus (NW corner of Freemont Street and Casino Center Blvd). I believe it was $7 for a 24-hour pass and you could buy other time-frames as well. Also went to the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (from the TV show Pawn Stars). We walked. It was probably about a mile away from the Golden Nugget. East on Freemont to Las Vegas Blvd. South (right) on Las Vegas Blvd to between Garces Ave and Gass Ave. I'd advise getting there at 9am when it opens. You won't have to wait in a line like you do later in the day. Details about the Golden Nugget: There are two pools and one large hot tub outside. The Tank pool is large and open to everyone. It is somewhat heated, has a waterfall, and a shark tank with an enclosed slide that goes through it. The other pool, The Hideout, is smaller and located above the larger pool. That pool is open until 2am to ages16 years and up. I am not sure if that pool is heated, but I believe that it was. We were there at the end of December and people (kids mostly) were swimming in The Tank. In the pool area there are several bars, lounge chairs, cabanas, a firepit, and freestanding heaters. The casino was easily the nicest in the downtown area. We took Craps lessons at 10am on Tues, Wed, and Thurs. The lessons were free and then, after the lesson, they would open up the table to $5 minimum bets. That was nice because the guys who work the table would give you advice and it was a good way to reinforce what you had just learned. Transportation: we flew to Vegas and took a shuttle from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport when we left. We used Bell Trans. When we arrived in Vegas we purchased a two-way ticket. The day before we returned home, I called to verify that they would be picking us up from our hotel for our trip back to the airport. They were there at the correct time, the driver was pleasant, and we made it to the airport safe and sound.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "DFW", "Title": "\u201cAvoid Golden Nugget\u201d", "Author": "Kenny F", "ReviewID": "UR123283252", "Content": "Beware The Golden Nugget.

The bottle of Fiji water in the room costs $7. $12.99 per day per computer for Internet. Go to the Krispy Kreme coffee shop at the Fitz for free Internet. There are other coffe shops with free Internet in the area. Near the elevators for the Carson Tower is a self-service Internet counter. Per minute fee for the computer and a per page fee for the printer. Now I know why the lines are so long at the airport check-in counters. Room safe is tiny. It is in the closet about 18 inches off the floor.Tablet will fit, but a larger screen netbook may not lay flat. No smoking poker room is good, but the smokers block the entrance ways to the poker room. You can find the poker room entrance by looking for the dense gray cloud. If you can hold your breath for 4 minutes and you are aggressive enough to push people aside maybe you can get into the poker room on the first try. Likes: It was CES week and there was a Moose poker tournment (more than 800 players plus their companions) at the Golden Nugget. Although the check-in area is tiny by Strip standards, the front desk people did an outstanding job. They were fast, but gave full and proper attention for questions; spoke clearly and anticipated the question if a customer looked confused. They kept things moving without upseting anyone. Two beds in the room with 4 drawer dresser, vanity table with lighted mirror and low chair, small round table, 2 upholstered chairs, 2 folding luggage stands. All of it fits and nothing gets in the way. The coupon book had useful 2 for 1 offers and a few free items: buffet, resturants, drinks, and match play and poker room chips. Food portions are large. Often we heard couples order one meal and an extra plate. Grotto resturant - Italian meat panini with cup of soup, $13.99. Bowl of lobster bisque, $9.99. Bread with oil included at the table. The site floor plan is well designed. Things are spread out but after a little walk around, land marks and lines of sight become familiar and navigation becomes easier even if you do take the long way. Other than the casino, ceilings are high and there are few floor to ceiling walls; making for a sense of open space. Resturants, shops and walk ways wrap around the pool on 3 sides but are separated from the pool by glass walls. Although taxi and small shuttle bus drop off and pick up are ongoing at the main lobby entrance, there is a spacious, multi-line area on the so called back side across from one of the parking decks.

I was hopeful from the ratings on the Golden Nugget especially since I had two weeks planned there, but the rating went from 4 to 3 because of added costs, the smoke-filled environment, and and went from 3 to 2 because of some of the misleading scripts from reservations. If you are a smoker, you will not mind this place, and it is on the Freemont walking mall (heart of downtown Vegas), but the additional fees may start to get irritating. But I had been promised a smoke-free room, and they placed me in the tower over the casino. Even though it was recently remodeled, it is impossible to have a smoke free room in that center tower. They have a separate non-smoking tower, but refused to move me there without additional fees. Some of the staff were really nice, but it was obvious management had given them scripts over certain issues, such as smoking, such as the $12.95/day wifi access, the gym in the spa at $20/day, etc etc. So reservations would say \"oh, just talk to the front desk if you are going to stay long and they will cut you a deal on wifi\", but when you get to the front desk to check in, they say \"no way\" and then launch into a prepared script on how they are not a \"spa destination\" and wifi costs extra. I think they are missing the mark on how they handle these issues, and with wifi access on phones, there additional fees will quickly dry up as a revenue stream within a year or two. I am not sure you will get better in downtown Vegas, so if you are a non-smoker, you have to find deals at more expensive strip hotels (Bellagio got high marks from others for clean air), or go to a non-casino hotel at least to get a breather with free wifi and gym at no extra cost.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice looking rooms, average service, overpriced food/casino\u201d", "Author": "Ottawawomanlaura", "ReviewID": "UR122933501", "Content": "Who: Me and my spouse When: 1 week, December 28 2011-January 4, 2012 Check in: We were booked for a king bed (Carson tower) and were told on arrival that we had to settle for 2 double beds.

There is a Starbucks right at the bottom of the elevators, so no need for 10 buck in room coffee. The breakfast buffet was fine.

Carson rooms have been redecorated, but the Rush is relatively new, has it's own covered entrance, valet parking, luggage storage and standing line of taxis. We have not stayed in Gold tower rooms. We found both times the rooms were large enough and the beds comfortable but the check in/out experience is much faster and smoother at Rush Tower as it is dedicated to fewer rooms. If you arrive from the airport by shuttle it will drop you at south entrance (across from Rush, but a long walk with your luggage to Carson check in desk). The walk from Carson rooms to the Casino and restaurants is very long compared to Rush and by staying in Rush you will avoid the people trying to sell show tickets and tours in the hall near Carson. The slight extra cost is worth paying for the convenience it brings. At Rush you should be careful getting into/out bathtub shower as there are no 'grab bars' and some of the areas have sharp edges. There are several good restaurants in the Nugget (see reviews), but if you plan on charging to your room be sure to inform them at check in. There is no 'resort fee' but you will have to pay for WiFi internet. There are two fish tanks. One is at the Chart House restaurant. With luck you will get to see someone inside the tank cleaning it. The other is a SHARK tank at the swimming pool with a water slide that runs through it. It was featured on an episode of CSI Las Vegas. Sit down, relax and enjoy the fish as they swim about in this large tank. It will take your mind off the slots for a few moments. CAUTION if you use the coffee maker or drink the water from bottles on desk in your room you will be surprised to find out it will cost ($10 for coffee about $5 for water). If you use both it will likely be the most expensive coffee you purchase, ever!! Prices are marked, but may not be immediately visible. We suggest you bring bottled water from casino (free) and grab a coffee at Starbucks (2 locations at Nugget) We found all the staff interactions on our recent trip were much more friendly than our first experience. The great feature about staying at the Golden Nugget is that you can walk to about 8 or 10 casinos in 5 minutes (not possible on the Strip) and you can enjoy the Fremont Experience--a fantastic light and sound show each hour starting when the sun sets. The outside casino lights dim and one of several shows appears on the 'ceiling' about 90 feet above Fremont Street. Each night crowds of people arrive from the Strip to take in the shows. Fremont Street is an 'experience': music, light show, street vendors, buskers and if you seek excitment you can enjoy the 'zip line' (about $20) running above Fremont, or have your picture taken ($ tip please) with one of many 'celebrities' (from Elvis to Superman).

Golden Nugget excellent buffet, you will be given a discount voucher for one free breakfast or lunch, breakfast queues started at around 08.45 and about 40 minute wait, lunch starts at 10.30 am so we used to hang out for lunch which had an even better choice, all non alcholic drinks free as well. Henneyses Irish bar was rubbish, overpriced, dark and dingy,bad slow service. Not many shops for food or snacks for the room, Walgreens and ABC stores sold basic snacks but very expensive. Premium outlet North usual designer stores is near downtown, you can get the bus or around 8 dollars in a cab, Miracle Mile shops and Fashion show Mall shops all easy access on bus, in the strip area amd Town Sqaure shopping mall by the airport is very quaint and pretty and about 45 minutes on bus. Ross shop is like TKMAXX thers is one just accross the road from circus Circus this is very affordable clothes shopping and just like TKMAXX. We are not gamblers so found the whole gambling scene just jaw dropping, totally different world and it never stops!! We liked the sight seeing and shopping, weather was 65/70 in Dec so it was T shirt weather during the day but freezing at night. Dont book any shows until you get there go to the tickets for less booths which are dotted around everywhere ask the hotel where they are and you will save a whack of money. Hotel transfers book on line in UK, but be careful as to where you have to pick up tickets, we arrived into terminal 2 and were supposed to collect transfer tickets from terminal 1 on arrival, that is a real pain because it is a trail to get to another terminal. However I had no idea that we were in terminal 2 and fortunately by chance a guy from Ritz transport was waiting at terminal 2 and took us to Golden Nugget, he was very helpful and gave us tips about downtown and best way to get around, his name was Jim. The return trip back to airport was a bit of a nightmare, ritz travel turned up and the guy was a complete jobsworth he demanded tickets and all we had was our on line confirmation and payment receipt, he proceeded to lecture us that we did not read the instructions and that we should have gone to Term 1 to collect tickets when we arrived and that we were a nuisance because he would now have to ring the office and confirm that we were Bona fide customers!!!! He had our name on a booking sheet what more did he want!! so that wasn't a good end to the holiday, then he drove like a maniac all the way to the airport. I am going to email them and tell them about this guy because he was a prat, unlike Jim who had picked us up on arrival and took a look at our confirmation emails and was OK with this. All in all Vegas is magic, Downtown is a better base because you can walk around easily it seems more relaxed and family friendly and if you want catch the bus to the strip to do the sight seeing.

Travel tip... there is a coffee Keurig coffee machine in the room but four kcups cost you $10. Bring your own and you will be set. So now for the NYE downtown experience. This was great. It only cost $32 a person to be on the street. There were three live bands so you had a variety of music. At midnight the countdown started with highlighting the events of 2011 on the canopy, which was done to music. Then the countdown and the fireworks on the canopy (computer generated); as well as, fireworks under the canopy (real) and timed with the computer generated fireworks. This was a great experience and was told several times this is were the locals go to celebrate. Would recommend it and do it again. If not doing the NYE experience still stay at the Nugget.

They still used the same dark tones as the Gold Club rooms, but would stay there again as we like it downtown. Vic and Anthonys AGAIN was the most delicious steak I have ever eaten twice my lifetime now. We stay here just to eat there. They raised the price on the French Onion Soup in the Cafe, but it's still good. The minestrone at the Magnolia Cafe at the Four Queens is now my new favorite soup. Did I tell you I like soup? Not a whole lot to add except it's downtown, don't expect a whole lot because we stayed four nights at the Cosmopolitan, awesome room, hip and modern, 3.9 billion dollars to build, but we would prefer to stay downtown and have all of the amenities and food options and gambling options. To each their own. You have to ask yourself what's more important during your trip to Las Vegas. There's pros and cons to everywhere. Oh, we loved the fun little tournament at the Main Street Station daily. Sign up for their players card and it's ten bucks and it's worth the entertainment, plus the finals are at 4 so they don't hold you hostage until nighttime. You can still go back to your room and go back and win some money if you're in the finals. I think downtown will be the only place we stay from here on in. Just love the convenience of everything.

On our first night, we realized that there was a drainage issue with the bath tub as well as the sink.

At that time, we were just happy to be upgraded although it was a bit of a hassle to pack and unpack again.

At first, I thought it was a bed sheet but as I pulled it from under the bed sheet I realized that it was used underwear. Until this day, I don\u2019t understand how the cleaner has missed the underwear under the sheet because they are supposed to take everything off the bed to make a new one. I called the front desk again feeling really frustrated but the first thing they said was \u201cDo you want another room?\u201d I ended up speaking to several people until they offered me a complementary food coupon at the Caf\u00e9 and NONE OF THEM said sorry. I had to let it go because I didn\u2019t want to ruin our Vegas experience but they have definitely lost valuable customers who could potentially bring in a lot more customers for them. Although the dirty underwear is unacceptable, I would have come back to Golden Nugget if one of them had sincerely apologized. All in all, the Old Vegas was not too far from the Las Vegas strip and we loved the Old Vegas with all the stories and history.

The shark tank was interesting, but I couldn't help but notice that they had rubbed sore spots on their skin that was obviously from bumping up against the tank. I thought it would be cool to watch them, but it was really just kinda sad. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. The bartender at H2o made me a great Hot Chocolate with Baileys and a dash of Amaretto and we cozied up with the fire pit. Even though it was a chilly night, we were very comfortable indeed. The only two legit complaints I have and they are minor at very best are that the Breakfast Buffet left much to be desired and somehow the air kept bothering my eyes. I've heard that bigger casinos pump extra oxygen into their casinos to keep gamblers awake and happy and playing longer, and my more paranoid friends have claimed they pump even stranger things into the air. Honestly, I think it was just their deodorizers they use to try to flush cigarette smoke smell out. But whatever it was, whenever we went downstairs, my eyes watered terribly, which made my sinuses and nose icky. We went to another casino down the street and it smelled smokey, but my eyes were fine, which was the lesser of two evils. Odd.

This was my second experience with a Gold Club Room and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have stayed in several room types at the Golden Nugget, but believe the Gold Club Rooms give me the best value. The Gold Club rooms are set up very similarly to the new Rush Tower rooms, but have a smaller galley-like bathroom. I travel by myself so this is not an issue. With two people, you may decide that it should be one person at a time usage of the bathroom, unlike the Rush Rooms. Other than the bathroom, there is not much difference in the two room types. I\u2019ve included pictures for the bathroom for your enlightenment. I didn\u2019t include pictures of the room because they are plentiful, but the bathroom is not. Like the Rush Rooms, the Gold Club Rooms are all non-smoking. Unlike the Rush Rooms, The Gold Club floors (16 and 17 in the Gold Tower) are accessible only by inserting your room key into a slot the elevator. More importantly, you get a great deal of extra benefits and value for about $20 more than a Rush room. While there is great value, be forewarned that there is no \"club\" per say as the 16 and 17th floors are not \"club level floors, but rather they are the floors the Gold Club rooms are on. Don't let yourself be misled by the term \"club\". The benefits include check-in at the VIP area. This is very helpful when there are long lines since VIP is limited and never has a long line. You can also use the VIP lounge during your stay, although I never do. There is also a line pass that you receive which is good for the buffet, the Caf\u00e9, and the Showroom. Free wired internet is included as is use of the Spa facilities. The most valuable benefit in my opinion is the coffee and newspaper they put out by the elevators in the morning. Most guest get coffee and a paper in their robes and then head back to their rooms to wake up. The coffee is replaced at noon with snacks like M&Ms trail mix, mixed nuts, jellybeans and water. Although they say there is a turndown service, I really have not noticed it. I have eaten in many of the restaurants, including Red Sushi, the Chart House, and the Grill. All the meals I\u2019ve had there have been very good, especially at the Chart House. The gaming area is better and cleaner than most downtown casinos (in my opinion). However, since it is hard to prevent entry of anyone, it is not unusual to be approached in any of the casinos for money or a cigarette by the homeless who have a large presence in the downtown area. The trade off for putting up with that is that I have not seen any \u201cporn slappers\u201d downtown, but they are very numerous on the strip.

We took the bus from downtown to the strip during the day, and took a cab back later that evening. Downtown to us just feels like it evokes the colorful history of the city, I love seeing the old photos in many of the casinos. We stayed in the Rush Tower on a high floor and the daytime view out towards Red Rock is very nice. The room was great, very big, great shower and tub, good king bed. What particularly attracted us to the Golden Nugget was the pool. The shark and other large fish in the shark tank in the middle of the pool were beautiful to watch, with their grace and interesting features. We are not particularly young but are active, and had a blast each day taking many trips down the water slide thru the shark tank. Adults and children alike were enjoying it. Since we were there in late November the temperature was in the 60's. I was glad I had read on a tripadvisor review that the tall buildings around the pool block the sun for part of the day. That is probably welcome in the hot summer but we had to work around it to keep warm enough as we were in the pool a lot. We had to make sure we went to the pool at the times the sun reached it, and we had to move from one section of chairs to other sections as the sun moved. The top pool on the third level catches much more sun, so we were up there quite a bit. Children are not allowed there. There is a big hot tub which helps when you get out of the pool. We ate one lunch and one dinner at the Grotto Italian Restaurant in the hotel and the food was wonderful with what we thought were reasonable prices. Breakfast at the Carson Street Cafe was nice. We did go to Vic & Anthony's which is a quiet, lovely place. It was excellent although I think the rave reviews we have read had our expectations a little too high. It's great to walk out of the hotel onto Fremont with so much to see in such close proximity. We love the old signs that are scattered about as part of the Neon Museum. And the Fremont Experience light and sound shows are still fascinating. The one problem with our room which I would try to avoid next time we go is the noise in the room, as we were looking out at the top of the Fremont Street experience framework. We realized it was the noise from the performances on the stages on Fremont that carried right into the room. The noise made it through my earplugs and noise cancelling headphones. We would attempt to find a way to get a room on the other side of the Rush Tower next time we go. I guess there are several ways to do that, one possibility being getting there early once check-in is available. That said, it was only a problem the night I wanted to stay in early and rest. The other nights we were out past 1 a.m., so it was fine by the time we got in. I like the layout of the hotel and casinos within, and the pretty bars, including the large aquarium at the Chart House and the large selection of vodkas at the pretty little bar just outside of the pool area.

Now i have a keurig at home and you can buy those kcups online for around 50 cents each. That is soooo cheap. Im sure the casino makes enough money to spring for some free coffee. Also there is a bottle of water in the room with a price tag of $7.00. Also for some reason the beds only had sheets on them. They were made up of 3 sheets. No blanket no comforter.

We arrived early evening after travelling for 17 hours, checked in and went to our room - right next to the elevator on the 11th floor - not good! On entering the room I went straight to the window to see the view and could see nothing, I managed to see a glimpse of light far to the right - yes we had a view of a brick wall! Straight back to reception to say we would not accept the room. We were told there were no other rooms available with king beds and so we agreed to move to a room with two doubles and a promise of a room change the next afternoon to a room with a king bed and a view. We then freshened up and went downstairs for a drink in the bar - my drink arrived in a plastic cup! My husband took it straight back to the bar to ask for it to be put into a glass, after waiting patiently while the bartender ignored him (there were not many other people in the bar it was early evening) my husband leaned over the bar and helped himself to a glass. We were not impressed after travelling halfway round the world that our first drink in Las VEgas was in a plastic cup - why? We noticed nobody else being served with plastic cups. Not a good start. The hotel is OK, nice furnishings and clean. Fremont Street on Halloween was a lot of fun. However, we would not stay there again as we spent the entire week travelling up town. We also had to spend the first full day of our holiday hanging round the hotel waiting till lunch time to find out if we could change rooms. Fremont Street is OK to visit once or twice at night, there is no reason to go there during the day. Next time we will stay on the Strip. You would also think that on checking in when they know they are giving you a room that is a) next to the elevator; and b) with full view of a brick wall - that they would tell you this and offer you whatever else was available, instead of letting you go up there and being very disappointed.

We asked for a room away from Fremont Street and they gave us a room with a window facing a cement wall with a small bit of space to the outside. Plus our room had one wall behind the elevators. They are loud and you can hear them going up and down all night. We had to run the AC to drown out the noise. The carpet had a stain on it.

The best view into the tank is from the back side of the pool. Be sure to walk outside and take a look even if you don't go in. There was no problem finding a chair at 11:30 am. The sun moves across the pool area so the chairs to the right when you walk out will be in the shade, but eventually the sun will hit them. The buffet is pretty good!

I just returned from a stay at the Golden Nugget. On a previous trip to Vegas we were mesmerized by the amazing Shark Tank, cabanas and pool area. This was enough to want a stay at the property when we returned. I booked a parlor suite and got an amazing rate! I booked through the hotel website so when the rate dropped a week before our stay they were able to confirm me with the lower rate. We had 4 different rooms in our party. Two standard rooms which were well appointed and quite spacious as well as a Rush tower Jr. Suite and our Parlor Suite. We checked in around 1pm, for the suites, I waited online at normal check in and a very nice receptionist told me I would need to check in at the VIP lounge. The VIP lounge is right off the main lobby and is a nice little well appointed lounge. My main complaint of my stay: the receptionist in the VIP area was rude, curt and generally unfriendly especially compared to the \"normal\" front desk staff. The guests experience at check in can often make or break an experience and I would hope VIP management takes that into account. We were put in room 538 in the Gold Tower. This is a low floor for the building but we were put at the end of the front hallway overlooking the buildings main entrance. The view was not stellar but pretty and not having anyone next to us allowed for a later night of laughs in the huge suite. The two rooms suites have 2 bathrooms and a wet bar in addition to the bedroom and living room. The bedroom had a gorgeous king bed with white sheets and a beautiful box valance above the bed which made it seem very regal. There is a seating area in the bedroom as well as a large flat screen TV and the mandatory items like clock radio/ipod player. Off the bedroom is a full closet, a dressing station and one of the bathrooms. This area was all marble, the bathroom was a bit small but had a soaking jetted tub which was terrific. The living area was enormous and the wet bar made it easy to keep the champagne and snacks coming. There was a mini fridge sink and counter but little else. It was outfitted with glasses but no dishes or cutlery, etc. Living room consisted of a large couch 2 arm chairs and a dining table for 4. Off the living room is the second bathroom. This bathroom was much larger then the first and did not have a tub but included a heavenly steam shower. At the Elevator bank to the Gold tower is where you will find the enormous gold nugget spinning in its large mirrored exhibit. We did not eat while at the Golden Nugget but the restaurants all looked clean and inviting (we had a full agenda of foodie stops, side note: Bouchon for breakfast is an orgasmic experience) The pool was definitely a highlight. The 3 story water slide that spirals thru the shark tank was a terrific experience. We spent a few good hours riding the slide before the main pool closed and we retired to the Hideout for more drinks and the adult pool.

My only complaint with the spa would be the lack of seating in the women's waiting room. The hotel pool was wonderful and refreshing on a hot day - get out there early for you best choice of seating. We will go back - we like being downtown and like that the GN is in the center of the Freemont Street experience.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wylie, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExpecting much more--and better\u201d", "Author": "Bigbill69", "ReviewID": "UR120131370", "Content": "The first four trips to Vegas we stayed on the Strip at four different hotels--some great, some not so much so. After we started going with friends, we started staying downtown and liked it so much better. At the downtown hotels you don't have to walk for 30 minutes just to get next door. Anywhere on Fremont Street (or within a block or two) you can get around quickly and not spend all of your time trying to get to somewhere else. If you do want to venture over to the Strip its only about two blocks to where you can catch the Duce (the double-decker buses). This, in itself, is a treat for me. The first couple of trips in which we stayed downtown, we stayed at the Four Queens which in my estimation was not bad. It wasn't the Bellagio, but then I wasn't expecting it to be. The next year (Oct. 2010) we got a good deal and stayed at the Golden Nugget. I had always heard that the Nugget was the best and nicest of the downtown hotels and was really excited about staying there. With all of the hype I had heard and read, I was expecting much more-- and better. Overall, I rate it very good, even though I was somewhat let-down, especially with our room. It was clean, but average at best, not any better than what we had at the Four Queen the previous two years. We were on the back side of the hotel and our view was of the top of other buildings and parking lots. But, afterall, we don't go to Vegas to spend our time looking out of the window, so really this was a no issue. The one thing I really didn't like, was the fact that there was not a coffee pot in the room. There are several Starbucks in the casino area if you want to buy overpriced coffee (which I refuse to do), but I don't want to track downstairs just to get my morning coffee. Even the Motel 6 offers free morning coffee!! The hotel and casino common areas are really nice and there is a lot to see, like the shark tank and pool, but still was not up to my expectations. I didn't particularly like their casino, but then, I judge a casino on the machines I like to play and how comfortable I am while I'm playing. If you're going to stay at the Nugget, you'd be better off in getting a room in the new tower (which was under construction when we stayed there). Overall, it's worth a stay--you might like it a lot better than I did.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wausau, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Golden Nugget!\u201d", "Author": "curly002", "ReviewID": "UR120038062", "Content": "This was our first trip to Vegas and the Nugget was an excellent fit for us! Previous to booking our hotel, we did a lot of research and got a lot of advice/suggestions for where to stay - downtown or the strip. We definitely made the right decision with downtown and the Golden Nugget. The staff was friendly, helpful and professional. We had a gorgeous, clean room with a wonderful view in the Rush Tower. It was very quiet, which was nice in the mornings for sleeping in. The pool was awesome - even with kids around, it was relaxing. The wait-staff was timely and the bartenders prompt. We ate at the Carson Cafe and had the Champagne Brunch Sunday morning. Both served delicious food with great service. For the price, I would have to say the brunch wasn't worth it for me, but my husband was pleased with it. The location was wonderful - there were taxis readily available as well as public transportation within a block or two. You could walk out of the hotel at night and watch the light show, listen/dance to live music (we heard three different rock bands and a saxophone player/signer) dance to dj's, see magicians, contortionist and a variety of other \"acts\". There were many different shops, casinos, restaurants, kiosks, and clubs along Fremont to enjoy. We did not gamble much (at any casino), didn't win a penny - but had fun playing. \"Free\" drinks were readily available if you are gambling, which was nice. There were people smoking in the casino's, but the ventilation must be awesome because it never smelled smokey, especially at the Golden Nugget. The only thing at the Nugget I was disappointed in was the availability of the workout room and the extra charges. There was a $20 fee per day to use the exercise facility as it was considered part of the spa. There was also a $13 fee for 24 hours of internet access. Even with these \"negatives\", we would stay at the Nugget again and recommend it to anyone who asks our opinion.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat downtown hotel\u201d", "Author": "cazzalfc", "ReviewID": "UR120019462", "Content": "We stayed in the Golden Nuggetn for 2 nights in September before moving on to the strip.

The rooms had been renovated, however many remnants from the 70's still remained, including the doors / locking mechanism, the loud wall air conditioner / heater and the shower. We chose this hotel because it looked like it had an incredibly cool pool. I will say that the pool itself was not a disappointment. Very nice. The pool is set around an aquarium, giving you the feeling of swimming with the fish. There is an awesome water slide that goes through the aquarium, however the speed of the slide makes the inside of the aquarium a big blur. Great concept, poor implementation. The smoke! Like most casino hotels you have to go through the casino to get to your room. Since this is an older casino, the ventilation is not as good as some of the newer ones. It was very smokey and very hard to breathe. My room was a smoke free room, but it was very obvious that it had been smoked in. Yuck! The room was ok, but parts were dated as mentioned above. Our pool view could be seen in tilting your head and looking at a 1/32 quadrant of the window. The rest was pavement and non-pool. The bathroom was small and you could not keep down the bath mat if you wanted to open the bathroom door. The room was appointed with 2 full sized beds. The beds were comfy and the bedding was nice, however if you have 3 people in your group, you know that sharing a full size bed is NOT comfy. The buffet. The lines are long during the week. If you show up for breakfast on the weekend, expect to pay a lot more as it becomes a \"champagne brunch\". Hard to spend $20.99 for a 13 year old to enjoy a champagne brunch, but they offered no alternative pricing for those that do not drink. Room coffee. We recently stayed at nice place in central California. They had a Keurig coffee maker in the room. They included 4 free pods as your \"room coffee.\". The Golden Nugget had a 4-Pack of coffee and wanted to charge $10.00!!! No free room coffee here! The location was fun. The downtown area has a great light show and friendlier casinos. It's very easy access either via local bus or driving to get to the strip.

Even in late October the weather was in the low 80's and the Golden Nugget in Freemont (downtown) has a fabulous pool area where non-gamblers (like me) can read a good book, enjoy a few drinks and be away from the noise of the casino! I booked our room directly with the casino and was asked if I wanted to purchase the \"VIP option\" for $25? Why not? They threw in a couple of free breakfast buffets, drink coupons and show tickets and put us on the top floor too. Nice! The VIP option provided us a super-quick check in (just a few feet away from the front desk is the \"VIP room\" and when I strolled past the mass of folks lined up at registration and opened the door to the VIP room, I was imediately greeted by a cheerful receptionist who handed us our keys and coupons. Done, just like that). A quick unpack and hanging up of some clothes and we went off to one of our favourite watering holes, the Chicago Brewery in the Four Queens (next door) after placing a small sports bet so we could enjoy some beers and pub food while cheering on our team that was broadcast on the big screened televisions (I'm not a BIG gambler but $50/day of short-term investing is about my comfort level). Kimmie at the CB is always cheerful and an attentive server - the big 22 oz growlers of Wezenheimer beer (with a slice of orange floating in them) helps the sliders and burgers go down. Well, my team lost, but I visited the nearby Premium Outlet Mall and purchased my Sweetie a bag full of her favourite soaps and lotions at L'occitane en Provence - now that's a smart investment! Up on the strip (just a short bus ride away on the Ace bus), the Fashion Mall now has the newest Tiffany & Co store and, while small in size, the service was first-class and I left with a tasteful gift for my work colleague. While the weekends are busy in LV, the weekdays are craaaazy quiet and I found myself enjoying the classical music and dancing waters outside the Bellagio Casino with only a handful of people scattered on the sidewalk around me. Inside Bellagios there is a piano bar that has awesome martinis, great music and is the ideal perch for people-watching. The Caesars's Casino next door has (surprise) another great bar, just outside the forum as you enter the casino floor and the bartender, Mike, is a true artist in dispensing amazing alcoholic creations... (he makes a killer \"old fashioned\" using Knob Creek whiskey). All that walking (and drinking) can create a little appetite mid day and thank goodness there's a Ghirardelli Chocolate shoppe hidden in behind Harrah's (actually more beside it and behind all the kiosks). They feature a menu with colour photos of their belt-busting sundaes and that makes picking your favourite a real challenge (there's always tomorrow for another visit!) While on the subject of eating (there's lots to discuss on that subject in Las Vegas) another good spot in Freemont is the diner at the Golden Gate Casino - well prepared food 24/7 (plus terrific pies if you have room for dessert...) when you don't feel like a buffet (but when you do, Main Street Station offers the best buffet downtown!!!) So, when you're not eating, drinking, shopping or people watching (or hanging out a the pool), there are loads of attractions and shows in LV. The Titanic exhibit, Paul Simon and Rodney Carrington were all enjoyed on this latest trip (I vow to see Garth Brooks next trip). Some evenings when we weren't up on the strip shopping or attending a show, we enjoyed live music outside the casinos in Freemont; listening to Carl Ferris performing on his saxaphone while at the other end of the street a group played rock n' roll classics. For the younger crowd there are pretty female bartenders outside the Golden Gate Casino dancing on top of the bars when not selling drinks (but in my book the \"mature\" bartenders inside the Golden Nugget create the best martinis in downtoown though...) We always agree that 5 nights is long enough for any LV visit (any longer and I couldn't get all my purchases on the plane - plus I'd be \"circus fat\"!)", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parma, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "tipsytravler", "ReviewID": "UR120000178", "Content": "Excellent stay in Rush Tower.

Our room was a king room. The room was very clean,no funny smells,bed was very comfortable although the pillows were too soft for me. The gaming area is clean , roomy ( not backing into people as we leave a slot machine). We didn't use the pool but wil on next visit. It was not crowded,there wwre plenty of chairs open and the aquarium is fab! We ate at the buffet and Carson St. Cafe while on our trip. I preferred the cafe over the buffet which is too pricey for the selection. There are quite a few different restaurants in the hotel to choose from. The valet's were very friendly and rememered us. They even offered directions and suggestions when we were going out. In fact, we found all the staff members to be freindly and helpful. We didn't have any issues with the noise from Freemont street at night either. We walked Freemont each night to see the different street performers and to visit the different casinos. I would suggest zip lining while you are down there, very inexpensive and an experience you won't forget. The street was not overly crowded at any time, it was clean and was fun to watch the hourly laser show.

The hotel is located Downtown, but the Strip is easily accessed using the local \"Deuce\" Bus. This costs $5 for 2 hours or $7 for 24 hours. As it can take a good half hour to get to the Strip and you need a good few hours to properly explore the Strip Casinos and Shops, the $7 fare is the best option. Travel tip - do not wait at stops outside very popular venues, walk a little and find a stop with no queue. The Hotel is showing it's age. We stayed on the 3rd floor. The room was dark and quite small, The bathroom was functional but the shower left a lot to be desired. There was quite a bit of machinery noise from a building just below our window. The double glazing did not cut it out and it went on all night, making it difficult to sleep. There are no coffee making facilities in the room, probably because the hotel wants you to spend as little time in the room as possible so that you spend more time in the Casino. There is a swimming pool and water slide, but charges for the pool chairs is high at $10 or $20. The Casino, as expected, was full of \"Slots\" and \"Tables\". There was a good selection of Minimum and Maximum bet tables, to suit most pockets. The slots took only $Bills and gave credits. You could also purchase a card loaded with credits. It was sometimes difficult to understand which buttons to push on the \"Slots\" and what options were available. There is no NO \"No Smoking\" in the Casino and the amount of smoke was sometimes very unpleasant. The Breakfast buffet was only average and there was always quite a queue at opening time.

We opted for a standard room in the Rush Tower but were upgraded to the Junior Suite upon arrival because the hotel was fully booked. Score! Or so we thought\u2026 Our good experiences: -The room is incredible for a hotel of this star rating. A nice, big junior suite, 2 flat screen televisions, a sectional couch at one end and a large comfortable bed at the other. -The bathroom is nice and spacious. Rain shower head was a nice touch. -The pool experience is a blast! The shark/fish tank in the middle of the pool is so much fun. On the bottom level, chairs are first come, first serve and it didn't appear to be hard to get a spot on a Sunday afternoon. The top pool is the adult-only pool and we opted for the day bed for $50. Money well-spent! It was so fun and relaxing up there. Great drink service, good music, and a terrific pool experience. My husband did the slide through the shark tank a couple of times and we went to the downstairs pool for a change of scenery throughout the day. Fabulous pool day! Our bad experiences: -When we got to our Junior Suite on our first night, we felt as though we were downstairs directly on Fremont. It was SO FREAKIN' LOUD. Normally in Vegas this wouldn't be a problem but, technically, we were still on Eastern time and we just wanted some sleep. The description of this room should be, \"Experience the sights and sounds of the Fremont Experience from your very own suite,\" because it couldn't have been any louder than if we were actually on the street. On weekends, Fremont experience ends at 1a and on weekdays, 12a. So by the time we were able to get any sleep on our first night (Saturday) it already felt like 4a. We asked to switch to any room, even a down grade to a standard room in a different tower, but they couldn't accommodate us because the hotel was full. -To me, the crowds and environment just aren't the same as on the strip. Seems like such a shady place. But some may prefer this locale over the strip. -I wished, in the junior suite, the tub was either a jacuzzi or whirlpool. But how picky can you be with a free upgrade?

Our rooms were in the new Rush Tower, which has its own check-in counter. If you are staying in the Rush Tower, be sure to tell your cab driver. We didn't, so we were brought to the regular check-in counter which was much more frantic. Check-in went smoothly, and took about 15 minutes, however, we may have received a better room had we gone to the Rush Tower check in. Our room was on the 5th floor (5206), and had a HUGE 5-foot tall air-conditioning unit right outside the window! We couldn't see anything else! And the thing made a constant humming noise! I would have given the GN five stars, except for this room. Anyway, I offered to go down to the lobby and try to switch, but my wife was okay with it. So we just relaxed and went with the flow. Other than that, the room is new and very nice, decorated in dark colors with dark woods, large flat-screen TV, robes in the large closet, separate toilet room in the bathroom. Tub-shower combo. with a very nice rain-head shower. Great comfortable king-sized bed. We paid about $100 per night average, since it was a holiday weekend. A woman that we had met in the casino was staying in the Carson Tower for $39 a night; not nearly as nice, but she said that it was okay. The Rush Tower has a bank of 6 (I think) elevators, and there was never any waiting. The pool was great, and generally can be described as a \"lagoon\" centered around the shark tank. It was fun to watch people water-sliding through the shark tank, and scuba divers cleaning the tank every morning. The tank actually is deeper than the pool, and has schools of tuna and some other kinds of large fish, in addition to the sharks. There is a bar in one corner of the pool area, and three black-jack tables at the other end. We were told that we would have to pay $20 for the padded chaise-lounges, but there was no charge while we were there, possibly because it was Sunday and Monday nights? Seating is on a first-come first-served basis. We were generally there by 10:00 am and had no problem getting loungers. The pool is within the center of a cluster of towers, however, so one half is in the shade in the morning while the other half is in the sun, and this switches in the early afternoon. Drink service at the pool was good to spotty, depending on how busy it was. Drink prices were reasonable (unlike the Mandalay Bay!). There is also a lunch and snack menu. The hot tub is in a corner of the area that seems to always be in the shade, but is very large, and shaped like a four-leafed clover with separate hot tub areas. There are also gas fire pits and padded deep-seating areas near the hot tubs. There is a three-story hike up to the water-slide through the shark tank, but it is worth the trip. Many people made the water-slide trip sitting up, which slows you down a bit so you can actually see the sharks as you go through. Otherwise, the trip is too quick to see anything. The adult pool is also on the third floor, but we didn't spend any time there. It appeared to be a lot more kicked-back. All of the cabanas appear to be situated on the second and third floors around the pool area, and are not situated convenient to the pools themselves. Restaurants. We ate in the Carson Cafe late one night, and the food was decent and so were the prices. We also enjoyed one meal in Vic and Anthony's Steakhouse, which was excellent! I asked that we be moved from our original seats at a table behind a pillar, and they were very gracious in moving us. The serving staff was exemplary, and really went out of their way to accommodate. Very good and enjoyable meal, but also very expensive!! We had one dinner at the Red Sushi, which was okay. The small restaurant is open to the casino, but still seemed to offer some level of privacy somehow. There are two Starbucks located at opposite ends of the hotel. The Chart House is centered around a large cylindrical fish tank just behind the Rush Tower check-in desk; we heard good things about it but did not have a chance to eat there. There is also an Italian restaurant near the center of the hotel that offers some seating looking into the pool area, but we did not eat there either. The casino is clean and well-maintained. Some areas feel dated a bit, but when you explore the other casinos on Fremont Street, you realize that this is the nicest one of the bunch. There is a specialty bar with a glass wall facing the pool, which offers a variety of martinis and high-end liquors, but expensive. Also, if you order a drink from this bar, you cannot wander around the casino with it, unless they pour your drink into a plastic cup!?! This isn't true of any of the other bars in the casino, only this one. The casino/hotel is right on Fremont Street, and convenient for exploring the other casinos and sights on the street. The bus stop for the strip express is just around the corner from the hotel, and the buses appear frequently. There is also a WAX express bus that apparently goes to the airport, but it was 45 minutes late one day so I wouldn't count on that one. Fremont Street also has kiosks with artists, fortune-tellers, souveniers, booze, etc. At the far end of Fremont Street is a place that sells Heart-Attack hamburgers, with waitresses dressed up in skimpy nurses outfits. But the place seemed very slow. There is also a zip-line that travels about halfway (800 feet?) down Fremont Street, and costs $20 at night. Signs on Fremont Street proclaim steak and lobster for $11.99 and $3 blackjack. Didn't try the steak and lobster, and there was only ONE $3 blackjack table which always had a huge crowd of people waiting for an opening. Otherwise, you can find $5 single-deck blackjack tables if you look around. The Street really livens up about 10 to midnight. We had stayed the three previous days at the Mandalay Bay before moving to the Golden Nugget, and there is a world of difference between the two. Cab fare was $30 (including tip). For the trip to the airport from the GN, we arranged for a shuttle (Bell Transport?) using the telephone at the front desk). The shuttle cost $8.50 apiece, and arrived promptly on time. The shuttle made two other stops on the way to the airport. Anyway, bottom line is, we really enjoyed our stay at the GN, but if you go, just don't get room 5206!!", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cSkip the buffet\u201d", "Author": "JoelsKitty", "ReviewID": "UR119431911", "Content": "I found the food on the dinner buffet to be bland and unappealing.

Overall, we enjoyed the hotel very much. They have updated a lot since the last time I stayed here in the downtown area. I definitely think the Golden Nugget is the best hotel if you plan to stay downtown versus the strip. The hotel is beautiful and nicely appointed. They spent a lot in upgrades. We stayed in the Gold tower and our friends stayed in the Carson tower. The Gold tower was only slightly nicer, with coffee maker in the room and a desk; otherwise pretty much the same. PLus, you have to pay for the Keurig cups for the coffeemaker - $10 for four of them. We ate in three of the restaurants during our visit, Lilly's Asian Cuisine, the Chart House, and Carson Street Cafe. All excellent restaurants. Brian, the manager at the Chart House, was especially good and took good care of us. Staying downtown versus the strip is nice because there is a lot to do and see without straying far from your hotel. There is a convenience store and gift shop right there on Freemont Street where we bought several bottles of water and some liquor and wine for the room and it was all very reasonably priced. Another good thing was there was no charge for the valet other than tips. This seemed to be a teme in Vegas, but we only went to two hotels and neither charged. I have stayed in other cities and paid upwards of $20-$25 per night to keep a car in the garage. What else can I say... the rooms were nice and comfortable. The bed especially; both my wife and I agreed that we slept very well at this hotel and the bedding was very nice. She complained about the lighting in the bathroom and at the makeup mirror outside.

The room itself was large and well furnished with a very comfortable King size bed. The room's decor was a bit dark for my personal taste with lots of brown,beige and dark wood accents. Housekeeping was impeccable and the room was always spotless. The Golden Nugget is a rather massive facility which offers a great deal but can be a bit intimidating to navigate. Fortunately, there are plenty of signs to assist in directing you to the appropriate Tower, restaurant or amenity. During our stay, we tried several of the restaurants on the premises-The Grotto for some very good Italian food; the Carson Street Cafe for some late night dining after attending shows, and the Buffet, offering a vast array of breakfast foods. All offered good food and service at a reasonable price.

My top choice of Hotel completely disappointed us but overall we had an amaing trip. I have travelled alot, all over Canada, U.S. and even some third world countries and encountered the worse customer service and hospitality at the Golden Nugget. Upon arriving at the hotel after a long but uncomplicated day, the hotel had no record of our reservation! It is 10 pm at night and we are at the desk with no where to sit down, except on a casino stool...after some time of checking spellings, dates, confirmation number and re-checking, we ask to speak to the manager and the clerk said ok but failed to make that call. This clerk is alone at the desk, no one came to help him figure things out, no one offered us a drink, the clerk refused to take our luggage or have someone get them. We had been travelling all day, the last meal we had was on our connecting flight 6 hrs previously and we were starving. We used our cell phone to call the airline we booked through (US Airways-very good and affordable) and was told that they recived confirmation from the Golden Nugget 3 weeks prior confirming the reservation and she would take care of it and call me back, politely letting me off my very expensive roaming charges. The clerk refused to give information (fax number ect) to the airline, in fact told me that I could pay for the reservation or atleast a night and we could sort it out tomorrow! What, pay again..OMG I was furious with this guy, it is now 11 pm and we were still ion the lobby! I used my cell phone once again, called the airline who was on hold with the hotel getting no where, Lisa (the wonderful US air agent) faxed all the information to the hotel after I finally got the fax number. Finally the clerk, found \"a\" reservation with our name but the dates were mixed up. We were getting no where...and after 3 times asking, still no manager or even another employee to help out! My mother-in-law called from Alberta in the middle of the night for her and talked to someone to try to help us out.....but still no manager or anything. We finally got bored of waiting, put a few dollars in the slots...drank some more (because we couldn't leave the lobby beause all our luggage was still with us)...and waited. I gave the clerk the benefit of the doubt...he did get busy.Finally at midnight, another clerk entered the picture, so I went over and reminded the first guy, we were still waiting and he went off shift...he bairly even acknowledged us! Amazingly, the new guy found our reservation.....was a bit confused because we were in an \"upgraded\" room. I let him know, we had been waiting more than 2 hrs already, and maybe this was a way of showing some hospitality towards us, he gave us our keys and it would seem we were set....when I went to sign the room charges card, I noticed it was only for 3 days...we had booked for a week. Finally closer to 1 am we finally got into a room....it was exhausting! The \"upgraded\" room was average, beautiful large bathrrom and tub, large flat screen and modern furniture but nothing special..in fact coffee was $10 for 4 cups, water was $7 per 1 L bottle, although our room attendant failed to put a slip on them so we assumed they were free. I even left a note stating unless they are free...we don't want them. The coffee is clearly marked...although do hotels really charge for coffee now? I have never encountered this elsewhere and the coffee was terrible. The room was never really cleaned. I do expect to come back into my room expecting it to look how it did the first time I entered it, but it was always only tidy...and so dusty!(pictures will be posted). In the end, we spoke to \"a\" mananger the night before we left (and we stayed a whole week), our room charges ($80) were comped and our check-out was extended until 2:00, and reminded us we did have \"an upgraded room\" and apologized. I felt ripped off completly and felt like they didn't even care. I really fought to stay in this hotel because I thought it would be amazing but was very disappointed and would not reccommend it....but the pool was amazing, food only average, the buffett for breakfast had barely any fruit in sight...the rest was nice but no where near what I expected.

These are just some of the emotions you can expect to feel when staying at The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. My wife and I were on the last leg of our journey, having just done a coastal driving trip of the western United States. On our way home to Salt Lake City, we thought we'd treat ourselves and stay somewhere in Vegas that had more quality than just your normal hotel. It's a shame, therefore, that we chose the Golden Nugget. We started off with a huge line at the check-in. Oh, well, that happens. Once we got checked in, we made our way to the elevator, not an easy feat considering that the Golden Nugget has one of the worst casino mazes I've ever been through. We were directed to go to the Starbucks and that the elevator was nearby. The front desk girl neglected to tell us which of the TWO in-house Starbucks she meant. Sigh, oh well. When we finally found the elevator, we were stopped by a man who demanded to see our room cards. Since he pretended to be a hotel worker, we did. But it turned out to be someone trying to sell us crap. I was very annoyed that he posed as a hotel employee by asking us to show him our room cards but, again, that's Vegas. When we reached our room, it was facing the elevator lobby with six elevators AND between the elevators and the ice machine. Not a recipe for a good night's sleep. I called the front desk to arrange another room but there was no answer, even after trying multiple times over fifteen minutes. I went back down to the lobby, waiting through a line that had now become even longer, and requested another room. The girl at the desk was unwilling to change my room. Not unable, unwilling. She told me that my reservation included only certain types of rooms. I guess I reserved in the \"crappy\" block of rooms or something. I was turned away without so much as an apology or any effort to try and rectify the situation. Not wanting to ruin the entire trip because of this nonsense, my wife and I decided to go for a swim in the famed shark tank swimming area. But when we went to check it out, it was closed. It closed at 6pm. WTF? 6? Really? It's June in Las Vegas, why are they closing the pool at 6? Ok, so I guess we could go get something to eat. Not a good option unless you're interested in spending $70 on ONE roll of Sushi. Seriously. I know Vegas is marked up, but that was pretty ridiculous. No decent dining options in the hotel so we found something on Fremont Street. Still expensive (as expected) but not ridiculous. So it was back to the room to try and salvage something out of the day. The room was small and dusty without any trace of the four star promise. I decided to get some business done while we were there but found that the wi-fi was $12.99 for 24 hours. Ridiculous. You can walk into McDonald's and experience free wi-fi but you can't pay for a four star hotel and expect the same. There was a tube of Lay's chips on the table which I assumed was for the guests. I, of course, wasn't going to open them so I wouldn't be charged. But wait, these ones are already open. Wait, these chips are already half eaten. Wait a minute! There is a stack of papers here with someone else's flight info and personal documents! And their trash is still in all the trash cans!! MY ROOM WASN'T EVEN CLEANED!!! Another call to the front desk was met with an answering machine. I left a message which was never returned. As expected, the constant dinging from the elevators and ka-chunks from the ice machine made for an unpleasant night. People also tend to congregate at those elevator lobbies and chat loudly before heading to their rooms. Add an extra noisy air conditioner into the mix and you now have the full picture of sleeping at the Golden Nugget. In the morning, we tried to check out using the TV checkout system but were met with a \"we cannot process your request at this time\". I called the front desk again but was naturally met with another answering machine message. Oh, and the hotel parking was PAID parking. In Vegas. PAID parking in Vegas. There wasn't even a hotel guest voucher or anything. You pay to stay in the hotel, then you PAY to park there. I've stayed in Vegas dozens of times and never encountered this phenomenon. All in all, I can't recommend this hotel to anyone. If you want to see the shark tank, just head over from the decent hotel that you decided to stay in, which is certainly NOT The Golden Nugget.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cCould have been a nice visit...BUT\u201d", "Author": "areynax", "ReviewID": "UR118913965", "Content": "This hotel is much larger and nicer than I ever thought about.

They both stated we (bikes) were taking parking away from paying customers. What are we if not paying customers? Are they comping me my room and forgot to tell me? Don't I have a parking permit? It doesn't say I have to park in designated parking spots. Are cars told you have to park in designated spots. Also the on-duty manager stated they were trying to maximize parking spaces, what cars can't park on the top floor of the parking garage? We were told if we wanted to pay $25 per bike in the valet we could have covered parking. The on-duty manager stated the hotel was booked and they wanted to maximize parking, aren't many of their visitors coming by plane and don't have vehicles??? What is the difference of one person in a car and one person on a bike? One parking space right?? Many bikes have two up or are bikes traveling together who usually only take up one spot as they park tandem in the spot. When we spoke with the Managers neither one was friendly and the security manager boarded on rude. Why do they feel parking is a problem they have to manage? Why can't everyone just park where there is open parking?? By stopping bikes entering the parking garage they are about to cause an accident. Making bikes travel up the 6 floors past all the cars who are backing up to get in a parking space of a car leaving they passed by (which we almost hit as he backed up) is just an accident waiting to happen. I thought this was a friendly high class establishment that enjoyed the bikefest participants, apparently not. We are a nusiance to them because we take parking spaces. Seems to me bikers bring a lot of revenue to the Nugget and it's a shame to be discriminated against when you ride a motorcycle. We will be looking for a friendlier hotel in the future!

The 'desk' was no help, to us, figuring out how to get our gear from the parking lot to our room - what a hike that was. True to their word, there is secure parking, set a side, for motorcycles. Score one for that. Good price for the room (during the week). Things were looking up. Until ... The additional $13 for an - unsecured - WiFi hook up. Which, of course, requires a (24) $50 hold on the credit card - Grrr. The other half booked the room, so I was not allowed to set up the WiFi, because there was no 'share' listed on the room. Even though it was booked for 2 people. We ended up in the Carson tower. So hiking back and forth to the main desk is a PITA. It's a bit of a hike. No refrigerator in the room. No coffee. The room safe is cool and all but wasn't big enough to hold anything I wanted to lock up. We decide to try out the tube/slide, through the shark tank. Get ready, hike over and up to the beginning of the slide, just in time to find out, the slide and the main pool had just closed - at 8 o'clock at night. 8 o'clock .. in Vegas? Ok ... fine. We go over the the Hide Out, a bar with a wading pool in it, to see if they can make a martini. The martini was good (not great). But ... $9 for martini - in a plastic cup? I under stand no glass near a pool, but don't charge top dollar for a drink in a beer swilling cup! So, off we go to find something to eat. The restaurant was top notch. The food was excellent and the staff was right there. Only thing was it was so damn noisy I couldn't hear anything they said. I've eaten in cafeterias that were less noisy than that. By now, all we're interested in is sleep. To that end the bed was very comfortable and the 20th floor is very quiet. The hotel staff treated us really great - no complaints with them.

After staying in some of the larger, newer hotels on the strip, we decided to try downtown a few years ago and never went back to staying on the strip. Being downtown is probably not for everyone, but we like that we can walk a short distance and be at another casino within a few minutes. The Rush Tower is a wonderful addition to the Golden Nugget and the rooms are very nice. We have always had a room with a leather \"L\" shaped sofa as well as a wall entertainment unit for the television. The bathroom is large with a big tub and shower. The restaurants at the Nugget are varied and good...prices range from low to high depending on where you choose to eat. I have fallen in love with the cannelonis served at the Italian restaurant, so I have go make a point to order them. The shark tank at the pool is definitely a plus for their pool area, cabanas are available for rent on the upper deck. I have taken advantage of the spa for pedicures and massages...it may not be as large as some hotel spas, but it suffices for a nice spa treatment....who can complain about that? Prices are not cheap, but they are also not as expensive as some of the strip hotel spas. If you wish to go to the strip, there are always taxis outside the door or you may walk about 1.5 blocks and catch one of the city buses that run to the strip. There are a few places to get a nice dinner downtown near the Nugget as well as a hot dog or the world famous $1.99 shrimp cocktail (which used to be 99 cents). The light show is not that impressive after you have seen it one time, but the Nugget is definitely worth a stay at least once...you may find that you like the smaller downtown area better than the crowded strip.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cA Great Surprise!\u201d", "Author": "IceTeaAustin", "ReviewID": "UR118041622", "Content": "My husband and I spent an exhilarating holiday at the Golden Nugget.

Went to the Grotto - good food but pretty pricey. We also ate at the Carson Street Cafe once, would have been twice, but we were advised by the not overly courteous hostess that there were not any tables available at 11 pm at night and that we would have to wait-this was on the night of our arrival, after driving for over 1700 miles,and when the cafe was approximately 1/8 full. The empty tables were \"Reserved'. Oh well, that was the cafe's loss - we usually frequent it when we stay. Not this visit - and we stayed for 11 nights!

The beds were not very comfortable and were firmer than firm. There was no coffee maker or fridge, but luckily we brought our own hot water heater and a cooler that we kept filling with ice for our drinks. Cable TV was very basic and had about 10 channels available. The best part of the hotel was the tank pool with water slide that runs right through it. The kids had a great time there and would've spent all day there if we let them. The hotel is worth staying just for the pool area. i recommend it for kids. Downtown LV is a bit of a drive to the strip, but there's the Fremont experience which is a cool thing to see. We ate at the Grill once for a quick dinner and the food was average. We tried the buffet dinner another night and the food was a little better, but some of the choices seemed like they had been sitting too long under the heaters. We've had better at hotels on the strip. We probably won't choose this hotel again in the future and will get one on the strip.

Before I begin, let me say that I have done a bit of traveling and stayed at all grades of hotels/resorts. I do not consider myself a high maintenance customer, I do expect to get what I pay for though. Check In (Rush Tower): The process went quick. We arrived on a Thursday 9/1. I instantly noticed that none of the desk staff were smiling or being cordial at all. Overall, not welcoming. We specifically asked for a room that did NOT overlook a roof. Instead, we were given a room that faced a parking garage. The Rush Tower room: The room was just ok. Not as large as the website portrays. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was user friendly. The door to our toilet didnt have a latch,so all we could do is hold it shut for privacy.There is no mini bar or fridge in the room. There was a Keurig coffee brewer in the room, but if you used it it would cost you 10.00 for 4 cups of coffee, so we ordered a pot of coffee from room service that was 5.00 plus 5.00 delivery!!! The next morning we opted to use the Keurig only to find no plug in close to the pot. So we had to brew our 10.00 Keurig coffee on the floor. Beware...dont use the bottled water in the room. It will cost you 7.00 per. Room service didnt even pick the thing up off the floor for us when they came in, nor did they restock the coffee. Room service also thought it was ok to start knocking on doors at 8:30 am. Not cool. The Casino: Sort of small, but thats why we like it. I had to call the hotel to find out where all the cocktail servers were. We had been in the casino for over an hour and not seen or heard a single server. I finally went to a couple of the bars and was served warm beer at both. Gambling here was brutal. We ventured around other casinos (mainly Four Queens) for better luck. We also visited the strip one day and had a GREAT time at a place called Casino Royale. Food: The food here was good. The wait staff were all friendly and attentive. Pools: Very small. I refuse to pay to rent a chair, at the pool, at ANY hotel I am staying at! What are they thinking?? Most memorable here: poor customer service at check-in ( come on people...smile a little!!), fee for in-room coffee, being charged for pool chairs,tight machines, no casino cocktail service, Great chicken fettuccini, and service, at the Grotto.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ware", "Title": "\u201cBetter than we expected!\u201d", "Author": "Gill M", "ReviewID": "UR117709931", "Content": "Stayed here as we first were attracted as a family by the pool.

What I really love about this place is that even in January, the spa was open until 2 p.m. and the two pools until 6 or 8? I think the adults-only pool upstairs was open later than the one with the water tube going to it, which I went down 3 times--what a trip! Shark tank etc. you can view from every angle around the pool. As usual, renting a cabana is expensive. The H2O Bar was closed most of the time when we were there (upstairs by the HideOut Infinity Pool). The water temp was pretty darn nice considering the outdoor temp and the spa temp was great. I checked around and many hotels either close their pools entirely in the winter or have very shortened hours. We ate several times at The Grille and once at The Grotto, where we sat right by the window with a great view of the shark tank/pool area. Good food. Next time, we'll spring for either the Chart House or Vic & Anthony's. I honestly can't remember which one we stopped into just for drinks and dessert, but the dessert was SO good I went back and got one to go to take to my room the next night. We've always stayed on the strip before, but I am now sold on Fremont Street. There are some fun places to get free drinks and play the machines at the bar out and about, and of course the Fremont Street Experience has a different program every hour, so that's worth checking out a couple of times. The Nugget's room rates range from good deals to kind of expensive depending on day and season, and unfortunately, they do not have a rate calendar where you can see rates for the whole month and pick your dates from that. I've been getting emails and facebook ads saying 'rooms from $42' but no matter what dates I plug in, they are always higher, generally over $100. Guess I'll have to call them. We stayed in the oldest Carson Tower, which is a fair walk from the elevators to anywhere, but that's another reason they cost less. Had a couple of noisy times (sounded like carpet cleaner or something), but out of five nights there, mostly it was pretty quiet. No 'resort fees' but they charge a lot for internet access (as usual for many Vegas hotel/casinos).

Where to start ? The Nugget expanded a few years ago, adding many more rooms in a new tower. Unfortunately, they didn't expand the other facilities enough to handle the additional guests. This problem showed up everywhere - from check in lines, casino, restaurants, to the pool area. Granted, part of my stay was over a weekend - CROWDED. This allows the Nugget to charge $25 for those of us \"smart enough\" to pay $28 (w/ tax) for a one-stay VIP membership so you can skip the long check in lines and get a coupon book of dubious value. VIP was quick and friendly, and I got some free M&Ms. I'm told that it took an hour for others to check in the regular way. Also, as noted by others, they charge $12/day for internet. The last night it got blinkey and required numerous log-ins. It said I wouldn't be charged twice, but upon check out I noticed I was. If you play blackjack, look elsewhere. Much of Vegas has the \"new rules\" which tilt the odds heavily in the house's favor. The tables I saw were 6-deck and only paid 6:5 for blackjacks instead of 3:2. Also, dealer gets to hit soft 17. You can and should do better if you want to win. A small thing, but my biggest gripe was no coffee. I was fully aware that they ding you $10 for 4 Keurig cups, but that's academic if you're staying in the Carson Tower. There are no Keurigs there, so you're only choice is $15 (plus tip) for a pot from room service, or getting dressed and going downstairs for Starbucks. I need my coffee people - before I get dressed ! Lastly, the staff isn't what it used to be. I remember fondly the days when they had suited doormen at the entrances (okay, nostalgia) - no more. Valet parking was courteous, but it took 20 minutes on a Friday morning to get my car - and I was the only customer. On the positive side, the room was very adequate. Nice size, rather dark, good bed, comfy chairs. AC had a hard time keeping up during the heat of the day though. Some may find same noisy, but I like the background noise. Pizza at the Grotto was decent, food at the Asian restaurant was good. Chart House was so-so and pricey - service was good at all, but we were well dressed.

Technically she was correct, however, when I went to the room, it was not overlooking the pool, it was overlooking a roof that was adjacent to the pool, and the music was noticeable. Again I called the front desk and asked how long the music at the pool lasts and they told me that it will go until at least 10PM and possibly later. I asked again for a manager to request a room that was quieter, and he proceeded to check his room inventory. He found a room in the Gold Tower on the 16th floor and told me that it was not facing either the pool or the FSE. This room turned out to be a much quieter room than the other two.

We were upgraded to a sute with a Strip View on the 17th floor. More on that later. You know that you are in an upscale place when you walk into the lobby and there's a massive fish tank. The lobby is bright, cheerful and well decorated. After a quick check in we were given our room keys and directions to the elevators. I have to say that walking down the hall to our room seemed like walking down the middle of a nuclear submarine. The decor was grown & gold lit by red bulbs. I half expected to hear a klaxon and the order to \"DIVE\" at any minute. The term \"suite\" is actually a misnomer. It's actually one very large and nicely decorated room with a very large bathroom. Part of the room held the kingsize (and very comfortable) bed and a couch separated the bed area from the sitting area. Two large flat screen TV's hung on the walls. One facing the bed and one facing the sitting area. The bathroom was large and beautiful with thick and thirsty towels and nice shampoos/conditioners. The tub was large and deep with sliding glass doors. Because it was so deep, getting in and out of the shower was a bit of a challenge. Golden Nugget would be wise to install a grab bar before someone falls getting out. The only other odd thing about the bathroom was that the toilet was in a tiny separate room. What used to be called a \"water closet.\" But the room is so small that it was like taking care of business in a phone booth. What you get here is what you would expect from any of the major resorts on the Strip. But because it's located downtown it's significantly less expensive. We normally get to Las Vegas a couple of times a year, but it had been a while since we had gone during the month of August. I was surprised to see so many kids out on Fremont St. And I'm not talking teenagers. I'm saying toddlers to tweens out side at 10 - midnight. and even as late as 1 AM. None of my business really, but you have to start wondering about the style of parenting going on. Okay - end of rant. The Rush tower at the GN is beautiful, new and classy.

I called the hotel a few days beforehand to make sure they had record of us and to let them know my \"significant other (SO)) has severe asthma and that we would need a non-smoking room. They indicated that it would be no problem. When we arrived late the night of check-in (around 11 pm) we followed signs all over the hotel for our particular \"tower\". Since there was no sign of a concierge or baggage handler we were dragging our luggage with us. We were exhausted, especially since we were on eastern time (it was 3 am). Needless to say we weren't too happy when we find the check-in counter and it's closed!! We then have to schlep our stuff back all thru the hotel to another counter. When we go to check-in we're told there are NO non-smoking rooms available in our tower at the price we paid. We were then told we could pay an extra $113 for 5 days for an upgrade to another \"tower\". No 'We're sorry\" or \"We can do this for you..\" It was basically \"That sucks for you that you have asthma.\" Not a good first impression that's for sure! So we paid the extra $ and here's a little list of what we encountered, pros and cons: Cons: *TV did not work *Bathroom sink clogged up *Toilet has metal bar so close to left side you bang your arm on it everytime you sit down!!! Plus lefties beware. You can't wipe your b--- with your dominant hand! How crazy is that? The bathroom was not handicapped accessible so not sure what purpose this bar served. * Detachable showhead was mounted halfway down the shower wall. We had to duck to get our head under it to wash our hair. Neither of us are over 5'9\" so height isn't an issue on our end. *Some towels were normal, some were threadbare *In room coffee was a Keurig with 4 pods. If you wanted more than 4 it was another $11!!! Bring your pods! *Iron didn't work *Digital bedside clock was the most annoying, outrageously bright blue display I've ever seen in my life!!! We had to cover it up w/ a towel each night. *The AC in the wall was like a freight train coming thru when you turned it on. It cycled on and off all night. We had earplugs and it still kept us awake. Also the room was extremely dry. Do what we did, don't buy the $7 in room spring water and walk down the street to Walgreens and get a whole case for $5! *Internet was $13 a day! Even the Starbucks in the lobby didn't have free wifi. We heard a lot of people complaining about this. *No fitness center. We heard there was one, we never saw it and the hotel brochure said there was a charge. *Don't believe the hype that the location was better than the Strip. It cost $7 a day to go back and forth on the bus to the Strip, where we went every day. Many times we had to stand on the return bus trip because of overcrowding . Plus it took forever because of all the stops. Cabs were out because we heard they were at least $25 one way. I would say the only plus is if you rent a car, as we did for 2 days, you can get in and out of the area pretty quickly. *The pool was packed and by the afternoon the water was gross!! Cloudy and dirty looking. Unless you're a swimmer you can't get up close to the shark tank, which was very cool. * We ate at the strip and all the great restaurants we had heard of so not much to report on the restaurants. We did have a turkey club sandwich in the Carson Street Cafe. I asked if it were real turkey and they told me absolutely! When it came it was nasty old turkey roll! Pros: *The bathroom looked as if it had been renovated. It had nice terrazzo tile throughout. *The bed, bedding and pillows were all really comfy. The pillows were really small tho. *Calls for maintenance were answered very promptly and the workers that came to our room were very nice. Sorry the pro list is so small but there really isn't much good to tell you good about this hotel. I consider myself very open minded and have traveled a lot, both domestic and internationally, being a trip leader for a local travel group.

When we first booked I did so because we wanted to go to Vegas but our budget wouldn't allow a lot, so I wasn't expecting too much. I figured we would just make do. I chose the Rush tower because it was the newer one and also paid the extra one time fee of $25 to get VIP check-in, (well worth it). When we walked into the room my jaw dropped. It was not exactly the minimal room I expected. It is full of rich woods and dark colors,with great lighting and a large flat screen. The bed was beyond comfortable with enough pillows and a down comforter. Our friends upgraded to a suite and it was astounding!! You walk into living room with two big couches, a dining room table, a bathroom, a sit in front of bar, and oh yeah, a winding staircase that goes upstairs to the bedroom!! I have never seen such a beautiful hotel room! I kept remarking how you could probably rent this room for the same price of a regular room at one of the high end hotels there. The casino is also very nice. You can still play $5 blackjack and the employees are all very pleasant. We spent a great deal of time in the pool. Since we all had no children with us we chose the adult pool because the normal pool does have a lot of kids, it was summer break so I'm sure that added to it. The adult pool is above the regular pool and is pretty small but worked just fine. They have cabanas there that they rent but they are not worth the money in the summer because they are too warm. There is a fan inside but there is no cross-ventilation so you won't spend anytime in them. Also there are no umbrellas so you really cannot lay on a lounge chair for very long before you have to get back in the water, which is just what we did. It was a lot of fun. The food at the Nugget is very good. Our favorite restaurant was the Chart House. It is not the most expensive, we avoided that one after looking at the prices on the menu.

I talked to a wonderful NEW pit boss who said the people who were caught being rude had been terminated. GOOD! Hope they never find work in \"customer service\" again. lol The bartenders were fun again as well as the casino staff for the most part. The pool is amazing as always. DH and I splurged and for 50.00 rented a day bed in the new H2O club (adults only area!) on the top deck of the pool area. I HIGHLY recommend it if it is just adults in your party. In July, the main pool area was full of little kids..of course though when you have that beautiful aquarium and water slide ..it's to be expected.

I was so impressed with the GN during that visit, I convinced my female friend to stay at the GN for a couple of days during our vacation! My reservation was for 2 double beds in the Rush Tower. Upon check-in, I was informed that only rooms w/ king size beds were available (they only have about 11 rooms w/double beds). We open the room door--GORGEOUS! But, we smell sewer. I assumed the room was just recently cleaned and the cleaning person farted before he/she left. Lol, wishful thinking. Hours later, about 8p, showered--huge puddle! Called front desk who sent maintenence to check our room. Apparently, all the caulking on the bottom of the shower doors was gone. Decision made to move us to a \"Suite\". We had show tickets so we couldn't move at that time. 3:30 am: We're moving from Rush Tower to Gold Tower. Upon arrival--utter disgust. Felt like we were stuck in an Austin Powers movie. Lava lamp, room decorated in multiple colors, stained carpets and walls, one bathroom smelled like mildew. And... a king size bed. I immediately called front desk to speak to manager about dissapointment and to request another room. At first, she couldn't understand why I was so displeased with the \"Suite\" we were given. I explained the presentaion of the room AND the mildew smell... major downgrade in comparison to the Rush Tower room. She advised me that no rooms available in Rush Tower til later that day and to call back to speak to manager. Hours later, I explained the whole situation to Orion (manager) who states no room available yet. He was extremely rude, unempathetic and acted like I was inconveniencing him with my situation. He advised me to call back later for an available room. Again, we had tickets for another show... we returned at about 3am and decided to remain in the room since we were checking out in about 8 hours anyway. Upon checkout, updated another manager of situation. (Apparently, they don't communicate at the GN.) This manager acted like I should've been thankful that the first night was \"comped\" and that I would only be charged for the second night. I argued that my intentions were to stay at the Rush Tower and that my secondary accomodations were unsatisfactory. He agreed to charge me the lowest price they charge at the GN. Also, I booked my reservation online, after receiving an e-mail advertising \"One Sweet Deal\". It promised 2 breakfast buffets, 4 welcome cocktails, 2 for 1 show tickets and 2 for 1 ice cream. I didn't receive those gifts during check-in and when I mentioned that to the woman at the front desk, she stated that I did not make my reservations using that deal. Why would I lie??? I still have the e-mail. We finally checked out of the GN and in to NY NY. That's when the enjoyable part of my vacation began. P.S. Our last day in Vegas, we had breakfast at the Wynn hotel--Terrace Point Cafe. Most enjoyable experience. Made me wonder... is the Golden Nugget the \"orphan child\" or the \"black sheep\" of the Wynn hotels? In 2006, I was extremely impressed with the Wynn hotels. 2011... not anymore! BTW...

Ok, I'll take Gold. Gold is midrange between Rush and Carson room. I only chose it because I stayed there last year, and I was comfortable in knowing where to walk navigate, ect. I checked in, and was told \"too bad no more rooms left, we put you in a Carson room\" Now, not that these rooms were particularly bad, they are ok. The fact is you have the balls to ask me what I want, I tell you, then you pull the rug out from under me when I get there.

I checked in my Carson room, walked downstairs and across the street to another casino. Played there all three days as a matter of fact. Thanks for the free room. Had you kindly informed me it is first come first serve, no problem. But you didn't and I felt like, well you know what. Anyways, the check in line is LONG. Bring some lunch with you by the way while you wait. The pool is not even worth going to anymore. Way overcrowded for my taste. Just out of control. The customer service is extremely lacking as well. But I gotta give a thumbs up to the sports book (Asian?) guy. I did play a few horse races, and he was very helpful in helping me bet (Im still a rookie) Good team in that dept! It's nice to see people like that working. I would go back to play race betting because of the great service I got. All in all, probably would choose another hotel.

The Golden Nugget shines as an example of downtown's rehabilitation and provides a fantastic alternative for people who want the Vegas experience without having to deal with the over-the-top scene and crowds of the Strip. When you walk into the Golden Nugget's lobby, you are greeted with very attractive and tasteful decor and a reception area that is on par with nicer business hotels. The hotel rooms have been renovated recently and are large, comfortable, and clean. I'm particular about the comfort of beds, and the king-size bed in our room was one of the better ones I've slept in at a hotel. Even though there were several groups in the hotel, including teams in town for a sports tournament, the hallways and room were quiet, and we didn't have any problems with noise. The bathroom is well stocked with the typical shampoo, soap, and lotion -- nothing fancy, but more than adequate. The Golden Nugget's pool is small by Vegas standards (especially compared to the large pool complexes of Strip hotels), but the facility is one of the nicest in town, more like a lounge than a pool. There are oodles of very comfortable cushioned lounge chairs to sun on, and there are many areas arranged into conversational, living room-like alcoves, which are great if you are at the pool with a group. The pool features a shark tank in the middle, so you can swim alongside marine animals and even slide through the tank down the Golden Nugget's popular water slide. There is a quieter pool for guests aged 16 and older, but we didn't go there on this particular visit. The Golden Nugget offers several attractive dining options. We had dinner at Vic and Anthony's steakhouse, and this was one of the best meals I've had all year -- definitely worth the price! We also had breakfast at the buffet, which didn't feature anything particularly noteworthy but had a good selection and wasn't expensive. Locationwise, the Golden Nugget can't be beat. Its location in the center of Fremont Street gives easy access to the Fremont Street Experience, the zip line, the other casinos, and great peoplewatching. We were very happy with our stay at the Golden Nugget and will definitely be back.

There are marble floors, clean carpets, and a few Starbucks in there. I named my own price on Priceline.com and got a room for Thursday and Friday night for $64 per night (saved $30 from what the GN website wanted). Check-in and check-out were slow so be prepared for that. My room was spacious and clean and well worth the $64 per night.

This private pool is also open until 2am which is a pretty rare thing in Vegas. If you are on a budget, downtown Vegas and the Golden Nugget is certainly the place for you.

We always stay downtown when traveling to Vegas, but never had stayed at the Golden Nugget before. Our room was far enough up in the tower that we weren't bothered by the Freemont Street Experience, the pool was fantastic although we couldn't get access to the adults only section because they were at capacity. We had no problem getting seats and towels at the pool and it was a relaxing experience. Our only complaint was the fact that there didn't seem to be any security there checking to see if the patrons were actually guests of the hotel, locals, or guests of other hotels. Several people I spoke with at the pool were actually Vegas residents. I think they should crack down on this a bit to ensure their guests have access to the services they deserve.

We stayed at the Golden Nugget about 4 years ago for a wedding and loved it then so we decided to stay there again after getting an email for a special rate. I booked the Rush Tower, which was a treat for us because we usually just book the cheapest room. WOW. What a room we got! We had a 'strip' view room on the 18th floor. Granted most of the strip is blocked by, well, the strip, but it was facing the direction of the strip and the view with the mountains was grand. Our room was huge. The bathroom had a double sink, a large tub and toilet in room separated with a door. Plenty of room for the two of us to move around without being in each other's way. The room was beautifully decorating and very posh for us. A deliciously comfortable king sized bed, an 'L' shaped sofa by the window, a nice entertainment center with a big flat screen tv. The safe was very easy to use. We hardly heard a peep from anyone. Only heard our neighbors shower one time. No noisy guests or housekeepers. The drapes totally blocked out the sun in the morning. We were in a quiet, relaxing paradise. With 4 elevators in the tower we hardly ever waited for one. Our package came with two coupons for free drinks, which we used while watching a baseball game and two coupons for the breakfast buffet which was delicious. The best coffee I've ever had at a hotel. We did not use the spa coupons, no time. And we did not use the 2 for one show tickets deal as we opted to see George Wallace at the Flamingo...hilarious. All in all a great two night stay and we would definitely pay extra to stay in the Rush Tower in the future. Here is our special tip for meals...the Triple 7 Brewery in the Main St. Station Casino is the BOMB. The BEST food downtown and so reasonable. We at dinner here both nights. They have a large selection of their own beer. Happy Hour M-F is from 4pm to 6pm. ON the first night we were in time for happy hour and my husband's beer was 2 bucks and we got a huge basket of calamari for 5 bucks. My husband had the Ceasar salad and I had the Oriental Chicken Salad for dinner. The portions are gigantic. Most dishes are under $10. The second night we sat at the bar and my husband had the mushroom burger which came with a mountain of fries and I had the two fish tacos. The best fish tacos I've ever had in my life. They are big and very filling. To get to the 777 from the Golden Nugget, exit the GN onto Freemont street, Walk to the casino on the far north west side of the street. Enter that casino and exit it on the far north east side of the casino. You need to exit, cross the street and enter the California Casino, go up the escalator and over the pedistrian bridge to the Main St. STation. This will keep you cool and I think a bit safer than walking the whole way out on the street.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat pool area\u201d", "Author": "LoLaIreland", "ReviewID": "UR116320747", "Content": "Swimming pool was the best part of the hotel, water slide that goes through a shark tank.

We were coming from The Cosmopolitan (outstanding hotel-read my separate review) which had totally spoiled us with a top of the line Vegas Hotel experience. That was an awesome hotel! Check in was a nightmare at the Golden Nugget but part of it was my fault. I had read that the newest tower The Rush Tower had it's own separate check in lobby..but I mistakenly went into the Gold Tower Entrance (not clearly marked) where there was a check in desk with a closed sign on it. I asked a girl behind the desk what was up and she said it was closed...had always been closed. I said that the website said it was opened and she said they had never opened it and I had to go all the way around to the front of the Hotel (it's clear on the other side two blocks over) and check in there. Now you think the lady could have told me that there was a beautiful lobby check in about 50 feet over right across the parking lot from the Gold Tower entrance at the new Rush Tower...I mean it's the same hotel right ? could she have asked if I was in the Rush tower? Anyway I drove back around to the front of the hotel and when I got to the check in line there were what seemed like 100 people standing in line. This was Sunday afternoon around 3:00 and we waited 50 minutes to get checked in...only to be told our rooms were clear on the other side of the hotel at The Rush Tower. Imagine how I felt when we finally got over to the Rush tower and I saw their Beautiful Marble lobby with Huge Aquarium behind a long check in counter and about 5 people waiting in line. GRRRRRRR! The Rush Tower rooms are fine..about what you would expect for a 3 star property but kind of dark and not a lot of lighting or wall plug outlets to plug stuff into.We had requested a strip view high up and were given a view of the roof of the parking garage roof...you're really to far removed from the strip for any typ;e of view.. The coffee machine was one of the newer POD type Machines and they were charging $10.00 for 4 cups of coffee if you wanted to use it. They did have a refrigerator which is nice to keep your waters and beers cold. I'm not sure the rooms are worth the extra $30.00 from the Carson tower rooms(we had some friends staying there) but the lobby was a lot nicer and certainly had a lot less people on check in and the rooms were a little bigger with a nice couch/sofa area. The Casino is nice and the restaurants in the hotel are all really nice with a lot of variety (you can see on the web site). We really liked being right on Fremont St cause its a Blast hanging out there at night to party and then being able to just walk right into your hotel from there.. One of the Major drawbacks was the pool area which was packed with people when we first checked in but the next morning when we went out to go play in the pool the Attendant yelled at us... telling us to get out... it did not open until 10:00am!!! Now what the heck is up with that? 10:00am? Lame! Most of the employees working at the hotel were fine but we did run into a few that seemed like they hated life and had no business being in the hospitality industry. At one point I lost my room key and went to stand in line with about 3 couples ahead of me. They had one girl working and she averaged 15 minutes per couple so I waited 45 minutes just to get a new key while a 2nd manager looking guy just roamed around behind the desk not bothering to help the girl. All in all Its fine for what it is but the issue with the pool (two many rooms between the 3 towers for the size of pool & not opening until 10:00am) and a couple of run ins with less than stellar service kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Having said all that...I would return to the property for a night if I wanted to hang at Fremont St ...but it can't really compare to the other newer center strip hotels. I've heard that the Plaza Hotel at the beginning of Fremont St is undergoing a complete renovation, so who know..maybe that one when it opens again.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medicine Hat, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, great atmosphere, awesome pool\u201d", "Author": "mtstang", "ReviewID": "UR116289432", "Content": "We have stayed at the Golden Nugget twice now and would go back.

I didn't book the room, so I didn't have any preconceived ideas on the hotel/casino. First impression is that it is far from the strip and not worth the money we saved.

We arrived on a Friday, but only one person was checking in guests. I think we stood in line for about 30 minutes with only 3 people ahead of us in line. The room was clean, but still old and not 'updated' as the website brags about. The pool area is small and full of kids. I'm not complaining about the kids, just an fyi. Since it was a small area, we paid to get into the bar/pool area at the top and it was totally not worth it. It was $20pp and we got chairs in the shade AND the people in charge would not change us to any other open chair!! I don't know if they were reserved, but no one sat in them ever. Moral of the story for us is make sure you know what you are paying for. Speaking of which, if you want to use the fitness facility, it also costs $20. Not the best value/money. The cafe near the enterance has ok cafe food, but the service is very slow. We even left one night after waiting 30 minutes for someone to take our order. We couldn't even find someone to flag down. One bright spot was the steak restaurant 'Vic & Anthony's' - super yummy. It is a bit pricey, but you get the best steak. Sides there are family style so everyone can share.

They were full all three nights we stayed. Valet parking was free (except for tipping of course), but even the Valet spaces filled up pretty quickly. Details, Details . . . We arrived very late on a Thursday night. We were booked in a Rush tower room, but it was full when we arrived. So the reservation agent said she would upgrade us to a suite in the Gold tower, and we could change to Rush the next day. When we got to the Gold Tower room, not only was it not a suite, but it was located in a corner unit with the ice machine on one wall and the elevator on the other. The A/C was really noisy and cancelled out the elevator noise, though. Since it was for one night, we didn't make an issue of it -- however, I believe the overstatement of this room being called a \"suite\" wasn't necessary. We were so tired and it was so late, that we had no trouble falling asleep. Once we moved into the Rush Tower the next day, we were much happier. The whole tower is non-smoking. The room was splendid! We had a view of Las Vegas which was divine at night. The room was clean. I forgot my cell phone cord in the previous room and housekeeping promptly retrieved it and brought it over. The bed was comfy. Didn't like that the in-room coffee was $10 for four cups. You can't buy just one. Didn't like the $7 Fiji water either, but that's Vegas, I guess. We rented a daybed by the Hideout pool on Saturday. It was pricey, but I felt well worth it. We relaxed without kids around. The pool was full, but not jammed. We enjoyed having our place to lounge, and we had a dedicated pool server to keep our drinks filled. The person in charge of ensuring that people who hadn't purchsed seating at the Hideout wouldn't be admitted wasn't very good at her job, but we didn't have any trouble with people trying to take our bed or any of the cabanas or chaises that were unoccupied. They were mainly there to visit others or check out this 16+ pool area. Now -- the food. We didn't like the 24 hour dining options. The Carson Street Cafe didn't offer anything light. And the prices were outrageous. We ate at the buffet on Friday morning at 10:30, and breakfast was over. We used a buy-one-get-one-free coupon and had lunch, although the omelet bar was still available. It wasn't a bargain because the food wasn't that great and there weren't a lot of selections for a buffet. The selections were quite limited. Very little fresh fruit. I liked the carving station and the omelet bar, but I had a hard time finding healthy, fresh choices. I don't eat pasta or potatoes, so I depend on vegetables for my sides, and there were slim pickings. We had breakfast Saturday morning at the Carson Street Cafe. I ordered eggs benedict. WORST ever. The Hollandaise sauce was not right. I think it was either a packaged sauce or it was chicken gravy. Hollandaise should be tangy because it's made with lemon, butter and eggs. This was salty and bland. My husband ordered the Loco Moco. It came smothered in onions which did not match the menu's description. We paid about $40 for our combined meal. Outrageous for food that was neither accurately described nor correctly prepared. We filled out comment cards after because we were outraged at the poor quality and high prices. My spa experience was okay. The aesthetician was great and the facial itself was wodnerful. What I didn't like was that, though I arrived early and did have some wait time before being called into the changing room, someone forgot to call me. When I got to the changing room, I was told to pick any empty locker with a robe in it and place my clothes in there. I changed and did as I was told. I found the robe was too small. I asked an attendant whether I could get a large instead of the medium that I had. She got kind of snippy and said, \"That's the 'medium' section. The 'large' section is over here. I'm the one who is supposed to bring people back here!\" I explained to her what I was told and apologized. She calmed down a little, but then I had to switch lockers and by the time all this transpired, they were calling me into the treatment room. I didn't have time to drink my juice or relax. Once in the treatment room, the experience was great. I was very happy with the facial treatments I requested. Other than the food, the rush to the spa treatment room and the first night's room in the Gold Tower, we enjoyed our stay at the Golden Nugget. I would stay there again, but we would not eat in the restaurants. We didn't chance the Chart House or the other restaurants for fear the food there would be just as disappointing as the two in-hotel restaurants we did try. Downtown is different from the strip, and I was glad to visit there again after many years. If you're looking for a stylish room with a great pool, go to the Nugget. Eat at the Four Queens or Main Street Station, though.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGolden Nugget & Downtown Vegas My New Spot\u201d", "Author": "tamaoj", "ReviewID": "UR115946265", "Content": "Downtown Vegas where have you been my whole life? My girlfriend has a long time friend from the East Coast that travels to Vegas every summer as a tradition. They're both teachers so they have the luxury of not having to work during the summer. So my GF and I decided to meet up with her in LV since it's not that far of a drive from SoCal. We only had two days to stay so I knew the trip would be a quick turnaround. Our arrival day was on a Saturday and our departure day was on Monday. I had to be back at work Monday night. So the decision was made that I would save a little bit of money and try staying in Downtown Vegas for the first time. Based on prices and reviews I chose to stay at the Golden Nugget. The Experience; Upon checking in I was upgraded from a regular room to a suite for no extra charge in their brand new tower. The kicker? I didn't ask for the upgrade nor am I known to be a gambler at any hotel. This room was a really surprising treat. We had a huge bathroom with one of those speacial shower heads that rains down from overhead. Beautiful bathroom counter top too with two sinks. The room had two big flat screen TV's with a sectional leather sofa along with an extra large comfortable bed. Two large windows one facing the pool and other looking out into the desert. GF had a special vanity space and chair just to put on her make up. Everything was a very pleasant surprise at this hotel. The Comparison; My GF's friend was traveling with a male friend of hers who knew the owners son of the Planet Hollywood hotel along with some other hotels in LV so they were comped a room. The room they were staying was supposed to be a suite. Well you guessed it, our room was way better than their \"suite\". When they came and visited our room they wanted to stay because it was so nice and way larger and decorated better than theirs. Moral of the story. I felt pretty dumb after recalling all of the past years I stayed in Vegas and made a point to stay on \"The Strip\" because everyone else does it. I wasted lots of money, large minimum buy ins and overpriced everything and missed out on the vintage style and service Downtown has to offer. It was cool to look at all the different people visiting, Europeans, senior citizens, families with kids and thirty somethings like myself who no longer want to pay for overpriced and \"mainstream\" Vegas. I would call my stay in Downtown Vegas like a visit to Venice Beach Ca. Compared to the times I stayed on the Strip like visiting Newport Beach Ca. I will no longer stay on the Strip unless I absolutely have to. During my stay at the Golden Nugget I only noticed one guy wearing a suit with an open collared shirt on the prowl. That alone is enough for me to keep coming back to Downtown LV.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel if you're staying off the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Deutschreisender", "ReviewID": "UR115942651", "Content": "We were here for a soccer tournament, and I'm not a huge gambler, so for us it was more about location and the room.

It is wayyyy too small for the amount of guests. You HAVE to get there before 9 a.m. to save a lounge chair. The pool opens at 10 so be prepared to wait/read a book. The line is very long for the slide in the afternoon/evening but it was fun. The pool is jam packed in the afternoon and you can't really swim, just stand there in the water. The 16 and older pool was VERY DIRTY and I cannot recommend it at all. I did not use the hot tub. The sharks and fish were fun to watch, and on Sunday the scuba divers were in the tank to clean it.

Stay here. Previous writer extolled the bus access to the Nugget from the airport and is completely right--if you are not renting a car, take the bus, period. If you are not leaving Fremont Street, take the bus. We needed to drive so I will take it from that standpoint. We stayed in the Carson Tower (which is the older rooms) but they are COMPLETELY FINE; Vegas is outside the room anyways. Echoing others, I do recommend the following: call ahead and order the \"VIP check-in\" which after tax is $28.25. This guarantees your room choice, gives you a waiting area at check-in (versus a line) and gets you a line pass at the restaurants. Ask for the 'Values Book' and see if they'll give it to you--let of 2-for-1, free drink, etc coupons. Also, I recommend doing valet just for check-in and letting them take your bags during check-in. For a few dollars in tips, you can get the lay of the land easier. I flew in from the east coast and was exhausted; this started my vacation nicely. After that first day, I used self-park. Once in my room for the evening (after I went to dinner with friends and 'donated' money), I called for my bags and got a very detailed explanation of the hotel from bellman--worth the tip money! The Nugget is quite family friendly (except in the casino, of course!), so if you want a no-kids experience go to Palms. There is an 18+ sunbathing area and a very small 16+ pool. Service was excellent. I easily got extra pillows at midnight and when something wasn't right with the shower, they were there and fixed it in ten minutes. Downside, which is STANDARD in Vegas casino hotels, is no free internet or coffee maker. So let's get around it: --Go out of the casino and turn right down Fremont street. Just inside the Fitzgerald is a McDonald's with the $1 coffee. -- Continue down Fremont there is a Krispy Kreme with free wifi, but you MUST buy something or they will run you out--which is fair, they are not a charity. --Continue one more block to the Walgreens, which is 24/7. Nice, safe, ATM, snack foods and the usual pharmacy stuff. --On Fremont Street, the 'tourist trap' shops all sell 2/$1 water, for what its worth.

This is a great property! And if you enjoy saving money, as I do, let\u2019s start with getting to the Golden Nugget from McCarran Airport. The Regional Transportation System of Southern Nevada (RTC) operates three public buses to and from McCarran, Bus No. 108, No. 109 and the new Westcliff Airport Express, or WAX Bus. You\u2019ll find their downloadable schedules at http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/. For the Golden Nugget, or any of the other Downtown hotels, the WAX is your best and quickest option. WAX buses are brand new and spotless; my drivers were very friendly and accommodating, and the fare is $2 each way. You pay as you board, exact change required; bills or coins accepted. My flight landed on Sunday, July 17, at 6:40 PM and I was easily able to catch the 7:02 departure as I had only carry-on luggage. To get to the WAX bus, take the down escalator near Carousel 7 in the main baggage claim area, then walk across the street to the pedestrian crosswalk. Turn right and go to the very end of the bus docks. You\u2019ll see a large sign, \u201cAll Buses Stop Here.\u201d There is also seating in this area. My WAX bus pulled up at 6:55 and departed exactly at 7:02, as scheduled. There were maybe 8 people on my bus. These are truly express buses and I was at my stop, 4th Street at Carson Avenue, at 7:35 PM. I had no worries about missing my stop as the driver asked me when I boarded where I was going, and he made sure I knew when my stop was coming up. It is a short three block walk up Carson Ave to the Golden Nugget. Check in was quick, and my room on the eighth floor of the new Rush Tower was perfect. In fact, it was exactly like the pictures on the hotel website. The bed was great, the separate L-sofa was comfortable, lighting at the ample workstation was adequate and the Rainforest showerhead was a real treat. Before checking in, be sure to sign up for the Golden Nugget\u2019s player card. Present it at check in and when you purchase chips in the casino or play the slots. As to the casino, the Nugget\u2019s was one of the friendliest ones I have ever been in. Now, I\u2019m not saying the pit bosses were chatty or overly engaging, but unlike some of the ones at Strip casinos, these pit bosses actually made eye contact, mentioned me by name and once in a while said \u201ccongratulations\u201d when a dealer paid me off. Three nights in a row, after long Roulette sessions, I asked if any meal comps were available, and all three nights I was comp\u2019d meals in the Carson Street Caf\u00e9. That sort of generosity is a really nice touch, and it will bring me back. I also gambled (and got a haircut) at El Cortez five blocks down Fremont Street, and ate on the cheap across from the Nugget at the Fremont ($8.99 prime rib). The California, a few blocks up Main Street from the Nugget, has good inexpensive food in their coffee shop. I never felt unsafe walking around the Fremont Street Experience and nearby streets, but do expect to get hit upon for a dollar now and then. I highly recommend the Golden Nugget, especially the Rush Tower if you are a nonsmoker. Some posters have complained about the $10 in-room coffee service, but it is optional and at least one of the Starbucks in the Nugget is open 24 hours a day. A word of caution if you return to McCarran airport by the WAX bus: Southbound, which is back to the airport, the stop where you board is in a different location than the stop from the airport. Going back to the airport, it is in front of Binion\u2019s, on South Casino Center Blvd, which is actually much closer to the Nugget. The way I look at it, the $4 I spent riding the WAX bus from the airport to the Golden Nugget and back again easily saved me $60 in cab fare.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fillmore, Utah", "Title": "\u201cStarted out bad and got worse\u201d", "Author": "Kristine15", "ReviewID": "UR115657847", "Content": "We make many trips to Las Vegas, but this was our first time staying on Fremont Street and was excited for the opportunity to experience the new location.

I used the bathroom after checking into the room and noticed a clump of long, black hair (I have long hair, but blonde, and the rest of my family are males, so I know it wasn't theirs,either) on the floor under the toilet paper holder. After washing my hands, I went to use the complimentary lotion. The housekeeper obviously didn't look at the bottle to see if it was used because, once again, there was a long black hair wrapped around where the lid is. I quickly disposed of the bottle and during the three days staying there did not receive another one. The next morning, I was the first to shower in my family and noticed short, black hair all over the bath tub. When I was using the makeup table (enjoyed that in a motel room), I noticed there was candy under the table, again not ours. Then next to the closet was a cherry pit (YUCK!) The second day, we left our room around 1:30 and returned later in the evening and found that our rooms had not been cleaned. During that day, we also tried to dine at the little diner there and had to leave because nobody would serve us after sitting at the table for over 20 minutes. The icing on the cake was the day that we were checking out, we were checking under the beds (and they are truly only double beds, not queens, who does that anymore?) to make sure we weren't leaving anything and my son found a bag with raisin bread in it (again, not ours).

After the $40 dollar cab ride, check in was a breeze. Tip: if you want to charge meals ect to your room, you MUST set it up during check-in. Our room was in the Rush tower, I highly reccomend the Rush tower. The entire tower is Non-Smoking. The room itself was great. King size bed & a sitting area, overlooking Freemont street. Housekeeping did an excellent job everyday. The pool was awsome, you can get right up next to the shark tank and watch the fish. When you are here, you MUST do the water slide that goes right thru the shark tank, very cool. There were lots of kids here during our stay, I found it a bit wearing, but they were all having a great time. For peace and quiet, we went to the Adult Only sun deck on the 3rd level. (use the stairs next to the bar or the elevator) Just a short walk over to the slide, and you arrived downstairs, cooled off, and ready for a drink! Spent happy hour at the Chart House. Good service and great drinks. (Say hi to Maggie) The food served at happy hour is delicious. We had dinner at Grotto, this was a let down. Never again, the food was good,but the service and attitude of our waiter (Steven) ruined the meal. To begin with the waiter wanted a drink order, but we had to ask for a wine list. (let the attitude begin) Then he wants a dinner order, before we have had a decent chance to review the menu. It became clear to us at this point he just wanted to turn the table and collect his tip. (but, the restaurant was NOT busy at all) Our meals arrived quickly. I got the wrong order, but, it was good and something I was considering, so I didn't mention it. The waiter eventually catches it, apologizes and offers to buy us dessert. (let the attitude continue) He gives us the \"bum's rush\" just to get us out the door. I just wonder if he is smart enought to understand the lousy tip he earned. So i suggest, avoid the Grotto, especially Steven. Other than that, we had a great time.

As usual, the GN is by far and away the best property if you want to stay downtown. You are in all the easy-walking action of late night Vegas, but you are spared the miles and miles of walking on the strip. In response to other reviews complaining about the spa/resort fees or no coffee maker in the room, those practices are THE NORM at nearly all resorts in Vegas. The management does not provide in-room coffee because they want to get you into the casino. They can't take your money if you are sipping coffee in the room! My tactic is to go sit at a slot machine for 5 minutes and order coffee from the waitress! And the resort fee, while annoying, has become common, too. If you join the player's club and gamble tables or slots relatively hard, most properties will waive that, too. The machines here are looser than the strip, and we travel with a friend who loves the poker room. The ability to walk to neighboring (and more seedy) properties nearby is a plus to experience \"old time\" Vegas. The smaller downtown casinos are known to pay better and have odds/rules that benefit the player more than the mega casinos on the strip. The buffet is marvelous and worth the long line. The bread pudding is the very best I've had outside of New Orleans!! You MUST try it if you like the stuff! My only complaint is that the pool area gets very crowded in the hotter weather, and it is difficult to find an open lounge chair, but the shark tank in the center with a water slide that goes around it is obviously a big attraction.

Usually have stayed at the Plaza but due to being closed for renovations, I chose the Golden Nugget. 1st, there is never a need to pay rack room rate. Go online to their site and check for promos and then compare with discount sites. 2nd, valet. Let them park your car. When checking in, they will also help you with your bags and have them brought to your room. But anything you need within the first hour- tote that in yourself. 3rd, check-in vs VIP check-in. I paid the 25 bucks for VIP to guarantee a non-smoking room. But other than that, when I arrived at 7pm on a Monday, July 4th...there was no line. The VIP is to the right , 2nd door just past the Chocolate store. They had a bowl of M&Ms...but I have this thing about eating from an uncovered bowl that people stick their hands in. 4th, use the resources of the staff. When the bellman brought up my bags, he explained the hotel and amenities. Asked if I had any questions. I told him I was on my way to the airport to pick up my sister- he pulled out his I Phone and tracked her plane, told me when she would land, then gave me directions....even directions to her gate. Wow! That's service. 5th, Landry's Club...gotta have. The 25 dollar fee puts 25 on the card. Plus, it puts another 25 for your birth month. So planning a trip? Get the card and use your travel dates as your birthday. Grotto is fabulous! And then go to the MGM Grand to the Rainforest Cafe. The Buffet doesn't accept the card. And about the buffet- skip it. The food wasn't even worth it with the buy one get one free coupon. 6th, cleaning staff does a great job. Our room in the old Carson tower was perfect. They will bring up more shampoos and stuff if you ask. They also have a denta packet complete with toothbrush and single use toothpaste. They will bring you three if you ask. 7th, The Golden Nugget is perfectly located. Walk out the doors onto Fremont. Go down 1 block to the Krispey Kreme for FREE internet. Just buy something first. They have patio seating outside, if you choose- but alot of nonpaying customers sit there and security will ask you to leave. So don't pay the 13 bucks for internet in your room. Walgreens (or was it CVS) is just a few doors down from Krispey Kreme. Snacks, souviners, etc. 8th, the pool. Too crowded for my taste. It's a headache waiting to happen. I went out one afternoon and could not find an empty chair...tons of chairs with no one in them but people leave their stuff to mark their territory. The Golden Nugget was awesome! While in Vegas, avoid the tourist traps. Sure- go to the strip, take the monorail, see all the sights and shopping. Stripburger is a MUST. Best burger of my life. The Harley Davidson Cafe is delicious! Hash House A Go Go is a must eat as well. 1 plate can feed a family of four. The Mob Tour will give you some history- if you are into that sort of thing. Trent Carlinia Elvis Impersonator at the Las Vegas Hilton is the BEST show in town. The Imperial Palace has their card dealers dress up like famous people- Wynonna, Michael Jackson, Lady Ga Ga, Garth Brooks, and others. They do a floor show. Wow!

It was superb !. Every guest was made to feel like they were welcome and respected. That they were special ! The superb service of that Steve Wynn style brought us back to the Nugget year after year --- through the 90's and until a few years ago. The Nugget was so special that we responded by doing all of our dining and gambling there. We felt we should ! Then the Nugget was sold a few years ago and everything changed. Over the last few years we have noticed a continued drop off in the service. The managers and staff (not the maids or other junior employees) demonstrate contempt for their guests rather than respect. The check in is dreadful unless you pay extra for the VIP checkin which in itself is an insult. Often there's only one person on duty even when there is a line for checking in or out. I understand you now have to pay for a seat around the pool. They added the Rush tower and a very small second pool which is nowhere near large enogh to accomodate the extra guests. My wife and I visit Vegas twice a year which means we've been there probably 40-50 times since we moved to the States in 1989. All but the last few have been at the Nugget. Now when we go just by ourselves we go elsewhere. Our last stay was at the Mandaly Bay --- great pool. We are Brits living in California and have lots of guests from the UK. We take them to Vegas and until this latest trip they loved the Nugget because they too remember what it was like. On this recent visit our party of four was returning from a vacation in Yellowstone and Utah. Wherever we stayed in Montana, Idaho and Utah we were treated with respect and it was made obvious we were welcome guests. Free internet, coffee in the rooms, even breakfasts, were standard. Then we decided to end our vacation with a two night stay at the Nugget. I booked 2 rooms for the four of us. When eventually checked in, remember that comment about lousy check in facilities, only one room had been reserved. OK mistakes happen but the check in clerk inferred it was our fault, not the hotels. Lack of respect for their guests !. Come check out another long line with just one clerk on duty. On checking the bill we found there were four incorrect charges to one of our rooms. OK mistakes happen, again, but the clerk's attitude made it obvious that he suspected we were trying to get away with a free meal. The incorrect charges were from the Carson Street cafe, a joint we would not take coffee in let alone a meal. The clerk, a Mr Juan Pablo, needs lessons in civility. Lack of respect for their guests ! I was so offended by his attitude that I asked to see a manager. I need not have bothered. The manager, a Mr. Gerald Stoafer went through the motions but he made it obvious he didn't care an iota. Lack of respect for thir quests ! His attitude would not have been acceptable to Steve Wynn ! Our friends witnessed this last event and they now need no persuading that there are far better choices in Vegas. They too are no longer fans of the Nugget and the other sets of regular visitors will no longer be given the option to stay at the Nugget.. Unless of course Steve Wynn buys it back and returns it to its former glory. We have to say there were a couple of small signs of the better days. The first is Terry the egg man in the buffet. He has cooked my eggs to perfection since the mid 90's, always with a guiet grace and respect for his customers. I will miss him. The second was one of the valet attendants. I will not mention his name because it might land him in trouble. He asked how our visit was. I replied that the Nugget was not like it used to be. He touched my shoulder and replied \"No it's not\" . He shouldn't of course have said it but he was being honest. It is intresting to note that the junior staff know how to behave, yet the staff wearing suites do not have a clue. In conclusion I'd say that if you just want a room this Nugget will not disappoint. But if you're looking for service, respect, no nickel and diming, uncrowded pools etc then go somewhere else. Vegas is hurting and for just a little xtra money you can get the service that the Nugget used to give. We, and all of our friends and family from both the UK and the USA will of course go elsewhere even though I'm leaving \"Private Arrangement\" points on the table. For those who do not know Private arrangement was the old Nuggets loyalty program. It was abandoned a few years ago but old members were grand fathered. Memership in this \"loyalty\" program not only gave you points towards room costs, but also gave you an automatic line pass and a members check in. Only the points remain. In short loyalty no longer matters to the Nugget. Instead they reward for the amount of money you gamble in the casino as a member of their Karret club. They obviously haven't realised that some of us prefer to keep our gambling habbits private, noyt out of guilt but because we value our privacy. I happen to like a little gamble on our two visits a year !

Given the relative decent value of our room rate to begin with - I gave in to what I thought was another Vegas nickel and dime up charge. (For new visitors to Vegas be prepared for this). However, in addition to our room choice guarantee, we were able to check in at the VIP desk and we also received a GN coupon book. We also received the privilege of using the VIP line at any of the on-site restaurants, including the buffet. The 2 for 1 buffet coupon paid for the VIP up charge and we skipped the huge line general customer line. We probably saved a half hour each morning...which meant a lot given we couldn't wait to give the GN our money at the craps table! There are other coupons in the book as well but not nearly as lucrative as the buffet coupons. Yet, use a couple of those and you're either even or ahead on the VIP up-charge. Generally about the GN: The demographic is pretty mixed with quite a few families with young kids. The pool, shark tank water slide and over all value is probably the draw. A little surprising but we found this was the case all over Vegas. Families have returned to Las Vegas in a big way. Our flight home had a dozen kids under the age of 5. The staff is wonderful and one morning when going to get coffee, I noticed the fact the chairs in the casino at the various table games were being painted. My point, the GN is reinvesting in the property and it shows. It is a luxurious property but at a lower price point than on the strip. This translates into a great value for its guests. Before signing off, one little tick that I hope the management of GN will notice. My son and I headed to Gold Diggers one evening. This night club is not crowded and last year we got a table on the balcony over looking Fremont Street. There was no up charge or reservation needed last summer. This time, however, those table were roped off. Again, another attempt to squeeze guests a little more for a very small revenue generator for the property. Again, just a little thing, but please know, it's noticeable to guests.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moorestown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cIf you must be downtown stay here.\u201d", "Author": "RockNJim", "ReviewID": "UR115229171", "Content": "Was in town only a few days buying a second home/investment property.

We got a great price on the room, and it was pretty nice and clean, but other than swimming, sleeping, and one meal, we spent all our time on the Strip. There were lots of disappointments, too. The hotel seemed overwhelmed by all the guests. After waiting in line to get checked in, we made the long walk to our room only to find out that our key wouldn't work. So we had to go all the way back to the check-in desk and get keys to a different room. Then when we went to the pool, it was so crowded that at first we couldn't even find two lounge chairs together. Plus, they were all out of towels when we first got there. The shark tank is pretty cool, so that's the one reason I'd recommend this hotel (and the price). But even the second day when we went to the pool, it was so crowded that we couldn't find any lounge chairs at all. I don't know about you, but when I go to the pool I do like to spend time laying out and reading, and we couldn't even do this. We also at breakfast at the hotel (Carson St. Cafe), and the experience was poor. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, but then once we were seated it took about 30 min for the waitress to even come to our table to take our orders. Then the food was underwhelming; I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all. And in the morning, the maids knocked on our door at 8:30am! We were checking out that day, so they shouldn't have even knocked on the door at all. Also, the self-parking was not very convenient.

Food in the Carson Street Cafe, was actually very good, better than my expectation based on the \"typical\" menu items. That was a very nice surprise. Pool area is the signature for this property, it's a circular ring pool, built around a shark/salt water fish tank with a water slide through it. Since they didn't have the room to \"spread out\" the pool area, they built up instead - it's kinda built in levels. First level is the ring pool and vertical shark tank. Head up a flight of stairs and a second level is more isolated cabanas (for a charge) and chases. Finally, kinda up and behind, is an adults only pool/bar area. They really did a nice job with differentiating each of these areas and providing a pleasant experience - it is very busy around the pool though! Water slide for the kids through the shark tank is pretty popular too. A nice touch in my opinion: the multi story parking garage is free for Hotel guests, a charge for non guests wanting to park there.

We were actually in the older, Carson tower, but that worked great for us. The room was huge. We had plenty of room for all of our shoes. Plus, the staff put our friends in the room directly across the hall from us as well which was great. The down fall is that a cab ride to the Strip is $30 each way which can add up if you go there multiple times a day, but if you are staying downtown you expect that. If you are in no hurry you can take the Deuce from downtown to the Strip for $7 for 24 hours. We did this a couple times to enjoy the sights and then would cab back to save time. The nightlife is lacking there. We tried Golddiggers...empty. We tried other bars throught the weekend...empty.

They always send us promotions, usually we visit when we get the the $500 or $250 in free play. Our last visit, we arrived around 10 on the Thursday evening(against our better judgement, we hate Vegas on the weekends). Straight to our favorite wall of slots! Are you kidding me? Out of the 15 or so machines, six of them had hold notices on them. As we play these all of the time, we know they usually hit around $1070.00 jackpot. Sure enough, all of the held machines were around the $1045.00 to $1080.00. After two hours, no one was back to play these machines. I finally got an attendant, and he told me no one was playing them....hmm? I will also add that that me and my husband were the only two playing on that wall. The attendant told me that he wasn't sure why they were shut down and walked away. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that they were saving the jackpots to go on the Friday when new people arrived. It makes the casino look good when it wins pay when other people are around to see them go. Sure enough, Friday morning a couple were opened up and by late that afternoon,they all were opened up. Yah, we ended up getting some wins, but it really urked me! Nextly, the trash that they allowed in there! We have always seen a few street stragglers, but usually they are asked to leave. Sometimes had beggers asking us for money, but after notifyingattendeants, they got kicked out. This time, my husband was approached twice by prostitutes wanting to go back to his room. At the roulette table two woman, literally had their boobs hanging out! I mean all of their boobs! I chuckled at first, but after an hour of listening to them talk about their drug habits, their sexual encounters, and F bombs every second word, I had to get up and leave. Yes, Me, not the trash that was only betting $1.00, when I was betting $25.00? Makes sense, drive away the big betters . I am far from being a prude, come on I visit Vegas three times a year, but enough already. The Golden Nugget has always been the only well maintained place downtown. And try and get a drink! Not like before....tip the girl, she would be back all the time. Never had an empty glass.This time, we waited a good hour before we even seen the waitress. After complaining to a floor worker, she did come back regularly. At the $25.00 black jack table, played three hours, got one drink! When time to leave, met with our host, meals covered(rightfully so after what we spent), but still gave no explanation as to why we couldn't play any of the Blazing Seven slots our first night. Shoed us out of her office and said she looked forward to seeing us on our next visit. Not Likely Lady, our Nugget days are over. This July we will staying with the MLife group.

We asked the check in person, and he informed me it would be an additional charge...for the Jr Suite...Ok I was game...Oh, but sorry we don't have any available...No offer of the other tower that has suites also. Gave up trying. Got to our room, on the 6th floor, and looked out the window and there was a row of 3 ft by 3 by lights pointing at the room, lighting up the side of the hotel..uh no, this was not going to do. In addition our view was the top of the parking garage...complete cement and cars. Called and asked for a better view, and again possibly an upgrade to the separate soaking tub room. They told us none were clean, but there would be a wait, Ok I will wait, but oh, there IS a room available for an additional 50 bucks a night that matched our request. Went back down stairs and waited in line, 3 guests in front of us, for 30 mins(might I add) to receive our new keys. Went back up to the new room and it was larger indeed...great view toward the strip, and also a window over the pool...but no separate soaking tub...in fact, NO TUB at all...it was a Handicapped ROOM! Bars in the bathroom, and higher counters and a shower you could roll your wheelchair in to... I was not happy, for the extra money, and in addition, felt guilty that I was in a Handicapped room, possibly taking it from someone who may need it! Tired of all the fuss, I gave up, but felt compelled to tell someone. Went back down and spoke to the original check in guy, and he said, oh we will give you 25 dollars back. The room was well appointed, nice amenities, etc, coffee pot was nice, but cost 10 dollars to use and bottled water was 7 dollars a bottle. Went to Starbucks w my Starbucks gift card and they refused to take it saying they don't take them cause its owned by the GN What??? Ate at the Chart House for dinner, it was marginally OK...a total rip off in my opinion. I give it 2 stars. Lousy atmosphere, as it sits behind the check in area. The aquarium is nice, but you tend to feel bad for the fish... Also ate late night at the Cafe...it was horrendous and awful food. The Rush Tower rooms are conveniently located and easy access. The South Tower, where the less expensive rooms are attract a real low class crowd...but hey, you are downtown. Explored the pool area after hours. More fish swimming in a tank, felt sorry for them also. Very tight chairs if you were to lay in the sun, and the pool is extra small. There is an upper area w another small pool, and has a few cabanas with TVs, etc. There also is a bar up there. This is also where the access to the slide is that you take down to the other pool through the fish tank. I guess there is not adequate employment or attention to their property, as while we were up by the slide a very large drunk man was up peeing down into the slide....OK that was gross...so tacky... Casino was crowded and had lots of life, and access to other properties and entertainment on Fremont street (if you are in to that) is readily available.

What a waste of electronics; the visuals were unimaginative and mostly ads. Very low tech. We decided to head to the Strip to check it out. Expensive cab ride, way too many people, and throngs of chicks in mini dresses and high heels having bachelorette parties. I don't need to do that again. Our last day, we took the bus up and down the strip, which was a good way to figure out where things are. Restaurants in the Golden Nugget were good and not crazy expensive. Checking out, the experience was equally good -- friendly people at the desk, fast bellman service to come collect and hold our luggage, and fast service to pick it up again. We didn't use the pool; too crowded the first day and if you're not there early, you don't get a chair apparently, and the second day, bad weather closed it.

The beds were comfy and at the end of the day thats all you need the room for in Vegas (although at least 2 nights of the trip we ended up not going to bed, bloody Alice in Wonderland slot!) The hotel itself is in a great location. The pool looked amazing, we didnt use the area as you had to pay and we thought it was very expensive, especially considering the pool area is in the centre of the complex and only seemed to get the sun when it was directly overhead. We also felt a room/bar area with comfortable seating would be a bonus as sometimes we like to read the paper or a book and just chill for a while. A 5 minute walk up Freemont street to the bus stop, and the Deuce is still cheap enough, we got the 3 day ticket a couple of times, but mostly stayed on or around Freemont. On a previous visit we stayed at the Mardi Gras, off strip, and although it was a nice motel it was a pain getting back from the strip as the shuttle stopped at 11pm. Freemont street is fantastic and as we had seen the rest of the strip hotels in great detail on our previous trip we had a great time looking round \"old Vegas\" this trip. We also found the slots to be a lot looser, a tour guide explained this was because of the lower overheads for the casinos in this part of town. We ate at the hotel on the first night, but there are so many places around which are cheaper and as good, if not better. We ordered the chicken strips, expecting them to be strips of chicken, when they bought the plate the chicken \"strips\" turned out to be 4 chicken breasts! Would definitely recommend the Hotel California restaurant. The steak dinner deal was fab, and the best salad bar I've ever seen. 3 courses for $8. We also ate at the Fitz, there steak deal was also good, and the Gumbo was delicious. Got the bus to the outlet mall and got some great bargains. Didnt bother with the Grand Canyon trip again, but did go to the Hoover Dam which was brilliant. We also went to the Rat Pack show again, I would definitely recommend this to anyone, it was the 2nd best highlight of our holiday last time (after the helicopter flight and champagne lunch inside the Grand Canyon!) and the highlight of this trip. I would not advise the trip (done with Thomas Cook) to LA. The guide was not very helpful and at times very rude, we were dumped at the end of a road and told that the sidewalk stars were \"up there, meet me down there in half an hour\". Didnt have time to look at the chinese theatre, the group of us just wandered around trying to find it, then we all grouped together at the place the guide had pointed in the general direction of (no one dared be late as he had really humiliated the people who had arrived back 2 minutes late at the rest stop) 10 minutes at a place you could only just see the Hollywood sign from, and he dropped people off at the top of rodeo drive and told them he would pick them up in 10 minutes at the bottom. The best part of the trip was the Warner Bros tour (which he wasnt part of), still not worth the 5 hour journey there and the 8 hour journey back (traffic was insane) We probably won't be going back to Vegas, for a while at least anyway, as we feel we have seen everything there is to see at the moment. If, or when, we do go back we will definitely book at either the Golden Nugget or another Freemont Hotel.

The complete lack of customer service by the staff at check-in set a very poor tone for our stay. This impression was further reinforced when I purchased a drink at the bar by the sports book. The glass was dirty, with some unidentified whitish smear across the lip of the glass. I returned the drink and the bartender looked the the glass and said, \"It's just cream, it won't kill you.\" The one bright spot was our lesson in Texas-hold-em in the poker room.

The last trip was two years ago when we stayed in the Lakeview rooms at Bellagio. We were travelling with the same group who wanted to stay downtown this time. We knew ahead of time not to compare the two or we would be disappointed. The rooms and location at Bellagio were superior and as a package from Toronto with air was only about $100 difference. We did not book for the cost saving but rather for a different experience on a short three night stay. We stayed in the Rush Tower, rooms were nice, clean and modern with a view of the strip a long way in the distance, not much to look at really. Beds were extremely comfortable and the small sitting area was a nice touch. We did not have any noise keeping us awake from other rooms although we could hear when doors opened and closed in the hallways, not a big deal. Once you walked into the casino, the smell of smoke was strong although not as bad as some of the other hotels downtown that were really unbearable. For anyone with mobility issues, the hotel is quite compact compared to most on the strip and very easy to get around. It is definately the nicest downtown, the others I would not consider staying in. We ate at the Grotto for lunch, about half the price as the poolside restaurant at Bellagio and equally as good. Lilly's, the Asian restuarant was good. We ate at Vic and Anthony's also but found the steak not great for the price and reputation, (salmon was excellent), wine list very extensive although a bit overwhelming and pretencious. The pool was very crowded and finding chairs together in the afternoon would have been impossible so we booked the reserved chairs at the Hideway. It was nice to have our space but the newer hotels on the strip have much bigger pool areas and this would not have been necessary. When it beame windy, the empty lounge chairs blew around, some even landing in the pool. An earlier review complained about the pool closing for wind this but after seeing what happened to the chairs, I can understand it being a safety issue. As a non gambler, the attraction of Freemont Stret wore off quickly, same bands and street performers daily. Also, if you ventured off Freemont, there were many homeless people and boarded up buildings. We never felt threatened but not a great vacation spot. We did walk to the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (Pawn Stars). It was open but no one from the store was there, it is much smaller than we expected. We took the bus to the strip two days to wander through the hotels on the strip and rented a limo one evening for a private tour of the strip to go the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign and stop at the hotels for the free outside shows. ($140 total cost for 6 for over two hours- worth the price). For us, we would have been better staying on the strip and venturing downtown one day or evening as that was more than enough.

When my friend and I checked in their front desk service was phenomenal. What I really liked is how this new addition to the hotel is separated from the old hotel, so when you walk in from the nice valet area you are automatically greeted by the front desk staff. Their check in sit right in front of a beautiful restaurant with a massive fish tank right behind them. Above them is a gorgeous chandelier that covers just about the entire entrance way. Once I received the keys we were shown to the elevators that were only for the Rush Tower Suites. The room in one word, incredible. From the color schemes to the comfort of the california king size bed everything was perfect. The room had a very modern touch to it with a modern asian theme as well. The restrooms were all marble with a roman bad tub and square shower head. Their were i-pod radio's as well as a huge plasma t.v in the room. For paying the price that we did it was also great having a whole view of the famous Fremont Street. We had dinner at an Italian restaurant in the hotel called Grotto, which is located in the old Golden Nugget, but right next to their world famous \"Tank\" pool. The food and service were excellent and we felt right at home. I really liked Rush Tower and the time we spent there even if it was just that one night staycation to get away. The service was awesome and the rooms were better than most of the properties that I have stayed at on the actual strip along with the customer service.If there is one thing that I did not really enjoy I would have to say the walk from the Rush Tower to the Grotto restaurant.

Booked a Golden Tower room and it was unbelivable cheap, just around $750 for 10 days! We got to the hotel around 9 pm and check in was very fast and efficient which was a blessing after 28 hours of travel. GT elevators was close to front desk, pool and casinofloor. The room was very nice, spacious and clean with a big plasmascreen TV. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept in -ever! Bathroom had thick towels and bodylotion etc from the Spa. Free robes, ironingboard, safe and hairdryer. Room is NOT soundproof so when the alarmclock goes off in the next room you will hear it (as well as early morning drinkers who scream and shouts in the hallway). BTW, the alarmclock docks with iPod. Pool was very crowded even though it was mid april, lots of little kids running around. Be there early if you want one of the free chairs, on topfloor you can rent a chair (or cabana) for the day. Poolside service was a little bit understaffed but it is quick and easy to just visit the bar at groundfloor poolarea, you can buy snacks at the booth were they hand out the towels. Buff\u00e9 and Carson Street Caf\u00e9 was ok. Lots of things going on at Fremont Street every evening/night, there are three stages that play different kind of livemusic/DJ. One day it was \"movietime\" outside the hotel when they filmed a sequence of \"Lay the favourite\" with Bruce Willis, it was fun to watch. It is easy and quick to get to The Strip with the bus just around the corner. You can buy a 24 hour pass for $7. Take the Express Bus if you are going to the Bellagio/Flamingo area, the \"normal\" bus stops at every corner and takes forever at rush hour. Coffeemachine in the room cost $10 for 4 capsules/cups but the hotel is very close to Krispy Kreme were they serve good coffee and they also have free WiFi. Signed up for 24 karat clubcard (free) and got $5 to play for. To sum up: We had a fantastic stay and I didn't miss The Strip as much as I thought I would. Frontdesk, maids, doormen and dealers were very friendly. Downtown you can get from casino to casino in just a few minutes. So, if you want a more posh stay you may be happier at a Strip-hotel but if you want cheap drinks, lots of different music and a great mix of people - you'll like downtown.

The GN is great value - you'll easily pay double for the same room on the strip. The new Rush tower gives you some glitzier accommodation, if that's what you're looking for. If not, stay in the Carlton tower. Who spends time in their room in Vegas? You should also note that GN does NOT charge the \"resort fees\" that are springing up all over Vegas - $10 or so added to your bill for \"your convenience\" for using the pool or high speed internet. The only thing that shocked me was the $10 fee for a Sun Bed by the pool - and they are pretty well packed in with little shade, so load up on the sun screen. At least you have the choice of spening the $10 or not! The buffet is good for breakfast weekdays - with little or no queues. It's better value that the coffee shop for the same meal - and you can get eggs cooked to order in front of you. Coffee is best bought and the two on-site Starbucks outlets. A small stroll will take you to Main Street Station - great brewpub for food and beer and a good buffet. The bus to the strip is easy - it picks up either end of Freemont Street. There's a map at check-in. $7 will get you a 24hr pass, which you need to buy before you board at the ticket machine, cards + cash, but no change. If you can, take the express which (unsurprisingly) is faster. Use that to get to the strip and walk betweent the stops. The other bus, the deuce, is double decked, but busier and makes more stops. If you're flight arrives at a convenient time, and you have little luggage, you can really save $ by splashing out $3 on an express bus from the airport almost directly to the hotel.

Small pool deck/area compared to other hotels, and the sun can often be blocked during the day--you have to chase the sunlight, but it is generally too crowded to find another seat once yours goes in the shade. The music they played at the pool was awful. It faded in and out, played Christian rock and slow indie music--it was a bad adult contempo channel with an identity crisis.

Would I have to walk for miles to get to my room? Would I be able to find a chair by the pool? Would they hassle me if I brought down a beer from my room like they do at the strip hotels?

It wasn't terrible, but it was in no way a 4-star hotel room. I'd say three stars would be pretty generous. The carpet was faded, the furniture was worn and dirty. The ice machine on my floor was broken. it had a big flat-screen TV, but so what? The bathroom was decent, pretty standard-issue mid-range hotel with a little granite thrown in.

I cant testify to the other room types; however, the lobby and pool were amazing. The casino was okay (seemed a little quiet). Conclusion If you are trying to experience Fremont, which is the older part of las vegas, I would def say go for the Golden Nugget. Fremont is a little bit slower than the main strip, and there are plenty of other hotels and little shops to entertain yourself. It seems to be a better spot for families because the street itself is closed off. If you are a first time visitor to Vegas and want to do it super big and get the full crazy hangover vegas experience--than you might want to stay on the strip or get a taxi/bus ride from the Golden Nugget.

We, however, were given a room in the original \"Carson Tower\". It's dated, but clean. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed and a nice, flat panel tv. Due to an unusually warm 1st week of May (at least, we won there!), we used the a/c. It worked very well. but, being an older unit, it was a little noisy. Very little external noise. Our room faced the Northwest and gave us a view of a parkade and the side of the old Plaza Hotel. If that's important to you, don't get that side. Bathroom was ok. Standard fixtures. All dated, but in good working order. Lots of hot water. No fridge or coffee maker. What's up with that...Vegas? You can get those in any \"Motel 6\", anywhere else in the world! (it needs to be said!) Our wifi was free, but a little slow. I tend to be suspicious about many of the unexpected \"fees\". The Golden Nugget, for us, was better than a lot of area hotels, in that respect. The pool was crowded but quite nice, regardless. Loved the Shark Tank adjacent to it. The waterslide, taking the rider through the tank, is a nice touch! Enjoyed a buffet lunch. Not a huge selection, but enough good stuff so as to walk away satisfied. Also, had a late dinner at the caf\u00e9. It was really quite good. Freemont Street is a ball! The overhead, 5 city block video show is a must-see on any Vegas trip.

I've already seen the mega resorts on the strip and they are ok to walk through but I can't justify paying for them. Non-weekend rates at the Golden Nugget are a great bargain and as Captain Kirk says: \"you get 4-star rooms at 2-star prices.\" I ate breakfast in the hotel's buffet every morning and it was unremarkable but adequate. One evening I had dinner at the hotel's steakhouse and it was indeed remarkable albeit rather pricy but I didn't travel that far to eat from a paper bag. The casino is good and the odds are better than on the strip (see above: paying for the mega resorts) and the Deuce Bus is a nearby bargain if one still wants to visit the strip for dinner, a show or to see its glitz. I'll likely rent a car next time as taxi fare one way from the airport is a full day's full-size rental. I haven't heard of and didn't experience any of the scams or petty crime I've experienced on the strip and am reading about here more and more each week.

We got to check in early with no problems. We stayed the first four nights at NYNY on the strip and then moved to the GN for three nights. Our room was right off the elevator (which we requested). We stayed in a \"GOLD TOWER DELUXE\" room (I think it was the second cheapest room). It was a lovely room. The bed was AMAZING; like sleeping on a cloud. Amazing Serta matress. AMAZING. Not having internet included is a bit annoying. But there are NO resort fees at this hotel, so it's a trade off. We paid for the internet for one day (24 hrs) which was fine. We ate at Grotto twice (LOVE IT) for lunch. - Even got to \"make my own pasta\" b/c I wanted a Carbonara which wasn't on the menu at lunch, and it was awesome. We also ate at the Buffet once b/c we got it free with tickets to the \"Country Tribute\" show - the buffet wasn't great and we certainly would never pay full price for it with such other great options in the hotel (like Grotto). We ate one (EXPENSIVE!!!) dinner at Vic and Anthony's which was also great. The ceasar salad was fabulous; full of cheese. And the potatoes au gratin were also super yummy. The steak was good too. Mushrooms, not so great. Overall, the meal was a bit pricey for me but it was good. We also ate one meal at Carson Street Cafe and were not impressed with it (the ceasar salad here was NOT good). Ate a few goodies from The Chocolate Box too. Overpriced but certainly yummy. I loved the chocolate macaroons best, try them if you like that kind of thing! Spent lots of time in the poker room; which was fun. Played several tournaments (they have tonnes running everyday) and my boyfriend played the cash games. Enjoyed our time there. Played a few tables games but didn't fair too well. Had fun winning and losing ont the \"sex and the city\" slot machines. Fun bonus games. And I sure raked up the 'comp points\" (or whatever they're called) by betting $2 a pull on those machines! Servers serving drinks come by frequent here (esp if you're playing near the bar areas) and tipping a $1 is always a good idea. Tipping the dealers helps too! What's a dollar here or there (or more if you actually win something?) when you're in Vegas?!?! Tipping goes along way sometimes.... We went to the Country Tribute show which we both enjoyed. I actually HATE country music (my boyfriend likes it) but I enjoyed the show too; live music. \"BIg and Rich\" were really enjoyable. It was a fun show and nice that it was right in the GN so we didn't have to go anywhere. We took a cab ride one morning to the \"Pawn Stars\" pawn shop from GN. It only cost about $10 one way to get there. It was cool to see the store that is shown in the tv show. None of the \"guys\" from the show were in the store when we were there but it was fun to see the place. Being close to Freemont Street is a HUGE bonus at GN. It's a whole different world when you step outside the Golden Nugget. Kinda shady in parts, the people are \"different\" but certainly it's a different side of Vegas and very enjoyable. Hotel pool is great! We did swim for a little while (it was quite windy the day we swam so cold) and went down the slide once (it was fast and scary for me!). The pool area is really crowded and small. But it's a great pool and very fun watching the sharks and fish swim while you swim. SO neat. There are cabanas you can rent on upper levels of the pool area. If you like the pool scene this might be fun. I think the cabanas even have TVs in them. They looked interesting but that wasn't our scene. Our comps at GN were great. ALL of our rooms were comped (3 nights) and our Country Tribute show ticket/buffet combo thing we got; all comped. VERY impressed with the comps! We had been impressed with our comps at NYNY but were extra impressed by the comps at GN.

This type of room does NOT come with refridgerator or microwave. This is an older hoell that has been updated with a new tower and an awesome pool. The only reason that we did NOT give the Golden Nugget a five star rating is the smoke. The smell of smoke is overpowering, even on the non-smoking rooms/floors. I guess this is true of any hotel in Las Vegas, but it seem particularly stong at the Golden Nugget, including the room, lobby, check-in area and pool area. Also, the hotel is an excellent value, but it is a bit removed from the strip, and everything around us is old and a little run-down looking. The rooms only offer CNN and Fox news, no MSNBC. This was a little bit of a downer for me, but not a deal breaker. Internet service is $12.99 per day, which is pretty steep. The hotel will give you coupons good for various services around the hotel, including a buy-1-get-1 buffet ticket, which was excellent. Freemont street was excellent, great entertainment in a family friendly envirionment. Request a room on a higher floor so that you do not have to hear the music from Freemont street if you like to go to bed early. Red sushi bar was overpriced and not worth the money. The Grotto was excellent, if you eat here, request a table near the pool; price is moderate, around $25 per plate. Room came with two bath robes, which was really nice, and the housekeeping staff was great. Pool was awesome; shartk tank is very cool and the water slide that goes through the shark tank is very cool. Overall, a very good experience at a great price. Remember, this hotel is NOT on the strip, and that is why the price is so affordable (we stayed in a delux room for $39/night). Save yourself some $$$ by stayingat this hotel off the strip: You can self park for free at the Golden Nugget and drive yourself to the strip and park at any hotel for free and enjoy the same experience as those paying for pricier rooms on the strip. The disapointments (smoke, no MSNBC, loud Freemont street,removed from the strip) are outweighed by the value and exceptional accomodations.

It was at the Flamingo, and that's where he stayed while attending (found it to be only okay, the hallways there were filthy dirty tho and we saw beer and used condoms lying around, no lie!)...Anyway, I flew down when it was over and we moved to the Golden Nugget. This was our second stay. Loved it even better than the first stay 2 years ago. Golden Nugget is in the older part of town, Fremont Disrict, which to me is much more relaxed and fun than the strip is. Older, yes, but just way easier and less stressful and tiring. The GN is a very clean, good sized hotel/casino with plenty to do and see, plenty of restaurants to eat at. (both the Carson St diner and Grotto were good, and Chart House is VERY good, though a bit pricier) Anyways, staying in the Fremont area is just so much nicer. We love being able to walk to a different casino in a matter of only a minute, as opposed to the strip where it can take you 20 minutes in some cases!...The strip is also so crowded and so many more obnoxious folks and partiers than we like to be around. You also have to deal with all the vehicle traffic and the crowds backing up at the crosswalks. It can be fun, and there is lots to do, but I just find it more stressful and tiring rather than 'fun'. I have stayed at many of the strip hotels...(Mirage (my favorite), MGM, Ballys, Flamingo...) but I don't think I would ever stay anywhere else other than Nugget now. It's just SO much cheaper and just as nice, if not nicer than many of the strip hotels. We had a super cheap rental vehicle (16 bucks a day at Fox rent-a-car) so getting to the strip the few times we wanted to go was no big deal. We stayed in the Gold Tower this time around. For only a few dollars more than the regular Carson Tower rooms, we got a gorgeous comfortable room, with soft clean sheets, excellent mattresses and a nice flat screen TV. Air conditioning was terrific, the room was simply immaculate. Would be nice if there was a tiny bit more water pressure, but that is really all that I could think that would improve the comfort. Great toiletries supplied, light bathrobes, iron/ironing board, safe for your valuables...Carpets were clean...Very very comfortable place to stay. We did order room service one night also. Husband had a cheeseburger and he said it was quite good and the service was lightning FAST! Typical expensive prices as you would expect, but no worse than anyplace else. We aren't big gamblers, so we didn't spend a lot of time in the casino itself, only a few slots here and there, but it is easy enough to find your way around. Check in took awhile, a very long line, and seemed to be a very slow process for many, but once it was your turn they were pleasant and efficient enough. The pool here is rather cool....A slide from the upper floor goes down through a shark tank. The main pool area however is horrible in that it is so CROWDED! and so NOISY!...Ugh...The lounges are packed in like sardines, the place is overrun with children, it's just not that enjoyable if lying out in the sun is your thing. Our last visit however, we did rent a private cabana on the upper floors with some friends, and THAT is the way to go if your budget allows. (believe it was $250 for the day?) SO much quieter, you have plenty of space, nice cooling tent, refridgerator/lounge/tv, beverage service...just great, loved it. Very peaceful and relaxing. This visit I had reserved two pool chairs at the private upstairs pool (16 and over allowed) but never used them. When I had tried to cancel the reservation of the chairs the day before I was told that it was not 'allowed'. What?....Only 20 bucks lost so whatever, not a huge deal to me, just thought that wouldn't have been a problem to cancel in a big hotel/casino. Oh, and parking is very easy and is FREE with your room card, never a problem finding a spot which is nice. In closing, you just cannot beat the comfort/price and cleanliness of the Golden Nugget. It is THE nicest place to stay and play in the Fremont District by far, and it is actually way nicer than several of the strip hotels, honestly. Don't be afraid to give it a try.

Except for our maid, we found that most of the staff didn't make any effort to be friendly, welcoming, or helpful, but were content to be cool and impersonal.

When I went back and 4 am. the desk clerk then told me the system was down at that time each morning for auditing, and that they would have to mail my bill. The pool was very pretty and the lounges comfy, but it was always crowded so finding a lounge was at times impossible. The fact that the pool was small didn't bother us. Nothing it seems went with the room! $1 ea. for local phone calls, fee for using the exercise room and on it went. We didn't received a coupon book when we checked in which is very unusual for a gambling town. After talking to a person who was staying ONE night at the Nugget in a more expensive tower and found he got a coupon book with some discounts, I stopped at the desk and asked why he got one for staying one night and we stayed 10 nights and got nothing. The desk clerk gave me the book. We stayed in the Carson tower and our window faced a wall which made it feel very dark & dingy in the room (3rd floor). Lighting in the room was very poor, even after we took the shades off the lamps. Bathroom was ok, good shower. Carpet needed steaming; other than that the room was clean.

This year I took my family. My wifes best friend and family live in LV and we thought a good spring break time would be had by all. We stayed in the rush tower. When I made reservations, through my casino host, he did not think the rush tower had any connecting rooms, which is what I expected. I wanted the rush tower so I planned on 1 adult and 2 kids in each room. We arrived at midnight on monday the 18th and got to the rooms and what do you know they were connecting rooms. We turned 2 rooms into our little own 2 bedroom suite. We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel rooms except for sleeping and changing. We stayed 5 nights and had a great time. We did everthing from the pool to the freemont street experience and spent 4 days off property. If you are taking a family to Las Vegas I suggest you google \"Las Vegas Power Pass\" If you find enough things that look entertaining buy it, You will save money. We were going to buy it online but my wife wanted to see what her friend wanted to do so we didn't. We ended up buying a 2 day pass for 2 adults and 4 kids. Total with Taxes and Fees was just over $500. We added up what we would have spent and it totaled over $800. You can do everything on the list once per day. If you buy the power pass online you get a voucher that you must redeem at the planet hollywood restaurant in Caesars Palace for your actual Power Pass Card. We started the power pass for breakfast at PH. $10.00 off per person with the pass. Breakfast netted $18.00 for 6 of us. PH restaurant adds the tip for parties of 6 or more. I was told this by our server the first morning and I told her she would make out better if she did not add the tip to the check. She did not and she was rewarded. The next night on our way back from the Grand Canyon we chose to stop there again for dinner and this time our waiter did not mention about the tip and we got our $60 off and I let him keep his 18%. His loss and my gain. I absolutely love the Golden Nugget. 4 trips now and every employee, bellman, waiters( either cafe, buffet or Vic and Anthonys are great) valets, front desk personel, cocktail servers, especially dealers and casino personel were a pleasure to deal with. If my family needed anything we asked and we got. I had one small issue. We ate at the pool saturday for lunch and my kids asked for more ketchup with their lunches and the server never got it. My kids survived. Pool was jammed as always. You have to be at the pool at 8:30 if you want a lounge chair. Keeping in mind the pool does not open until 10 AM. Downtown has what you need unless you want exercise. Then go walk the strip and be hounded by everyone handing out passes for every strip club in town. That might have worked for me 20 years ago so maybe there is a place for it. I know a lot of people like the mega resorts and that is great. I like the comfort and convienence of the Golden Nugget and the downtown area. Take the bus to the strip. 24 hour pass is $7.00. I would definitely reccommend the GN to all.

They do not block the sun and at about 6:30am there was a lot of light streaming through the window. We didn't party that much in Vegas but being awoken that early was a huge nuisance. Also the bathroom is oddly designed. The shower hardware is on the opposite side from the door and turning on the water before entering requires quite a lean over the edge. The closet is also behind the bathroom door. The room was clean and it was nice to have free water everyday and a few snacks near the elevator. This is about all you get for your \"VIP\" experience.

One of my issues with Vegas over the years are the huge crowds and the difficulty of simply walking to a new casino. Well this isn't a downtown. The table limits were much more reasonable. It didn't take 30 minutes to find an exit to try your luck across the street. The crowds were not as massive. It was simply a much more laid back atmosphere which we all enjoyed. Keep in mind we didn't really care about shows or fancy dining or going to a club. Our trip was all about watching football, having some drinks, gambling and having a good time. And a good time we did have. As for the hotel the rooms were very large and very clean. We had 5 guys in 2 rooms and we were never cramped. The dealers were very friendly and the drink girls quick on the draw.

This being our first time to Las Vegas and going in with high expectations we were a little worried of what we would find staying \"off strip\". I can honestly tell you we were pleasantly suprised. Neither my husband nor myself gamble or drink so we really weren't sure if we would be bored with a week's stay. All though our check-in was a little bit confusing (mostly our own fault) once we got to where we were supposed to go, all went very smoothly and the check-in staff were friendly and quick. Be sure to get your coupon book from the front desk. The room we were assigned was ready and waiting for us. Nothing spectacular but definitely comfortable. We were pleased to get a room with a view of the mountains. The family we traveled with and who paid for the VIP service were given a room with a view of the corner of another hotel and a wall. During our unpacking we noticed that the previous occupants had locked the save and we were unable to access it. A quick call to the front desk and less than 15 minutes later we had someone there to unlock it for us (our only issue with the room). Room service was done early so we could go for breakfast knowing that when we returned all would be done. The hotel itself is very well maintained with mostly friendly staff available to assist. A couple of the women in the small gift shop were rather rude and non-helpful. Almost as if you were imposing on their day. Tho we didn't gamble (other than a couple of spins on the slot machines) or drink...others that were seemed to be enjoying themselves. Food was always good (we ate at the Carson Street Cafe, the buffet (2 for 1 on weekdays) and the Grille. It was a little pricey but you could always go to other hotels for cheaper meals - especially if you took the bus to the Strip - which we found out almost too late. The Freemont Street Experience is well worth the time. There is always something going on even thru the day and the evenings were great for entertainment and people watching. Lots of security and police around so walking up and down the street you felt completely safe and there were always places open to pop into if needed. We were warned by many not to travel off Freemont in the evenings so we didn't. Buses to take you all over Vegas were cheap (seven dollars for a 24 hour pass) and easy to use. We did three trips to the strip to wander the bigger hotels and catch several of the free shows. Very crowded on the weekends. Beware of ALL the people on the sidewalks handing out discount coupons. Without looking at them our one travel mate grabbed every one offered him and when eh (and his wife) returned to the hotel, he discovered he had over fifty cards for escort services, three somes and other various \"women\" offers. Quite comical. Our ONLY complaint with the hotel was the \"pending\" credit card charge they put on your card upon arrival. This \"pending\" charge can sty on your card for up to thirty days and can be as much as four hundred dollars (even if you have paid in full for your stay). My suggestion (and we will do for all future hotels) is to have the extra cash available for this and then you can get it back at the end of your stay without having to wait the thirty days for it to be reversed on your card. If we were to return to Vegas we would definitely stay at the Golden Nugget again but maybe split the vacation up so we could spend a couple nights at one of the larger hotels on the strip.

Smoky? A little bit? Tacky... compared to Aria, yes. Compared to other hotels in old Vegas, nope. I personally thought it had a lot of character. They really keep it up to date and are always cleaning the elevator chrome and carpets (etc). We stayed in the older Carson tower. We were on the 22nd floor (top) and while we didn't have a great view the room was really big sporting two double beds and a nice big 42in tv. No complaints on the room except the counter top in the bathroom is pretty high so if you are short it doesn't work out that well... also despite the granite and housekeeping I still felt kind of dirty in it. I'm picky.... but generally it was clean. The showers are a bit old. I did the bed bug and gross checks behind the bed and in between the pillow top and did not see any signs of bed bugs, eggs, hair (etc). I know it's nasty but I'm not sleeping anywhere that I'm going to get that stuff.... In fact, the mattress was so new it still had the warranty tag on it. The bed was really nice and the quality of sheets and betting was decent. Very soft and smooth. Local calls are $1. No fridge in the room. The casino is ok but nothing spectacular. I lost $$$ with my bad luck on video blackjack. Everytime I hit on 15 I bust or the machine beats me... go figure. The pool area is cool, though. Despite having to pay a ripoff $20 for a beach chair (and $20 to access the gym per day), the pool is cool and the water slide that goes through the shark tank is neat. Be sure to check out the gold vending machine and the world's largest displayed gold nugget. Not 'blow your socks off' but cool to see for free. The area is cool/tacky/fun/stupid/cheap... the crowd down in old vegas are mainly older people in their 40s and 50s who are there to drink and party. Not my thing.... but the souveneir shops there are super cheap and beer/liquor on Freemont is really cheap as well. They also have free live shows and bands playing... personally I think I'd rather spend time on the strip (a short drive down Las Vegas Blvd through the abandoned crackhead area) than Freemont. Make sure you pull into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop (as seen on Pawn Stars) on your left right before Stratosphere if you are a fan of the show. Say hi to Chumlee for me.

We usually stay at the Golddn Nugget when we go to Vegas at least once a year. We have always loved the Golden Nugget and have never had a problem up until this stay. We booked 2 nights in the new Rush Tower at over $100/night. (at least $40 /night more than the regular rooms that we usually stay in). The room itself was nice and updated. We went to bed and slept through the night on a nice soft comfortable bed. About 6 A.M. the first morning we were awaken by a large THUD and the sound of water running, we could hear the shower in the next room as if it was running into our bed. We were kept up for about a half hour as the people in the next room took showers. We called down to the front desk and were spoken to by a RUDE female who really didnt want to be bothered by the issue. A short time later we were contacted by a women who said she was the hotel engineer and spoke to us about the issue, this after we had falled back alseep. The woman assured us that somebody would be up shortly to speak to us about the problem and try to see if they could get into the next room to check out the loud shower issue. We stayed in our room until after 10 A.M., and got no call back from the woman and nobody responded to our room. As we went downstairs to start our day we stopped at the front desk. We spoke to the male at the front desk about the issue. He told us that he would have somebody check into the issue and would let us know if there was anyting they could do, or if they could switch our room. After a short time out we stopped back by the front desk, the male was no longer there and nobody knew what we were talking about. Nobody ever advised us of a check up and no offer was ever made to switch our room after that. Again the next morning, same THUD and same water issue, again we were awake at 6 A.M.. Upon checking out the woman at the front desk asked us about our stay, we told her this entire story, her response was....\"Oh I am sorry to hear that, do you want a copy of your bill\". This was the WORST stay we have ever had in Las Vegas in over 15 years of going there. We are going to be contacting the Golden Nugget management about the issue to see if we can get a response from them. My advise to you, dont waste your money on the Rush Tower, we have never had an issue with the older rooms for almost half the price. We will probably go back to the Golden Nugget, just not the Rush Tower.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cWhat's not to love?\u201d", "Author": "MarkDC-Travel", "ReviewID": "UR94143373", "Content": "Stayed in room 8214 on December 17 & 18, 2010. I travel to Vegas several times a year and like to put in a couple days stay downtown when I can. I stayed in a regular room in the Rush Tower last time so I stayed in the Jr Corner Suite this time. I also had the VIP check-in which would have been of great help if I had arrived during a busy time. My flight was delayed so I arrived late (after 9PM) and there were no real lines to speak of. Check-in (and check-out two days later) was friendly and quick. I was in my room in just minutes. (see pictures) The room was of good size and quite comfortable with a sofa to sit and watch TV as well as a separate sitting area for reading or chatting. There were actually two flat panel televisions, one to be watched from the sofa and the other while you are in bed. Hey, it's a Jr Suite, why not two TVs in the same room? The internet connection ($12.99 extra) worked without problems but did seem to be a bit slower than what I'm used to, but most will not see a difference. Having stayed in the regular Rush Tower room on my last visit, I probably would opt for the regular room again since it was a large enough room for me. The only thing the room needed, but did not have, was a refrigerator. Suites usually have a wet bar or at least a fridge. This was my sole disappointment. If I wanted one badly enough, I could have had one sent up, but for such a short stay, it really was not worth the effort of the phone call, never mind the additional cost. The weather was bad during this trip with record breaking rain and flooding. It created a gloomy atmosphere which is rare in Las Vegas. Fatigue caused me to fall asleep once I was unpacked, so no dinner the first night. Breakfast in the Carson Street Cafe was fine. Food was very good and the service was terrific (my coffee cup was never empty). Also, had a Ruben for lunch at The Grille. It wasn't great, nor bad, just OK which is OK. The Grille is very informal and usually you would get something to go rather than eat it there. I stopped at the Chocolate Box and picked up mint chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn. OMG, it was great. Munched on this stuff over the next few days. Unfortunately, I was not very hungry later that night, so I skipped dinner. Last trip to the Golden Nugget, I eat at Red Sushi for dinner twice. It was terrific. There is also a Starbucks or two here. I do love the gingerbread latte they have at Christmas time. Bonus mood points for those! The cost of laundry here is a bit cheaper than the strip, so if you transfer to a hotel on the strip and you have laundry, save a couple of bucks and get it done here. The casino is as good as any on the strip and nicer (cleaner) than the ones here downtown. For blackjack, be careful of the 6:5 game. You will have no trouble finding the 3:2 tables, just check before playing. I found each dealer and pit boss friendly and engaging. This is important especially if you run into a bit of bad luck. The slots are the same as you would find everywhere else. The Fremont Street Experience is always a trip a night. Live bands, costumed characters, local artisans, and just a lot of excited people, not to mention the new \"Zipline ride\" above your head. It being December, I only went to the shark pool, or \"the tank\" as they call it to take pictures rather than to swim. Imagine going down a water slide that takes you through a huge tank filled with sharks! And you get to see it all as you go along. I heard this was one of the top 10 pools of note in the world because of this feature. I believe it. As usual, I had a great time at the Golden Nugget and am returning March 30 and 31. This time I will be in a Gold Club Room @ the facebook rate which includes the internet. I really have grown to love the GN and the Downtown area and try to build some time into each trip for them.

Freemont Street consists of several covered pedestrian area blocks, with a ceiling of lights. You step out of the Nugget Casino doors, and you are right in the mix...convenience stores, 5 other casinos, and a great variety of eateries, all with great prices you WILL NOT find on the Strip. The room we had at the hotel was great, with the only draw backs being a semi-noisy AC unit (but after roaming around all day, it didn't matter!), and the fact that there is no coffee makers in the rooms, but 2 starbucks on the first floor. We stayed on the 18th floor which is non-smoking, and you cannot hear the faintest noise from downtown. The room was cleaned very well all three days of our trip. The one thing to beware (other then all the gaming) is being waylaid by the hawkers of the GRANDVIEW RESORT. As you walk in any of the doors (except the main hotel entrance) what appears to be a friendly personal greeter infront of a consierge desk is a trap. If someone approaches you and says \"Hi!

Couldn't decide between the Gold Tower Club rooms and Rush Tower. Decided to go with the more expensive Club rooms because it included wifi and access to the spa. The room was a decent size, big plasma screen tv, comfy bed but there were also some major design flaws. First, the closet is in the bathroom. I was alone, so that wasn't a big deal but if I'd been traveling with someone else I'd have found it really inconvenient. Second the tub is enclosed and half sealed with glass. The half that opens, swings out. Because of where the water temperature gauge and spigot is placed you can't turn on or regulate the water temperature unless you're already in the tub. If you're a person with a disability or a senior these bathrooms are a law suit waiting to happen. How the hotel could've allowed the design is beyond me. No risk management folks? Third flaw are the window treatments. Despite what the picture shows on the website (roman shades) there are only poor fitted venetian blinds. This becomes a particular problem if you're in an east facing room. At 6:30 am, you're awake. This is Vegas. Who wants to wake up at 6:30??? I was put in room 1608 (east facing). When I was awoken the first morning I called the front desk. No one answered. After being on hold for 15 minutes I gave up and dialed an assistant manager. A woman answered and told me she could move me to 1614. I told her 1614 was just a few doors down and faced east also. She told me not to worry because there were drapes in that room. A guy came up with a new key card. Before packing I decided to check the new room. She was wrong, no drapes there either. Just blinds and plenty of light. I asked to be switched to a Rush Tower room. She claimed they were sold out (I later found out that was not true) Then they sent up a maintenance guy. He suggested I take the cushions from the sofa and stuff them in the window when I went to sleep at night. Huh? That's the solution? These people are in the hospitality business? I called back down to the assistant manager's number. Someone else answered this time. I explained all that happened. He was very nice, apologized and switched me to a room on the 17th floor facing a different direction. Having been out until 3 am, all of this was a little much on four hours of sleep. The third room wasn't perfect but at least darker then the first two. Stay away from rooms without drapes! Spa workout room was adequate but nothing fantastic. Wifi did not work well all weekend. The pool was nice, heated and since it was winter not at all crowded. Selection of restaurants was fine. Had dinner at Charthouse one night and really enjoyed it. Great service. My table was right next to their beautiful huge aquarium; very cool. If you don't want a big breakfast there's a Starbucks. I also ate at their coffee shop a couple of times (Cason Cafe?) and it was decent and fairly priced. Hotel service was hit and miss. Some were terrific and professional , others were poorly trained knuckle heads. Valet was easy and courteous. Staying downtown is fun. Everything is within an easy walk.

I explained to him that there was no letter and this is the second room issue we have had. he kinda chuckled and said \" well i guess it is luck of the draw\". so i asked to speak with a manager. explained to him that i have traveled a fair amount and have never had to change rooms. let alone twice in two days. then to be told \" luck of the draw\" ...i was not happy. he repeatedly apologized and said he would move us to a suite. i was thinking he meant their parlor suites, but after the bell hop told us to go up stairs and he would meet us at the bedroom door to drop off our luggage i knew something was up. in the end i was very happy with the stay,and the suits are great. if we ever do a group travel thing again we will check out a suite. it was great to meet in, have a drink or two, then go out. we ended up staying at the pool mostly. they had a hot tub that was out doors and very relaxing next to a fire pit. we were allowed to bring our own drinks as long as they were not in a glass container. even though we brought an entire box of beer down the staff was great. a employee came up and asked us if the case of beer was almost empty, and we said no. he proceeded to explain that the hotel doesn't mind of guests bring a \"couple\" of drinks to the pool area but they don't like excessive amounts, so if the box was \"almost empty\" he could just walk away. so we told him yes it was almost empty (even though you can see it was more than half full) and they left us alone. until we ran out. but have no fear: there was a bar no more than 50 feet way. i hope this review helps. the hotel isn't the swankiest in Vegas but loved it.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "shellybelly22", "ReviewID": "UR92906419", "Content": "Lovely bright check in area,staff very helpful and friendly.

Pulled up to the valet and was greeted by some courteous guys. Got in the hotel, looked at the desk of the Rush Towers and it instructed us to the main desk... so we had to grunt all our luggage across the hotel floor. Once we got there, there were an easy 15 people ahead of us, and 2 people working the desk. We waited in line for half an hour, not so much because of bad employees but idiot customers that hadn't booked in advance or were whining about something else. We got to our room and were more than please. Very spacious, two flat screen televisions, couch, huge bathroom for a hotel. The view... meh. There was a lot of imagination to be pleased with the view, but who cares. The gambling in the hotel casino was much better than the other places we had visited. It was a bit smokey but... it's a casino. We ate at the Grotto, Carson Street Cafe, and the Buffet. The Grotto had amazing authentic Italian Cuisine, brilliant desserts, and an awesome staff. Absolutely no complaints all three times we ate there. Carson Street Cafe gave out massive portions, had very reasonable prices, and was really the type of food we were looking for after three days in Vegas. We eventually got tired of the glitzy dining, and just wanted a down to earth meal, the Cafe definitely hit the spot. Only complaint I would have is the wait was a little bit long, but beings I grew up in the Restaurant Industry I can understand that sometimes it takes a while to make a good meal. The Buffet... ehh.. it had a lot to be desired. It was quite costly, had a lot of food but nothing that really meshed. Seemed like whatever they had sitting around went out on the pans. We went there once... that was too many times. I love the location of the hotel, it's away from all the hustle and bustle, and perfect if you have a rental car. The only complaint I would have is that the pool was freezing. Not only that but because of the wind the pool was only open 2 days out of the entire week we were there. Fair enough - you can't control the weather. However, the upper deck pool that was meant for adults only, was also closed even when the weather was fine. Why? Because there weren't enough patrons entering to keep it open. I didn't realize you needed a lot of patrons to keep a pool open that already has the chlorine and water in it anyway.

Firstly, we arrived quite late, about 9pm, and there was not a queue for check-in as some people had mentioned on here. The staff there were polite and courteous, and everything was done swiftly. We were given a room on the 18th floor of the Carson Tower, and pointed in the direction of the lifts. There were six lifts serving the upper floors of the tower, so you never had to wait long to get one. The lift was quick, and we soon found ourselves at our room. My first surprise on opening the door was the size of the room; it was huge compared to plenty of five star hotels I have stayed. It didn\u2019t have air conditioning, but each room has a cooling setting on the heater under the window, and believe me, it blew the iciest air ever and was a welcome relief from the heat. Plus, I usually have trouble working the air con systems so this was a welcome change. The room also had a large built-in wardrobe and a large chest of drawers (about 6 spacious drawers) upon which the huge widescreen tv was sat. This was a bonus as, having travelled from the UK, we had a LOT of clothes to store for our stay. The bathroom was spacious and the shower, no matter which time of the day or night you used it, was hot and powerful. The hotel itself was pleasant and I always felt safe no matter what time I was walking around. There is a pleasant shop by the lifts at the Carson Tower which sells sandwiches, newspapers, etc. and also a Starbucks next to that. Perfect to take back to your room for an afternoon of lounging before heading out at night! During my stay, I used a few of the hotels eateries with mixed opinions. The Carson Street Cafe really wasn't great at all, and I found the service a little disappointing. The breakfast buffet upstairs (off the casino floor) was a great find, but could get expensive as it was $10 each every morning. In the end, we used to end up in Binions across the street as they did a lighter breakfast so you could just pay for what you had. I'm not a \"pile the plate high\" girl! The Italian restaurant, Grotto, inside the Golden Nugget is amazing. I had a lovely salad there, and the ambience was great - good prices too. I never used the pool whilst I was there, sadly. The first few days when the weather was good enough to use the pool, we went sightseeing. After that, the weather went a bit crazy. It did look amazing though, and the shark tank is awesome! So, on to the location. At the start of the week, we took the Ace Gold Bus to the strip from outside the hotel. This was SO convenient, so don't be put off this hotel just because it's not on the strip. That is a good thing, the strip can get a little bit too crazy. The bus takes about half an hour to get to the strip, but you forget time as you go past all the hotels (Stratosphere, Sahara, Hilton - the hotels between Fremont and the strip) and you even end up hopping off to see them! Later in the week, they moved the bus stop to the next road down. I don't know why they did this, but there was someone on hand to direct you to the new stop (which was like 100m away - pointless!). I found Fremont Street to be EXTREMELY safe and fun. I often walked back up at 4am in the morning and there were always plenty of security guards outside the casinos, and I never saw any trouble. I will definitely be staying at the Golden Nugget the next time I return to Las Vegas. Staying on the strip may seem like a good idea, but other than the hotels/casinos, there isn't a great deal to see or do there and it can get hectic.

Our room was really cool, with modern, hip, chocolate brown furniture and a great pair of wooden sliding doors that separated the bathroom from the living areas. There was a big jacuzzi tub which we loved and a separate room for the toilet. It is really a cool, hip room. The pool is always great although it can be crowded. I didn't bother with the shark slide this time as it seemed like a long wait. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel changed ownership since our last visit and I don't think it is as good as the previous one. Also, Starbucks in the hotel won't take your gift card.

I booked a web winter special for the rush tower at $75 wich is a great price for these lovely rooms. upon check-in I was told I did not have a reservation, I told the lady there must be a mistake I booked online Sunday and the website went to the completion page. she asked me if I had checked with my bank to see if a charge went through? I said why would I do that, I always book online and don't have any problems. so she said she would call upstairs. She got a code from whoever was on the phone upstairs and Walah, there I was in the computer billing info address and all. so she said it never went through I will put it through for you now. Ok great ... my wife had been waiting in the car now for 20 minutes she was already pissed off and tired when I left her there I'm just happy this is done. She hands me my keys and the receipt and I notice she booked me for a different room... the crappy tower for $50 when I had reserved the rush tower for $75 (I've stayed in the older tower, worth every penny to upgrade BTW if you can). So I tell her my reservation was for the rush tower remember? Oh, yahhh. Well you can call reservations and see if they can change it for you... ok so now I'm pissed its been like 20 mins and I'm back where I started. No I'm not calling anyone that's your job I just want the room I booked online for the price I booked it for, and I want to talk to a manager please. Ok I will call upstairs for the reservations department again to change it, and call for a manager. As she's calling I pull up the page on their website where I booked the room. They talk on the phone and she hangs up and says all set its $80 sign here... I double check their website for the current special rate its still the same that I booked it for $75 I show her on my phone . So again she picks up the phone to call upstairs and says ya hi, he says its $75 not $80 ..ok I will tell him. No reservations says its $80..I'm thinking lady I just showed you the live price for tonight on your own website and your going to argue with me over $5 but I hold it in even though at this point I'm boiling. Ok I will just wait for the manager, she had called for him like 10 minutes ago. So without her asking I say I'll get out of the way so you can help other customers, and I move to the left.10 minutes go by as she checks in two people, still no manager so she calls me over and asks \"do you just want the room for $75\"... you've got to be kidding me.. \"of course I do, all i have wanted since I walked in here was the room I reserved for the peice I reserved it for.\" \" ok well the manager isn't here yet so he must be on the phone or busy so I will adjust it and have him approve it later.\" She hands me the new receipt, as I'm signing Im thinking about where I'm going to gamble and drop the $200-400 I usually throw away in Vegas. After this I didn't want these guys getting another cent from me. So no joke as I hand her the receipt about a hour after walking up to the front desk the manager Julio walks up, \" I here you have someone for me\"he says to her. I explain what happened he was polite says sorry and smiles I force one out back at him to be polite even though I'm still fuming, \"would have been a lot easier if your reservation went through huh\", \" if only\" I say.he looks at the computer and says \"well sorry again, let me give you a late check out at 3 instead of 1\"...\"awesome, thanks\"", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Falls, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNice Surprise\u201d", "Author": "nursepolly", "ReviewID": "UR91602419", "Content": "We stayed in the Carson Tower for 4 nights.

We've stayed here a few times before and really like this hotel - nice restaurants and casino, lovely rooms with comfortable beds and a great location for people who like downtown. I had an experience this stay however that disturbed and disgusted me. After showering, I put on one of the robes provided by the hotel and proceeded to begin doing my hair and putting on my make up. At one point I looked down and noticed that there were large splotches of make up on the robe. I didn't recall spilling any, so I took a closer look and realized it was a very dark foundation color and not my make up at all. I was disgusted to realize I was wearing someone else's filthy clothing and called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager. The response of the man I spoke with was, essentially, sorry, we'll send you a clean robe. I told him I didn't think that was an appropriate response to the hotel's serious lapse in cleanliness, and he offered to send up a security officer to take a report. The security officer was very professional and showed concern for the situation. He also pointed out to me a large stain on the back of the bathrobe. He told me the hotel would make it right with me, but I told him I didn't want anything - just for the hotel to make sure this didn't happen again. While I am in no way a clean freak, the thought of wearing a stranger's dirty clothes (and possibly even sleeping on their dirty sheets) bothered me greatly.

The Golden Nugget is more beautiful and accomodating than we could have imagined. The rooms in the Rush Tower are EXACTLY how they are presented on the GN's website. They are full of dark brown wood and tile and natural colors and it makes for a very cozy, relaxing room. We had three rooms booked and the front desk attendant was kind enough to search out rooms on the same floor, even two next door to each other so we could arrange daily activities conveniently. Speaking of convenient, the hotel is so convenient to everything. If you stay in Vegas much you will notice sometimes you walk more than anything, from the car to the hotel, from the hotel to the casino, from the casino to the road, etc. Everything at the GN is RIGHT THERE. The lobby of the Rush Tower is steps from the parking deck. You are steps from the casino floor, which is right next to Fremont St. Parking is ample, even on a busy night. You might have to park at the top of the deck, but there are two elevators available. Parking is also complimentary for guests, as it should be. The only restaurant in the hotel we checked out was the Buffet, which was delicious. It didn't seem like the \"typical\" buffet. It had choices like caprese salad, which I've never seen on a buffet! We enjoyed it, and the price was super cheap. We even had decent luck on the machines! The men really enjoyed the poker room, which has a cheap buy-in and they played all day and met some really nice people. Fremont Street is really an experience, which I guess is how they came up with the Fremont St. Experience name. There are so many interesting people and events that go on out there. We even rode the zip line, which was awesome. I really prefer Fremont St to the Strip. To each his own, I suppose! Also, the pool area is GORGEOUS.

You either took it that day or the offer was off the table so that kind of pissed us off. The price was actually really good but we weren't prepared for such a big purchase. We did get free money to spend in some of the casinos and a free show so it wasn't all to bad. I would also recommend that you take a coach bus to the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam.

Hard to know if there is enough seating as there were not many people out there.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Standish, Maine", "Title": "\u201cSecond Time Visit - Stay Here and Play/Eat Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "Leaving_LostWages", "ReviewID": "UR87309874", "Content": "Second time staying at the GN this year. This time we stayed in the Carson Tower. Last time I was in a Club room in the Gold Tower. The Carson Tower is farther away from the casino and Freemont St., but in my opinion the rooms are just as nice as those in the Gold Tower, and the decor is much brighter than that found in the Club rooms. My advice: save yourself some money and book in the Carson Tower if you can handle the extra 5-10 minute walk to get to the casino. I used VIP check-in this time as well. I was checked in and in my room within 10 minutes of arriving. It costs extra, but is a huge time saver. VIP check-in can be purchased with ANY room reservation. Depending on the room specials when you book, you may also get a coupon book as well. The specials in the coupon book (free drinks, food discounts, and match play) will more than equal what you pay extra for VIP check-in. My advice: VIP check-in is a MUST. The pool area looked nice, but it was a bit cold so i didn't use it. There is also a hot tub and fire pit nearby if you want to relax. There are BJ tables and a bar nearby as well. My advice: check it out and enjoy the sharks. I didn't go to the GN buffet this time, as I wasn't overly impressed with it (for lunch and dinner) during my last visits. My advice: go to Main Street Station instead. They have a good brunch buffet on the weekends (you can get a 2-for-1 coupon if you sign up for their players club) and the decor is much nicer than the GN's. I visited the Carson Street Cafe again (for breakfast), and while the food is OK, the service is consistently sloooooow, even when it's not that crowded. My advice: avoid if you can help it. This time I did splurge and ate at Vic & Anthony's steakhouse. I had a Landry's Select Club $25 credit to use, so that influenced my choice to eat here. The decor was very dark, and they played relaxing jazz music during dinner. The restuarant was quiet at first, but then got progressively louder as it filled. Supposedly there is a dress code, but I observed people dining in jeans and shorts, so that detracted from the overall experience. The food was pricey but excellent, and the service attentive but not overbearing. The jumbo shrimp cocktail was a bit disappointing, but my 12 oz. filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and the sides were huge and tasty. My advice: splurge if you have it, and avoid the shrimp cocktail. Finally, we get to the casino itself. The slots and VP are pretty much the same as can be found in other casinos, but the table limits here are the highest downtown, even during the non-busy times. The staff overall are excellent, and if you want to spend $10 and up per hand/throw, this is a good place to be. The big advantage of being downtown is that there are other casinos a short walk away that offer more games and have cheaper limits. My advice: play here if you are a high roller and/or like a nice atmosphere, and seek out other places if you are not and/or don't care too much about the ambiance. I've now stayed downtown twice, and I like it a lot more than staying on the strip. Lots of casinos, good food/drink specials and entertainment, and all in a fairly compact area known as The Freemont Street experience. My final advice: the GN is the nicest place downtown to stay. Stay here if you can get a good room rate, but for better quality and value for your money, play and eat elsewhere. Although a bit off the beaten path (but not too far), I highly recommend Main Street Station for the latter.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA reliable standby in Vegas-paying for a chaise at the pool is outrageous\u201d", "Author": "irelandmm", "ReviewID": "UR87035042", "Content": "Situated in the old Las Vegas makes for expensive taxi rides or interminable bus rides.

This was not true. We had to move the luggage ourself. I do not mind moving my own luggage however I was not happy that they were not truthful with me. My opinion is that if you are going to promise something then keep your word. The room was spacious but poorly lit. There is a makeup mirror outside of the bathroom.

It was our first time in Vegas and we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The downtown atmosphere was so much fun and the hotel had a lot of great features. We stayed in the Carson tower, which although being the older tower had renovated rooms that were very spacious and did not dissapoint for the little amount of time that we were in the room. The swimming pool with a shark tank in the middle was a great place to relax and take a break from the gambling. Since we are not hard core gamblers, the lower limits at the downtown hotels made it possible for us to gamble and not feel like we were going to have to mortgage the house to cover any losses. Most of the time you can find $5 blackjack tables (during the evening limits seemed to all go up to $10, but still less than the $25 minimums at most of the strip hotels). The nugget also offers affordable poker tournaments every few hours with $65 buy ins, which were a great way to play some poker and enjoy a few drinks. The food was great tasting and reasonably priced at the hotel. We had meals at the Grotto (Italian), Red (Japanese-Sushi) and the Carson Street Cafe. I would reccomend eating at any of these restaurants. For breakfast we strolled down Fremont street and there were a number of options for those looking to cut the cost of the trip down a little by avoiding paying for 3 gourmet meals a day (Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, McDonalds). One thing we weren't sure about was whether we were limiting our Vegas experience by staying downtown, rather than on the strip, however the strip/downtown express bus made it possible to get to and from the strip in 15mins or less and a 24 hr pass was only $7 per person. We spent a full day and evening wondering the strip and took in a show at the Venetian, but in the end, we decided that downtown was a little more our taste as the strip was a much more expensive playland (We spent more on one meal on the strip than all of the meals combined that we ate over 4 days at the Nugget). The Fremont experience was also a lot better than I was expecting based on some comments that I had read on here. We thought it was a fun experience, wondering along the street, drink in hand and taking in the free concerts offered every night. The only complaint I had about the Fremont street experience was the last night we were there, they had a Mexican band playing, which seemed odd as 90% of the clientele of the downtown hotels is caucasian and don't speak Mexican. Even given this we managed to have a good time by wondering through some shops and taking in the other sites while that concert was ongoing. The afforementioned bus pass was also handy at getting us to the Outlet shopping mall which was another relaxing break we took during our trip. The shopping was approximately a 5 min bus ride from the Golden Nugget.

Once again the staff, accommadations and food were fantastic. I can not say enough about this property. I do not know why so many people have issues. Everything I read centers around check in and check out. I have spoken with many people and they realize there is an issue a certain times and are really trying to come up with a solution. I can not believe that waiting for 20-30 minutes really can ruin a persons vacation. I was there from Thursday night 11/4 to sunday morning 11/7. I waited 15 minutes at VIP check in. If it was 30 minutes than so be it. I said it in one of my previous reviews. You are on vacation or away for an event or business. RELAX and enjoy yourself. A very simple rule I like. \"In life there is always somebody worse off than you\" Have your house burn down or get washed away in a flood or think about the people whos young kids have died or been kidnapped. Now think about the 30 minutes and how selfish that really is. The staff at the GN is as good as I have ever seen in any hotel. If you have an attitude you will eventually get one in return. \"Treat people the way you want to be treated\". I know many people have stayed in the Carson tower, which is the oldest of the three and they expect their room to be a suite. You get what you pay for AND the value at this property is the best in VEGAS. We ate at the cafe and Vic and Anthony's all meals were better than expected. Pool service for the first week in November was great (Thanks Lindsay). I can only assume that people who bash this hotel just have nothing better to do than complain. This is a great hotel. For the gamblers only \"Use a casino host\" If you gamble even a moderate amount you should use a host. Ask what they can do for you. Do not ask for more than you are entitled and if they say no don't get upset just move on. I have been in this hotel 3 times and not yet met one employee that was anything but professional and friendly. With the amount of drunk and unruly people they deal with they should be given medals for how they conduct themselves. Enjoy this place it is a great hotel. PERIOD.

All in all, they say all the right things but that's where the customer service stops. Why is this?

The Strip has the newer mega-hotels, and is where you probably want to stay if you're limited to one trip to Vegas. Fremont Street is either a $30 cab ride or a 1-2 hr. (esp. at night) bus ride away, each way. Fremont Street is more 'old-style' Vegas, much more user-friendly, you could walk the whole length in about 15 minutes, but you'd be missing all the fun. Fremont Street is made for strolling, watching the street artists, the street musicians, dancing to the free live music, and so much more. This is where you'll find the Golden Nugget. Our stay at the Golden Nugget rivaled any of our many stays on The Strip. We stayed in the Carson Tower, had a nice, basic hotel room for a very reasonable price. Wish there was a coffee maker and refrigerator, but for some reason these amenities are rather rare in Las Vegas. Nice, clean, basic, hotel room, with a wonderfully comfortable king bed. The one thing that sets the Golden Nugget above other hotels is the pool. Or rather, pools. First of all, all rooms come equipped with bathrobes. Very cool, if you pack light, as we do. Change into your swimwear in your room, walk on down to the pools. The main pool is big, with a lot of deck space for more than enough chaise lounges, and assorted other seating arrangements. Two very special features make this pool unique. First, it's built around a shark tank. Secondly, it's got a water slide! VERY fun! It's only three stories tall, but it runs pretty fast, twists and turns, and ends with an acrylic tube shooting you through the shark tank. Free. Take a ride, towel off at the bottom, enjoy a cocktail, another ride may seem like a good idea. Our only problem was the hot tub. A large, very inviting hot tub right off the main pool. While we were there, we counted 11 children at one point using the hot tub as a kiddie pool. Splashing, running, frollicking, diving(!?). There is an adults only pool on the 3rd floor, but they charge $20 for a chaise lounge chair, and it was totally dead when we checked it out. Good thing or bad thing, your call.

We arrived in LV mid-late afternoon on Saturday and drove round and round looking for the hotel car park. In the end we had to resort to parking in a public car park and then finding the hotel on foot to find out how to get to the parking. There are two options for parking \u2013 valet or self park. If you can, go for the valet parking. We went self park and ended up nearly parking at the very top of the car park because it was pretty full and most of the lower spaces were reserved for the valet parking but even if you do end up at the top there are lifts so it\u2019s not too bad. When we checked in there was a bit of a wait (about 20 minutes) and the receptionist was quite helpful. The room was lovely - huge bed which was super comfy, massive TV, very very impressive bathroom with his n hers sinks and a lovely deep tub and air con. On the downside - there's no tea/coffee making facilities and they put bottles of water in your room which you can buy for $7! We were advised not to drink the water from the tap (when you smell it you'll understand why!) so ended up buying water but not at $7 a bottle! There\u2019s a 24 hour Walgreens just a short walk from the front of the hotel on the corner which is the best place for supplies and the odd cheaper souvenir. On the first night we were tired so decided to eat at one of the restaurants in the casino, the Grotto. Don\u2019t bother \u2013 very expensive and very very poor service. We were ignored for about 10 minutes when we arrived and eventually found ourselves a table in the bar area. We then waited a further 30 minutes for a menu but weren\u2019t offered any drinks so, not really knowing the etiquette, we went to the bar and bought 2 Buds for $9.75! The guy behind the bar was extremely rude and said we should wait for our server but did serve us. Eventually our server appeared and we ordered, waited another 30 minutes, got our food and then needed another drink but no server anywhere so we went back to the bar and again the bar tender was extremely rude again. In fairness it was a Saturday night, they were busy and the servers were stretched but it took us about 2 hours to have a quick meal which was very expensive and we were mostly ignored expect for the bar tender to be rude to! Another downer is that there is no free internet access \u2013 if you want wifi it\u2019s something like $12.99 per day. As two travellers both trying to keep in touch with family and friends we both have android phones and decided that it was worth paying the money. When we went to check out we were told that there was $90 to pay for internet access (we were there for 4 nights)! We were then advised that the daily charge is PER DEVICE and that it was outlined in their terms and conditions but we weren\u2019t quite sure where! I argued with the receptionist who agreed to waive the additional fees incurred so only charged us for 1 device for 4 days but very grudgingly. If you decide to do a trip to the Grand Canyon my advice is do it, it\u2019s fab but don\u2019t pay hotel prices. The hotel quoted us $183 for a days coach trip \u2013 we paid $70 for the same tour! There\u2019s a guy called Bruce Z-Man (Zesserman) who you\u2019ll find outside 4 Queens Casino in Fremont Street. He\u2019s a street vendor and we were really nervous about him to start with but he has all the necessary permits and he\u2019s very helpful. He saved us loads of money and it was relatively hassle free. To get to the strip you can buy a bus ticket for $2 which lets you ride the buses for 24 hours, there\u2019s a stop very close to the hotel but make sure you have the right change with you. All in all, if I ever go back to Vegas I would rather pay more and stay somewhere on the strip. The attitude of the staff and the prices at the Golden Nugget put us off plus it takes quite a while to get from Fremont Street to the strip where everything happens.

Luckily we were with another couple, so it wasnt so bad, but if we had to pay an added $50 for the night out, it would be better for us at least...to stay somewhere on the strip. The other thing was the pool. We really enjoy lounging by the pool during the day, but the pool was VERY small....yes the shark tank was cool, but after one day the novelty wears off. The pool was basically big enough to get wet and thats it. So if you are wanting or expecting a big pool like say the Mirage....you wont find it here. Also the way the pool chairs are situated there are basically two areas to lounge by the pool, one area gets the sun in the morning, and the other area gets the sun in the afternoon. But with limited seating, its hard to get both, so you have to take your pick....you cant pick up and move for the afternoon sun, cause there wont be any chairs left....so that was a bit disappointing not to be able just to plunk down for the whole day and enjoy the sun, but instead have to try to play musical chairs to find sun.

Vegas has changed so much since then-some of it good (better hotels, better shows and better night clubs) but, some of it bad (insanely crowed, over developed-it takes FOREVER to get from one hotel to an another and the days of $4.99 buffets and amazing service/comps for the average person are OVER!). Overall downtown is more of what Vegas used to be only better! The GN was beautiful! We stayed in the Rush Tower and it was amazing! We could easily compare it to our room at Mandalay Bay for sure! Spent a day at the adult only pool and felt it was totally worth it. Saw Gordie Brown and we laughed till we cried.! If you have ever stayed in a good hotel on the strip you know breakfast in the 24 hour cafe is $50.00 for 2, drinks by the pool $15.00 each, adult only pool $40.00 per person, show tickets even in the worst seats are $60.00-you can basically half those prices at the Golden Nugget! Service was very friendly across the board. We also spent a lot of time gambling at Binions across the street and found their dealers very friendly as well with better cocktail service.

On our recent stay in July 0f 2010, the first night I woke up with bug bites on my ankles; we found a store and bought medicine to stop the itching. Did not think too much about it until my ankles had some swelling and began to wonder what on earth had bitten me. Two nights before we were to check out we were getting ready to go to bed and my husband saw a bug crawling on the floor and was able to get in a a plastic baggie. We went online and found that there were several hotels in Vegas, some being very expensive, that had a problem with bedbugs. We found pictures online of bed bugs and felt that the bug that we had found was a bed bug and was what had bitten me. We were up most of the night checking facts online and the next morning my husband called the front desk and asked if they were having trouble with bedbugs and was told \"not in the room that we were staying\" which told us that they had or have had problems. He told them that we felt that I had been bitten by a bed bug and they sent up a couple of gentlemen that looked at my ankles and the bug in the bag and they both said they thought it was a bed bug. They took pictures of my ankles that showed the bites and swelling and did ask if I wanted to see a Medic. They changed us to another room, which was an upgrade, however, by the time all this was finished, the day had been wasted. The next day we had a late afternoon flght home and I went to the front desk and asked if we could keep our room until 3 PM; the bell person checked with the manager and came back and told me we could not stay until 3 but 1 PM would be ok. This really upset me, as we had wasted a lot of our vacation finding a place to buy medicine, staying up most of a night because we had found a bed bug, answering questions, pictures being made,reports filled out and being moved to a different room. I voiced my anger and told the bell person that they had bed bugs and had ruined part of our vacation and that I could not believe that we could not keep the room until 3. He went back to the manager and came back and asked me if 2 PM would be OK and I was so tired of the whole business that I told him OK and thanked him for his help. I feel that the new management of the Golden Nugget does not care a lot about their customers; I would have thought that they might have offered at least a meal on the house, but they did not want to even give us a few hours extra. Let me add that we called to make our reservations twice and was quoted very high rates, different each of the two calls. We found that we got a better deal by going through our airline, however after I had booked all of the trip, I called and checked and the rates given me were much lower than the other calls and this did not please my husband or me. I might add that we have been a member of the Private Arrangement program since it was started by Steve Wynn and had always felt our rates were fair. I have concluded that the new managment is only interested in the almighty dollar; I guess someone has to pay for all the remodeling. I have read that there is a bed bug problem in many states and I can see where Las Vegas is a prime target, however, if I am a victim, I would like to feel that management is sorry and would like to make it up to me or any other customer. We are an older couple and like to stay downtown as the casinos are close and not so much walking and we have always been treated well by the Golden Nugget and have enjoyed our Private Arrangement program for years. I don't care how much you put into fixing up your property; you should remember customer satisfaction and service should be at the top of the list.

The reception desk staff were always very polite and helpful, we booked a cabanana at the superb 'shark tank' pool to be at the exclusive 'Hideaway pool', at $175 it wasn't cheap but it was definitely worth it for a special day by the pool. The casino was just like every other casino, we actually left the tables a few dollars up, the Rush Lounge is a nice touch =excellent live entertainment and the cocktails were a reasonable price $10 - $15 and you could taste the alcohol. Food - Carson St., was okay but nothing special, the buffett was great for breakfast with Juice, Coffee, Water, and too much food all for $9.95 each (had a voucher as well for a freebie so 2 for $9.95). Wouldn't bother with the Lunch Buffet. The Italian restaurant was good and reasonable price. The piece de resistance was Vic & Anthonys, absolutely fabulous - but not cheap. We had the porterhouse - twice. Freemont Street is amazing, full of real people out for a good time, good natured, good humoured with street entertainment and a lightshow you have to see to believe. Not once did we feel un-easy. Catch the deuce bus from the stop on Freemont St/Las Vagas Blvd, prepay at the m/c by the stop and its a 'not so quick' 1.5miles to the OTT strip.

First of all, the rooms are spacious and comfortable. You're not in the lap of luxury, but you certainly feel like you're living it up in Vegas. You need to navigate some labyrinthine halls to get there, but it's worth the trip. The breakfast buffet is good and has a nice variety of food, and there's plenty of gambling to be done if that's your thing. We weren't really there for the gambling. The pool is one of the best I've had the pleasure of visiting. Whether you're lounging around on deck chairs, swimming lazily in its lagoon circuit, or riding through the shark tank on the water slide - you're going to love time spent by the pool. My one complaint about the Nugget would be its night club. Half of the drinks on the menu weren't available and those that were were grossly overpriced for a place not on the Strip. We definitely preferred to do our drinking elsewhere. Also, the gym access was ridiculously high in cost.

The place was packed! We went over to the check in at the Rush Tower and they took care of us even though we booked the cheapest room via Priceline negotiations for $32 a night. All my researching led to $49 a night for that time period so I am happy with the $32. I\u2019m sure we were to get the Carson Tower. However, they didn\u2019t have any kings left, so they said they would upgrade us to the Gold Tower for $10 more. I wasn\u2019t happy that they charged $10 for a king bed, but we said okay. It was difficult to get to the gold tower elevators for some reason, but eventually we got use to it and found them right away. The room was very nice. It was bright and large enough. The King bed was very comfortable with a double sheet surrounding a blanket and then a down duvet at the foot of the bed. There was recessed lighting above the bed in case you wanted to read. The flat screen was fairly large and offered many channels. The curtains were thick and closed nicely so the room was totally dark when closed (the doorframe to the hallway let in a tiny bit of light however). The carpeting was clean and no distinct smell of any sort. There were two comfortable leather chairs and a table. A dressing table with a lighted magnifying mirror, a desk and a large enough bathroom (that might need to be remodeled sometime in the near future). Everything was very clean. The reason I am giving the Golden Nugget 4 stars instead of 5 stars because even though the room is very nice, it doesn\u2019t have basic amenities like a mini fridge, microwave or coffee pot. The hotel was super crowded when we arrived at 8PM on Sunday. The hallways were warm and humid as well as the casino. It was very hot outside that day and maybe because of the crowds it couldn\u2019t get cool. We walked outside to the beautiful pool area where the sharks swim (is that tank big enough for sooo many sharks and fish?). Many guests were relaxing on the lounge chairs enjoying the fire pits (even though it was still warm out). Very nice gathering spot. Downtown was hopping!! So many people and singers and bands playing. It was incredible. It was like one giant party. I thought to myself that downtown Vegas sure wasn\u2019t hurting, not any longer. We walked to the El Cortez, that one block getting to the El Cortez was a little sketchy, but obviously fine. We had a couple of poorly made drinks and played some video blackjack and left. Then, we walked to the Golden Gate, that place was shaking with so much going on. Dancers on top the outside bar with blaring music. Dancers in the casino, fairly crowded. We sat down at the bar and they never even tended to us. So we left there. The next night (Monday), downtown was still crowded, but not as bad as Sunday. It was still fun to be amongst all those people. We walked about a mile to the Gold Silver Pawn Shop which host a reality show on the History Channel. It was great to see all the main characters. They were getting ready to film when we were there. I guess we could have stayed but we had other plans. Tuesday, we went to the pool (had to show our room key) and got a couple of loungers in the shade (plenty of shade earlier in the morning). By the early afternoon, we had tons of sun and the other sunny side (morning) now had the shade. It was fairly crowded by the pool, but not overly so. Still loungers left and lots of room to swim or float in the pool. They said that the pool is heated, though I was a little chilled going into the pool, but quickly got use to is (I am always cold though). I read here on TripAdvisor that the pool area charges you for a lounger or chair. NOT TRUE! They are free. The adult only pool upstairs charges. We walked up there, but it was too windy to be enjoyable, so we never even considered paying money to be there. The shark tank is truly incredible! I will post some pictures. The pictures just don\u2019t do it justice. Very clean, what a sight to be seen! The pool was very, very clean. I read one reviewer said that the pool was nasty. Not at all. I also read that there were kids all over, splashing and screaming. Not when we were there. We went down the waterslide and it is fast! I thought I would make a delicate entrance into the pool from the slide, but not so! I went PLOP! Must be my age! Oh well, so I tried again and PLOP! Okay, maybe next time\u2026 The pool during the day and in the evening is probably the nicest pool area I have ever been at. One negative: the lounge chairs are too close together. We got two end loungers, so we move fairly far from our neighbors, so no big deal. No line to get into the pool either. We got there around 10:30 (I think the pool opens up at 10AM). Reviewers wrote that you had to start lining up to get a lounger, not true when we were there. We sat in the hot tub (very clean) for a little while and we were the only two in there. Maybe because it was Las Vegas in September! We saw that people were in it at night. If we weren\u2019t exhausted by the time we got to our hotel at night, we might have taken advantage of that. Maybe next time. We never ate there. So I can\u2019t comment on the food. We never gambled there (though the casino never seemed too smoky and the atmosphere was classy and comfortable , so I can\u2019t comment on that either. We never even drank there. We just slept there and was gone for the rest of the day (except for that one amazing day at the pool). I would recommend this place in a heartbeat, especially for what we paid. This hotel should NOT be compared to the expensive hotels on the strip as some reviewers do. Those hotels charge two, three sometimes four times what we paid.

No problem since we planned to sign up for a players card and look over the new areas of the hotel as we had not been there in about a year. We received our keys and gave the desk clerk our luggage check and went to the room. The luggage arrived at the same time. Very impressive service! The room was great. Very comfortable and spacious with a great bed. Only con was the tub and shower were one unit, and the tub is quite deep, making it a little tricky to get out without slipping. Elderly guests may find it a definite problem. Service at the GN is remarkable. Cocktail waitresses were prompt and we were comped premium liquors while gambling. Room service arrived as promised (about 20 minutes in mid afternoon) and was very good, and still hot! We had an excellent meal at the Grotto. The only complaint I had was that the computer could not give me the credit I had coming on the Landry card. Computer issues seemed to be a bit of a theme, but did not really impact our stay very much. We enjoy gaming downtown and the GN is clearly the class of the area.

Got in on a Thursday morning at 8, check in line wasn't terrible, and they were able to give us an early check in at no charge. The pool is neat, but seating can be a bit hard to find, and there always seemed to be a lot of kids splashing around. You do have the option of paying $10 for a seat at the hideout ( a 16 and older pool), to get away from kids. The water slide was pretty fun as well, even if you can't see anything when you go through the aquarium. They had a lot of restaurants in the casino, which was convenient. Ate at grotto for lunch and dinner, but would definitely recommend the dinner menu because of the increased options, prices were about $20 a plate. Had the lunch and dinner buffet, at 12 and 20 dollars respectively. The dinner buffet didn't have that much extra compared to the lunch, but was still a pretty good deal. Skip the Carson street buffet though, it was like a village inn, but more expensive and with worse food. Gold diggers night club was fun, it was only a $5 dollar cover, as compared to $40 at most other places. Drinks were a bit expensive, but what can you expect at a club. Guest services were incredibly nice and helpful, we were the most needy guests on this trip than on any other, but they just smiled and helped with our problems. The freemont street experience is right outside the door, and it was nice staying downtown for a change, there were a lot less people and it was a much more laid back vibe. The surrounding casinos had cheap table game too, which was nice, but the golden nugget rarely had a table under $10. If you wanted to go to the strip, the bus stops were right outside the hotel, but I would recommend the 3 day pass. It is about a 45 minute bus ride, and you can't bring drinks on. Now for the negatives. The front desk is understaffed. It did take a long time to get help from guest services, and if you called down to the front desk you were always put on hold, with the option of leaving a message. Although the atmosphere of Golden Nugget was really cool and felt like old time Vegas, it is basically a very nice 4 star island in a sea of old people and run down buildings that compose the other casinos downtown. Consequently we spent most of out time in the the Golden Nugget, or on the Strip. there were not many restaurants outside the hotel worth going to, unless you wanted to cure a hangover on the cheap. It did seem like the hotel liked to charge for extras, i.e. internet, fitness center, late checkout and extra guests, but what hotel doesn't. Overall though, we thought the Golden Nugget was a great place, especially at the rate we got. As a quick side note, we got a standard room in the Carson tower, the beds were doubles instead of queens, and seemed a bit small, but otherwise it was pretty similar to staying at a Holiday Inn.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, but they'll Nickle & Dime you at every corner\u201d", "Author": "RodeoRacer", "ReviewID": "UR79556640", "Content": "We stayed in a new Rush tower room, beautiful, stylish, roomy.

We both wanted to stay in the Fremont district, which we love and prefer over the Strip. We both thought the Strip was a great place to visit but liked the feel of Fremont. As for the Nugget, it's a nice place and we would stay again. A couple of drawbacks: 1) we had to pay for the VIP in order to get a room with two double beds; 2) the beds and pillows were horrible, neither of us had a good nights sleep while there; 3) the VIP was supposed to allow us to forego the lines, which was true during check in but when we actually were waiting in a line, which was on our last day while waiting for the breakfast buffet, we didn't think about it until we were at the beginning of the line. When I brought it up to the cashier she asked to see my VIP line pass, which we had not received during check-in so that added \"perk\" was a wash. Speaking of the buffet, we waited in line for about 30-40 minutes and by the time we got to the front of the line they had switched to lunch; breakfast is served until 10:30 which seems a bit early to cut it off considering how late people stay up in Vegas. The food wasn't exceptional and of course we were disappointed because we wanted breakfast. The maddening part was we could see numerous empty tables just waiting to be bussed with no one in sight to clean them up. If they had enough help to bus the tables the line would have moved a lot faster. Bottom line for us--we won't be eating at the buffet again. Another problem I had at the Nugget-in all the time I spent at the machines not once was I approached by a cocktail server. The Fitz, Excalibur, Paris and Caesar's were extremely quick when it came to offering drinks-but the Nugget scores a 0 in this respect.

The biggest one was that the colors are so dark when you walk in you cant even find the light switches. It took ten minutes just to turn on the light. Since Vegas cant have coffee makers in any rooms any more, because of a law suit, you would think they would serve it free in the lobby. None was found. My husband gambles and I like to relax all day by the pool so I was looking forward to going to the pool the very first day. I picked this hotel just because of the pool. I got to the pool around 11am and there were no available seats anywhere and even to just sit next to the pool and put your feet in was next to impossible. That put me in a very bad mood from jump street. So I went to an employee that works in the gift shop by the pool and asked her what time they opened the pool. She told me that the doors open at 7 am but the pool wont open until 10 am. She also told me that if there is a chair with just a towel and no personal belongings that I can sit there but if there are belongings there I cant touch the chair. So my number one priority was to make sure I was there the next day as soon as the doors open. Next morning got up bright and early excited about going to the pool. Was the first in line and got the exact seat that I wanted. After sitting there about an hour I remembered that I forgot my iphone in the room and decided to go and get it. I told the security guard that I was going up to my room to get my phone and said I would be right back. He then pointed at a sign in front of him and with a loud voice proceeded to tell me that chairs can not be reserved or saved. I tried to say something and he interrupted me and spoke even louder like he wanted everyone to hear. In a polite soft voice I told him that I was not there to argue with him but was told by another employee that if I had my stuff on the chair that they could not touch it and asked if that were true. Before he could even finish saying yes I was out the door on the way to get my phone. The next morning I was up and at em early again but this time there was someone in front of me that got the seat I was in the day before saved 6 more seats in that row and then the round day bed next to her on the other side, and no she didn't tell me that she lives in Vegas and decided to come early and save seats for her family and that they were bringing their children. She wasn't staying at the hotel and she was on the phone for the next hour calling up her family telling them how to get there and how she was saving a bunch of seats for them. Now I flew in from across the country just to stay at this hotel to go to the pool and spent over $1200.00 and this chick hasn't spent a dime and just got prime seats for the day at the best pool in downtown Vegas. Now I cant blame her because if she is doing it you know there are others doing it too and that is one of the reasons i probably couldn't get a seat the first day I was there. Its called very bad management. Needless to say she sat in front of me smoking the entire time so that day was not a great one for me.

We had stayed on the strip at Bally's and eventhough there were kids around, the pool being larger allowed for those of us without kids to still enjoy ourselves. At the Golden Nugget pool, the kids need to learn pool etiquette. They were jumping/diving into the pool, splashing in my face and I did not find this fun. I felt like a sardine with all the loungers squeezed right next to each other. It was difficult to get a lounge chair unless you got there early. Now I want you to know that I am a mother of 5 and not opposed to children but I think the lower price hotel attracts more famiies on a budget and I should keep this in mind when next I book a trip to Vegas. That being said, there is a pool called the \"hideaway\" on the top level that is for age 16 and above. We could not get into there because it was all booked up.

The people in our room had already checked out, but the room hadn't been cleaned yet. The clerk basically checked us in, gave us our coupon book, and had the bell man hold our luggage for us. We just had to come back around 10:00AM and see if our room was ready and get our keys. When we returned just a few minutes after 10:00AM, our room was ready. We were on the 17th floor with a strip view. The room was absolutely gorgeous! Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. This was probably the first hotel I've ever stayed at where the sheets didn't come untucked when I pulled the covers down. Our room was cleaned promptly every day. The maid was perhaps a little too efficient. They give a large bar of upgraded soap and two smaller bars at the sink. The maid threw the soaps away every day. That large soap would probably last two weeks at home, so I just put them in my suitcase and only opened the little bars, so we wouldn't waste so much. My only complaint about the room would be the height of the tub. The first time I got in, I banged my foot. It's a deep tub. I could see an older person having a hard time using the tub/shower. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but the lunch buffet lacked variety, although everything was of a good quality and tasty. The table dealers were a mixed bag. A lot of them were very quiet. Once I started having the dealer play along with my hands, it woke them up fast. They were otherwise polite, just not as much fun as those who joke around and talk more.

The Golden Nugget was beautiful, classy, bizarre, lively, intimate, fun, comfortable, exciting. I have not slept so well in ten years as I did the three nights we were there. Lovely rooms (older, Carson Tower), great AC, beautiful view of the mountains, awesome shower that made us comatose at the end of the night, wonderful service (Every single staff member smiled and said \"Good morning\" or \"Good evening.\") One reviewer mentioned that, although the rooms have multiplied, the pool is the same, and yes, it's a bit cramped but you feel like you are at a family party with lots of nice, happy people. It's wonderful for couples, families, older people--anyone. There is an army of staff who are constantly cleaning everything from the slot machines to the pool area. I don't know how to gamble but I put about ten bucks in the slot machines over the stay and won a bit over forty just for fun. The Mai Tais at the pool are the finest I have ever had--no mix at all, just the real, potent deal. We rented a car at the in-house Budget counter and went to attractions at about ten hotels over two days (all the hotels have FREE valet parking for everyone, an insane concept for a Chicagoan who can't park anywhere without mortgaging the house). This is the one thing about the Golden Nugget: it's about a twenty-thirty dollar cab ride from the Strip hotels, depending on where you are going, so definitely rent a car for about eighty bucks a day, which also allowed us to ride out into the desert at bit and go back and forth twice a day to the Strip. We also had several meals at Carson Street Cafe--great breakfast--and had dinner at Lilly's, an Asian place with Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisine, also very good. Fremont Street, day or night, is a must-see slice of Americana, and it was wonderful to be able to walk outside the door and say goodnight to old Las Vegas in its current incarnation of rowdiness (Fremont Street Experience) . . . and then head right inside for a safe, secure, totally quiet night, without any noise at all.

We called 10 minutes after checking in, and two days later they still hadn't fixed it. We were disappointed in the lack of service, considering we were used to the Wynn's AWESOME service. Whatever - we were a bunch of guys on a bachelor party trip. Another annoyance - there was no \"do not disturb\" sign - and no one could find us one. So each day, bright and early, there was a knock on the door from housekeeping. I am never mad at people for doing their job - but really? 9am? In Vegas? The ladies were polite, but the door knocking was annoying. Overall, okay experience, decent rooms. Just make sure you get a good price. It's about a $30 cab ride to the strip.

Perks: Free upgrade through Landry's Select Membership to a Rush Tower Junior Suite, even though I booked through a 3rd party. $40 bill at Red Sushi comped for paltry play by a super generous casino hostess (I'm sorry to say I can't recall her name at the moment. To bad this could have been her opportunity to become Internet famous). Reviewer: Early 30's married couple no kids. Travel to Vegas about every 90 days. Interests are...wait for it...gambling (never would have guessed, huh?), food and lounging near the pool. Location: The Golden Nugget is ideally situated right in the middle of the Fremont Street experience. Every Fremont Street location is only a 5-15 min walk, if you have no difficulties walking. Check-in: Landry's membership gave us the option to use VIP-check in, but embarrassingly enough we had no idea where it was located. So we used the regular check-in and waited in line for about 6 mins. If your looking for VIP it's located next to the Rush Towers, keep the pool area to your left, follow it around to the slots and take a left. Elevators: Lightning fast, longest wait 30 sec. Room: 10202 Rush Tower Junior Suite. We've been steadily working our way up the hotel food chain. We have yet to stay at the Wynn, Palazzo or Bellagio, so if your used to these places then the junior suite will be comfortable, it just won't be \"Wow, this is niiiiiice!\" Foyer leads to a closet on your left, restroom straight ahead (double sink and deep tub with shower), and a separate make-up area with mirror to the right. Opens up into a lounge area, sitting area, and king bed. Two 42-inch flat screens. Furniture was very comfortable, views of other hotels (pretty sad), and shower water pressure was strong. Free in room safe. See attached pictures. Very pleased with house keeping and quality of room. Minor complaint: the pillows did not offer enough support IMHO. they folded like a lawn chair under the weight of my head. I think it was because they were down pillows. Pool: We opted to pay $40 ($20 a piece) for two chaise lounges at the Hide-Out pool located on the 3rd floor. Worth every penny. I'm not against kids, but kids can be kids, and downstairs was a zoo. The Hide-Out was very relaxing, quite and a fun group of adult couples. Jeff, the bartender, was spot-on and personable. The only negative: The only areas out of the sun were the cabanas ($250 a day, 6 people, but one can fit 16). But depending on the time of day, several day beds had shade from the buildings. Casino: Daytime you can find $5 tables, but the min moves to $10 at night. There is usually a $5 three card poker and a Super 21 blackjack at the back pit near the rear entrance by the WOF slot machines at night. Friendly dealers and pit bosses. Drink service was prompt. Kettle one vodka offered, sorry no goose. Slots: Golden Nugget has a reputation (deserved or not) as a tighter casino. Can't say that I noticed one way or the other. WOF seemed to be on par at max bet with other casinos, except the Cortez. I don't know if we were lucky, or what, but the Cortez was spitting money out of their WOF machines 3 days in a row. Casino host/hostess: They're great as far as I'm concerned since they comped my Red Sushi bill on a $200 loss. Restaurants: Vic and Anthony's is the best steak house downtown. If you disagree...you are wrong ;-P. Flawless service and an affordable $46 prix fixe menu (salad, 8 0z prime filet, side and dessert). 2.5 lb lobster is not meant for one person. You have been warned. Grotto: Excellent thin crust pizza and delicious pastas. Friendly wait staff, can be hit or miss with service depending on who you get. Buffet: Best quality downtown, but nothing that knocks your socks-off. The champagne served with the champagne brunch was pleasantly delicious and endless. Deadly combination. Bottom line: Golden Nugget is the class of downtown and I'm happy to say that the service exceeded my expectations. It easily has the best pool, restaurants and rooms downtown. Side note: It takes about 15-20 min to take an ACE bus from downtown to the Fashion-show Mall (across from the Wynn). The 108 bus will take you to the airport, but it takes 40 min.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cRush Tower is Great!\u201d", "Author": "Googlebears26", "ReviewID": "UR75946534", "Content": "I live in Las Vegas and stayed at the Golden Nugget for one night.

The water slide was fun for our son but the pool area just wasn't very clean or bright or spacious. I will say the people working at the hotel were all very helpful and friendly. I'm normally not a complainer. I don't think I've ever posted a negative review on tripadvisor.

The view from the window was the wall of one of the adjoining towers. We stayed in the room for only 5 minutes or so and decided it was totally unacceptable. Back to the desk we went and voiced our concern to some rude young woman behind the counter. She quickly informed us that they had no more smoking rooms. We told her to put us in the Carson tower and let us keep this fun book. She said \"we didn't pay\" for the fun book, but that it had been given to us...telling us the fun book didn't come with the Summer10 promotion. We got our room in the Carson tower. Day 2. We returned to our room at 1:00 in the afternoon to rest for a while before going out again. Housekeeping hadn't made up the room yet so we put the do not disturb sign on the door.

Check-in was fairly quick and courteous (we arrived on a Monday around 2:30pm. Our rooms were King/Non-Smoking Rooms in the Carson Tower. The rooms themselves were nice and clean and fairly decent in size. My wife really enjoyed the make-up table and mirror just outside of the bathroom and I was happy to see that there was a safe in the room (small, located in the closet if you're looking for it, and was large enough for wallets/passports/jewellery but wouldn't fit a laptop or anything of decent size). The cleaning staff did a great job keeping the room clean during our stay too. The hotel itself is quite large and the Carson tower is situated right at the back. The elevator tower for it is close to a small store with beverages and hotel souveniers, and nearby a Starbucks coffee outlet (very busy in the mornings!). The pool is also nearby with the world famous Shark Tank. The pool itself opens at 10am for swimming, but you have to go earlier (8-9am) if you want a chair... great place to catch some sun. We even managed to catch filming of a few scenes of CSI Vegas in the pool area while we were there (I think the episode will be called \"Pool Shark\" and it's supposed to air September 30th). The Casino floor is fairly large considering it is a downtown Casino. Lots of table games too (my friend seemed to enjoy the poker room on a daily basis too). As for restaurants, we only tried the one near the pool (can't remember the name of it at the moment), but it was good and the prices were affordable. I had heard ahead of time that the buffet and some of the other restaurants were pricey, so we didn't even bother going into them. There's a ton of affordable places on and around Fremont to try out. The location of the hotel is fairly cental on Fremont Street, so it's close to everything there. While we didn't have too much interaction with staff, they did seem courteous when approached. The hotel was also close to a bus stop which our wives took to the north outlet mall (they found out later it would have just been a short & fairly cheap cap ride away - which they took to get back to the hotel with the stuff they had bought). It's aslo only couple blocks walk to catch the ACE Goldline or Deuce to head down to the strip (we found the Goldline great as it has less stops than the Deuce). The Golden Nugget (and Fremont Street for that matter) is also a short cab ride away to Cashman Field, home of the Las Vegas 51's Triple A farm team for the Blue Jays... very affordable tickets for a great night out. All in all, this was our first time staying at the Golden Nugget (first time on Fremont too) and we preferred it to our stays on the Strip (have stayed at Bally's and New York New York before). The Golden Nugget is the nicest of the hotels downtown, it's less crowded on Fremont and you spend less time going from casino to casino than you would on the Strip.

We like the easy walking from Casino to Casino from our home base of the Nugget. The Pool is really great, but there were lots and lots of children aroound during our visit. You have to get to the pool very early to get a chair at all. Everyone is using the water slide witht he sharks swimming nearby in their tanks. It's too hot in the afternoon to sunbathe in the summer. There is an adult level in the pool area where it is serene. We loved the gambling in this Casino.

The staff were all friendly and helpful, apart from one girl on the ticket office desk, who appeared disinterested in finding us a show. There are number of resturants with \"world flavours\" alongside a buffet and a cafe, the restaurants are often busy, so booking required, the buffet moves quickly, and the cafe is good for breakfast as well as afternoon snack. The pool area is great, if a little crowded, try to get a chair on one of the upper levels, where it is lesss busy. There is a private area that you have to pay to get into with its own pool, but this tends to be full of 20-something trendy types posing! The main pool circles a shark/fish tank, it is cleaned from the inside most days by three divers (one on guard!) this is very interesting to watch as the sharks approach. I did feel that the tank was on the small side though and began to feel sorry for the sharks. there is a flume that runs through the tank, great for the kids. All hotels have there own casino and this is no exception, with one of the largest in that area, however, it is also one of the smokiest. Outside of the hotel is the Fremont Street Experience, this has a carnival atmosphere and consists of permormance artists, shops, stalls and live bands on two stages. All covered by a giant LED TV roof. We actually prefered this to the busier and brasher strip. Close by there is a Tickets4Tonight stall that sells reduced price show, tour and meal tickets, we got some good savings there, but you do need to be there before 10am to ensure the more popular are not sold out for that evening To get to the strip requires a bus journey ($15 tickets for five days) that can take anywhere between 15 minutes in the morning and 50 minutes late at night back.

I was told by the reservation staff that I could pay a $25.00 fee for a VIP upgrade and be guaranteed a no smoking room with a King sized bed. Otherwise it would be the roll of the dice for whatever was available. (They were hosting a large convention that week end) I paid the $25.00 fee since I wouldn't be checking in until after midnight and wanted to make sure that I had a No Smoking room with a King sized bed. Upon checking in I was told that there were no King beds available. I informed the check in person that I paid for a VIP package which guaranteed me a no smoking room with a King sized bed. She apologized and refunded me my $25.00. When I went up to my room I had to wait in the hallway while my room was being made. I couldn't understand how I had to wait in the hallway at 1:30 AM waiting for a room to be made when I told the Golden Nugget that I was checking in after midnight. When I called the front desk to ask why the room wasn't made the person at the desk apologized and told me that the hotel comped me on the V IP fee. I told him that I wasn't comped, I was refunded for a service I didn't get. So please don't act as if you comped me. Giving me a meal for free would have been a comp. The pool is featured on the travel channel. It has a shark tank and a water slide that goes through it. If you don't get there early to hold a lounger you are out of luck. There aren't enought loungers because the pool area is very small. Then on top of that CSI Vegas was filming there and the pool was closed for hours on two seperate days to accomodate the filming. The room ( I stayed in the Carson Tower) is very rudimentary. It has no refridgerator or coffee maker. I had to go back to the old ice in the trash can to keep my drinks cold. The rooms are a nice size and the beds are comfortable. In this day and age I find the lack of a coffee maker and refridgerator strange. Gambling- The Casino has a very good assortment of gaming tables and slot machines. I found the staff at the tables not to be the friendliest people. Even when tipped after a win they barely aknowledge you. I gambled at the other downtown hotels and the staff was much more pleasant. Overall I've been coming to the Golden Nugget for over 10 years.

The other trip we took (together) was for a wedding, so we didn't get to see as much as we would have liked. He had never been downtown, so I thought it would be fun to book a two part trip..3 nights downtown and 2 on the strip. It's pretty well known that the Nugget is the nicest hotel downtown...so when I saw they had a summer special for $39 midweek rooms, it was a no-brainer. We arrived by shuttle from the airport on a Sunday night We had to schlep our luggage around a bit before we found the check in desk (better signage would be a bonus here), but after reading about some of the long waits, we were pleasantly surprised to find a very short line. We stayed in a standard room in the older Carson tower. For the money, we were quite satisfied. It was nothing special or over the top, but plenty comfortable...about what you'd expect to find at your average Hilton. I was pleasantly surprised to find they provided robes, and the bed was very comfy. We were on the 12th floor, kind of in a corner with a partial view of the Fitzgerald. The Carson tower is the one furthest back from Freemont Street, which suited us just fine as it was nice and quiet. It is also the closest tower to the swimming pool, which is nice if you prefer not to have to walk through a casino in your swimsuit! The GN pool is unique in that is surrounds a large tank with sharks and other fish. There is a (free) waterslide that goes right through the shark tank, which is pretty cool! The pool area was a little smaller than I expected, but definitely worth checking out. They close the actual pool at night, but you can still grab a lounge chair and look at the sharks after dark when they have the tank lit up. As with many Vegas hotels, there was no coffee maker in the room (we brought our own), but there is a Starbucks very close to the Carson Tower elevators, which would be appreciated for folks who want to grab a quick cup of Joe to bring back up to the room. Other than a quick dinner at the coffee shop the night we arrived, we really didn't eat at the GN, though I've heard Vic and Anthony's steakhouse is excellent, and something we're putting on our list for next time. Though V and A's is one of several higher end places to eat, there are MANY cheap places to eat downtown. Since the casinos are in such close proximity to each other, it's very easy to get around and try different places. Tip: for some good downtown two-for-one dining coupons, go to vegasexperience.com and use the password REALVEGAS. Many of these coupons are only good for first time player's club signees, but if you're new to downtown, these could save you a few bucks! The GN casino is very nice (you definitely notice the difference between it and some of the other downtown properties) and we had fair luck. Didn't win anything huge, but were able to play a long time off a minimal amount of money (we mostly do penny slots). The only downside to our experience at the GN was a few housekeeping issues. After our room was cleaned the first day, they forgot to leave us clean towles. No biggie...we called the front desk and they delivered us two days' worth. The next day, however, we didn't get any houskeeping service at all! I suppose we could have called to complain, but we didn't bother. Again, not a HUGE deal (at least we had another days' worth of clean towels), but for a 4-star hotel, this is kind of a big oversight. Overall, though, we found the GN to be a great deal for the money we paid.

My brother and I were traveling back from Grand Canyon (North Rim) where we were going on two days of no sleep, and just needed our two bed non-smoking room so we could crash for the night before heading home the following morning. Reservations were made months in advance, with a triple-check that we'd need a late check-in time. When we drove up to the hotel, it wasn't at all clear where to park. We pulled up to the valet area, who told us to drive around the the tower to the parking structure behind. When we pulled up to the garage, the fully tattoo'd attendant said we couldn't park in the garage until we had a room key. We had to park in the dirt parking lot down the street. We walked back to the Carson Tower check desk, and it was closed - signs said that we had to check-in at the Golden Tower desk. We worked our way through the smokey casino (I think there was a gang banger convention going on or something), and eventually found the Golden Tower check-in desk. The host banged away on the keyboard for several minutes before excusing herself to the back for another 10+ minutes. When she emerged, she advised that they no longer had any non-smoking two bed bedrooms. She could give us a non-smoking King with a roll-away Queen in the Golden Tower. Fine - we're exhausted. We get our key and head back to the car so we can move it to the parking garage. Tattoo man let's us in, and we find probably the last slot in the entire structure. We carry our luggage back to the Golden Tower and find our room (3rd Floor). We go in, and SURPRISE - someone is already in this room! Nice - we got a key that opens someone elses room - WOW, I really feel safe in this place now. OK, lug everything back down and hit the Golden Nugget front desk again - the angry host from earlier is now gone, so we get to deal with someone else who begins to argue with us why we want a freakin' refund, and we're moving on to a more reputable establishment. Took 30 minutes to process the refund. Ended up going to the Hilton Garden Inn in Henderson, and go the perfect hotel experience we deserved (and it was cheaper).

The only reason for my staying downtown this trip was so I could be closer to a couple of social functions happening around Fremont Street. Liking the best I can afford, I booked the Rush Tower at the Golden Nugget. Rush Tower is the Nugget's newest addition and rivals the four star hotels on the Vegas strip. Coming from the airport, if you want to save on cab fare take the shuttle for $9. You will surely be last to arrive at the GN as it is the last stop. By cab, ask your driver to take Dean Martin to Industrial, Industrial to Wyoming St., Wyoming to Main and on to the Golden Nugget.. This route will save you three to four dollars. On with the review! Stepping throught the doors was impressive enough with the reservation desk being backed up to a huge aquarium with the Chart House bar sandwhiched between the desk and the tank. There were ten parties in front of me waiting for room keys since there was a power failure or some such thing. New keys were in the process of being made. Twenty minutes later, I was finished with the check-in process and on my way to room 21225 on the 21st floor. The room was spacious with a large seperate bathroom and water closet. There are two sinks and a back lit mirror, magnification make-up mirror and plenty of fresh white bath linens. The room was very clean. The window faced south where distant views of the Stratosphere and the strip, beyond could be seen. Looking below, I could see the drive up entrance to the Rush Tower and to the left the pool area. Since there were sufficient bath linens for five days, I opted to hang the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door knob. The flat screen TV was on a large wall unit with up lights on top. The closet was spacious with enough hangers for one person. The safe is in the wall unit, tucked behind one of the doors. Decor is in brown and orange tones, not my favorite color scheme but comtemporary and restful. A large brown sofa and tables filled the area between the bed and window. Be sure not to pick up the water bottles which are on the tray or you will be charged $4. I had to ask that the price be removed from my bill. Staff at Rush Tower is very friendly and helpful. My room keys stopped working and security had to come up to fix the situation. That and the long checkin were the only inconveniences. If swimming is important to you, the GN is the place to be.

I was initially a bit hesitant to book the rush tower suite since they are only available with 1 king sized bed and there were 4 of us that would be sleeping in the room. However, the booking agent informed me that the jr. corner suites include a sectional type sofa that comfortably fits 2 people. And she was right! The only complaints that I heard from my boys during our entire stay at the Golden Nugget was that the line to get on the water slide was extremely long and the pool itself was really crowded. In fact, even though the pool opens at 10:00, people start lining up about 9:30 in order to snag a lounge chair. Despite those 2 minor things, our stay at the Golden Nugget was awesome!

There were things I didn't do that I really should have. This time I went with some of the criticisms I have read in the back of my mind to see if they were really true. #1 and the biggest complaint I see on this site regarding this hotel is the check in process. I spoke with a hotel member and she said they know there is an issue and they are really trying hard to get that fixed. She did say it is an ongoing issue but they are really working on it. The one that really blew my mind was that somebody said the tub in the showers were very slippery and to be careful. Last trip I had no problem with the tub. This time I found that to be true. They do provide bath mats and you should use them. The only other problem with the shower/tub is it can be a very big step for an older person or someone with any leg or knee problems. The last thing I looked for that somebody complained about was that the food in the carson street cafe was not 4 star. For most people reading this I would hope that nobody other than the person who wrote that would guess that a cafe should have 4 star food and service. I ate there twice and the first time I was greeted promptly and the food was above average for what I expected. I especially liked the red onion soup (their version of French Onion) Very hot and well seasoned. The second time there I waited about 5 minutes after being sat before anyone coming to wait on me. I was there for soup and salad for an afternoon snack. A little dissapointing with the service but not terrible. The food was above average. As far as check in I can not comment because I am usually checked in when I arrive by my host. As in my previous review \"IFYOU GAMBLE A DECENT AMOUNT (Not Huge). GET A PLAYERS CARD AND ASK TO MEET A CASINO HOST\" This will be one of the best moves you will ever make. Now for this trips reviews. Check in very early or very late to avoid the lines. I will say this again and again and again. There is not ONE person in that building that is anything but extreemly helpful and curteous. They have the best staff in town or on the strip. I had a pit supervisor that remebered me by name without my players card and went out of his way to talk to me for a few minutes. The pool: One word packed.. Get over it Do what everybody else does and be a winner at the pool. Go down around 8:30 or 9:00 and bring or get a couple of towels and t shirts and stake you claim to your lounge chairs early. You can put your stuff there and feel pretty safe about it. That is why I say T shirts( crappy ones in case somebody does move them). Went to the pool 4 times for no more than 1 hour max. For me that was pleanty of time. Buffet: Good value for lunch at $11. Wasn't as pleased with weekend brunch for $19. Had dinner in April and thought is was a good deal for the $19.00. Did not try the Grotto that is on the agenda for next trip. I had great luck on the slots $1 primarily. Black jack was a killer this time. After my budget was up for the 5 days, I had an extra $18.00 in slot money back. So I took it and played .25 cent poker and 6 spins in hit a royal flush 1 hour before I had to leave so although I lost overall I finished on a $1000 hit. Best dinner in a long time: Vic and Anthonys. Can be pricy for some but this is all of 4 stars and then some. Biggest problem is portion size on their sides and salads. Buy a you own entree and split a side or two. If you go figure 100 PP for 2 drinks with salad, entree and side plus tip. WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT. John was my waiter and Edward his assistant. Never missed a beat. I left at 10 PM sunday night for a red eye back to the east coast. I got to the airport only to NOT find my month old blackberry. I made several calls to the receptionist at the rush tower ( who went beyond to help me find my phone. TO no avail. Called the casino host office and Virginia tried to find it. No luck when I arrived home I emailed my host and she said it was found and VIP serviecs had it they are sending to me. If that isn't customer service nothing is I will say this again as in my last review. Treat people the way you want to be treated. You are on vacation in a great city enjoy it and don't stress over small little things. Every time somebody ask how I am I say great. I get the same answer \"really why?\" My answer is because I got up today, I am healthy and I have a healthy family. There is so much bad in the world shed some positive energy. When you are on vacation have fun some people never have the opportunity that you do. Try living in a box or a shelter. Think about that next time you have to wait a few minutes for a meal or a table or a room. Have fun and enjoy your life it's the only one you have. Golden Nugget you have the greatest people working for you and they are one of your greatest assets. Keep up the great work. Thank you Jessica. Maria, and Virginia.

We had made our reservation 2 months in advance but at our check-in (10:30 am) they were evidently overbooked. We had a very charming but incredibly new or incompetent desk clerk. As I watched the minutes tick away she continued to type and sigh. She finally called a supervisor over who typed and grunted. I pleasantly asked if anything was wrong and they smiled back a lot. The short version is that after a 20 minute wait watching them type they didn't have the room we reserved and put us in the \"south\" tower which is the oldest and an overland hike from the casino. I objected and asked if we might get any comps or considerations since we didn't want to stay in the south tower. What we were offered was the south tower standard price! They said we were saving money from our original reservation and I explained that we were saving money because we had booked a more expensive room! At this point it was about 40 minutes of debating at the counter and they succeeded in winning the smile down. The vapidly grinning clerk offered to call in the manager but I had to concede they'd won and just took our luggage and schlepped the miles to our room. When we finally got to our room our message light was blinking and I hurried to check it in the event that this was only a bad joke. However, it was an irritating message telling us how much they loved having us and wouldn't we just love to book a show! The Golden Nugget is getting a little too crowded now that they have added their fourth tower for a total of 2300 rooms! That being said, it's still a very cool place with a great casino. For the younger crowd they have a good variety of theme restaurants, bars, and a night club. For our over 50 crowd they have a good buffet and a lot of penny slots! At peak times it can be a little hard to navigate as the crowds can get pretty dense. It's location on Fremont Street is convenient to all of the other casinos and that's what I love about downtown. If your luck's run cold at one table or machine, another casino is but a few steps away.

After studying many reviews on Trip Advisor, we chose the Golden Nugget and decided that we would go for a Spa Suite. What I would say at this stage is, if you can afford one, then go for it, they really are worth the extra. Check in was via their small VIP room which is situated just off reception.

There is a huge whirlpool tub and a steam room/shower as well as a toilet upstairs and another downstairs. There are plenty of pictures of these suites available so I won\u2019t waffle on too long about it other than to say, they did have a BOSE radio in the suite which was great. For one of our days, we rented a cabanna at the Hideout pool for $175 for the day, this was well worth the money. My husband played some poker and won a little and we played a little on the slots and ended up willing about $400 on the Star Trek machine. We ate all our breakfasts in the buffet, which was excellent and one of our dinners. We also ate at the Italian restaurant, we asked for a nice quiet romantic table and I think they thought it was our anniversary as we had a free desert to share and as we left we were wished happy anniversary, which was nice even though it wasn\u2019t our anniversary.

When in Las Vegas, I prefer now to stay downtown, as I don't like the long walks between different places on the Strip. Of the places I have stayed at downtown, one has closed (Lady Luck), one was a dump the time I stayed there (Four Queens), and now the Nugget. The good: We were assigned a room in the Carson Tower. The room we had was well equipped, clean, and the beds comfortable. The valet parking service was very convenient (and free), especially when the temperature is over 100. The casino workers were relatively friendly, and the casino itself has a very classic look. This is a major step up from what Binion's has turned itself into (with the trashy looking blackjack dealers), or the low class casinos like the Las Vegas Club or Golden Gate. A friend who was traveling with us stayed in his own room, and was upgraded to the Rush Tower when he checked in on Sunday thanks to his Landry Select Club Membership. That was a gorgeous suite. The downsides: I myself got the Landry membership, but don't think I got upgraded. While that may have been due to the fact that we didn't check in until just before midnight on a Saturday, either no upgrades were available for a two bed suite, or the hotel clerk didn't know what to do with the Landry Club. After a long day of travel, we just checked in. Not that there was anything wrong with the room we received, but just thought they would have done better for us. Foodwise, we were disappointed with the choices we made there. We tried the lunch buffet, and I've had better. Very limited selection and not the greatest of food. Our Landry Club membership required a payment of $25, but that is refunded to you when you eat at a Landry restaurant. I also got $25 added to the card because of my birthday, so we went to eat at Red Sushi in the hotel.

We have stayed there years ago (before the huge remodel) and back then we enjoyed it but this place has forgotten all of the ideals that make people return to Las Vegas. For starters, for 2 of the 3 nights we stayed there, there was no parking available in the ramp for us. I have never in my life heard of a hotel that denied it's guests use of the parking garage! They put us in a remote lot 2 blocks away which was a huge inconvenience. If you going to increase the size of your hotel by adding several hundred rooms here is a tip- Add more parking!!! In addition to that, upon our arrival the registration desk for our tower was closed so we had to drag all of our luggage from the remote parking lot- to the other registration desk which had a wait time of about 30 minutes only to drag it all the way back to the tower we knew we were staying in. Those were the big inconveniences but we had several more complaints.They wanted $2 per cup for the low-quality coffee self-service in the rooms. How about a decent brand name if you want people to pay for coffee in their rooms? I won't even begin to get into how they apparently offer the same size small uniform to the girls working at the pool regardless of their size- the poor girls- give them a size that fits! The elevators were terribly slow and sounded like they were about to break down at any moment.

It was cool to see the Fremont Street Experience. We just drove to the strip, because you can park for free at most of the casinos/hotels along the strip. One of the main reasons we stayed here was because of the shark tank in the pool. According to several online sources, it is one of the top 10 hotel pools in the world. We thought the shark tank was pretty awesome. There are several varieties of sharks in the tank, and the waterslide that goes right through the middle of the tank. Would definitely recommend if you have kids or if you just like sea life like us. We didn't come to gamble, but to see the sights, and we thought this was a good value for the price, a pretty good location in relation to everything (if you have a car), and a neat unique experience at the pool.

Last year we stayed in a Gold Club room. This year we stayed in the new Rush Tower. We arrived Saturday at 2 o'clock to an empty check in counter and were warmly greeted and helped by JP. The check in area and elevators are off the beaten path so it was always less crowed and a quiet area. We stayed in room 8220 looking out over the parking deck and the far off strip. It was not a great view but staying downtown we understood there are not a lot of great views although last year we overlooked the pool which was nice.. The room was very similar to the the Gold Club room in color, decorations and furniture but with a much larger bathroom with a separate water closest. We did miss a TV in there the Gold Club bathroom had a tv in the mirror and very cool. The reports of the slippery bathtub are very true but there was a rubber mat that I suggest everyone use. We did that the second day and there after so really not a problem. The only issue for us that was mentioned in other post to was the lack of electrical outlets near the bed if anyone else has a CPAP machine. I had to pull out the night stand and unplug the clock no big deal since we really didn't use the clock or the built in Ipod player but an extra outlet or adapter would have been nice. I know we could have called and possibly got an extension cord or something. The room overall was comfortable, very clean and as quiet as any hotel room can be except for the occasional slam of a door or loud people talking as they walked down the hall past our room. Maid service was preformed efficiently everyday with plenty of towels and toiletries. Golden Nuggets staff was always pleasant, very helpful and they would stop and talk a minute with you. Casino has a good vibe with very good cocktail service. We play video poker and the selection was not great but 21 and craps tables were great fun. Did not eat at any of the on site restaurants this year but heard good things from other folks. Pool is great but yes crowded with kids so we skipped this year no big deal for us. The one thing we noticed at most casinos was the kids this year hanging out, Serveral youngsters were helping their father play video pokier in the Golden Nugget Casino, what a shame and where was security. Overall our second visit was a very pleasant experience again. In the future if we stay downtown we would definitely chose the Golden Nugget but probably stay in the Gold Club room and pass on the Rush Tower unless the prices were crazy between the too..", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLas Disneyland\u201d", "Author": "onered66", "ReviewID": "UR70218825", "Content": "Decent property with good service and selection in dining.

This is my third time staying here and it gets better each time.

So we choose to stay downtown because 1) the slots are looser, 2) the table game minimums are lower and 3) it\u2019s easy to casino hop since you don\u2019t have to walk for miles. The Golden Nugget is the nicest of all the downtown hotels. We stayed in the Carson tower, which is the oldest of the towers, but our room was clean, spacious, and nicely updated. We stayed in room #1276, a corner room very close to the elevators. It had a king-size bed, a small table with 2 chairs, a make-up desk with lighted mirror, and a big lcd tv. I wish the room had a coffee-maker and refrigerator, but thank goodness there is a starbucks at the bottom of the Carson tower so we\u2019d stop by every morning to start our day. The shark pool is gorgeous (and crowded) but sadly we did not find time to stop by. Check-in and check-out was quick. We checked-in around 6pm on Friday night and there were about 6 people in line. Suprisingly, it only took about 20 minutes. For check-out, we tried using the express checkout on the tv but it wasn\u2019t working. I called the front desk and explained that the express checkout wasn\u2019t working and she checked me out over the phone. The GN casino had a great vibe and the now that the rush tower construction is finished, the casino floor is lot a bigger. I really enjoyed playing their Wizard of Oz and Monopoly penny machines.

I'm torn between how much detail to share - as other reviewers give a minute by minute account of their vacation. So I'll just say this - the GN represents an older time in Vegas - great service and value. Value doesn't mean cheap - I've stayed on the strip and and have paid more for the room and food - I'm referring to true value. It appears the staff at the Golden Nugget are the only ones that realize we have choices as Vegas visitors and at every turn my expectations were exceeded. The food was great (coffee shop, Chart House, Vic and Anthony's). The room was fine - basic Gold Tower room - but it was newly furnished. We wanted to make it to the pool, but didn't. It's as nice as you'll find in Vegas. A final point - I rent a car in LV because cab fare adds up quickly if you casino hop (Hard Rock to Rio to Mandalay Bay etc). However, we did not use our car for one solid day of our short trip because downtown and the Golden Nugget met all of our needs - extraordinarily so. This includes the nightlife. By the way, as low stakes but persistent gamblers, the table minimums downtown are lower than on the strip. The GN will raise their minimums to $10 in the evenings - but lower them again after the peak periods. If you want try your luck at different casinos, they are just a short walk away.

For whatever reason I had gotten out of that habit, so it had been quite a few years since my last visit. With the opening of the Rush Tower, this seemed to be a good time for a return a visit. I checked in very quickly on the Monday evening I arrived. I was assigned a room on the 15th floor of the Rush Tower. The room was great! Nice size, flat screen tv, dvd player, a clock radio you didn't need a degree in engineering to set, comfortable bed, and large bathroom area. My only complaint would be that in facing Fremont St, it was very noisy each night until past midnight. I got up early each day to go golfing so a quieter room would have been of great benefit. I'd love to stay in the Rush Tower again, but only if I could get a room on the other side of the hall. I tried the buffet one night and would have to say I was underwhelmed. For a property this size I was expecting a much better selectin. The food available was ok, but given how great everything else was at the GN, the buffet was a disappointment.

My friends and I stayed in Carson Tower which are the older rooms but they were, nevertheless, very nice--pretty, clean and updated. The beds were extremely comfortable and I usually hate hotel beds. Our only complaint about the room is that there was no coffee pot and it's inconvenient to have to get dressed and go downstairs to buy coffee from Starbucks. The rest of the hotel is beautiful. We had one meal in the cafe that was good, reasonably priced and with good service. The staff that I dealt with were pleasant and helpful. The hotel is downtown, not on the strip, but it was easy enough to take the bus to the strip and having the bus ticket also allowed us to hop on and off the bus to visit the various strip hotels which are much farther apart than you might expect. All in all, if we were coming to the Golden Nugget only to play penny, nickel and quarter slot machines, this is probably a great place to stay since the strip hotels seem to have few of these machines. The problems we encountered however, outweighed the positives. We had done our research prior to our trip. Several hotels would have met our needs. But we chose the Golden Nugget because of the pool. The shark tank in the center was beautiful. We also liked that there was an adults-only pool. And we were intrigued by the water slide. None of us \"old folks\" had ever been on a water slide before and we'd decided that we were all going to go down it at least once. The day we arrived we were very tired and decided to hit the pool and hot tub to relax before dinner. Unlike other hotels we saw, The Golden Nugget has no sign at the door saying that you need a room key to swim. No one ever asked us for a room key during our entire trip although I was later told by an employee that someone is supposed to ask for it. When we arrived at the pool that first evening it was crowded with kids and we wondered if local families used it since no one was checking. We decided to bypass the crowd and we went upstairs to the adults-only pool which is small and shallow but very nice. Two days later when we came back from a day of sightseeing, we were anxious to visit the pool. Unfortunately, someone, probably one of the small children, had had \"an accident\" in the main pool and they'd had to shut it down for cleaning. It wasn't scheduled to reopen until the next day. Again we went to the small adults-only pool, however, we found kids splashing around there! About the time we were getting ready to get out and complain to a manager, the bartender came over and told the kids to leave. Their mother started arguing with him and said someone downstairs had given them permission to swim there. The bartender was polite but still insisted they leave. We were very appreciative. Unfortunately, there is no hot tub in the adults-only area. The hot tub is on the first level and open to everyone. On our first night there, we got in but almost immediately found that it wasn't a pleasant experience because there were so many kids jumping around playing games and even trying to swim in it. A sign says that kids need to be with an adult but they weren't. The sign also says it's recommended that kids stay in for 10 minutes only, due to health concerns I suppose, but these kids were there for the long haul. We never did visit the hot tub after the first night because every time we looked, no matter how late at night, kids were in it playing games and even tossing beach balls around. I expect a hot tub to be relaxing place to soak. At the Golden Nugget I found no opportunity to do that in 5 days. We never tried out the water slide either because the constant line of pushing and shoving children was more than we wanted to deal with. We never swam in the main pool with the shark tank. I understand why the Golden Nugget wants to make itself appealing to families. But I felt that this hotel catered to families with children at my expense. My friends and I were on an adult vacation. But we found little space the entire week to just relax with a drink in the water. If the Golden Nugget wants to be a family hotel that's fine, but they shouldn't be advertising themselves as a \"romantic getaway.\" Any newlywed couple would have been as disappointed as we were. We were particularly annoyed since there really is an easy solution to the problem if the management cared to address it. All the hotel would have to do is establish \"adult hours\" after 8 p.m. when the main pool closes anyway. We found it strange that the pool would close at 8 p.m. and disappointing, since we like to come back after a show for a midnight swim and it would have been nice to do so around the beautiful shark tank. Since the kids already can't swim after 8, why not just make all of the pool area adults-only from 8 until 2? That, at least, would give adults a chance to enjoy the hot tub which is now filled with kids all day and especially after 8:00 when the pool closes.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBegining a little bumpy at the Rush tower but improved.\u201d", "Author": "barbiep1199", "ReviewID": "UR68250368", "Content": "Arrived at 2:30 pm and the check in was a little slow.

We get to the room and there is smoke smell all over the room, we were wondering why we did not get a non smoking room, after the front ,check- in-lady, confirmed that we arranged for non-smoking room. We call the front desk and they apologized for sending us to the smoking area. Then they send a gentleman whom helped take our stuff two floors up and the room was so far from the elevator, seemed like we were never going to get there. We call and speak to the hotel manager and he hooked it up with free buffett tickets, which we picked up the last day of our stay. The check out lady was so rude when we explained our situation with the buffet tickets, the lady at the front desk was so rude, trying to talk over me when I was trying to explain to her our situation. When she finally spoke to somebody her attitude was somewhat different. So we get to the buffet, but the food was not that great, it was very dry and was only able to eat one plate of food. oh it gets better..... We go to the pool to chill out and gamble, the security asks us for our hotel key but we left it in the room because we had checked out, Besides we were just going to gamble which did not require a hotel key to get in the pool area. So my friend leaves to get money out of the ATM machine so we wait at one of the poolside chairs.

It is also very close to the Premium outlets with all the brand names.

However, after this weekend, I must... I must because I feel deceived and I'm angry. After extensive research and reading so many reviews, I decided to book the Golden Nuggets Hotel for a girls' weekend - it boasted as a 4-star hotel with great amenities, a shark tank pool, and awesome reviews by users. It ranked within the top 15% of hotels in all of Las Vegas according to trip advisor (higher than that of MGM, TI, etc. on the strip). I thought I had a pretty safe bet; what could possibly go wrong??? Let me tell you what went wrong... (1) THE ROOM: - The room was small and had the smell of \"old\" because everything was old - from the carpet, linens, towels, to the furniture. - The beds were much smaller than other 4-star hotels - thank goodness we are not curvy bodacious babes! - Our sink clogged up - we called maintenance and no one came... - There was a flat screen TV, but the remote didn't work half the time - don't even bother calling maintenance cuz they'll come up and step all over your stuff. - The knob below the shower faucet fell off. - No refrigerator - The lighting was very dim... maybe all the electricity were used to light the outside of the hotel. - Lastly, our room was about a mile away from the elevator. - Overall: This aint nothing more than a 2-star room. (2) THE SERVICE: The front desk and parking attendants were very nice. Everybody else sucked!!! They all wanted their turn to snap at us. The lady guarding the pool was especially rude and mean. Maintenance never came up to fix our broken sink; they did come up one time to fix a broken remote, and she was grumpy and stepped all over our stuff. (3) THE POOL AND RESTAURANT: The pool had a shark tank and slide... it was just ok nice. Great hang out for families with little kids - not so much for adults unless you want to get splashed all the time by the little rugrats - not their fault, i'd do the same if i was 9 years old :) I ordered chicken dumpling soup from the hotel cafe, I got canned chicken... food quality would be something you get in a cafeteria or denny's... how is this 4-star??? So that's my experience at the Golden Nugget - VERY VERY SUPER DISAPPOINTED!!! It's not even comprable to the 4-star on the strip.

We (there was two of us) arrived before check in time, and were able to get into our room in the Carson Tower. He offered us an upgrade to the new Rush Tower for only a total of $60 more, which we would have gladly taken, but they didn't have any rooms with two beds available, which we required. Next stay! The Carson Tower was fine for us, and we had no major complaints. The room was fine, clean, good size. It had two comfortable beds, a sitting area, a separate table with makeup mirror outside the bathroom. The only problem we had, was at first the internet wouldn't work, both wired and wireless. I tried repeatedly and kept getting an error message that my name didn't match the hotel record's for that room. It took 3 calls to the desk before it was resolved, 1st call noone answered, 2nd call a message was left and they didn't call back, 3rd call they responded and said they'd send a guy up. They did, and oddly, when I tried it when he came up, it worked, and was fine from then on. I don't know if they fixed something at the desk or what. I can't comment on the restaurants, as we didn't eat at any of them, besides the Starbucks, of which they have two in the hotel. I ate at The Buffet and the Carson Street Cafe though 7 yrs ago, and both were good then, but I can't comment on how they are now. We ate at the Main Street Station buffet after all the good reviews I read about it on here, and it didn't disappoint. Lunch was a good price, with great variety and it was all good quality. I'll definitely visit again on my next trip! We also ate at the Cafe Binion, inside Binion's, basic menu with good prices, and was also a good meal. We didn't use the pools, but passed by The Tank, the pool with the fish and the sharks with the waterslide that goes right through the tank going to and from the elevator every time. It looked nice, the chair/chaise lounge rental prices are $10/$20, which I imagine go quickly on summer days. The business center at the hotel is 3 computers by the Carson Tower elevators, there's a fee for their use, and also to print out boarding passes. The hotels nearby all had a similar setup. The timeshare sellers tried to stop us right when we were headed to the elevator right after we checked in, as we had to walk by their desk to get to our tower's elevators. They are also by the doors on Fremont Street, as others have mentioned. We got stopped 4 times the whole trip, 3 at the Golden Nugget and once at Planet Hollywood. The one time the woman at the door made a beeline for me right on to Fremont Street when she saw me coming inside. I guess I met her target group. We didn't have a car, so to get to the Strip, we took the ART bus from Fremont Street, the stop was across from the El Cortez. The stop where we got dropped off was right across from the GN's main entrance, so that worked out well. We took the ART to the Bellagio, and got it back from Paris. You can also get the Deuce bus at the same stop on Fremont Street, and it makes more stops, some the same as the ART. The ART was fine, except it can get very crowded, and is slow. Overall, it was a good stay, and I'll probably stay there again eventually, though my next trip, I'll probably go back to one of the Strip hotels.

Both the valet and hotel staff are exceptionally efficient and the service is top-notch. Rush Tower room is just as described on the site. The bathroom is very nice and roomy with the dual sink vanity, large shower, and separate toilet room. The studio is roomy and nicely decorated with the LCD TV and extremely comfy bed and pillows \u2013 best ever for us. Our view from room 20122 was of the strip and the mountains, very nice. The Golden Nugget casino is very nice, we also enjoyed seeing Binion\u2019s, 4 Queens, and Fitzgerald\u2019s, but we enjoyed returning to the Golden Nugget. I think all of these casinos are probably favorites to different people. Pool \u2013 The pool is much smaller than we expected, and that\u2019s because of the shape and the tank in the center. It\u2019s pretty at night with the lighting but we didn\u2019t spend as much time in the pool as we had wanted to. The seating area with the \u201csofa beds\u201d and tables were very comfortable however. Sun is in and out due to the 3 towers surrounding the pool. The upper pools are less busy of course because of the charge. Fremont Street Experience \u2013 The light show is amazing, especially when the real show starts. But my favorite sight was the neon lights on all of the casinos. Vegas Vic and all of the other lights and images \u2013 this is the Las Vegas we were looking for! And the vendors aren't hawking you as you walk the street - very comfortable and clean. Dining - Vic\u2019s & Anthony\u2019s steakhouse at the GN \u2013 I enjoyed the best steak I\u2019ve had in years. This strip steak was exquisite! The au gratin potatoes are to die for as well. My wife tried the king crab pasta dish and was not excited about it and probably wished she had ordered the filet. But she enjoyed the king crab that was already deshelled. Grotto Italian restaurant at the GN \u2013 My wife loved the rigitoni & meatball dish, and I enjoyed the pizza. The food is excellent at this restaurant. Golden Gate Casino shrimp bar & deli \u2013 Just down the street from the GN, the \u201cBest Tail in Town\u201d is a must. Very good shrimp cocktail for the price ($1.99 & $2.99), and the French dip sandwich is good too. The deli is a fun place to people watch. Shows \u2013 We missed the RatPack at the Plaza, unfortunately. We were counting on the Frank & Barbara show at the Riviera but they were out of town, it turned out. We did see Gordie Brown and were a little disappointed, but there were some good moments. We really enjoyed Terry Fator and the Blue Man Group, these are excellent shows. Terry Fator has to be the best performer in Vegas at the moment. One last note on the level of service here \u2013 A Golden Nugget hotel guest tossed an ashtray from their Gold Tower room and smashed our rental car rear window \u2013 nice. We were picking it up to go to Planet Hollywood for lunch when the valet and security staff informed us of the recent damage (I used the valet option because it is so much easier and costs only a few dollars - I would definitely recommend going that way after this experience). The rental company needed the car returned before they would release a replacement, and that meant they would need to have the car towed to their airport location. They advised we should follow the tow truck and pick up the replacement. Right\u2026 The lead valet, Barry, talked to the rental company and the tow company for us to ensure everything was being taken care of. He went the extra step and found that the tow was 2 hours away and said the hotel limo was at our disposal for the remainder of the day and night if we needed it. That was a great gesture on their part, and we decided to stay at the GN until the car was picked up and then take the limo to the airport. Barry and the security officer then followed up with a very generous lunch voucher for our troubles - that was the first time I had ever ordered filet and a shrimp cocktail for lunch! So we want to acknowledge the level of service this staff went to in assuring our satisfaction. We\u2019ve experienced many 4 \u2013 5 star hotels and resorts and the service at the GN is excellent. Needless to say we will be staying here when we visit Vegas again. The Golden Nugget is a very comfortable hotel and the service is consistently exceptional.

At the Fremont Street itself you don't find so many young people like at the strip. The casinos are smaller, the walking ways shorter. You can like it or not... but you really need to see this part of Vegas, too! At the hotel there is a nice pool with a waterslide through an aquarium with sharks and other big fishes, but you can not see it on the slide, because it is very quick. If you don't like so much action you can chill at one of the sun decks or at the jaccuzi. The staff at the reception are very frindly, so we got a very nice room at one of the higher levels with strip view. Nice room, no long ways to walk.

This was our fourth stay in 5 years and we have never been disappointed. This was our first time staying at the new RUSH Tower and we highly recommend it. The entrance is stunning and we felt seperated from the more crowded casino part, which we liked. The rooms were so cozy and well appointed that it was truly hard to leave them. The ebony wood colours and the leather couch were nice touches that you don't see anywhere else in standard rooms. The bathroom...well that was large enough to be a bedroom. There were french doors that opend up to a spaciously appointed bathroom. Top of the line Gilchrist and Soames tolietries. We paid $69.00 each night and had two rooms (travelled with my parents-their first time in Vegas) for these brand new rooms. This included the Golden Nugget coupon book that had 2-1 breakfast and lunch buffet coupons that we used and 2 free drinks. How can you go wrong to have a breakfast buffet for $10.80 for the two of you and you are not hungry until dinner? Then there was a happy hour special at Grotto (wood oven pizzas) and we had $5.00 pizzas and $3.00 belinni's or wine from 2-6pm. Truly an economical yet beautiful time at the Golden Nugget. Hats off to the pool area once again. My mom was able to relax in comfort by the pool and yet stay out of the direct sun on one of their spacious couches with awnings. We were able to enjoy sliding down the shark tank never tire of that) and sit in the sun. Great spot for a relaxing few days when you want to get away from it all!

Once we finally made it to the hotel, I was cautiously optimistic. We booked into the Rush Tower. Our only complaint at this point was the lack of front desk staff. This seemed to be an ongoing problem as we regularly passed by the check in during our 5 night stay. Other than that, we have virtually no other complaints. The Rush Tower rooms were very nicely appointed, clean, comfortable, quiet, modern and roomy. They even provided little extras such as a DVD player and alarm clock with an ipod dock. I did notice the lack of a bar fridge tho. Although I'm not a big mini bar drinker, the fridge would have been handy for juice and other items. The hotel itself had a completely different feel than the Strip. It actually seemed cozier and more welcoming. Not quite as pretentious as some of the other hotels. We've stayed at the Mandalay Bay, the MGM, and the Monte Carlo on some previous visits and enjoyed the Nugget just as much. The pool at the Nugget has recently undergone some significant renos to the tune of $20,000,000 I'm told. It was quite nice but perhaps a little small in regard to seating area but we still were able to find places to sun ourselves. Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse in the Nugget was another stop of ours. Definitely a great meal. We left completely satisfied after about a 2 hr dining experience. Fantastic food and worth the visit! We also checked out the Italian bistro just opposite the pool. Excellent service and also great food! Try the pizza with chicken! The Cafe was also quite good and offered a good selection of food for a decent price. You can walk out of the Nugget onto Freemont Street. Also a cool experience. A number of places to grab slushy drinks and cheap food. We found a couple of nice pubs down at the far end and enjoyed some good food and cold drinks. If you want to do some shopping, the new outlet stores are a short cab ride away. $12 or so. Excellent selections and plenty of options. If you want to make it over to the Fashion Show Mall, cab ride there and also to the Strip is about $20-25. One other thing...we had originally only planned to stay at the Nugget for 3 nights and then move to another hotel for a change. We decided to stay a couple extra nights at the Nugget. I called down to extend. No muss no fuss. When we checked out though, as is my usual custom, I simply do the quick check out and didn't check my bill. They had quoted me a different price on the phone for the two nights than what they charged. My bill was significantly more than I expected. 3 weeks later, I called the Nugget, advised them of the price I was quoted and what I was charged. Within a day, they had refunded the difference to my card. Thank you to Rosa in accounting :) We enjoyed our stay and found the rooms to be an excellent value. The different feel from the Strip was a nice change. We would definitely recommend the Golden Nugget, Rush Tower to any who want a cozier environment, a bit smaller scale of hotel and a change from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cBest Place to stay in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "jclark1421", "ReviewID": "UR66623442", "Content": "Every five years, my husband and I return to Las Vegas to celebrate our anniversary.

We'd pre-booked a twin-bed room with \"view of the Strip\" and, as I'd also requested VIP Check-in, I was told by the reservations staff that the room was pre-assigned. Arrived at the new hotel entry for the Rush Tower. Valet staff and bell boys helpful as ever but VIP check-in was closed. Indeed we never saw it open. Not much point providing it, really. Also, quite often we noticed the standard Rush Tower check-in was close at quieter times. In both cases this means a haul round to the main check-in area which is all a bit of a pain after a long journey. Not the friendliest of welcomes in the main VIP check-in, compared to previous occasions and, when we got to the room, it was not south-facing (closest you get to a Strip view from here). So all the way back to \"VIP\" check-in when I was advised that all the twin rooms are on that side. So how come I was told I'd been \"pre-allocated\" a twin room with a \"Strip view\". I never found out the answer to that but was given a King bed room with a South facing view. Room was great and you can glimpse bits of the Strip but still a better view than we would have had. (Though not important to some, we do like a bit of a view). After that bit of hassle we really enjoyed the stay and standards at the Nugget remain high. The new rooms and furnishings, especially the bathroom area, were very nice indeed. No coffee machine, of course (we bring a travel kettle) there is a safe in the room, FS TV, and expensive Wifi access. Have given a lower rating for service due to the reservation and check-in problems and the attitude of the check-in staff. All other staff were most helpful and friendly. It did seem very quiet in the Rush Tower area though (bar, check-in and gaming). But the Valet car return was always pretty speedy. Another oddity for a new facility was the waiting area for the Valet consisted of a couple of benches perched on a curb. Odd they had not thought about a proper waiting area when they planned this project. Also, we are not sure we would pay the extra for a Rush Tower room next time, nice as they are.

After driving for 8 hours (and arriving at 1:00am) we walked into the hotel only to find the check in process very confusing. The hotel has two different towers and two different check in areas. We waiting in (what we realized was the wrong one according to the posted signs) for about 15 minutes and then thought we were at the wrong registration, so we left our spot in line and walked to the other registration desk where it said \"Carson tower.\" Guess what? It was closed so we had to walk back with all of our luggage and start our wait over. 15-20 minutes later we were greeted and advised that the hotel did not have anymore non-smoking rooms... ARE YOU KIDDING??? What kind of hotel expects a tenant to stay in a smoking room when they don't smoke?? Especially after the guest RESERVED a non-smoking room?? Our front-desk person told us she would get the manager and asked us to step aside. Approximately 10 minutes later the manager comes out and advises us that when we reserved a non-smoking room it was actually only a request; they do not guarantee non-smoking rooms... FUNNY, I have never had this happen at any other hotel... EVER! After about 10 minutes of back and forth amazingly enough a non-smoking room became available. We got to our room about 2:00am and lights out! The accomodations were 3.5 star, comfortable with higher-end toiletries. The next day while at the pool we found out that (even though we gave our credit card to the front desk) the front desk didn't register it... so back to the waiting game... this went smoothly, but only after a 20 minute wait in line. While in line I observed a manager having a verbal confrontation with a guest... I am not sure what the complaint was, but the guest was threatening legal action and the manager didn't seem to be responding appropriately or maturely! The manager on duty this day looked like a 25 year old kid! After the manager finished with that guest he was being awaited on by another unhappy guest... This seemed to be some sort of room problem and the guest was not happy about a reservation he made (and had evidence of) and the hotel didn't have that room available... the guest ended up leaving (I guess to stay at another hotel.) I did not witness nor did I have one positive interaction with any hotel employee the entire time I was there. One morning while at the hotel cafe, while delivering my (wrong order) food, the waitress told me that \"I didn't tell her that\" in regards to how I ordered my eggs... Seriousely, be more tactful... say \"I must have missed you saying that\" or something of that nature... Do these people not work in customer service??? OH, one more discusting thing... Upon arriving at our room at 2:00am the first night I went to the rest room and found that our sink hadn't been cleaned. This wouldn't have been so gross if it wasn't for the fact that it had tobacco chew juice all over it!! In terms of the hotel, except for this, it was nicely cleaned and everything worked in proper order. In terms of customer service -- NO WAY would I EVER consider staying at the Golden Nugget again!

I've stayed at pretty much every luxury hotel on the strip, and downtown Las Vegas offers a welcome change to the giant casino resorts, with the Nugget being the \"best in class\" downtown and worth a look. The Nugget is in the center of the downtown casino district on a pedestrian only street with all the casinos and souvenir stores in the area just outside your door. This central location provides a variety that should certainly be experienced. The Hotel - The Golden Nugget is comparable with many of the smaller 4 star resorts on the strip (think Paris or Bally\u2019s, nicer than the Monte Carlo, not comparable to the mega resorts like MGM, Caesars or Mandalay Bay). The rooms are smaller than what you'd find on the strip (we stayed in the updated Gold Tower), but they are well laid out with quality materials (comfy beds with high-count linens, large plasma TVs). The bathrooms are small for Vegas (like standard hotel bathrooms...one sink, toilet, tub). The new pool at the Nugget is an incredible complex...the best of any hotel of its size in the city. It was packed in late May and they need to upgrade their music at the pool level, but it's a beautiful, clean, fresh complex with tons to look at. We suffered one poor experience that I feel compelled to share. The ice machine on our floor had seemingly not been serviced/cleaned in some time, as we noticed slime in our ice bucket after the ice had melted (wish we saw it before). We both suffered from bouts of \"stomach discomfort\" earlier that day (after consuming the bad ice), and can't help connecting the two. When I brought the ice bucket down to the front desk late that night to complain, the clerk simply stated that he would call maintenance to have the machine repaired; the manager was not called and nothing else was said. Definitely not up to 4 star standards from that experience, but it was the exception for our stay and not the rule. Without this event, I would have scored our stay 4 stars, but it did happen and it put a damper on an otherwise great stay. So the net is that we loved the downtown experience. The location of the Nugget ; the freedom to roam without the long walk between casinos was very convenient, and there was a feeling that the staff everywhere downtown was just a little bit friendlier.

I had often gambled at the Nugget but had never stayed at the hotel. With a fantastic promotion, I took advantage of staying here instead of lesser expensive properties downtown as is my norm. Our checkin process was fairly smooth at 11 am, a room with double beds in the Carson tower was available so we spent maybe 15 minutes at the desk before entering our room. The room was attractive and very comfortable and though the bathroom was a bit small it was adequate for our needs. The decor was a bit dated but more reflective of an older Vegas feel than disregard. It was neat, clean and very functional. Actually, I enjoyed our room at the Nugget more than our room at the Monte Carlo. The only restaurant we patronized on-site was the buffet for brunch. It was unappetizing but acceptable with a 2 for 1 coupon at $11. The Cafe was well-attended and we probably should have eaten there for a quick bite. The casino is my favorite downtown. The gaming selections are the best downtown, the seats are very comfortable and the atmosphere more upscale despite constant walk-ins from Fremont St. The cocktail service on the floor continues to be the best downtown if not in Vegas. The drink quality is consistently good and the cocktail waitresses friendly, efficient and attractive. The property in general is equal to or even superior to many on the Strip. The ammenities are good and coincide to the price paid for a room. The sports book is well-appointed, comfortable, and intimate. To me, it is a bit small to stay for too long. The multi-tiered pool area is compact yet very nice with a nice choice of loungers and a European option. The massive saltwater aquarium and waterfalls at the pool's center are very unique and attractive features even featuring a waterslide through the shark-infested aquarium. It was a fun place to spend a few sunny hours with good drink service but its smallish size was impacted by the number of children in the area - some unattended - that negatively impacted the experience. This was a major annoyance. Since the Fremont St area is fairly compact, it is very easy and fun to access the other hotel/casinos/restaurants in an evening as well as the light and sound show under the canopy. It is due to this ready access that the Golden Nugget stands out decisively as the premier property downtown and an excellent alternative to the LV Strip for those seeking less hype and expense with a comfortable, \"old Vegas\" vibe.

First time we stayed downtown and really liked it overall! Line at check in desk was minimal. (Saw it was longer later on though.) We got a room on the 16th floor in the Carson Tower (south tower), non smoking which is what we requested in advance. Room was quite nice; clean, spacious, marble counter in bathroom, flat panel TV. The bathroom even had a regular rug with plastic backing, which is a lot nicer to have than the towel-type bathrugs. No view to speak of out our window, but you could see the LV Hilton if you craned your neck a bit. I was not there for the view anyway. Bed was comfortable as well. I thought the room was quite nice. The rooms at GN are far nicer than comparably priced rooms I've had on the strip. It was quiet too. People say it is a long walk to the Carson Tower rooms but I think it is far less walking than you'd do at any strip hotel. We had no issues with housekeeping. They came a bit later on Sunday as I'm sure lots of people checked out but they showed up eventually. There are timeshare people near the elevators, just keep walking.... We ate at the Carson Street Cafe late at night on our first night for breakfast. Service was great and food was also quite good. Also ate at the Chart House on our last evening. Walked in without a reservation and got right in on a Monday night. We had a nice table right by the fish tank. It was a lot of fun to watch the fish during our dinner. I had the scallops with risotto and DH has the scrimp scampi. Both were excellent and service was perfect. Played a bit in the casino, mostly slots and did not have great luck. Drink service was pretty good though. Had better luck on slots at other Fremont street casinos. The pool was VERY crowded on Saturday, a little less so on Sunday. Tried to reserve chairs for Sunday at the new Hideout pool but it closed due to high winds. Too bad they did not tell us earlier so we could've grabbed pool chairs. People play the pool chair game and leave towels on chairs and return 2+ hours later. Wish they could put a stop to that. Water slide is very cool though! Also visited lots of other casinos and restaurants DT. One nice thing aobut Fremont street is that you can easily walk from one casino to the next much more quickly than you can on the strip.

The decor was funky, but I can appreciate Vegas better than the average person. It was clean, bedbug free (very important!) and spacious. I had fun sitting at the vanity and preparing to go to a wedding. My hubby was very worried about being stuffed into a depressing room, but that did not happen. It helped that he made friends with a bird that would come to the window and share his starbux muffin every morning. The pool had no available chairs by the time we got there , but we rolled in pretty late, but as I said before, we enjoyed ourselves there.

I have never stayed Downtown before but I am familiar with the area. Booked a 2 room suite for $135 a night. Arrived mid-afternoon. Since I had booked a suite it entitled me to VIP checkin. Very quick and I was in my room within minutes. Room was very large and clean and had 2 full bathrooms, one with a jacuzzi tub. Excellent, well appointed sitting room and a very nice wetbar with Marble countertops, fridge and sink. Bedroom was large with an excellent king size bed. Two 42\" LCD TV's, one in each room and a coffee maker in the room! Unheard of at most places on the strip. View was not good but it did not detract from my stay. I chose a smoking suite and apparently they only have one suite that is smoking. Pluses are many, including the staff. The only minus was the buffet. Found it expensive for dinner and slow service. Valet parking was excellent, never waited more than 4-5 minutes for my vehicle. There is a Starbucks right in the hotel which was great. The hotel is clean and kept in good repair. The people are a little more mellow and the pace is just easier than the noise and confusion of the strip. The downtown part of Vegas, outside the Fremont Street canopy, can be sketchy. As long as you remain under the Fremont Street canopy, it is probably safer than the strip. There are security and police everywhere and there are none of the annoying \"card flickers\" or panhandlers to be seen. With \"buck a beer\" Heineken and all kinds of incentives, it is definitely more affordable than the strip. Every night they have free street perfomances, (musicians, dancers, etc.) and I found them to be quite entertaining. I like the fact that you can walk from your room to multiple other casinos with 2 minutes. Downtown is not as fancy as the strip and is the \"old Vegas\", but the payouts are definitely better. If you have never been to Las Vegas before, then stay on the strip, you will want to see the sights. If you have been to Vegas multiple times but have never stayed downtown, and are getting a little tired of the whole \"Strip experience\", then give the Golden Nugget a try and make sure you book a suite.

The Rush tower has a seperate lobby area - much quieter, different decor with a more exclusive feel. The room was beautiful and the largest/nicest we stopped in during our vacation. Seperate shower cubicle, his and hers sinks, large tv screen and a good sized sitting area. I also preferred the casino to many of the others.

We also had one of the best meals there during our stay in Vegas. Vic & Anthony's steakhouse was fabulous and where I had one of the best steaks in my life. It is expensive but is reputed as one of the finest steakhouses in all of Vegas. The exits on the Freemont side lead directly onto the street where the lightshow can be watched. Our only grumble was the pool area - it's just not big enough for the size of the hotel. Beds were limited and due to the enclosure of the hotel's towers people were moving beds throught the day to avoid the shifting shade. The pool is designed for dipping rather than swimming and is usually full of people stood in it watching the sharks/fish in the tank located in the centre of the pool, oblivious to others having to swim around them.

In terms of the casino there: I can't say i was lucky at anything although the baccarat was good to me.

We had a room with two queens and it was big enough for the two of us. A nice perk (that we hardly used) was the huge, flat-screen TV in the room. Also, I want to note that we took the Gold bus to the strip multiple times. It only costs $3 per person to get to the Strip on this bus. This Gold bus is the EXPRESS bus, stops right across the street from one of the Golden Nugget's exits (on the Freemont Street side), and takes you to the heart of the strip in just 20 or 30 minutes (getting to the strip takes maybe 15 minutes, but getting the Bellagio can be another 15 minutes longer due to the horrific traffic). Buses run VERY frequently, day and night. The longest we waited was just 20 minutes and that was in the middle of the night. So, take the GOLD Bus to get from the Golden Nugget to the Strip on the cheap! Buses were clean, safe, spacious, CHEAP, and FAST (especially compared to the slower public buses that stop every two minutes and take at least four times as long). The Golden Nugget staff told us about the Gold Bus and I will forever be in debt to the lovely man who told us about this. The pool is awesome. SHARK SLIDE!! We ate at the buffet for breakfast.

With the recent room renovations, great service, excellent food, outstanding price and relaxed location, I would highly recommend staying at the Golden Nugget.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cRush Tower is Outstanding\u201d", "Author": "mrjiggyfly", "ReviewID": "UR62813033", "Content": "I am a Vegas local and decided to treat myself to a two night staycation at the new Rush Tower at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas. The tower has its own valet area and its own front desk. Check-in was quick. I was in my room within 10 minutes of leaving my car at the valet. The room was very classy. It had a nice couch which made it easy to have a couple of friends hang out for a while. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the tv was very nice. Unfortunately, it didn't get the Versus network which was crushing to me as a big hockey fan. Oh well, no hotel is perfect. The bathroom is big and very nice also. I would agree with those who suggested bath mats for the shower as it was a bit slippery. The Golden Nugget also recently opened a second pool area (in addition to the phenomenal Shark Tank pool) for adults called the Hideout. It's beautiful. They do charge during the day to get in there. I paid $20 for a chaise lounge chair and I thought it was worth it. Fortunately, I went on a Sunday which I heard was far less crowded than Saturday. The Hideout is free after 5pm and is open til 2am I believe. It's a great place for evening cocktails. World class! The Italian restaurant in the hotel, Grotto, is very good in my opinion. I have eaten there several times and always liked it. I prefer downtown Vegas to the strip because you can walk to several casino in just a few minutes. The strip if far more grandiose and it takes a long walk to move from one hotel to the next. The gambling is also cheaper downtown than on the strip (though the Golden Nugget is more expensive than the other downtown casinos). The staff was very friendly across the board during my stay. The addition of the Rush Tower and the Hideout makes a great hotel even better.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "hartford, ct", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "whalerfan", "ReviewID": "UR62629204", "Content": "I have never stayed downtown but decided to when I attended NAB this year.

We booked a Carson (South) Tower room and when making our reservations online, we requested a room on the top floor, away from the elevator and the noise from the Fremont Street Experience, and we received a room on a high floor at the end of the hall overlooking Casino Center Boulevard. There were eight elevators in the Carson (South) Tower, and we never had to wait long, no matter if we were on the main floor or coming from our room. The walk to the casino was quite far for a downtown hotel, so if you are elderly or have trouble with mobility, try and request a room in the Gold (North) Tower. As you walk from the Carson (South) Tower to the casino, you pass a Starbucks, the gift shop, a restaurant, the swimming pool, and the front desk. The large room included two queen-sized beds, each with three pillows on them, a clock radio, two comfy chairs beside a round table, one regular chair next to the make-up table, a large HD television with about 20+ channels and a remote, and an iron/ironing board in the closet area, along with an extra pillow. We also found the doors slammed quite loudly, so we tried to close them as quietly as possible during our early morning gambling excursions. The medium-sized bathroom included three sets of towels, bottles of shampoo, conditioner and lotion, as well as a bar of soap. There was a very nice handle in the shower, that my mother was able to use to get in and out of with ease. The parking garage is across from the hotel on First Street and was almost always full. If you are staying at the Golden Nugget, you will be issued a parking permit which you will show, along with your parking ticket, to exit. The casino is very large and crowded, with not much space to move around in. Despite staying four nights, my mother and I gambled elsewhere during our stay, as past visits to the Golden Nugget's casino resulted in empty pockets.... The hotel is located in the Fremont Street Experience area, within walking distance of quite a few casinos. At night there is a light show, which is very entertaining. After taxes, the average rate per night for our room in the Carson (South) Tower came to $54.39 U.S. Funds.

I booked online with no problems. My husband and I fly standby, and it looked more likely that we would get out to Vegas if we left a couple days earlier, so I called the hotel reservation line - again, no problems, added two nights for a reasonable cost. Flew in late and arrived at the hotel - the check in desk was hard to find, and when found for our tower (there are four), it was closed. We then had to walk halfway across the hotel and through the crowded casino with our bags to the nearest tower's desk. We use a debit card for travel, rather than a credit card, and upon checking in, had a nice man who neglected to tell us that they would be placing a hold on our card - $100 for every night booked IN ADDITION to the reservation's total balance. He also neglected to give us the \"$250 in savings!\" coupon book that was supposed to be part of the Travelzoo promotion. The next day was rainy, so we didn't stray far from the hotel and didn't know our checking account had been completely tied up with this pre-authorization charge until we went to the buffet for dinner and couldn't charge $30 because our card was declined. Upon checking our account, we found out that there was only $27 left in it after this Pre-Authorization. Went to the front desk to complain, and was brushed off by a woman who said \"we'll call your bank in the morning\" without taking our bank's phone number. Needless to say, they didn't call, and we went down to the desk again and FINALLY got a person who cared, took all our information, informed us that the hotel's policy with debit cards is to do a hard charge for the whole owed amount and just turn off incedentals. Fine. So he brings this info back to the cashiers who have to release the charges - it took ALL DAY for them to release the charge, when they told us it would be a couple hours. We had no money to eat!! When we called the hotel, the cashier said, \"oh, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.\" WE WOULD LIKE TO EAT! The rest of the stay was fairly uneventful, and housekeeping was generally good until our last day when housekeeping just threw our toiletries onto the counter, gave us just two towels and didn't look like they changed the sheets. Plus was the bed was pretty comfortable (we stayed in Carson tower, the oldest). Very few amenities. Spa ridiculously expensive for a downtown hotel. Also, the website makes it sound like wired internet was free but you had to pay for WiFi - this is not the case, you have to pay for both. Luckily the Krispy Kreme down the street had free wifi. Location - not much to see or do in Downtown (Old) Las Vegas. Fremont Street Experience was nice, but that's it. We spent most of our time on the Strip - at Treasure Island no less.

It is very nice, luxurious and quiet. However, if you need electrical outlets you're in bad shape. There was one by the window and one in the bathroom. My husband has sleep apnea and has to use a C Pap machine at night. No plug-ins near the bed. The one plug in the bathroom is used to plug in the lighted make-up mirror so if you need to charge a cell phone, use a hair dryer or curling iron you have to unplug the light. Also the bathroom has inadequate lighting and it is difficult to see to apply make-up. The mirror is very high making it impossible to sit while putting on make-up or doing your hair. The bathtub/shower combination was very deep and you had to step way up over into it and out of it. The sides were so high that short or elderly individuals will find it very difficult to get in and out of. Now to the bed. The mattress was very thick but not comfortable. It sloped on the edges and at the head, making you feel like you had to sleep in the middle of the bed to keep from rolling off. The pillows were very plump looking but when you laid on them they went flat. They were down pillows. We asked to have them replaced with regular pillows and got very small ones that were a fiber fill that went as flat as the down pillows. We used the pillows from the couch(even though they were as hard as rocks) just so we could get our head up enough to keep from sliding into the headboard. We will continue to stay at the Nugget but will definitely not stay in the Rush Tower again. We are always perfectly comfortable and have all our needs met in the Carson Tower.

That was the only travel mistake I made. I took a taxi from the airport. Way too expensive. For the price I could have hired a town car. Next time either a limo or just take the shuttle. Checked in to the Rush tower and this weekend was packed so they upgraded me to the Gold Club room in the Gold tower. Reception was quick and Door man and receptionist were both great people. I had given my bag to Bill at the door. After realizing I would not be in the rush tower I told him what room I would be in and he said he would take care of it for me. I took 10 minutes and introduced myself to my new casino host. This is my first gambling trip to LV and it wont be my last. After she gave me an overview of the property I went upstairs to my floor and waiting for me was the Bellman (Ricardo) with my bag. I was very impressed the way I was treated having never been to LV. I am a AC and Connecticut casino player. You don't get treated like this in the east unless you are a diamond player. I like the fact that the dealers are on a first name basis. I felt like I was the king of the GN all three days I was there. I don't know why people complain about service. Not one person I came in contact with was anything but nice and very respectful and FUN to be around. One major difference between LV and AC is the alcohol. If you want to get trashed and throw away your money go for it. In AC they stop serving at 1 or 2 depending on the day of the week. I spent time downtown and on the strip. I didn't care for the smaller places downtown. The strip is what it is. Glitz and Glamour. It has it's place I walked the strip on Monday for 1 hour. Having people shove stuff at me as I walk all day is not my Idea of fun. My friend stayed at Harrahs in one of their Deluxe rooms. I went there and the room was 1/2 the size of mine. He and his girlfriend asked to meet my host and now they will be GN guests moving forward. The pool at the GN is fantastic. Next trip I will spend more time there. I like the fact that they have 2 separate areas for adults and families. Pool area fills up quickly. If I could give one tip that I noticed. whenever you go to a casino, If you play slots or table games, GET a players card and be rated. They do give out comps, Food, beverage, and rooms. It goes up from there for the serious players. I do not understand why people don't want to be rated. If you are going to give them your time and play at their casino why not take advantage of what they have to offer in return. I have been in the Mirage as well as Ballys and Caesars about 10 years ago in a more family vacation and limited gambling. The Golden Nugget in my opinion is the best. I only ate at the buffet one night and my friends and I ate at the buffet at Harrahs the other day. I liked them both. For the money the nuggets was a little better. Harrahs and their group offers the all day $30.00 deal which for some might really work out well. Next time I am at the GN I will definitly eat at the Grotto and Vic and Anthonys. They both looked great. My final piece of advice and you should think about this in all aspects of life, Treat people the way you want to be treated. Sometimes thing don't go as planned. If you are nice to a receptionist that doesn't have a room being nicer about it as opposed to getting upset with probably net you better results in the long run. If you are going to stay and play at a casino property. Ask for a casino host. They can usually help you. You dont need to be betting $100 per hand at a table game but at $25 or so you will be surprised at what you can get. If you remember nothing else from this review. 2 things, no matter how bad your life is somebody else is always worse off than you. Don't let little stuff bother you because somebody elses house burnt down or drifted away in a flood. You are partying or on Vacation in a great city. Enjoy yourself and have fun.

We went to the deli at the Golden Gate, and they would not allow children in their deli. However, went to the Freemont Casino for shrimp cocktails and they did allow him in their deli area. Also ate at the Main Street Station- few blocks off of Freemont. This is a huge sports bar/micro brewery. Very good food and inexpensive. Across from the Nugget at the Four Queens they have a \"half -price/discount\" booth for Vegas shows which is very convenient.

My review follows. We stayed in a Gold Club VIP room on the 17th floor in the Gold Tower. Check-in and check-out were super fast using the VIP lounge. No wait at all. A coupon book was given to us which included some great deals and freebies for the bars, buffets, restaurants, and other services. VIP rooms also come with buffet and coffee shop line passes - which we never had to use, and free access to the Spa and Internet. VIP rooms required key access in the elevator to reach the VIP floors. Elevators were fast during our stay. The room was clean and spacious, but very dark due to the color scheme, wood accents and furnishings. The king-size bed was comfortable, and the cleaning staff was timely and diligent. The room was quiet, since it faced the Rush Tower and mountain views (i.e., faced away from Fremont Street.) I recommend that you request the same if you're a light sleeper and/or retire early. The room, however, also had some considerable drawbacks. There was a lack of usable drawer space, and the closet was actually located in the bathroom, which we found to be highly inconvenient. The doors for the closet were the self-closing type, which was also a nuisance. The corners of the bed frame were sharp, and I actually cut my leg when I bumped into one. The bathroom fixtures were also of industrial design, with sharp edges and square corners on the faucets. The biggest problem in the bathroom though was the height of the step required to get in to and out of the bathtub and shower, and the shower head itself: it was a rainfall design, and had very low water pressure. Also, the TV that was in the mirror did not work, but that was not a big deal to us. Given the above, I'm not sure the amenities provided for a VIP room and the room itself is actually worth the price. We will definitely come back to the Nugget, but next time may try either a Rush Tower or standard room instead. Either way, we will definitely purchase VIP service, as that is a big time saver. As for the casino, the layout was somewhat confusing at first but easily learned by walking around and/or using the property map provided at check-in. The staff was very friendly. Waitress service was generally pretty quick. All of the standard games are here, along with the standard table limits for a downtown casino (depending on the time of day and number of gamblers). I saw a small keno lounge and a decent-sized sports book. There are a vast number of different types of slot and multi-game video poker machines available in the casino as well. There were a number of bars, all offering excellent drink selections (beer and well drinks) and video poker at the bar. Service at the bars we sat at was quick and friendly. We did not stop at any of the trendy bars or night spots on the property, so no comment on those. We ate at 3 of the restaurants: the Buffet, the Carson Street Cafe, and Lillies Asian Cuisine. Breakfast at the Buffet was good, cheap (with a 2 for 1 coupon) with varied selections. There were also 2 omelet stations as well. We had a comped dinner there as well, and overall it was good, again with a wide selection of offerings. We had a late-night meal and breakfast at the Carson Street Caf\u00e9, and both times the food and service was excellent, with decent prices for the meals. Finally, we had dinner at Lillies one evening, and although the restaurant was somewhat price, the menu and food was outstanding. We did not make use of the Spa, or the pool. The pool itself seemed interesting \u2013 with a Shark tank in the middle of it \u2013 but it also seemed a bit small. On the day I was intending on using the pool, a convention at the hotel had the entire area reserved for an event. I feel the VIP staff should have let us know this at check in to that we could have planned accordingly. If you are going to stay at the Nugget, or any other Las Vegas hotel for that matter that may host a convention, you may want to check first at http://www.pcap.com/lvconv.htm so you are aware of a potential competition for the hotel\u2019s resources. All in all our stay was very pleasant and except for some minor annoyances, we will come back to the Nugget to stay and gamble.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for the price - Do your Homework!\u201d", "Author": "SantaDog", "ReviewID": "UR61346174", "Content": "We came back to the Nugget as the price is great and we like the Fremont Street Experience as opposed to the Strip where it is just to chaotic for us.

We stayed in the Gold Tower as opposed to the Carson Tower last year. Rooms a bit nicer and more centrally located. We asked to be near an elevator and they were happy to take care of us. The Fremont Street Casino's are a lot \"looser\" and more fun to be at and the drink people come around every 5 minutes instead of every 2 hours on the strip and you can also play $3 or $5 Blackjack. The Fremont Street Experience Light Show is a lot of fun so take a camera or video camera. The new pool on the 3rd floor is nice as its adults only but it tends to get a bit windy up there.

Some of downtown can be a bit run down in comparison to the Strip - but it is reflected in the prices, but the Golden Nugget is definately an exception. We stayed in the new Rush Tower and the room was just fantastic. Massive bathroom with twin sinks, a rain shower and a tub. A huge bed, massive flat screen TV, DVD player, Ipod dock and the usual mini bar etc, plus a corner sofa lounge space - and all really modern. I would say the room quality is on a par with Caesars and other Strip hotels ! The casino has a really nice atmosphere too and is really well kept...the pool area looked fantastic - it was a bit cold to try it out, but we had a look around and although looks a little crowded with the beds close together, the pool and the slide that goes through the big fish tank was great. We had a great meal in Vic and Anthony's steakhouse and it was the most amazing steak ever...done in butter and just melt in the mouth !! We also used the Spa, and although it doesn't have the modern feel of some of the ultra spas on the strip - it was really nice and the treatments were fantastic. We would defintately stay here again, my advice if you want to get the best of Vegas and are staying for four days or more would be to do a couple of nights downtown at the Golden Nugget and enjoy all that downtown has to offer and then move and stay a couple of nights on the strip - that way you get the best of both worlds.

It is located relatively close to the outlets (whihc we walked to one day). The hotel itself just built a brand new tower & pool to go with it. THIS MAKES THE HOTEL! The new tower has gorgeous rooms & has an awesome adult only pool called The Hideout. The larger \"family\" pool is located just below it on the ground floor of the hotel and is just as nice but the chairs are very close together and one side gets the sun in the morning & the other side in the afternoon. The Hideout pool is phenomenal; quiet; waitress service with reasonable drinks and adults only. =) (Hint: Get chairs as far left as you can when you walk in- those have the sun the longest on that deck.) We ate at the Carson St Cafe & Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse. Vic & Anthony's was to die for; I had filet mignon that melted in my mouth.

The week-day rate for a room in Golden Nugget\u2019s new Rush Tower was very reasonable and the pictures (on their web site) of the accommodations looked inviting. Upon checking in, we were not disappointed and in fact were truly impressed with the entire stay. The Rush Tower has it\u2019s own check-in desk, which we didn\u2019t know, so we stood in a short line at the main check-in desk, while the other desk would have probably checked us in immediately. (Be sure to park or ask the taxi driver to drop you off at the Carson Street entrance if you\u2019re staying in the Rush Tower) Besides a friendly valet and quick service, the front desk for the Rush Tower has the gorgeous 75,000 gallon tropical aquarium from the Chart House as their backdrop. There is no traipsing through the casino to get to the elevator to take you up to your room, it\u2019s just around the corner. Our room was incredibly clean, comfortable and well appointed with plenty of amenities. The d\u00e9cor was elegant, with rich woods, a flat screen TV, iPod docking station, leather sofas and handsome lighting. The bed and linens were very comfortable. The double-sink bathrooms were huge -- plenty of vanity space -- and a Raintree shower head that was wonderful. Everything was fresh and new -- ideally it\u2019s a \u2018look\u2019 they can maintain. We have only stayed this one time in the Rush Tower, so these are the only accommodations I can (highly) recommend. The room was outstanding, and at a great value. The renovated pool - now called \u2018The Tank\u2019 is a highlight of the property. In fact, it was recently listed by Budget Travel as \u201cOne of the World\u2019s Coolest Hotel Pools\u201d. In the center of the pool is a 3-story shark tank (all kinds of tropical fish!), a 3-story water slide and colorful private cabanas (on the second floor). There are wonderful lounge chairs, tanning beds and on the third floor there\u2019s a quieter pool with a bar (for adults). On the ground floor you can enjoy a drink from the H20 bar, sit in the huge Jacuzzi, or relax next to the handsome fire pit. (Plenty of lounge chairs and sun beds here, too!) There are also several Black Jack tables poolside. When we were there, the tables had a $5 minimum. The location definitely reminds you of where you are\u2026in the old part of \u2018downtown\u2019\u2026not on The Strip. This can be a pro or a con, depending on what you desire from your visit. This does not have the glitz and glamour of The Strip and it can get a bit seedy, the further you get from The Golden Nugget. That being said, there is security is everywhere. CASINOS: There are many hotels with minimum $5 (or less!) Black Jack tables -- even at night, with non-stop (complimentary) cocktail service. (this was during the week, so I can\u2019t vouch for the table minimum on the week-ends or during peak season) Although the Golden Nugget looks totally renovated, some of the other casinos are pretty shabby. RESTAURANTS: There are plenty of choices of restaurants. The two we chose were inside the Golden Nugget -- Vic & Anthony\u2019s and The Grotto (Italian) -- and both were very good. Besides those two, there\u2019s also the Chart House, Lillie\u2019s Asian Cuisine (with Teppanyaki tables), a classic Vegas buffet, Red Sushi, Carson Street Caf\u00e9 and a 24/7 \u201cGrille\u201d. There are several wonderful restaurants nearby that have carried a great reputation for years. (Hugo\u2019s Cellar, being one!) ENTERTAINMENT: There are a few places where you can catch a show. Gordie Brown is one (at The Nugget)\u2026and he has been recognized as Entertainer of the Year. The Rat Pack show at The Plaza Hotel gets great reviews and is just a block or two away. And speaking of being \u201ca block or two away\u201d\u2026that\u2019s a definite \u2018pro\u2019 of staying downtown. Rather than taking you ten minutes just to reach the front door of the hotel/casino where you\u2019re staying, in ten minutes you can be two casinos away! Another source of evening entertainment is the Fremont Street Experience -- high tech wonderment at its best. It\u2019s free entertainment overhead (fantastic light show to music), for length of about 5 football fields, and it\u2019s free!) If all of this bores you, you can take a cab ride or catch The Deuce (cheap, double-decker bus) to The Strip for more options on how to spend your money!

We originally booked a $99/night junior corner suite in the new Rush Tower. I prefer a separate tub from the shower, so we opted to upgrade to the East End Jr. Suite. This reservation is not available on their website or through an agent. You have to call direct to the GN for the upgrade because there are so few available. We paid an additional $50/night for the upgrade. It was SO worth it! We were in room 9215 and stayed 03/28 thru 03/30. Front desk at the Rush Tower presented a line and 1 attendant. The Chart House aquarium was in the backdrop, so at least you had something pleasant and relaxing to calm the frustration. The young man helping us was very pleasant. We arrived around 8AM and had our luggage held until we could check in. Because we had a suite, we were allowed to return to the VIP check-in. We returned around noon and our room was ready. VIP attendant was not friendly at all. I think she thought SHE was the VIP. It could've just been a very stressful day for her, working her shift on her feet in those heels and skin tight dress. A girl can only take so much for the sake of appearance. She was very pretty, so we'll stick with the good. Would've been great had she not opened her mouth to speak. Our suite was incredibly clean and amenities that satisfied our preferences. East End suites are 150sqft larger than the Jr. Corner Suites, overlooking the pool area. The bathroom has a huge walk in closet, large tiled rainfall shower, extra large soaking tub (easily fits 2), 2 separate sinks/vanities, and closed off commode. There is a table with 4 chairs, sectional leather sofa, and large flat screen in a sitting area. King sized bed, dresser and another large flat screen to watch while in bed. Our bed was very comfy. Turn down service was provided. Housekeeping did a fabulous job and was tipped accordingly. We invited our friends up to our room for some down time and we purchased a movie. The sofa sectional seating was very comfortable for 4. The pics on the GN website are exactly what you will get. It is still fresh and new and hopefully they will work diligently to maintain that. I would return to this suite downtown at GN in a heartbeat, probably before booking again at THEhotel, but the locations are apples to oranges. Downtown is old school, Rat Pack, Vintage Vegas, designed for hard core gamers, but not so much the experience of high end shopping and shows that we do enjoy - but that all being just a $25 cab ride away. Also, far fewer kids downtown than at strip resorts. It is a bit seedy once you step out of the Nugget onto Fremont Street, but I never felt unsafe. Lots of neon and old retired signage from what the strip was eons ago which is pretty cool, old Vegas charm. Security is everywhere and there are stages at either end of the Fremont Experience with continuous performances. I noticed maintenance workers cleaning along Fremont and I have to say, it was quite clean and unlittered, well maintained. The strip is actually far dirtier I believe. It's really nice to walk under the Fremont canopy from resort to resort with doors open to the street, always a place awaiting me on a $3-$5 minimum blackjack table with non-stop cocktail service. Good times and great fun. We did visit Wynn while there for an intimate night with Garth Brooks. What a performance, catering to only 1500 ticket holders. Stories of his childhood and songs/artists that influenced him along the way. Felt like I was sitting on his living room sofa, listening to him reminisce and belt out tunes from Bob Seger to Elton John to George Straitt, and many of his own. It was 2 1/2 hours of Garth, all accoustic, probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. When we picked up our tickets in a meeting room at Wynn, we were offered complimentary beverages and we were given complimentary passes to the buffet at Wynn with VIP seating - BONUS! It was a good night. A downtown dining experience this trip worth talking about; Hugo's Cellar - THE BEST dining experience we've had in Vegas, and we've had many. It's a total escape, very quiet, very romantic, superb service, and a great overall experience. We had so much fun gambling downtown, mostly amongst 40+ age range of people who would sit at the tables for hours together. Servers were very attentive and working hard for their tips. I don't think 20 minutes passed between server visits to the tables. They were very pleasant and they spoke proper English which I appreciate, as did the majority of dealers. A nice change for the better, comparted to the strip. Altogether a far superior gaming experience, compared to that of the strip. Hubby took 3rd in a poker tournament at GN and walked away smiling. Another good night! Golden Nugget Rush Tower is the only way to do Downtown Vegas and it is a far greater value than the same class/star rating resorts on the strip. Highly recommend! Oh yeah, one last thing worth putting out there - GN buffet makes Steve Wynn's momma's award winning recipe of bread pudding, worth the buffet price for that alone.

Not a 4 Star Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "KonaMona2", "ReviewID": "UR59968575", "Content": "I stayed at the Golden Nugget this past weekend hoping to have a fun, relaxing weekend. THE GOOD: The pool shark aquarium and the Chart House wall aquarium were interesting. I also liked our spacious room and the bath products stocked in our bathroom. THE BAD: Front Desk is poorly managed. We were welcomed by a 45 minute check-in line Friday afternoon. I observed the same l-o-n-g front desk lines on Saturday and Sunday as well. Why is such a long wait necessary when you have reservations? We stayed in the new Rush Tower where all rooms are supposed to be non-smoking. Maybe the rooms are non-smoking, but the hallway leading to our room was poorly ventilated and smoky. The toilet in our room greeted us by threatening to overflow on first flush. All tower rooms are also supposed to have 42\u201d plasma screen televisions. Our room had an old square tube type T.V. We stayed on the 9th floor and had window view of an opposing tower wall. Our room lacked a mini-bar or refrigerator. I asked around, evidently none of the rooms in the Tower have mini-bars or refrigerators. DO NOT stay at this hotel unless you like lots of loud music being blared 24/7. Music blares perpetually in the casino\u2019s, restaurants, hallways, elevators and at the pools. I went outside by the pools to sit in the sun, read and relax. Impossible. I couldn\u2019t even hear myself think, no less read because there was no escaping the blasting music. After I gave up trying to read, I tried to strike up a conversation with the person sitting in the chase lounge next to mine. Neither of us could hear what the other was saying because the music was so loud. The only place in the entire hotel I could find quiet was in my room. If you like to lay in the sun, this is not a good hotel to do it. The main pool is surrounded by tall towers. This means that if you find a sunny spot, it wont\u2019 be sunny long. As the sun moves, the buildings cast long shadows. The small Hideout Pool has the ubiquitous blaring music , but is better sunning pool. Regarding the hotel\u2019s Sunday Champagne Brunch, one word: AVOIDABLE! The food was not freshly prepared. Salads were soggy. The shrimp cocktail looked and tasted like it had just been thawed from a 100 year freeze. Entrees were either greasy, fatty and under cooked or way over cooked. The prime rib was so raw that many people complained and brought their meat back to be cooked properly. The bacon was burnt. The only fresh fruit served at the entire buffet was whole apples in a bowl and cantaloupe. I skipped the dessert table entirely because everything else was so bad. Finally, the casino: Big, noisy, smoky, & crowded. I guess this is to be expected in many Las Vegas hotel casinos. The machines are tight. You will be a loser if you play slots here. No one I talked with had any luck with the slots. Redeeming gambling chips, slot receipts and Keno tickets is not convenient because the Golden Nugget keeps their casino cashiers discretely tucked away. My friends and family members walked to the Four Queens and had way better luck in their casino.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cThe Nugget needs to do more to live up to its self appointed high standards.\u201d", "Author": "Betsey71", "ReviewID": "UR59839401", "Content": "The wait for check in took FOREVER!

I apologize for the long length of the review but I know I would have really appreciated having this sort of review before we booked our 6 day wedding\\vacation at the Golden Nugget. We were married there in mid Feb 2010. All in all, we are happy with our decision to marry and vacation at the Golden Nugget. I will give a detailed review of my entire experience below, ranking everything on a 1 thru 10 score, but just to sum it up \u2013 our overall experience was positive. I would rank it an 8.5 out of 10. My individual ratings of each item are: Reservations \u2013rated a 10, check-in \u2013 6, wedding \u2013 10, room \u2013 10, gambling \u2013 4, salon \u2013 10, hotel staff \u2013 10. First, we looked at many hotels and chapels in Las Vegas but decided on the Golden Nugget because it was so close to the license bureau, it was reasonably priced, we wanted something that was nice and not cheesy for the ceremony, we wanted a place that would likely be around for a while so we could revisit on anniversaries, and we\u2019d heard the gambling odds were a little better downtown. Reservations: We made room reservations via the internet (room and air was booked as a package deal.). We used promo code which was to include several hotel perks such as a coupon book. We were booked for 5 nights into a standard king room in the new rush tower. A few days before we were to leave for Vegas, I called the hotel\u2019s 1800 number because I realized I needed a fridge in the room to store some medication. They said no problem. Before hanging up they offered me a VIP package for $28. They said this included VIP check-in, no waiting in line at any of the hotel\u2019s restaurants, a guarantee of a king size bed in our room, and some other perks. We took this offer, and they charged my credit card. See more about the VIP offer below. We had no problems with the reservation process so I give it a 10. Check-in: Once at the hotel, they did not have us listed for the VIP check in, but went ahead and let us check in anyway at the VIP check-in desk. I had to ask for the coupon book (it was not offered) which was supposed to be included in our promo. I also had to ask for the \u201cgo to the front of the line\u201d card which allowed us to skip the line at the hotel\u2019s restaurants \u2013 again, it was not offered \u2013 I had to ask for it. I asked how much it would cost to upgrade our room and was told that since we were in the rush tower, we were already upgraded (a standard king room in the rush tower was considered an upgrade over the regular Golden Nugget rooms). Since we'd paid an extra $28 for an easy check-in, I was a little disappointed that they didn\u2019t have our information ready and that they didn\u2019t offer us the perks that were supposed to be included in our package \u2013 I had to ask for them. But even so, we were checked-in within 15 minutes or so and on our way to the room. I rated the check-in a 6 because there was just a lot of room for improvement. Room: Our standard king room in the rush tower was absolutely gorgeous. It was just perfect with a sofa/couch and flat screen TV. It was a large room, extremely clean and very modern \u2013 I can\u2019t say enough about how pleased we were with it. In fact, after seeing our room I was glad they had not encouraged me to upgrade during check in. The fridge was not in the room when we got there but just a quick phone call to the front desk remedied that. I rate the room at a 10. I just don\u2019t see how it could have been any better. VIP \u2013 this turned out to be a little bargain. There were lines at just about all of the hotel\u2019s restaurants and we were able to walk past everyone waiting to be seated and go to the head of the line. It seemed rude the first couple of times that we did it, but it turned out to be such a time savor that we both agreed it was worth the money and we\u2019d purchase it again next time. Gambling \u2013 The casino wasn\u2019t too smokey or full of bad smells the way some casinos are. We\u2019d heard that the gambling odds at this hotel are excellent. I\u2019d beg to differ. It took us less than an hour to lose our entire daily gambling budget on the slots in the hotel\u2019s casino that first day. We thought it was just an off day but the same thing happened again the next day and the next. However, they did have my favorite slot machine: the \u201csex and the city\u201d slot machine. It is just a bunch of fun and I was able to play for a long while on it before it too, ate my money. We continued gambling at the Golden Nugget throughout our 6 day stay at the hotel but never got ahead or even close to breaking even on any given day. And just walking through the casino, we noticed that we never heard anyone yelling out excitedly they way you normally hear people that are winning on slots. There were plenty of loud people at the table games, but we weren\u2019t playing table games for the most part. So even though we lost a bunch, I still give the gambling at this casino a 4 out of 10 because we had a so much fun gambling there and the air smelled a bit cleaner than at some of the other downtown casinos. Salon - Two days before the wedding I went to the hotel salon to have a spray-on tan. It was reasonably priced and turned out beautiful. They recommended doing the tan a couple of days before the wedding so that there will be time to fix any spots that need touching up before the wedding. The salon also did my hair and make-up on my wedding day. I have long hair \u2013 to the middle of my back. The salon used a curling iron to make long ringlet curls in the back (which took over an hour) and then a swept up-do look for the front. My makeup looked natural and beautiful. The total price for the tan, hair and make up was somewhere around $160 - $200 (depending on how much you tip) and totally worth it. They made me feel and look like a pampered princess, so I give the salon a 10 out of 10 rating. It just couldn\u2019t have been nicer or better. Wedding \u2013 We were able to walk to the marriage license bureau from the hotel. We went around 10:30 am and we were in and out within 30 minutes. We took our wedding clothes to the front desk to be pressed the day before our wedding. They delivered our pressed clothes to our room that night which was nice. Silke (the hotel\u2019s wedding coordinator) did a wonderful job. We purchased the $299 wedding package from the hotel. On the day of our wedding, Silke, along with the minister and the photographer were on time, ready and waiting for me to arrive at the chapel. The minister was lovely and very professional. He\u2019d obviously done thousands of wedding ceremonies. The chapel was a medium sized room and was decorated tastefully. It really was perfect for any sort of small wedding. The ceremony lasted around 20 minutes and was perfect. Although 6 or 8 photos came with our package, the photographer took almost a hundred. We ended up buying all the photographs he took. He took photos before the ceremony, during and after and also took multiple photos of the entire family. It really documented our special day wonderfully. I give the hotel\u2019s wedding experience a 10 out of 10. Again, I don\u2019t see how it could have been any better. Note \u2013 the minister has to turn in paperwork to the county clerk documenting your wedding before you are allowed to order your final marriage certificate. I think he has up to 10 days to do this. On the 9th day after we returned home, our documentation still wasn\u2019t there. I called and left a message for the minister and within hours the documentation showed up. I\u2019m guessing he probably waits until he has several to drop off to avoid multiple trips to the county clerk\u2019s office \u2013 which makes sense. At the wedding, you might want to just ask him when to expect your paperwork to be filed so you have an idea of when to expect it. Reception \u2013 We only had 5 family members with us for the wedding. We had reservations at \u201cThe Grotto\u201d restaurant (inside the Golden Nugget) for lunch after the wedding. The Grotto allowed our guests to drop off our wedding gifts there before the wedding so they didn\u2019t have to carry them around the hotel. Once we were seated for lunch, the Grotto brought out a beautiful rolling table that contained our wedding cake and all of the wedding gifts. We ordered a wedding cake from the hotel bakery (white cake with buttercream frosting). It was a two tiered cake ($100) and we ordered a cake topper for it ($30). The cake was gorgeously decorated \u2013 it looked like something from a magazine. It was just so incredibly pretty. However, the butter cream icing tasted a lot like Crisco with a tiny bit of sweetener and the cake itself was extremely dry and tasted like maybe it had been frozen at some point. Although, it should be noted that this might have been sort of our fault since the hotel offered us the option of having a fruit filling (between the cake\u2019s layers) but we opted for just icing. The fruit filling might have made the cake a bit less dry. But as far as how the cake looked \u2013 it was absolutely beautiful and well worth the $100 price. Again, all in all we really enjoyed our stay and wedding at the Golden Nugget. and would definately recommend it to others.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington", "Title": "\u201cCan't Wait To Go Back\u201d", "Author": "Charlie-Lucy", "ReviewID": "UR59653419", "Content": "We have only stayed on the strip before so we definitely thought we were \"rolling the dice\" by staying downtown.

This was not our first time staying here, and we were quickly reminded why we love to come back! We feel we get MORE than what we are paying for from the GN. The GN, along with all the other hotels on Fremont are still quite large but not NEARLY as large as the hotels on the Strip. So navigating around the hotel is pretty easy, you don't have to walk far to get to food, a bathroom, or your room elevator. Then there is Fremont. Small YET large & ALWAYS a party! We love the small town feel that comes along. Not to mention drinks & food are MUCH cheaper down here. By staying at GN we are left with more money for other things such as gambling. Which we don't do much of, but sitting down at a slot on Fremont & taking the chances to win get you great timely drink service so even if you lose it was worth it! We checked out Gold Diggers which was a first for us. We like how big it was & made sure to get there early enough to get a table on the balcony overlooking Fremont & under the canopy. The drinksthere were about $8 which was more than we wanted to spend, but they were VERY strong! The music as great. Oh & they had heaters on the balcony to keep you warm from the chilly spring nights. This was also our first time seeing the new pool on the 3rd floor. AMAZING! We spent nearly every day here. Not only because our trip was blessed with nice weather but it was pretty cool! The infinity affect was nice, the bar was even better, and the beds were comfortable. Not that the beds below aren't, but it was also really cool that kids weren't allowed up there. They were also cool about drinking in the pool, which from our experience is not the case at most the strip pools. Another thing we love is having the option of fancy or fastfood dining SO close. We got the chance to enjoy the new Chart House in the Rush tower which was TO DIE FOR! We were seated right along the 70,000 gallong tank & recieved amazing service. The food, well lets just say we had to force ourselves not to go back EVERY NIGHT!!! It was spendy but still much cheaper than what you would pay for that experience on the strip. We also enjoyed the Grotto. Again, pretty darn good! Our room was decent along with our experience with the hotel staff. We learned that the higher floors in the Carson/South tower are updated. We unfortunately got stuck in a line during check in and then found out the type of room we requested was no longer available nor was an upgrade. They said we could try to switch the next day but when the next day came we weren't up to switching and we kind of enjoyed each having a bed to ourselves! We were extremely dissappointed to find out we couldn't even PAY for an extended stay & got a little fired up when we found a condom wrapper on the floor during our room sweep before check out---that was not ours! We were also irritated that there was no free wi-fi. It is 2010 people! Why not????

This area has good public bus connections with the airport (#108 or #109A departing from airport level zero, allow 1 hour each way, $2 each ride or buy an all day bus pass). The downtown area provides great nostalgia for old Las Vegas. The hotel fronts the Fremont Street Experience, a free hourly sound and light show every evening, with additional free live stage entertainment most nights. When I arrived, the hotel gave me a free upgrade from the older (and probably quieter) south Carson Tower to the newer north Rush Tower, even though I had never stayed here before and am a non-gambler. My Rush Tower room was very elegant and quite large (about 500 sq. ft. = 50 sq. m.). The room was decorated in medium to dark brown tones, with a large marble and tile bathroom, a king bed, and an attached sitting area with a large sectional sofa. At about the cost of a single buffet dinner on the Strip ($39), my room was a great bargain. In appreciation, I doubled my usual service tips to the various hotel staff. The staff were very friendly and efficient throughout the hotel. The breakfast buffet was a good value at $10, with good variety and nice presentation (but avoid the pastries, all of which were stale). I did not try any other meals in the hotel. The pool area is relatively small compared with the hotel size, but it is entertaining because of the shark tank and water slide in the center of the pool. I found only two drawbacks to staying at the GN. First, the public \"Deuce\" bus which shuttles passengers along the Strip runs well in the morning, but by afternoon is jammed, and by evening is worthless due to excess demand. Second, Rush Tower rooms facing north (Fremont Street) are somewhat noisy from about 8-10pm while live entertainment is going on -- a band played Johnny Cash tributes at about 150 decibels, and even the double glazed windows could not keep the noise (music) out. Still, I recommend the GN for anyone who wants to stay in old Las Vegas and does not have to shuttle to the Strip for shows or shopping (there is a good premium outlet mall only a mile from the GN anyway, on bus #108).", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis", "Title": "\u201cExcellence Superior to all other places in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Banky3", "ReviewID": "UR58212978", "Content": "I have been going to Vegas every year for the last twenty years.

As a matter of fact, my husband had never even been downtown before so this trip out we decided to stay one night downtown and the other two nights on the strip (THE Hotel, see other review). I believe it was about a 20$ cab ride from the aiport, but honestly I forget now. Check in folks were very nice and we stayed in a Gold Tower room, was about 60 bucks via their website. The hotel was alot nicer than I thought it would be actually. I had a minds eye view of the downtown hotels and don't know about the others, but GN was classy, clean and well appointed. The room was wonderful really. Super comfy bed, nice side bathroom, flat screen tv (never turned it on so can't comment). Better than many of the rooms at the mid level hotels we have stayed at on the strip. Certainly not as nice as Bellagio, MGM or Mandaly but I guess that goes without saying for most. Casino was great, checked out alot of them downtown but mostly played here. Others have said they were lean on the payoff but we did not experience that. Found an Invaders From Planet Moolah here and had a ton of fun for quite a long time on that quirky little machine! Spent a good bit of time at one of the sit up bars (can't remember which on) and fell upon a Video Poker machine that really, really liked us - hit 400$ bucks twice on it. Gambling gods were smiling on us here. Actually came back to that same one the next morning, however a very nice lady was perched on it. We waited.....and waited....and waited but she was not moving!! We were joking with her and she promised after her last deal she was on her way. Low and behold....her last spin she hit the jackpot. Rats for us but good for her. High fives all around. Food: Sorry, can't comment. Did not eat at the GN. Did have the buffet at the Paradise across the way and it was really very good and very reasonable. Would eat there again (breakfast). Pool: Too cold but looked very nice. On the small side in my opinion. Bet it is jammed in the summer time. Downtown Experience: Interesting. Lots of characters down there. Nothing to complain about on our end but I wouldn't roam around down there by myself. Street is a party to be sure. You can walk around with drink in hand so you know how that goes. I'd like to comment on the light show, but I'll be darned...we missed it!!! How might you ask? Well we roamed into Glitter Gultch (what the heck....why not....it's Vegas) and ended up hanging out there quite a while. While certainly not a high end club, service was good at least. Let's just say husband did not spend a whole lotta time staring at the various ladies, every one outta ten was at least average. Made it fun thought. I will say I woke up the next morning without my drivers license and new I left it there when I cashed out the card. Had to hang around till 11 the next morning to get back in (nice...on a Sunday morning....lurking around the club entrance waiting for them to open). Managers searched high and low and found it behind the bar. They went out of their way to find that sucker for me. Very much appreciated as I needed it to fly home!

We ordered room service our last night, it was pretty overwelming for they come in with a huge table with flowers on it and it was like being treated like royalty. They did not have coffee makers in the room, so we walked across the street to Walgreens (open 24 hours) and got a 4 cup maker for 10 bucks, IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!! I highly advise buying one, saves $$ vs buying starbucks daily. Walgreens have tons of stuff in that store, including coffee and cream and sugar,lol. The hotel and casino was breathtaking!

There is handblown glass chandaleers and ornaments threwout the hotel, OMG, beautiful. ALL the staff were outstanding and always smiling. You have to try a truffel from the Chocolate Store, NUMMY! Worth it for $2.50 per piece,trust me. We only ate at the 24 hr restaurant, it was good prices and a plate full of food is enough for 2 people to share. The location on Freemont Street was right in the middle of the action, PERFECT location. It was our first time staying downtown and we will 100% be back and HIGHLY recommend the Golden Nugget :) And for the record the downtown-Freemont Street is VERY safe to walk on, anytime of day. Trust me, we were walking down it at 5am with our luggage tagging behind us without any hesitation. There were still lots of people around and also they were cleaning the street with high powered washers. It was immaculate when they finished. Be prepared though for tons of people, especially on the weekend. Definatley a site to see and a lifetime experience! It is like a carnival, mardi gras down there daily. And dont forget to book your room at the Golden Nugget....you wont be disappointed, guaranteed.

We paid approx $190 USD per night. Overall total disappointment. There was a 15 min wait at registration (4:45 pm, Fri eve.), not because of a long line (we were 2nd in line), but because there were only 2 clerks at the desk. I would guess some of the people in line behind us waited up to 30 minutes to check in. The lobby is new and attractive, but no place to sit down other than the gaming tables, which were usually empty due to the high minimum limits at those tables. The halls upstairs are dimly lit and unattractive. Our room was decorated in dark colors, which, I guess, was supposed to make it look rich and elegant, but because of poor lighting, it just came off as dark and depressing. No refrigerator. No coffee maker. We were on the 8th flr facing south, and there were arc lights to light up the side of the building that shined into our windows. No view to speak of. Upon check in, we found that our bed sheets had two large, nasty stains (I won't go into details) that NO maid could have missed, and one of our bath towels also was soiled. In other words, housekeeping had simply remade a used bed and refolded used towels. The bathrooms are small and ugly. The floor, and up the side of the tub, is cheap-looking fake-wood laminate.... same as just outside the elevators. The bathtub is a law suit waiting to happen..... There is no seperate shower, and the tub floor is very slippery when wet and soapy (the guest book advised that a bath mat could be provided FOR A FEE!), there are no grab bars in the shower whatsoever, and the artsy-fartsy steel faucet knob is cubical with sharp corners that would probably kill someone if they slipped and hit their head on it. The glass shower doors leak water onto the bathroom floor no matter how you try to close them. The restaurants in the new tower are attractive, but terribly overpriced. I ordered the sushi combo plate at their restaurant RED, and for over $30.00 got a bowl of miso soup and only 7 pieces of sushi nigiri and a california roll. Wait staff were generally not friendly. I joined trip advisor specifically to give this review, as there are no feed-back forms in the rooms, and because upon check out, the desk clerk didn't even bother to ask \"HOW WAS YOUR STAY\". I have stayed at the GN several times over the past 20 years and used to always enjoy my stays there.

After searching for hotels , I found Golden Nugget to be a affordable, yet great hotel. We stayed at Golden Nugget from Feb 6th till Feb 10th, 2010. If you've been to Reno, you'll realize on fremont street, it's similar to that. Fremont street has its own casinos, bars, restaurants etc. Once we got off the airplane, we decided to catch a cab to the hotel. By the time we go there, it was close to $25 in fare. I did not realize that this hotel is far from the strip. The first night to go the strip and come back, we had paid $40 in cab + tip. The next day we decided to look for shuttles or even buses..and thank god we asked! Two blocks from the hotel, you'll find a bus stop....you have to purchase the ticket to get on the bus...which is $3.00 one way or $7.00 for the entire day / person. If you can't find this ticket booth, dont worry, just take exact change and use that inside the bus. THEY DO TAKE CASH!!! Which we didn't realize until the 3rd day. We had visited some great restaurants but they are pricey...as you know..Vegas is not cheap..Try Spago inside Ceasar's.. They even have a cheesecake factory inside there too..We also tried Table 10 inside Palazzo. Portions at Table 10 is bountiful and I must say.. they have the best bread I have ever eaten..soft and warm..yumm!! If you planning on shopping there is a cart inside ceasars called Everything for $10...but if you go upstairs in Treasure Island..you will see the same store but with more stuff..It's cheap and good. If you have a pricey taste...don't worry, there's plenty of shops on the strip also they just opened city center..has great shops and some are still in the process of opening. If you want to see shows, try Mystere in TI. Its fun and great for adults and kids. We got our tickets at $25 /person total of $50 with no tax. Usually its starting at $70. In Golden Nugget, their staff is promoting a new timeshare called \"Grand View\" and what they want you to do is go in to see the place for 2 hours, eat snacks and get your free gifts, We were given an option of watching Mystere by paying $50 (2) and free breakfast buffet at GN or get Cris Angel Mindfreak show by paying $20 (2) and get $25 free money to spend in GN. If you get Cris angel..you in a way make $5.00 out of this but we preferred Mystere. Hustle these ppl inside GN so they do give you other free things..like we got breakfast buffet and trust me , they need you to go check out this new place. BTW: I recommend taking the 1.00pm shuttle there so you can eat lunch at Grandview. They have deli sandwiches, juices, coffee, fruits and cookies. Free Lunch and plus you can ask them to drop you off on the strip once the session is over, so that way you can save your money on Bus fare. Overall Vegas was fun, Hotel was great and don't forget to check out their amazing pool with REAL SHARKS inside.

Our experience was nothing short of perfection! We arrived on Jan. 28th around 11:15pm and the hotel staff were courteous and more than accommodating. Being the fact that it was New Years week and hotels were jammed to the rafters, the only room they could give us for our first night was the Spa Suite. Holy crap! This room goes for $800 a night any other time, but we got it at no extra charge and the timing couldn't have been better. I had a screaming migrane and just needed to relax and the spa suite was the answer to my prayers. This two bedroom, 3 bathroom and with TWO jaccuzzi tubs (2 person wide), along with a formal diningroom and livingroom, complete with 5 (count them, yes 5) LCD TV's, I was in HEAVEN. The next day, we had to move to a regular suite in the Carson Tower but again, they upgraded us to a newer room on a higher floor with a view of the strip....without us even asking for it. I cannot praise the staff at this hotel enough. They went out of their way to make us comfortable and welcome anytime we had questions. Regarding some of their quirky rules.....like, there are NO coffee makers in the rooms people!! When we asked if we could have one, they said it was a safety issue. Of course, to make it convenient for us, they did have a Starbucks (where coffee is $4 a cup) at the bottom of the elevators, so it wasn't too far to go; just cut short our gambling funds for a cup of coffee every morning (lol). We have been to Vegas several times, but this was the first time we've ever stayed at the Nugget. The location is fantastic to the Premier Outlet shopping mall....just a quick 20 minute walk and you've got the best shopping in town and the sales were unbelievable!! Fremont Street is something to experience....I loved all the lights on the corner where all 4 hotels come together. The H2o bar in the pool area is neat. Although we never swam in the pool beside the sharktank, we did use the hot tub which was fantastic. Drinks are expensive but food and beverages are quite high in general, so make sure you budget yourself accordingly. A couple can eat 3 meals a day for around 100 bucks. Gone are the days of the 2.95 buffets....but at least the hotels gives you a booklet which has two for one breakfast, lunches and other discounts for food and entertainment. Still, we weren't quite prepared for the cost of food and drinks. The buffet food was a typical buffet....not very hot, but quite tasty and lots of variety. Anyone who complains about the buffet is too picky - get over it and eat elsewhere if you don't like it. We found a fabulous restaurant on Fremont Street called Hennessey's. It's an Irish Pub that has fantastic Pepper Chicken. You can get discount meal vouchers at \"Tickets for Today\" stands which is just outside the 4 Queens Hotel. You can eat a Sirloin Steak for 8.50 with the coupon. Drinks were yummy too. If you're gambling, the drinks in the Nugget are fantastic - not watered down. I particularly liked the margaritas and beer. The only drawback to staying at the Nugget is that it is not very safe to walk outside of the Fremont Street hub at night. Druggies and other activities occur on a regular basis and you're best to take the bus to the strip if you want to do some walking at night.

Behind one wall was a humming ice maker, behind the other paper thin wall were neighbors having loud sex, and on the third side was a fake walled-up window!!. The dingy lighting and dated decor completed the mood of this seedy room. I went back down and told them I didn't want it. The second attendant made a call, mumbled a few things into the phone, and sent me back up to a much nicer room on the 17th floor. It turned out that the second room was the Gold Tower room that I paid for. The first room was two levels or more lower in quality than what I paid for. They pretended to be doing me a favor by giving me the second room when it was actually the type of room I paid for. The Gold tower was very nice - I liked the TV miror and Bose sound in the bathroom. However the attitude of the staff has a larger effect on my overall experience. I'd rather stay in a dumpy hotel with very nice staff (well not really, but you get the idea ) I just didn't like that I had to complain to get the level of room that I paid for.

After a lot of confusion and a two hour wait to check in we were told that our room wasnt ready and that we should go to the restaurant and they would pick up the bill. The 100 or so people before us either relocated or sent to the restaurant so we were expecting this. However, for us this was unacceptable as we had been travelling for a long time and just wanted to sleep so insisted that we see a Manager and amazingly a room became available and we were offered some compensation for our two hour wait to check in! The room was above average quality and we would have been happy to stay there for our full four nights. However with 10 mins of being in the room we flushed the toilet and it over-spilled onto the floor - so within 10 mins we had the lid of the toilet off trying to stop the flow and were calling maintenance. As you can imagine we went straight back down and complained ...... We delat with the same Manager, Julio, who after a little arm twisting, promised us an upgrade the next day as he had nothing available that night. The next day we moved to a suite in the Rush Tower which was truely amazing. We spent the next three nights in luxury and the rest of our stay was very pleasant with staff as friendly as can be in a hotel this scale. We had a meal in the Itailan restaurant one night and surprisingly it was lovely - not being gamblers we has a small flutter on the slot machines and walked away $50 up so all in all a pleasant stay overall. This was our first time in Vegas and downtown is quite far from the Strip but parking is free and cheap at the Nugget. Vallet parking staff are good and offer insightful help for a small $2 tip. Trip would have been perfect had we had started in the rush room. Trip would have been good if we had started and finished well in the standard room.

We arrived late, and that meant that check-in as really easy. There was one party in front of us, and they had been dropped off at the GNRT by a taxi, when really they were checking into the South Tower. The receptionist still checked then in and directed them over to the other building. We noticed over the next few days that this seemed to be the latest trick of the cabbies to drop people off that the Rush Tower - so this meant longer lines to check in at busy times of the day. So we got to our room, we were 12th floor, and had a view overlooking Fremont Street. The rooms are lovely in the Rush Tower. The entranceway is a good size with a table and a really handy little dish to put your coins and keys in. The bathroom was off the entrance way and had lovely sliding doors that opened the bathroom right up. There is a separate toilet in the bathroom, which is great (don't really want to see my DH sitting on the loo!) There is plenty of seating in the room with the corner sofa, a great place to sit and watch the street below. the room came with DVD player, 42\" Flat screen TV, data ports, safe, and loads of storage space, and a lovely large wardrobe, with plenty of hangers! Now there was one downside to the room, and this was the bed, not the mattress, but the bed frame - it sticks out beyond the mattress and both me and my hubby bashed our legs against it a couple of times and had the bruises to prove it! But once we were accustomed to steering clear of the frame we were OK! We had great times in the casino, DH was extremely lucky and won every night, his best win was $4K on Let It Ride. The pit boss (Frank) was excellent, and really made us feel welcome every time we sat at the table. I wasn't so lucky in the GN casino, but there are so many casinos around about that there was never a problem going somewhere else! We ate at Vic and Anthony's restaurant on Christmas Day night, and the meal was wonderful. It was the best steak that I have ever had, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Excellent! We also had a couple of breakfasts at the Carson Street Cafe and the service was wonderful. It seems that the staff is a little older at the hotel and I always feel that they give a much better service....

After looking at the other hotels downtown we decided to pick what we felt was the nicest one and spent a little extra to stay in the new Rush Tower. It was an excellent choice. For the same price as staying in a lower end property on the strip (i.e.: Circus Circus, Excalibur, IP) we got a VERY nice room at a very nice hotel. The Rush Tower rooms still have their 'new room smell' and the whole tower feels like it just had a the plastic taken off. The decore is all muted browns and powerful reds. The room had a comfortable (if a tab bit harder then I like) bed, a sitting area with a nice sized leather couch and ottoman and a very nice 42 inch flatscreen HDTV (along with about 10 full HD channels). The bathroom is large with a double vanity and a separate toilet area that you can close the door on and relieve yourself in peace. The property itself is very nice. The casino is large and filled with all the latest games. The table limits are higher then most of the other strip properties ($10 minimums are as low as I saw them go) and they have plenty of eye-candy dealers (along with non-eye-candy dealers if that's your thing). We ate at the Buffet, Carson Cafe, and the little Asian restaurant beside the Carson Cafe. In addition we order room service once, but that's just food from the Cafe. All the meals were good. The buffet is small by Vegas standards but the food was very good and fresh and the staff was attentive and friendly. The Carson Cafe is large and open 24 hours a day (reduced menu during late night) and the staff there was also attentive and friendly. The Asian resturant was the highlight of the dining at the Nugget. Their food is excellent and priced very reasonably. Overall all the staff we encountered were friendly and gave good service with a smile. The front-desk staff got us checked in quickly and gave us a nice coupon book. The Rush Tower valets were fast and friendly, even when the lot was full except for guests all they asked was 'are you staying with us sir?' and took me at my word when I said 'yes' , I was never hassled to provide proof. Our room was cleaned early every day (each day we were out by 10am and normally back to a fully cleaned room at noon or 1pm). Charging things to our room was a breeze even when I forgot my room charge card they were very understanding. While we didn't spend any time in the pool it looks AWESOME with the big shark tank and the water slide. In the summer months I bet this pool area could really rock your socks off. Checkout took exactly 8 seconds using the express checkout on the TV. The location downtown is great if you want to stay downtown. You have access right on to Fremont St. right out the hotel doors. If you stay here and want to get to the Strip often (as we did) you have to have a rental car, it's the best blend of ease and affordability for transportation when you're staying downtown. That said, if you just want to drink and gamble and eat Fremont St. is perfect for that and everything is in walking distance. Overall I have no real complaints about the Golden Nugget, it was as close to perfect as a hotel can come. The only marks off I give are for location (real far from the action on the Strip) and a couple points off for service in the casino as drink service at the machines was rather slow (at the tables it was great). A couple of things to note specific to the Rush Tower Rooms: 1) The closet has door handles but they don't turn. When you try and turn them it feels just like a locked door. All you need to do is give them a firm pull and the closet pops open to reveal your robes and slippers + ironing board etc. I felt rather dumb when I figured that out after being in the room for an hour wondering where I was gonna hang my suit, save yourself some embarrassment ;) 2) When you're having a shower, due to the way the 'rainfall' style shower head works the bottom of the bathtub can get quite slippery. If you have stability issues (disabled, older, etc) you'll want to watch out for that or you could take a very nasty fall in there.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cA good deal and cool location\u201d", "Author": "Esfy", "ReviewID": "UR52670261", "Content": "I was a first time Vegas traveller and was meeting family to stay on the Strip for several days. Wanting to see old downtown Vegas so I got there a day early and did a lot of research as to which of the hotels to stay in for that one day/night. I chose the Golden Nugget and didn't regret it. Wanted to be near enough to the Fremont St experience but not right on top of it since I'm a light sleeper. I got a room on the 14th floor in one of the towers at the southern end of their large property for sixty-something dollars, was allowed to check in at 11 AM and found the room to be clean and the staff to be helpful and friendly. My only complaint is that the room was a tiny bit dark in the daytime due to the drape / window configuration. But turning on the lights solved that problem and I didn't spend much time in my room. Also the room next to me had some sort of argument going on late at night (audible through the locked doors in the shared wall. But the argument quieted down before I had to call the front desk. Downtown is pretty different from the Strip. It's definitely older, and as others have mentioned, the emphasis is more on gambling and less on glitz and fancy stores and all that. I would have stayed down there even without the Fremont Street Experience happening, I love old buildings and pedestrian-friendly streets. Unlike on the strip, it's easy to walk around and check out the sites. The old hotel signs at night are pretty amazing; Binions, the Plazas, the California, the Golden State. If you're into vintage stuff, you must at least visit downtown at night. But unfortunately most of the action is limited to the immediate area around the Fremont St Experience. It gets seedy as you go east on Fremont even though there are some cool looking old bars. The minimum bets seem to be lower on Fremont St than most places on the Strip as well and people are friendlier too.

Our Las vegas trip was for five nights this holiday and we had enjoyed a day spent at the Golden Nugget on an earlier trip and decided to try one of their new rooms in the new tower. The valet parking is a nightmare at the new entrance since many of the locals were using the valet parking and guests were stuck out in the front entrance road. I have never seen so many local people with so many young children and babies in tow all over the hotel common area's and Fremont Street. We finally were checked in thru VIP services and a room was finally determined after several lenghty phone conversations and walkie talkie's. Our room was a king bed standard and was completely brand new. The smells were a bit overpowering and it was clear the finish had been made \"under the gun\" so to speak. The bed was not level, the light switches on the wood entertainment center were hard to find and the bathroom is not to our liking at all. The tub is a fiberglass insertable and has an unusually high step over, Someone is going to be seriously injured in the future. The shower/tub doors are very flimsy , very thin glass and not commercial grade. Very Cheap. The bathroom doors are twin shop doors. To close, you must pull both the doors together on overhead tracks. Not very private and not easily or quickly done. The room is very dark with browns and tans and in my opinion will show wear and tear quite quickly. The colors are very dark and very masculine, but not inviting for a sitting. The large corner leather (?) sectional is good for placing suitcases on, but not much for a relaxing sit and the three head lighting fixture immediately provokes sixty/seventy images and will be broken quickly . The television remote was overly complicated for getting just a news broadcast or weather channel , but the ipod alarm was a nice feature bolted to the nightstand. There was NO security for the elevators and no room key was required to access. I expressed my concern to a front desk agent who replied that several guests had voiced concerns. The walls were thin and other guests could be heard in the hallway who ever was coming and going thru the fire exit doors at the end of the hallway. The casino was extremely crowded as was Fremont street. The casino had a lot of persons , but not many gamers as the boss in our section was preparing to close several tables after dropping the minimum minutes earlier. Our boss was a former real estate agent who bemoaned the state of real estate in Las Vegas as was our dealer, a young Phillipino man who stated he had made a lot of money as a loan originator, but was now shutling his BMW between relatives homes to stay ahead of the repo man. I can't say I felt sorry for him. The crowds on Fremont street were depressing for us on this trip and we decided to cut our stay short and move on. we felt like we were in a maze trying to get around the Nugget this trip and felt like we were in a bus terminal.

I booked this surprise trip for my boyfriends 30th and after visiting casinos on the strip we much much preferred to go to the casinos downtown.

But I guess that goes along with the whole old-time rat pack theme of the hotel, so I didn't mind. The window is small because it is an old building. All in all it seemed like a good room to have vintage cocktails in with some friends before an old-time night downtown. I was by myself though, and immersed in a writing project, so I ended up leaving the GN the next day to go to a bigger, lighter room with a bigger desk at Caesars. But for the vast majority of people who are NOT in Vegas to spend a lot of time writing, I think the GN is a great choice. One final note: I definitely recommend the spa at the GN for the tub, sauna, and steam room. The steam was great and hot tub was big, hot, and uncrowded. I did not think as much of my body treatments-- they were ok but very expensive and not competitive in skill to \"real\" spas.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cOld Vegas charm, good value, small rooms\u201d", "Author": "smalltowngalReno", "ReviewID": "UR51712330", "Content": "I've been to Vegas many times but this is the first time I have stayed at the Golden Nugget.

Our adjoining rooms were ready (the only bonus) but I do not recommend the South Tower rooms. They are very old, dark and small but we all enjoyed the old Vegas charm of this hotel and Fremont Street and it didn't take us long to get to our shows on the strip. The gaming was good and we enjoyed the casino. We dined at the buffet and the coffee shop, both were very mediocre and one morning our breakfast showed up stone cold. The waitress was not very helpful and simply avoided our table after we brought it to her attention. On the way out of the restaurant two of the employees were having a rather loud disagreement right in the middle of the restaurant (very unprofessional). Room service and valet service were both very fast and courteous so no complaints there. I was amazed when I saw they are still charging for internet access at this hotel and to top it off, it was quite slow. We saw Terry Fator at the Mirage and Rob Thomas at the Palms, both excellent shows. Dinner at Japanois in the Mirage and Nine at the Palms were expensive, but delicious!

The self parking garage is free-it would be nice if they had a walkway connecting it to the hotel. My only real complaint is that they do charge $13 for 24 hours of internet.

I checked into the Golden Nugget, and couldn't have been more happy. For about $15 more a night, the difference was staggering! First, the casino, lobby and elevators have been beautifully restored, and are clean and fresh smelling. The check-in staff was not overtly friendly, but still very polite and respectful. The offer of bellboy service was made, but in the age of rolling luggage, who needs that! I wasn't expecting much from my Gold Tower room, but was delighted to see how spacious and luxurious it was! Amazingly comfortable bed, nice furniture, giant flat-panel television, mini-safe for valuables, etc. The entry area was marbled, with the balance of the room carpeted. Everything was immaculately clean, and the room was fresh smelling but not laden with cleaning chemicals or disinfectant. The bathroom was smallish (hey, this is a very old building) but again, it was beautifully restored...marble tile, elegant sink/counter, shower with curved curtain rod and great water pressure, etc. The commode seemed to be rocket powered! WiFi internet access was a bit pricey at $12.95 a day, but it worked well and was very speedy. Now none of this was a fluke, as each of my three friends had rooms that were virtually identical. If I had to say anything negative about the room, it would be that sound isolation is not terribly good. It's not that I could hear people through the walls, but sounds in the hallway (doors slamming, people walking, etc.) definitely seemed quite loud. Again, this probably just goes with the territory in an older building. No big deal. That evening my friends and I took a quick dip in the pool, and had fun swimming up within inches of the giant fish and sharks in the central aquarium. It was fascinating to be so close to these beautiful animals. Afterwards we soaked in the jacuzzi for an hour or so, to unwind before going out to dinner. The pool staff was attentive and helpful...lots of clean, high quality towels were provided, and the wait staff was quick to bring drinks around. We spent a fair amount of time in two Nugget bars, I wish I could remember the name of them. The first has a large balcony that hangs out over Fremont Street, and it's a great spot to do a little \"people watching.\" The second is a circular arrangement with the bar in the middle, and it had the most amazing band playing there. Just four piece (guitar, keyboardist/vocalist, drums, bass) but they sounded huge, their level of musicianship was tremendous and the singer really knew how to work a crowd. Honestly, I had no idea that downtown Vegas had a hotel of this caliber! When traveling for work, I usually stay at the Bellagio. Now the Nugget is no Bellagio, but you know what...it's really not too far behind!

The new area was not very big - there were no craps tables in the new area (the game we play). The new restaurant looked very plain - didn't eat there. We did eat at the Grotto which was excellent. The Rush Tower lobby smelled like smoke since it was connected to the old GN. I thought the rooms seemed small and dark - I felt like I was in a Hyatt Place. The mattress seemed too soft. The a/c was loud though I thought everything was supposed to be new. The shower was nice. The towels shed all over us (perhaps they had not yet been washed before). The hallways were dark and lightened by red lights - bringing to mind the Amsterdam Red Light District.

The ice machine didn't work on our floor but you just go up or down one floor to get ice. Why sweat the small stuff - you are on vacation! The elevators were always fast. I am a slot player and hubby plays blackjack. Neither one of us had a problem getting a drink when our glass was empty. We had a lunch and breakfast in the Carson St Cafe. Meals were adequate (nothing special) service was friendly. First night we had dinner at Vic & Anthonys. A meal to remember. Lance took good care of us. We started with lobster bisque laced with cognac (yum) followed by salmon stuffed with crab and gouda for me and a 16 oz prime rib steak for hubby. Yes, he finished it but neither of us had room for dessert. We took in the Gordie Brown show in the Gordie Brown showroom - a very nice venue. Bought the 2nd cheapest seats and had a very good view. No one sat in front of me so I had a great view and I'm a shorty. Laughed my head off but he covered so much material that I had to buy the DVD. I would say the show is relevant to ages 40+ (some 20 year olds might not know who Wayne Newton, Tom Jones or Sammy Davis Jr. are. A nice plus was all the eye candy. That weekend there was the Firefighter Combat Challenge going on outside on Fremont St and the Fitness America Weekend in the Nugget. Oh my. Firefighters and body builders - OH MY. Women as well. Hubby and I had to take turns keeping each other from running into things. But some of those discount spray tans were ghastly shades of orange - eek.

I walked right past them with my luggage and they didn't offer a hand, but when I reentered the area to tell my husband something they interrrupted our conversation telling me something unrelated to what I was trying to tell my husband. I told them if they wanted to help me they could have helped me with my luggage a minute ago. They replied \"well you didn't ask\"......\"whatever\", I guess you have to ask the employees at Golden Nugget to do their job?? The buffet was subpar to those in Vegas. Our waitress also tried overhearing my husband and I conversation and tried joining in on our conversation when it was of none of their concern. To me that is rude and inappropriate. It was hard to find a waitress on the casino floor and after playing there I was always dehydrated to the point my mouth was bone dry. I approached a man in a suit on the floor and explained to him that I could not find a waitress he didn't offer much help so I went to the bar and had to pay $4 for a water. The slots were tight and some I would not get one credit back. I made my rounds to the casinos and found the Fremont Casino (kiddy corner to the Golden Nugget) to be one of the best paying casinos and there was always a waitress coming around for drinks. I didn't give Golden Nugget another penny after that. The room was average clean and had only minimal accomodations compared to other hotels. The hallway door was about 2 inches shorter than the floor so all hallway noise would be directed into our room. I also had to call housekeeping as they forgot to give us towels, refill water bottles in fridge etc. This was also the first hotel I had ever stayed in where they charged $5 for 15 minutes of interent service on a public pc in a hallway. My husband used the spa while there for a massage. It was overpriced and they tacked on a 20% tip automatically. The next day I checked out Bellagio spa and they don't tack on a tip and it was a lot nicer and classier than Golden Nugget. There was also no vending machines for hotel guests everyone had to use the gift shop were pop was $3 a bottle. It seems like they could be a little more considerate of their guests, but I guess their goal at the Golden Nugget is to hire the cheapest workers who are rude and won't do their job unless they are asked to and rip off their customers. Golden Nugget however was one of the more updated/modern casinos on Fremont even though the entire place including hallways on a nonsmoking floor were filled with a smell of stale smoke.

Great location with easy access to the Fremont St. activities and casinos. Great for young (lots of free entertainment) and older (close to other casinos, easier walks than on the strip). The Grotto restaurant was divine! Out of 6 of us, not one complaint and lots of compliments! Cannot say the same about the Cafe, would not eat there again..only 3 out of 8 enjoyed their meals (and they ate sandwiches.) Actually tried the breakfast buffet which was Ok especially with a 2 for 1 coupon. Easy free valet (call down ahead and the car will be waiting for you.)

Because we had locked the door from the inside before we left, apparently when the guest opens the door to leave, it does not default open, and thusly the door locks.

Check in on Friday, and was given a suite in the Spa Tower. Beautiful 2 story room. Thumbs up. Put bag in room and went out to gamble. Got back to room early Saturday morning around 3:30 am. Slept and up around 11:30am and downstairs in the casino by around noon. Although I have a beautiful room, I'm the type that stays out all day and just use the room to sleep. Once again gambled till around 3:30 am early Sunday. Go to the room, put the key in, but the key did not worked. Damn. Thinking that the key got de-magnetized, so trek downstairs to the front desk to try and get a new key. At the front desk, they could not find me as registered guest!!!! So I showed them the \"guest card\" showing the dates of my arrival and checkout which was supposed to be Monday. After checking somemore, the front desk robot told me that they checked me out on Saturday just after I have gotten up and left the room!!!! I ask why, of course the front desk robot could not answer me. Then I ask what happened to my stuff that I left in the room. After numerous phone calls, I was told that the cleaning staff removed my toiletry bag and kept it in housekeeping somewhere. However, my bag that was in the closet with a couple of t-short on hangers were nowhere to be found. Remember, this is around 4:00 in the morning. I'm tired. My cloths stinks and you don't want to be near my feet. So I asked the front desk robot if it is golden nugget's policy to check people out of their room before they are suppose to!!! Of course no answer was given. Granted, the front desk robot offered me another room, but given their treatment so far, I declined. I could get a room anywhere on the strip. By this time, someone from housekeeping arrived with a blue plastic bag with my toiletry bag inside, but my other bag with clothing and everything else is nowhere to be found. Seeing that there were no answers to be gotten from the front desk robot and I really did not want to wake up the host that make the reservation for me, I just gave them my cell number and ask to them call me when they found my bag. So I left with my toiletry bag and went to another casino on the strip. Expecting a call early in the morning when someone with some sort of authority that could sort out the situtation but it was not to be. No one called. So, I had to drag myself back downtown as I have some valuable items in the bag that I left in the room. Eventhough I showered, I had to put my old clothing back on. So I still stink. I went to the host office told the host on duty my story and after more phone calls, I was told that someone else with a name that was close to mine asked to check out on Saturday and they make the mistake and check me out instead. Right!!!!!!! With my stuff still the room!!!! At this point, I really didn't care for their explanation, I just wanted my bag. After a few calls, I was told my bag was at Lost and Found and the host sort of hinted for me to go there to get my bag. Yeah right!!!! How many strikes is this? Seeing the expression on my face, he quickly call someone to bring it down. After retriving my bag, I check the bag and thank God everything was there. They actually did folded my t-shirts bery nicely before putting back in the bag. Thumbs up. Thumbs down for making me come back down to get it. So I left with my bag.

We arrived on a Thursday night, around 11pm. Check in was a little slow, but thorough. We were given a booklet of Golden Nugget coupons as well. We used about three of them during our two night stay. Our room on the 14th floor was nicely appointed, two beds & non-smoking - just as I asked for. Everything was very clean. I wished that our room had a mini-fridge and coffee maker, but we were ok without it. The complimentary toiletries were good sized and nice. After getting settled in, we went down to the Grille for a bite. We used a $2 off per person coupon. The food was really good, and it came out fast, considering it was after midnight. The pool area was great, if but a little small - really liked the shark tank. The only real downside was that there wasn't a whole lot of sun reaching the space. It more than likely has a lot to do with the time of year (the sun doesn't get as high- we had similar problems finding chairs in the sun at the Venetian later in the week), but you have to scope it out early if you want to get a spot in the sun. We ate at the Buffet for breakfast (used a two-for-one coupon and got breakfast for $10 for both of us!) and it was pretty tasty. I recommend going earlier than 10am if you want all of the breakfast selections... at around 10:15 they started switching over to lunch. All in all, I would definitely return to the Golden Nugget.

But I decided to take a risk and I'm glad I did. We stayed on the 22nd floor of the South Tower in a room supposedly remodeled in 2009 and we paid $49 for the first night (a Thursday) and $159 for the second night (Friday). The Good: Excellent value for money, esp. at the $49 rate. If both nights were $159, I would not have stayed here because I got the same rate at Bellagio but I wanted to save some bucks and spend it on a great dinner out. The room was large and clean but the furniture looked dated and a little scuffed. The bathroom is tiny and the door opens inward which makes it even more crowded. The sink is ridiculously small. However, it's serviceable. All amenities provided, flat screen TV, blow dryer, lotion, shampoo, iron and board, etc. and replenished each day. I was surprised to see robes hanging in our closet. That is a luxury hotel amenity and to find it in a $49 room is pretty amazing. The pool is fantastic! If you have kids, I can't think of a better way to have them spend the day than under the waterfalls and hurtling down the water slide that cuts through the shark tank. Yes, there are live sharks swimming in the shark tank and you can gaze at them while they peer at you through the glass. You can do the water slide and lie out on the lounges to your heart's content and never have to spend a dime unless you want to buy beer and food, which is always a good idea. The weekday crowd seems to be working-class families, the weekend crowd seems to trend younger with lots of L.A. and O.C. visitors. The steakhouse at the hotel is pretty good and I have reviewed it separately on yelp.com. Lots of slot machines (which I don't use) and gaming tables of all kinds. I played texas hold-em at the lowest limit table ($2/$4) and the dealers were helpful and friendly and most of the players were nice. The Bad: Most of the staff don't look particularly happy and aren't particularly pleasant. We did end up getting upgraded to the 22nd floor at check-in and a waiver of the $12.99/24hr. internet fee the next day but it was not easy to do. And none of the workers seem to smile much. Maybe they don't get paid well and that's why the hotel is good value for money? Hmmm. Not very convenient to the Strip so if you don't have a car, you'll have to take the City Bus or taxis if you want to get up where all the action is. We had no trouble driving and we also enjoyed exploring Fremont Street. If you're on a budget, things seem to be a little less expensive at that end of town anyway. Side Notes: You have to prance through the hotel lobby in your robe to get to the pool. I guess you have to do this most places but it felt strange. Lots of shiny gold and mirrors all around. No doubt this was high style back in the day but if you're looking for uber-chic Zen decor, this place isn't it. The casino in particular seems very poorly lit, and I'm not sure why.

Very much a party atmosphere on the weekend with alcohol everywhere and many people drinking in the pool itself. Unsure if the best place for kids on the weekend because of that. Sunday there was much more quiet with many kids splashing around. My only complaints (and really not a huge deal) was the elevators.

This was good as we did not have much of a view - but I don't spend much time staring out the window. The bathroom was nice sized - I certainly didn't have any trouble turning on the water, showerhead, etc. standing outside the tub, nor did I have to lay down to rinse my hair - the shower head had great pressure. The tub did drain rather slowly, however. Housekeeping was quite efficient. One phone call and pillows arrived not ten minutes later. They did the rooms twice a day - 8am and 3pm. If you didn't want to be bothered, you just put your privacy sign out. I am guessing that some of the other posters who thought the south tower was such a long walk have never stayed anywhere like Caesers, MGM or some of the other strip hotels. From the south tower elevators it was straight down the hall to the pool, a right then a left and a little more walking and there was the casino. Very convenient. Never did hear any street noise from our room - never even heard our neighbors or people in the hall. The pool area was great. For an FYI for those that are interested, if you are looking directly at the shark tank, the sun hits on the left side of the pool first in the am, then moves across to the right mid-day, and then back to the left late afternoon. Plenty of lounge chairs (with great pads) and seating areas with couches - chairs were plentiful until around 10am or so and then they got sparse. The are also two levels with cabanas above the pools and any chairs that are not in front of cabanas are open to all. Pool opens officially at 10am but you can get in around 830-900am and get a chair; just no towels or swimming until 10. Food was good - the Grotto has wonderful pizza. Cocktail waitressess are all over and you never really had a wait for a cocktail. I played craps and had a great time - even if I am a wussy bettor! Starts at a $5 minimum and at 8 or so goes to $10 but if you have been playing at the lower minimum you can stay at it. Only thing I was a little annoyed at was charging to my room - no problem several times and then at the gift shop all of the sudden they wanted my id!

Most of the Vegas properties have made the game unplayable, used to never see 8 deck shoes there, no doubling down after split pairs on single deck. Terrible blackjack games. If enough people stop playing these highly unfavorable bj games they will revert back to the old rules. The South Point has double deck, 3 to 2 on bj, dbl after splits, $5 minimum.

We stayed their for a seminar. They offer a VIP check-in for an additional $20. It is well worth it because you do not have to wait in long check in or check out lines. You just go to the VIP room around the corner from the check in desk. They have some cheese, fruit, crackers, and bags of nuts offered while checking in and out. The rooms are nice. They have a great pool with jaquzzi's, a water slide and a large shark tank with sharks and fish swimming in the middle of the pool. They have many choices of restaurants, a good nite club with a balcony over looking the downtown walkway and have two Starbuck's inside. If you are on a budget walk over to the Plaza hotel where they have Mc Donald's, Subway, and a reasonably priced buffet. A great buffet with lots of variety and good food, desserts, and drinks included is around the corner at the Main Street station casino. The price is resonable for what all you get. If you want to save on a beer or two walk over to the ABC market towards the Plaza casino. At the Gold Spike they have shrimp cocktails for $1.99 or if get a players card there then the shrimp cock tails are 99 cents. I did not eat at the Golden Nugget buffet so I can not comment on it. It was a great stay. I would recommend the Golden Nugget to my friends if they are going to stay downtown.

The room feels even more spacious because of the huge windows and two open floors. All the drapes work electronically, very cool.

The upstairs bathroom is huge and has a steam shower and big, very comfortable whirlpool bath, a separate w/c with toilet and bidet, a vanity area, a tv over the sinks. There are even mirrors over the king bed, which I tried very hard to avoid looking up at ! The room is very clean and well maintained; my only small quibble with the room is that there is an industrial type of brown carpet that covers the stairs and entire upstairs, including bathroom. Sorta detracts from the overall luxury feel the room's going for, but that's minor. Check in is in the Vip area, a nice touch; I found the desk clerk a bit cold, though polite.

A few things have gotten old about it - the litter, the crowds at night, and the bad gaming odds at strip casinos. We spent a night of our last trip at the Golden Nugget to give downtown a try. This time we spent all three nights (Fri-Sun) there. After this trip, we're sold on downtown. We had a south tower room, which was spotless, had a 42 inch flat-screen TV and a very comfortable king mattress. The hotel was full according to the desk clerk, but the soundproofing between rooms seemed very good. While we saw our neighbors in the hallway, we never heard them. Yes, the bathrooms are small by strip standards, but there is a make-up desk and mirror just outside the bathroom. The shower head was excellent (one of those \"rain\" types) and the towels plush. We didn't try the restaurants, but had the lunch buffet one day and breakfast buffet another. No buffet is gourmet, but the food selections and quality were more than adequate and the buffet dining room is pleasant. The pool is a big attraction, but is too small and crowded for actual swimming (it's best for just taking a dip and looking into the aquarium). We didn't have much difficulty finding a couple of lounge chairs. It only took a couple of minutes of \"cruising\" to find someone who was leaving. They chaises are close together, but very comfortable. Much of the area is shaded at times by the buildings, but to us that's a plus since it's still plenty hot and prevents sunburn. Every staff member we encountered in our stay was pleasant and helpful. We did pay the extra $20 for VIP check-in, which I think was worth it since it was a busy weekend and we wanted to be assured of getting the room type we requested and not having a long wait in line. We checked in about 10:00 Friday morning, and the two woman at the VIP desk gave us a room immediately without our having to ask if that was possible so early. When we checked out Monday there was a line at the main area, but we got helped immediately in the VIP room. I'd do it in the future if coming on a weekend. If anyone at the Golden Nugget reads these reviews, I do have one question - what are you going to do about the pool area when your new building opens? It may be genuinely overcrowded at that point. A plug for downtown in general - we were amazed by the almost total lack of trash compared to the strip. Even off of Fremont street in the neighboring blocks to the north, it was clear that street cleaning is a high priority. Also, there are none of those obnoxious people passing out the girly cards that are everywhere on the strip. Must be something different about city vs. Clark County (where the strip is) rules. Also, the entertainment downtown was outstanding. Major props to the downtown association or whoever it is that puts on the events. The Woodstock Tribute Weekend bands were all excellent. I think some might be better than the original bands they covered (\"Jimi Hendrix\", \"Janis Joplin\", and \"Joe Cocker\" were fantastic). The crowds were ample and the mood very festive. I was also surprised and pleased with demographic of the downtown crowd. I expected old and downbeat, but actually it was pretty much the same mix as the strip. Very few visible \"bums\" either. Throw in that the gaming odds are much better in most downtown hotels, food deals are still plentiful, and it's easy to walk around with the shade and width of Fremont Street. We thought we'd spend at least part of our visit going up to the strip, but we ended up only leaving downtown once. We're no longer into the nightclub scene, but I'd say that is one area where the strip holds a real edge. We'll look first to downtown and the Golden Nugget for our future stays.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Two Harbors", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely thrilled with this hotel and all of its services\u201d", "Author": "sven25", "ReviewID": "UR37967371", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from a 4 night stay at the Golden Nugget.

Golden Nugget is a hotel that we have always wanted to stay at, so we were happy to check it out! We arrived and got checked in (there was a fairly regular stream of people coming in to check in) about 20 people in front of us. Check in was quick, and our wonderful check in agent upgraded us without us asking! We got a very nice room (not sure if they are all like this room, but it had a lot of space, king bed, robes, a couple chairs and writing table.) She offered us a room overlooking the pool which I would have loved to take, but it only had double beds in it and DH is too tall, needs either a queen or king! We overlooked the canopy (we weren't really there for the view though) DH played poker and said the GN room was one of his faves. I found a WOO slot and kept myself occupied for a couple hours :) We found a resteraunt that overlooked the pool (I cannot remember the name of it) but we split a pizza that was really great. We went out to the pool once it cooled down. There were many lounges available all over the place, they have really done a great job of ensuring they have provided as many as they can. They have round bed loungers, regular loungers and couches under a roof cover as well. You can also go to the second floor and sit on the loungers as long as they are not in the private cabanas. I did not check to see if there were loungers on the third floor. We did however stand in a LONG lineup to get on the slide. We did the slide once, it went SO quickly, that we decided not to stand in line again for it as fun and unique as it was. We spent most of our time in the pool under the covered side staring at the sharks, using our underwater camera to get some great video and pics. I will eventually post them. There is a bar as well as a hot tub around the pool, we came out later on at night to check the pool area out after dark and were surprised to see so many people out there, in the hot tub and having drinks at the bar out there. I will absolutely stay downtown again at the Golden Nugget. We really liked the room as well as the vibe of the casino. Service all around was nice and seemed genuine, right down to the doorman.

I want to be absolutely clear to anyone who is trying to decided between the Strip and Downtown. The big boys on the Strip have decided to fight the recession by gouging you at the tables. All of the hotel/casinos I visited that are part of Harrahs, and all of the the ones owned by MGM/Mirage DON'T OFFER REAL BLACKJACK AT A REAL PRICE! Take note of that. ALL of the blackjack tables on the Strip that I visited now only pay 6:5 on a blackjack hand, as opposed to the REAL blackjack, which SHOULD pay 3:2. This raises the house advantage pretty substantially. I'm hoping you won't be like the rest of the dopes at these casinos throwing their money away obliviously, thinking they're playing blackjack: they ain't. 'Nuff said! Now, as for the Golden Nugget...this was my first time staying there, having snagged a deal months beforehand on Continental Vacations. We usually stay next door at Four Queens. Usually the Four Queens is cheaper, but not this time. The Golden Nugget has a reputation of being the \"Wynn\" of Downtown. (The Nugget was Wynn's first casino.) The hotel was nice, but not really much nicer than the Four Queens. And it's much bigger, and the layout and distance from different areas will require your walking shoes. The room was old, but clean and well-kept. The televisions in the South Tower, where we stayed, were older; not really acceptable at this level. The beds were comfortable and the room was fairly large. Oddly, there is no mini-fridge, and housekeeping never gave us shower floor towels. The room, though, was quiet, service was good, and the A/C (so vitally important in this sauna of a climate) worked well. I am an avid runner, and wanted to use the workout facilities. The spa/workout room was nice, but it will cost you a \"nominal\" $20 to use them...per day. I hate that. Very cool pool area, with a circular pool and water slide that surrounds (and the slide goes through) a shark-infested aquarium. The bottom line is that the Golden Nugget is nice, but I personally wouldn't pay more for it if the Four Queens was cheaper, as it usually is.

The staff are awesome, extremely helpful and recall conversations that we had over the week. The desk clerk Laura was wonderful, she was extremely attentive and helpful. The housekeeping staff were also helpful and remembered our names whenever we strolled down the hall. Please don't forget to tip housekeeping, they work hard, we recommend $5 min per night.

Our rooms were in the south tower, and were the lowest cost room type available when we booked. They were recently renovated, in very good condition, and included flat-panel LCD TV, an air conditioner that left our room well cooled on one of this summer\u2019s hottest days, a low table at the entry with a make-up mirror, and two very comfortable beds. For business travelers, there is no desk or other adequate workspace, but there is cabled and wireless HSIA available at $12.99 per day. Owing to its status as an older hotel, the guest room bathrooms are well-appointed, but small. While the room rate was shown as $50 per night, when we called to make reservations, it quickly escalated to more than $75 once we told the reservationist that our seven year old child would be with us \u2013 and \u2013 we elected to pay an extra $20 charge in order to be able to skip long check-in and check-out lines and work through the VIP lounge instead. But, given the length of lines we saw when we arrived, it was $20 well spent. Food and beverage was good, too. The Casino Caf\u00e9 served standard fare (steaks, burgers, sandwiches, pasta) and service was prompt. We didn\u2019t try the other restaurants, but they were very busy and seemed fine. The treat for our family was the pool area and water slide/tube through the shark tank. The kids loved it, and made a dozen trips through the tube during our afternoon there. There is no cost for doing the shark tube slide, and even on a busy day, the maximum wait was about 10 minutes. The pool area itself is very small \u2013 grab a chair early if you plan to use it that day. The H2O bar area is nice, but not over the top. Another treat at the Golden Nugget is the pool-side Blackjack tables. For evening entertainment, the Fremont Experience outside the hotels in that section of downtown Las Vegas is cheesy but entertaining. Parking was free for hotel guests in a deck behind the rear of the hotel. Overall, we\u2019d recommend this hotel as a lower-cost alternative for a pleasure stay in Las Vegas, and we commend the Golden Nugget for all they\u2019re doing to keep the hotel fresh and the downtown casino environment alive.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glendale, arizona", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints here!\u201d", "Author": "glendalegal", "ReviewID": "UR35159712", "Content": "Just got back from several days in Vegas with the teens.

First time 5 or 6 years ago was perfect in every way (except for the tight slots, which are even tighter now but hubby did fairly well on the blackjack tables). We've stayed at the Mirage as well as MGM. Arrived Sunday evening July 12 about 6 and faced a long line for check-in. Soon as we got to the desk we were told we should have gone to VIP check-in. DUH! I had forgotten that fact. We got 2 parlor suites, one for us, smoking, one for our couple friend, non-smoking. We were in the north tower, 2nd floor, friends on 6th floor. We had only a view of the concrete walls between buildings and rows of compressors. First negative was the smell. We've stayed in a lot of smoking rooms but none stunk as bad as this one. I brought my own expensive air freshener which didn't help at all. They should provide some type of decent ventilation. The bathroom fans did absolutely nothing when showering. Pictures online showed a bright cheery room, slightly feminine in decor but both of ours were done in very contemporary, dark tans and browns with minimal lighting and even with curtains opened, it felt like a cave. We had a non-working refrigerator which had 4 warm bottles of water. Maintenance came and inspected it and said they'd try to find a replacement. 10 min. later a tiny little elderly man who couldn't speak English showed up with a luggage rack carrying a really beat up replacement that was half the size of the one in the room. No way could he have lifted it, much less the broken one. We sent him away and soon another maintenance guy shows up and tries to work on it. He gave up after sparks shot out from the bottom and hit his boots! Next day 2 more guys show up with a working replacement. Another complaint was we killed 3 roaches in our room. Not a good sign. The small whirlpool tub had several long dark hairs in it and was so stained I couldn't tell if it was clean or not so only used the shower. I did go down to the VIP lounge to complain and she did offer to move us, but we declined as we were all settled in. She gave me a coupon book for our troubles. Oh boy! $5 discount off $65 Gordie Brown tickets, a free drink with purchase at several clubs and a couple of free desserts with purchase. As another reviewer mentioned, Gordie Brown was ok, but not worth the money. We did have 2 full bathrooms which was nice. Shampoo, conditioner, bar soap and body lotion was provided, no shower gel. We received 4 small bottles of water (complimentary) but they never supplied more. 2 large bottles of Figi water if you wanted to pay $4 each. The bed was very comfortable and was turned down our first nite but we put out the privacy tags after that since the rooms had already been cleaned each day and I'm never comfortable with people in our rooms when we are not there. The dinner buffet was mediocre. There were no cooked vegetable other than mashed potatoes and salads. No green beans, peas, corn, carrots, etc. I asked one of the servers and he said \"I'll go down to the warehouse and see what I can find\". Of course, I already had my plate fixed. I went back to check about 10 minutes later and they had about a 3 serving platter with completely undercooked fresh green beans, red bell peppers and hard as a rock carrots. I guess since they were comped, we couldn't complain too much. My husband and our friends had breakfast (I slept in) at the buffet and said it was excellent. The first morning, we orderd room service and my Eggs Benedict were superb. We never ventured into the pool area although we had intended to. It was just too incredibly crowded with young children everywhere. If you do stay downtown (or just go there from the strip) be sure and catch Carl \"The Safe Sax\" Ferris. He is so great to watch. We've bought 2 of his CD's and they don't disappoint. He plays most nights and takes tips as well as selling his signed CD's. I would still recommend the Nugget hoping others would have the great experience we had the first time. But when making my reservations for our next stay, I will be very specific as to what I expect and will demand another room if it's anything like this last one. I suggest insisting on seeing the room before committing to accepting it. Oh, one other thing: Don't discount the slots at the airport. Our flight was delayed over 2 hours and my husband decided to try the one we'd seen a guy hit big on when we were there last year (stayed at MGM Grand). He ended up hitting a $600 jackpot (put $100 in) after 2 spins and 4 spins later, hit $2700. This was on a dollar machine. The gal that paid him said that was the best paying machine they had. Made the expense of the trip a little easier to swallow!! I would definitely take advantage of their online specials.

Ugly curtains, no flat screen TVS, (couldn't connect my iphone to watch movies, i guess they wanted me to pay for movies!), sheets were \"Days Inn\" types. 2. The maid service. Some times they clean the rooms at 9am, some days at late at 4pm. They was no way to tell when they were going to come. They should have a sign like the cruise ships that says \"Please clean the room\". I left the room early mornings i so they could clean it, come back late afternoons to take a nap, they didn't clean it. And they didn't clean it that day. Also they didn't pick up room service trays right away, some were left in hallway for days. 3. Customer Service. I ran into some problems with the safe, security came to fix it. They seem to have attitude problem, and accuse me of breaking it. They fixed it, but they could have bigger safes (yes ive been to other hotels that have bigger safes) Also, I requested a restaurant chair to help me with my disability, but they gave me a hard time. I just wanted a extra chair! 4. Food was expensive, so we ate at other downtown hotels. 5. Swimming pool was okay, but very crowded. With the new tower being build, it 's even gonna be more crowded. Also they didn't check hotel keys, so I guess anyone could use it. 6. Casino was okay, but at times it too smoke smell ...better ventilation is needed.

The buffet was good and a value at 2 for 1. Like others have said the pool area is very crowded and it is extremely hard to get a chair. There were a lot of families. You had to a walk a far way to get to the elevator for the south tower and yes those annoying time share people were there bugging everyone, just keep walking! If you walk far away from your spouse they will not bother you. We ended up getting a handicapped washroom (the sink was very small and there was no counter space at all to place anything) there was no fridge in the room and the TV did not always work as there were no signals for the channels. The GN is pretty crowded and it seemed like there was a more younger crowd who like to party ( the MSS is more quiet with a different clinental) the slots were tight, could not even win $5.00 (different story at the MSS, the CAL and Binions) drink service was far and few inbetween, not like Binions (with excellent, super friendly waitresses) and MSS or the CAL. In any event, the GN was clean and the room was pretty nice, but not all that big but for $49.00 a night, who can complain. I just will not stay again, it just was not for me. Any way, that's my 2 cents worth.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Charles, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, annoying stay.\u201d", "Author": "Ajay0876", "ReviewID": "UR33621676", "Content": "I booked a room at the Golden Nugget through Orbitz several months before our trip to Vegas. They were running a special which included somewhat discounted pricing on rooms and included a special bonus booklet including gambling vouchers, meal discounts, free meals etc. Many other hotels were offering great pricing on rooms, but didn't have any special bonuses, so we chose the Nugget. Well, once we arrived and self-parked we were accosted by a desk full of used car salesman types trying to sell us discounted tickets to shows. We told them that we just drove all day and want to just check in. They still tried to sell us tickets and finally we had to be very firm in order to get directions to the check in desk. When we arrived at check in the line was ridiculously long. When I got to the desk the clerk was rude and bossy. I tried to give him my printed confirmation from Orbitz and he said he didn't need to see it in a very brash way. Then what a surprise, we get our keys in a little folder and there is nothing in there except our keys. No booklet w/ specials or vouchers. So we have to go back down from our South Tower room, which required us to walk past the desk of show ticket sales people again - just don't make eye contact with them. When I talked to a different gentleman at check in he said that they had \"run out\" of the special booklets and all her could offer us was 2 free passes to the buffet and 2 free passes to the spa/sauna. What a ripoff!! The booklet we were supposed to get included over $100 of vouchers and coupons and we get two passes for a $15 buffet (which was not very good at all btw) and passes for the sauna. If I wanted a sauna I could walk outside where it was 112 degrees! I couldn't even use the \"spa\" passes for any spa services such as massages or manicure/pedicures because it doesn't include that. I asked if we could exchange the spa passes for something else that we would actually use and was told no. I was fuming. We even talked to the host about this and had no success at all. He did nothing for us. They would have been wise to give people gambling vouchers so that we would at least stay in their casino to gamble. We did have fun in the casino, although if you purchase drinks at the bar it was extremely expensive - stick w/ the waitresses. Our room was beautiful, very large and immaculately clean, the bed was so comfortable. Nice bathroom, nice towels. I called housekeeping to come and change our sheets and it was taken care of right away. For some reason the TV got very few channels and the hotel services station would not work, neither would the movie channels. The only downside of our room was that being located in the South Tower meant that everytime we went to and from our room we had to walk by the desk of ticket sales-people. And EVERY time they tried to sell us tickets. It was really annoying!!!! The location was convenient and within walking distance to lots of places on Fremont St. The dinner buffet pretty much stunk. The food was the same quality that I would expect at an Old Country Buffet - Yuck! However, the breakfast buffet was wonderful!!! Everything I had for breakfast was delicious and there were so many choices. The day we were checking out there was a special offer slipped under our door - if we wanted to stay an extra day we could have the room for a discount. I called the front desk and they said we could have the room for $34. If we had gotten our incentives booklet we would have stayed for sure. But without that they're just trying to get more of our money so we opted not to stay the additional night.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLoved It But...

I was in town to play in the poker tournament that the Golden Nugget was sponsoring during my stay. The tournaments were very well run and organized and gave the players good value for the entry fee. With some of the poker room employees running the tournaments the organization of the poker room itself suffered a bit, but still a good experience. I only play poker in Vegas, so I have no opinion on the slots, machines or table games. The Noodle House wasn't great. The service was very good but the food was average. Carson Street Station has an awesome breakfast menu and very good service. Excellent little grill by the Sports Book for burgers and sandwiches. Didn't have time to eat and Vic and Anthony's this trip which I regret.

I also booked it because in the virtual tour of the room, there was both a recliner and a large sofa to relax on. When we got to the hotel, the service was great, and the public rooms were beautiful. When we got to the room however, that was a different story. Our room was in corner in a stairwell area. It was laid out differently than the picture. The walls were very dark brown, not deep tan as the pictures seemed to indicate. This made the room also like being in a cave. Since there were no curtains over the window, there was a lot of music coming from the street as well as a great deal of bright light. Also, the one feature I wanted the most was missing. There were no upholstered chair or couch. Just a wood desk chair and a end of bed bench. No sign of either sofa or recliner. We basically got half a room. The bathroom was so trendy as to be almost unfunctional. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to turn on the water using the ultra modern style faucet, and another 5 minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower. The glass in front of the shower made it very hard on turn on and adjust the shower. Once the shower was on, it was the rain type showerhead and I could never get a forceful spray that I prefer. On the other hand, the TV in the mirror was cool. In the morning we were awaked before 6 am by construction noise from somewhere outside. If there had been curtains on the window, it might have muffled the noise. The buffet was okay, it was food and a large variety but nothing great. The coffee was weak. The casino was laid out in such a way that if you wanted to walk around, you couldn't. There was enough room between slot machines facing each other, but the main walk areas through the casino was so tight as to be unsafe when crowded - elbow to elbow people. The line to get the 24 karat club card was so long we never got ours. The morning we checked out we used the VIP lounge such to have a quiet place to read the newpaper and drink coffee since our room had no chairs. It was beautiful and comfortable, but a group of people came in after us and starting talking, so it wasn't quiet. We asked the ladies at the desk to assist us in a couple of things, but they could not accomodate us. When we checked out, we did talk to the manager about the lack of chairs in our room, and he did knock $50 off the room rate. Overall, the extra cost of the VIP room was not worth it, the few extra amenities we got such as free bottled water, and a few snacks did not make up for the lack of chairs, the noise, the bright lights and lack of quiet space. Our room was $169 before the $50 deduction, but even at $119, that is more than double the cost of a standard room. At least in a standard room there may have been a chair.

The rooms are very nice... large, with flat panel TV's, safes in the closet, and the air conditioning works very well. The bed has a very comfortable pillowtop mattress, and my room was clean and well kept. I will also say that the outside noise doesn't even seem to penetrate here. Elevators are fast, too.

He was early. Relief. Arrived at the Golden nugget and checked in without incidence. No waiting at 6:00 P.M. We had the 21st floor, South Tower. You have a choice of 8 elevators. No waiting . Our room was very clean. The closet had a blow dryer, security safe, ironing board, approx 20 hangers, 2 bathrobes. The bathroom was small but still clean. It has a bathtub w/good water pressure. One sink on a large granite countertop. The basic room included the 5 drawer dresser, table 2 chairs, night stand w/alarm clock and vanity. We had a 47\" flat screen tv. The internet adapter was on the table for $12.50. Not quite sure on the price but close. The beds were quite comfortable and soft. I really dread the hard beds. Never heard any neighbors and the curtains when closed made the room pitch dark. I really enjoyed looking at the pool. This is seen on the 1st floor. What a cool feature. Only one night was it extremely crowded. Sometimes they had only about 20 people in it. Closes at 8:00p.m. Buffet on the 2nd floor. I give it about an 8. We ate breakfast here. We had a woman who did the slow shuffle as our waitress(MS Wiggins). I enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the Fremont so much better. The egg guy at the fremont was terrific. He was on it. I did not enjoy the Fremont for dinner. Ate at the Carson Street cafe for supper. Good place to eat. Service was great. Manager walked around and asked us if we had good service. I would definitely stay here again. The fitzgeralds still has the old slot machines. In fact some of there machines would not take the new $5.00 bill. Alot of them still return the coins instead of the tickets. The fitz has gone down hill since i stayed there 3 years ago. Smoky smell is bad. I really hate that as i see the potential of this hotel. I used to love that hotel They have a Mcdonalds there. Ask for Senior citizens drink/coffee. Cheaper. Never did find Burger King even though it shows ads on it. The Plaza has a Mcdonalds and a Subway in it. They do not offer the senior discount For bowlers: Binions has a shuttle bus that takes you to the Cashman Center at no charge except tip. Its in the back of Binions. The taxi cost $6.50 from fremont street to Cashman. Walking distance is about 20 minutes from Main street. Parking at the Cashman was $3.00. Transportation: Fremont has a free Charter bus that takes you to Sam's Town. From there you take another free bus ride to the strip(Harrah's & Riviera). Last run back is approx 10:45 p.m. This is how we got around. My husband's brother took the Deuce from Stewart street (downtown) to the strip. Information is on the RTC website. I believe it was $7.50 one way. Also the Cat (local bus) information in on the RTC. I believe that approx $1.50. I called them to find out what bus route to take to the strip. I ended up going out on the fremont bus. website. We ate at the Margaritaville on the strip. We ate a volcano. Large mound of chips/chili & cheese. This could eat 4. We bought one for two. Way to much. This was great. I am glad we stayed at the Golden Nugget. It is so much closer to the bowling center.

Service was exceptional from start to finish. The guys at the front door of the hotel were friendly & courteous. Check-in was a piece of cake with very knowledgeable and friendly staff. My husband shipped his bowling balls ahead of us for ease of travel and asked the staff to locate the package. Within 5 minutes of us arriving in our room, the box was delivered to us. The room was just as their website described. We had a king-sized bed and a very large, comfortable room. My only complaint (which is certainly not the hotels fault) was that we stayed on a smoking floor (hubby is a smoker). Room had a desk, a table with 2 chairs, dresser with a large flat screen TV on top, dressing table with makeup mirror, large closet with a safe, iron, ironing board, hairdryer and extra pillows. And the best of all...2 absolutely, fabulous bathrobes! We had dinner at the buffet that evening and breakfast there everyday after that. The weekend brunch was just fabulous with your choice of champagne or mimosa's and lots of great choices with everything you could imagine for brunch! Saturday was my day at the spa, while hubby went to play in the casino. I just started working out with a trainer and was sore from being out of shape, so I decided to go for the \"sports massage\" and facial. I was pampered from the start and the staff was great. I was brought into the spa and shown everything there (which includes the salon, fitness area, hot tub, sauna & dry heat rooms). I was given a pair of sandals and brought to the changing/waiting room. I was given a locker which had a robe to change into and where I could keep my clothes while I was at the spa. The waiting area was comfortable with lounge/chaise chairs and cold refreshments & snacks. I changed and was immediately called in for my massage. The massage was great and lasted for 50 minutes...not so much relaxing as it was healing my sore muscles. I was then brought back to the waiting area to wait to be called in for my facial. It was a 30 minute facial which everyone should experience! Throughout my massage & facial, both staff members were constantly asking if I was comfortable and enjoying my spa experience. Once my facial was done, I decided to go into the hot tub. I enjoyed that to the point where I became wrinkled! Once I was ready to leave, the shower area was complete with everything one could possibly need...shampoo, conditioner, razors, washcloths, towels, etc. The makeup area was complete with combs, hairdryers, deodorant, body lotions, etc. The experience was wonderful, relaxing and something I would certainly recommend to anyone! Later that afternoon, the day continued with a BIG win on the Kentucky Derby which was shown on 4 big screens in the Grand Ballroom. Sunday was bowling day in the afternoon, so most of the morning was spent on the casino floor (which was fun & profitable!) Monday morning (VERY early...6am) was bowling day #2, so we were back at the hotel by 10 am. I wanted to spend some time by the pool while hubby went to play in a poker tournament (which he won!!!) The pool was just AMAZING! Waitstaff was very courteous and busy! Towels were supplied poolside and frozen strawberry margaritas were great. The shark tank was just the coolest thing I have ever seen. To be able to take a dip in the pool and swim up to the fish and sharks was just amazing. Very relaxing lounge chairs in the shallow part of the pool were refreshing too. Wished I had worked in a trip down the slide, but was enjoying myself too much relaxing in a lounge chair. 4 blackjack tables poolside were very good to hubby as well.

We were not disappointed in the slightest on fact our expectations were exceeded. We arrived late (midnight) and we had a very quick and easy check in. Our room was a King Deluxe in the South Tower. Room was big and was identical to the photos on the website. Room was lovely and clean as too was the bathroom. Only thing lacking in the bathroom was a mini showergel, but this is really being picky as we had everything else and more besides. Bath was low with easy access and hand rail. The cleaners came to tidy our room and make the bed daily, they changed the sheets every other day, and they did a fantastic job. The food at the hotel, buffet and Carson Street Cafe is excellent. We only ate at those places did not try other places. In fact we had a buffet breakfast most days and found that we filled up on it so much so that we really didnt feel the need to eat anything else for the rest of the day, we would have an evening snack of sandwich or similar and we would be fine. The South Tower alone had 16 elevators, 8 for the even floors and 8 for the odd floors. There were elevators and moving stairways upto the buffet restaurant and Showroom. The casino floor was all on groundfloor level as was the Tank, other restaurants etc. The casino was nice and airy, not too much smoke and did not smell as some other casinos did. The staff at the hotel did everything they could to assist us, even the bell hops, one of which booked and arranged a trip for us to hoover dam at short notice. The Deuce bus stop to the strip is just a couple of blocks away, and we used this service everyday. Costs $3 for one way trip $7 dollars for all day or $15 dollars for 3 days. The 3 day pass proved really good value. Journey sometimes was quick but other times could be lengthy but we felt this just depended on time of day and driver.

Lots of food including meats, eggs, bagels, pastries, fruit cereal, etc. The bourbon sauce is a must try (we poured it over the bread pudding - yum!!). Lunch buffet is not nearly as good and the only saving grace was that they still had the omelet station going and of course that lovely bourbon sauce... Location is good. It is very convenient to access different casinos with little walking. We walked down to Main Street Station a few times and highly recommend the Microbrewery there. Pool is cool.

The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino surprised me with comfort and luxury I had doubted existed downtown. VIP check-in was fast and convenient. Our 17th floor Gold Club Level room was beautiful, furnished with modern details and a very comfortable bed, offered robes and slippers, plenty of storage and complimentary coffee, snacks and water. The view of the pool was inviting yet the automatic window shade tightly shut out the morning sun. My husband was tickled by the television set into the mirror of the bathroom as well as the huge flatscreen in the bedroom. They even provided a collection of music CD\u2019s and free wireless internet service. Dining options were good, yet varied in quality. At Vic and Anthonys, we shared the most amazing Australian Lobster tail and a 24 ounce bone-in ribeye, cooked to perfection. I was a bit distracted by the noise level, expecting a more romantic steak house environment. We were delighted with the quiet atmosphere, service and options at Lillie\u2019s Noodle House- try the Sea Bass! Carson Street Caf\u00e9 was convenient and offered a good variety all hours. I would not recommend Grotto, unless you are satisfied with Olive Garden quality dining. The buffet was a huge disappointment, as it is recommended by many guides as a local favorite. The food choice was minimal and unappetizing. The pool at this hotel was great. Not only for the fantastic aquarium situated in the middle of the swimming area, but the shaded H20 bar area provided an excellent space for extended relaxation. We spent quite a bit of time lounging on a huge papasan, gazing up at the palm trees and listening to great music. Celebrating our 11th anniversary, we felt comfortable with the many other couples the resort seems to attract. Unlike the distance required to travel on the main strip to see \u2018nearby\u2019 attractions, the Freemont Street Experience is right outside the door of the Golden Nugget. It was a great party! We enjoyed the advantage of watching the action from the balcony of Golddiggers, a second story nightclub in the casino. The hotel is under construction, building a 4th tower on the West side.

So here is my review, hope you find this useful! We booked our package through Allegiant Air, flying out of Eugene, Oregon, three nights, and a round trip shuttle to and from the airport. All that for $600 total. This was definatly the way to go, and here is why...Allegiant Air is a cheap no frills airline, its been the third time i've flown to Vegas with them and its been great everytime. The airline was ontime leaving out of Eugene and we actually landed about 10 minutes early so that is always great when you are excited! So the bad thing about flying into Vegas right now is they only have One Tram working. So there is a long wait to get to baggage claim. This will be ongoing for sometime. Just a warning so be ready for this, also, keep that in mind when you return, give yourself plenty of time to get through security and back on the One Tram thats working. The round trip shuttle option offered through Allegiant was a great deal, saved a few bucks, it was $28 round trip. It only took minutes after we got our bags to be on the way to the hotel so that was pretty awesome I thought. If you outright get a shuttle it can be $14 per person each way, and a cab from the airport to Golden Nugget yikes! We did the regular check in the Golden Nugget, took only minutes and the room we reserved online was ready for us so no need to pay the extra $20 for VIP. So here's the great deal for a prepaid trip to Golden Nugget, they do not need your credit card or debit card for incidentals! Otherwise they hold $100 per night, so that was another good deal! We stayed in the South Tower, 10th floor room 10109 and had a view of the Stratoshper Tower. So all the complaints about the walk from your room to the casino floor, don't worry about it, its not bad at all! I've stayed on the strip, now that's a long walk! They do have those pesky Tahiti Villiage people along the way to the elevators, so just don't make eye contact, keep walking and you'll be ok! Actually its not that bad at all. So the food was great there, we ate at Lillies Noodle house, two of us came to $60 and the food was great! Ate at Carson Cafe for breakfast, great again. Ate at the buffet for breakfast, not the best but only $10 each so what do you want for only ten bucks?? The thing i liked about the buffet was the veiw of the pool! So the staff was excellent, everyone was very friendly! I can't wait to stay here again, i receomend this hotel to anyone wanting a great Vegas experiance. How can you beat it? Catch the Duece to the Strip, its only $3 one way or $7 for an all day pass. We caught a cab from Excallaber to Freemont and it was $25 so cabs are pricey!! Just be warned.

We chose the Golden Nugget because of their reputation for being the nicest hotel Downtown. From what we saw of the other casinos, Golden Nugget is BY FAR the nicest and the classiest. We played at the other casinos, but I couldnt get my husband to eat anywhere else but the Golden Nugget. We chose a deluxe room in the North tower because of the upgrade features. The flat screen TV was very large and the bed was great. The sheets were very comfortable and the pillows and comforter were super soft. We LOVED the room. It was better than the standard room at the Flamingo and on par with the remodeled rooms at Treasure Island. The common areas are beautiful and the pool was nice. The only complaint about the pool area is the number of available chairs. We were there during a HOT spell, and before the pool even opened, most of the lounge chairs were taken. This is concerning considering we saw a sign in the construction area saying there were 500 more rooms being built. Hopefully they expand the pool area too. As for the construction, we only heard noise one morning and it was barely noticable. Since the construction area overlooks the pool, we did see more than one construction worker staring down at the pool area, presumably checking out the bikinis by the pool. The casino and restaurants were very nice and had a very classy feel. I dont think the slots were as loose as the other hotels downtown and the table limits are higher. I realized quickly that since the new building needed to be funded , the slots would probably be tighter . Most of my gambling dollars went across the way to Binions and their $2 roulette. As for location, Downtown is the way to go. We love the Fremont Street experience light show, the entertainment and the action at night. The clientele is a little rough at times, but it is on some parts of the strip too. One good thing, no annoying people flicking their nudey girl cards at you. You can walk easily to multiple different hotels that have good gambling . We have found that the strip casinos take your money FAST. Downtown you can play longer and have a lot more fun.

The hot tub is open until 2am and is a very nice place to relax at the end of the day. We did not spend too much time on Fremont street at night but if I go back to Vegas I would hang out on Fremont a bit more. We went to the main strip a couple of times and in my opinion Fremont street had a way better vibe, and everything is close together. *Tip* If you have a car and you want to visit the strip you can valet park your vehicle at the Bellagio for free (tips are expected). Other hotels might do this too, but the Bellagio is kind of in the heart of the strip and is a great place to start exploring.

I have never been so disappointed - the service/atmosphere has changed tremendously for the worse. We (the entire group) had seven rooms in the North Tower on different levels. Two rooms in the South Tower as they were \"sold out\" in the North. It was Valentine's holiday so my husband decided to surprise me with a Club Room. It was a beautiful room with tasteful appointments - cd player complete with Frank Sinatra cds, large plasma/hd tv, clock with iPod station, free bottled Figi water,etc. However, coffee promised near elevator? It was there one morning during our stay. The \"food/snacks\" consisted of m&m's, granola, chocolate covered rasins and a bowl of apples. It was there one day but all of it was gone by 11am over the weekend and not refilled all day. I had an apple on the day we checked in and found a bottle of water. The goodies were in bowls with spoons but I saw ppl dip there hands in for a handful. eww! The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows! Bathroom was nice with tv built into the mirror. Bath robes and slippers provided. Our maid was wonderful and our room was cleaned to perfection every day. Do NOT expect \"express room service\" as it took an hour and a half to get mediocre food at room service rates. You can hear everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) in the room next to you. We were on the 17th floor. WiFi did not work for our stay. Pretty pointless to book a room on this level unless you really stay in the room the entire stay. View was of the mountains in background. Nothing special. Here's the ugly... Casino - As stated, we were on a yearly trip always staying at GN with family and friends. We were there in August for our anniversary and labor day with a wonderful stay too. So we are really wondering.. WHAT HAPPENED???? At the end of this trip three of us had been verbally accosted - I was called a [-] by a pit supervisor in front of everyone remaining at the table! 3 card poker with some great ppl from MN and others. I had previously heard some mumblings about us \"midwesterners\" but let it go. Instead of simply stating \"Hi folks, It's late and I will be closing this table down in 10 minutes\" we kind of chuckled as the pit boss walked by and quietly upped the minimum from 5 per hand, to 10, to 25 without a word. We had been playing for a couple of hours at wayyy more than the minimum, having fun with the dealer (who was very nice btw) and tipping as well. Perfectly understandable that they would close down a table if it were empty but it was not. When the \"pit supervisor\" upped it to 25 (remember 3 card is 3 bets!) I had money on the table and was finishing a hand while others looked on. This guy arrogantly called the bet off as I \"was not playing the minimum bet\". Huh? You just turned it in the middle of a hand!? I was not happy at all but when I went to walk away.. he called me that in front of everyone in the casino and loud enough to hear. When I turned and said \"what did you just call me?\" He had the audacity to repeat it. Even the kind ppl who had been sitting next to me were in awe. I really don't know who this guy thought he was but wow..there was absolutely no reason for it. We could not believe that in a casino hotel of this \"caliber\" had no GM on duty. This guy just grinned and asked \"what are YOU going to do about it?\" No manager was on duty or at least no one wanted to deal with me -I was crying at that point. Go figure. This is not our first trip ..take a look at my profile - not pretentious or a snob of any kind. I simply like kind ppl, comfortable surroundings and beleive that you should take care of your \"guests\". You simply expect someone in upper management to contact you about such an issue even the next morning. They were probably all off playing on a holiday weekend - this is Wednesday evening and we have heard nothing. I must say one lady who was also a pit super from that evening sent to pacify me..so \"generously\" took off a whopping 35.00 charge from our bill on our final day. The head of security at least called back but told us to write to the GM. Wow. (and he/she can't take care of this because???) On another evening - late on our last night our friends wanted to gamble before bed so they were at the crap table where one guy was referred to as an \"[-] in front of everyone. I was on my way to my room when our friends called me over. The dealers will mock you behind your back so watch out - this guy had played for days on several trips to this casino, tips well and is one of the nicest guys you will meet. Also, know that the F word flies freely so consider yourself warned if you are sensitive to this kind of language. I hope if you decide to gamble here you understand these guys can rip you off and call you every name in the book and WILL get away with it. I don't know what is going on with this place but for these reasons we will head to another casino on our next trip. Since I don't want to just list the bad - we had fun despite the situations (they are NOT going to get away with wrecking our trip) here are some good points- We did meet many nice guests and I really enjoyed playing craps with the couple next to me who had the most amazing roll I have ever seen. Congrats again dear - you deserved it! During warm months the pool is amazing. There were many ppl IN the heated pool but it was too cold to lay out near it or that is where I would have stayed after the casino assault. The bar near the pool serves amazing bloody marys. :) Rent a cabana -so nice. The RED restaraunt for sushi is wonderful and the wine bar is quite nice for socializing. Carson Cafe had great food and drinks for reasonable resort prices. Next time to Vegas we will try Four Queens - we spent much of the next day there gambling and found the dealers and bartenders (while playing Video Poker) to be the best! I love staying downtown as it is fun to be able to visit many casinos in one area DH is returning with friends next week but is NOT returning to GN. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel has such ugly staff and needs so much improvement before we will ever return. One more note..we have also stayed at NY/NY, Bellagio and Binions before the GN and if you check our trips it is a VERY rare occasion when I have something negative to say.

The service was excellent from the bellmen to check in, to maid service to the awesome room service attendant I had. Breakfast at the \"Nugget\" is still very reasonably priced - something hard to find in vegas. They do add that typical room service charge onto the tab, but even with that, a full breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast and coffee only cost me around $15-20. Excellent bfast! Room had thick, plush carpeting and bedding - nice shampoos and toiletries in bathroom replaced daily by maids. Great view from room. Outside of hotel is gorgeous at night! Inside is lovely as well. Downsides: This hotel is NOT on the Vegas strip - no where near it! If you want to see anything on the strip, you will need to rent a car or have lots of cash stashed for taxi fare back and forth to the strip. Lucky for me, I had a local friend who was driving me around wherever I wanted to go. Cabs are not cheap here and they wiill try to find the scenic route whenever possible.. The spa at the hotel was extremely overpriced and not at all enjoyable. I paid $$$ to have a manicure/pedicure and the woman slaughtered my poor feet. She took too much skin off my feet and I had a hard time walking for almost a week after she got done with me. So not only is it overpriced, they don't know what they are doing in there. Also, for what you pay, they didn't even have the decent pedicure chairs with attached foot bath...My feet were soaking in a bucket!! Do NOT pay the big bucks for a pedicure here. The slots here seemed quite tight. I saw no one winning anything. I did see quite a number of unsavory looking characters lurking around (only in the casino part downstairs) and felt there should have been better security there. Mediocre: All the food eaten at all the restaurants at the hotel - with the exception of the room service bfasts - of course! :-) Overall: Very much worth the money, would stay here again and do what i did last time - stay here for the nice room, but go elsewhere for better gambling and to avoid the unsavory looking characters in the Nugget's casino.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cGold Club Room\u201d", "Author": "satx", "ReviewID": "UR23833634", "Content": "Background - married couple in their mid to late 50's and retired. We booked our airfare and hotel on a New Years Eve Special and got 50% off both airfare (Southwest Airlines) and our hotel room for 3 nights here at Golden Nugget. Because the fares were so reasonable we opted for a Gold Club Room (Concierge Class). We arrived at the hotel about 2:30pm and went to VIP check in and it took approximately 5 minutes (in the meantime my husband got himself a juice and a bag of pretzels to tide him over until dinner - this is included with the cost of a suite or Gold Club Room). Our room was on the 16th floor near the elevators (as requested at reservation time). I was surprised at the size of the room (large) but I also noticed that our room did not have the L shaped leather sofa and instead included a leather lounger along with a fabric recliner. I would like to add that even if the room had the L shaped sofa it would have still been considered large. The mattress was nice albeit on the firm side, bedding was nice. The room is very dark and it's necessary to have the blind open. Our room faced the Freemont Experience and the Nevada Mountains. The bathroom has a nice amount of counter space but otherwise it's dysfunctional in design. The flat screen tv was okay but the speakers are inadequate for a room this size without turning up the speakers to an unreasonable level (due to neighbors on either side). Included with this room is wifi, coffee in the mornings, bottled water in the afternoons and evenings, along with snacks. I agree with previous reviews concerning the fact that the snacks (choc covered raisins, jelly bellys, peanut m&ms, and trailmix) are open to hands that could have been anywhere (yuck). What we didn't like at all is housekeeping, it's poor at best. We were out of our room before 7:30am each morning and it was after 2pm most days before the room was ready for us again - not satisfactory at all. The air conditioning units are old and are noisy but we are people that like ambient sounds while we sleep anyway. We were able to hear the Freemont Experience from our room and it was somewhat annoying and then on our second morning we heard saws of some kind beginning around 6am - it was background noise but annoying nonetheless. We ate at Carson Street Cafe (good but not what it was even 2 years ago), The Grille (inside the casino area and a very good value with excellent food), and The Grotto (Italian - good).

The heated pool with water slide and fishtank is a nice feature. Still, I cannot give a better rating than average/neutral. For $100 dolars average rate/night I do expect decent treatment, decent conditions as listed above, and more!!! There isnt a coffee maker in the room, excuse me!? Subjective I know, but it's just terrible to not enjoy a slow start with a cup of coffee in bed! The choices are: to pay about 5.50 (small pot of coffee) + 5 (operation fee to all room service orders) + tax + gratuity = which comes to about what? 15 bucks coffee? or to face the world with your morning face, take the elevator to the starbucks \"conveniently located\" :D right outside the elevators, and get back in bed? Ridiculous! On the down side also, the rooms have outdated looking ac units, settings not very clear, difficult to adjust the room temperature in the winter; first night I woke up frozen, second night was okay but the unit started to make a loud noise that woke me up so I stopped it, third night just folded the blankets in two - that was a good nite, fourth night forgot the heater on -that never stopped and I ended up sick because of the overdry and heated air. Those with allergies/sinuses problems Beware! I ate once at the cafe-(dont remember the name Carson?), food was good. Room service was also good - the prices too - 6 dollars a mimosa:) The pastries at starbucks in the hotel were very fresh and delicious, especially the fruit tart, also cheesecake and danishes. I liked the New Years atmosphere on Fremont outside the hotel. I cannot comment on any other features of the hotel, as I only used it to sleep/rest, then went out sightseeing strip, hoover dam, etc. It's 8.50 + tips the shuttle to and from the airport, which I find convenient. It's about 5 dollars the bus to the strip from what I heard but havent used it. It' s 23 dollars the taxi from the strip -(Luxor area)back to the hotel. Note that it's almost impossible to find a taxi on a holiday night like New Year's Eve, we waited over 15 minutes for one -out of many passing by -to stop and then they ask \"how much are u willing to pay!?\" It's up to anyone's negociations skills and no less than double:) In conclusion, I would stay at GN again, but I will bring with me a coffee maker and a humidifier..of course, after I check out its competion on the strip first:)", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEfficient, comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "Flyingred", "ReviewID": "UR23635457", "Content": "I spent six nights at the GN coinciding with CES.

The Golden Nugget's main area's were updated and fancy enough, I loved the idea of the pool and the shark tank with the fish and sharks swimming by. You can see it from the lobby. Their buffet was closed, so we used the two-for-one coupon given at checkin for a main entree instead at the cafe. It was ok, just not as good a deal had it been the buffet. We're from Boston, and in my reading on Vegas nobody mentioned that there is PLENTY of FREE parking. Seriously. At least when we went. Every hotel has a self-park lot, which we were plenty happy with--let alone the valet service which we didn't even try. Some people complained about the Strip being a \"parking lot\", but we didn't find it that bad at all (again, Boston). The reason I mention this is that the Golden Nugget is a long 3+ mi to the top of the Strip, which itself is 4 miles long. I wholeheartedly recommend getting a car to explore Vegas: save your energy for walking inside the huge resorts, rather than between them. The resorts themselves are so full of detail, you can easily get mentally and physically tuckered out. Perhaps at most you can do two a day (if looking at the architecture/sites is your thing). We had no problem getting from the middle of the Strip to Downtown where the Golden Nugget is by car. We had to return the car early, so a taxi from MGM Grand to GN was $25. Rent the car. We stayed here because at the time it had the lowest rate for the supposedly higher quality (hotwire \"4 star\" for $75 a night, during CES). I disagree with the stars (lower).

Our room was perfectly maintained by the housekeeping staff. The service has lost that personal touch. No one was rude - just not as friendly as in the past. We stayed in the south tower at an average rate of $54.00 a night. Don't get me wrong - for that price the room was good. It was just lacking a couple of simple things that could easily make it high class again. For instance, one night we had no wash cloths. Some of the towels were frayed around the edges. The sheets were too small for the bed to remain tucked in and the carpet in the halls was stained and worn. On the plus side, the beds have been upgraded to pillow top mattresses.

The property in my book gets an 11 out of 10 \u2013 the rooms are really nice at affordable rates (please tell me where you can find a 4 diamond resort in this country for $59 a night other then Las Vegas!?!), the amenities are amazing, and the Food & Beverage outlets are impressive (although I would expect so much with the hotel now being run by a Food & Beverage company). On this specific trip I stayed 2 nights for my birthday to pretty much drink at the pool during the day and relax in a nice comfy bed. We ate at the buffet for breakfast (2 for 1-$10) for a great breakfast buffet; we had room service-decent, and ate dinner one night at Grotto (very good we had a FEAST for $100 including a few drinks). My only complaint with the property was some of the customer service I received. I presently work for a strip property in customer service and have reasonable expectations (I understand things that might upset your typical guests and I try not to ask for too much BUT at the same time it takes an extra step to WOW me). The front desk clerk at check in wasn\u2019t friendly and seemed to be just \u201cdoing his job\u201d as we say \u2013 he didn\u2019t explain anything to me I had to ask questions to get anything out of him. I had issues with the authorization on my card (they over authorized on incidentals) and when I called the front desk to ask why, I stated the clerk who checked me in told me it would only be $100 a night and I\u2019m being hit $130 a night \u2013 they replied \u201cthe system sometimes does that\u201d. I was using a debit that a family member had pre-paid for my trip for me as a gift with the exact amount for room & tax + $100 incidentals on it. An authorization on a debit card is as good as a cash withdrawal in most circumstances \u2013 and asked the hotel manager that if my account over withdrew due to this lack of information given to me were they going to cover my over withdrawal fees passed on to my family member-they said no and were very rude about the situation. I clearly signed off on $100 incidentals a night on my registration card, so if I wanted to take legal action I could. Luckily no over withdrawal fees were passed and all was fine & dandy with me-but it was the manner both front desk reps and managers handled the situation that left a sour taste in my mouth. On a positive note every dealer, server, and food & beverage representative was great \u2013 I would highly suggest a retraining of the front desk staff on 4 Diamond Standards.

This is great, but what about fining people for smoking in the common areas of the floor too?? While I was there, these jerk partiers couldn't smoke in their rooms, so they go out into the hall to do it, and some of the smoke comes in my room.

When we checked in (a process that took a long time, but it takes a long time everywhere in Las Vegas, honestly), we were told, of course, that we were in a room with two double beds. Not exactly the weekend I had imagined, as I'm not a Puritan. When I asked about a king bed, I was told that not a single king room was available in the entire hotel. I silently stared at the clerk for a while, and eventually she caved and \"consulted a manager\" who \"found\" a king room in the North Tower. Our room was a) behind the elevators, b) next to the ice machine, and c) directly across from the housekeeping phone. So it was quite possibly the worst room in the entire hotel, if not Las Vegas, which is what I get for being tough and demanding my way. Also, our view? A dirty wall.

I decided to go with the south tower anyway, and... maybe I just lucked out, or maybe it's important to ask for a room on the upper floors (we were on the 18th floor). But my budget room boasted a pillow-top bed, a flat-screen TV and an in-room safe(!) Anyone out there who, like me, might be hesitant about choosing an \"old\" room shouldn't be. It was very nice -- large, nicely decorated, with several pieces of furniture, a table, chairs and a nice, clean bathroom with plush towels and even two robes in the closet. Sure, the carpet is a little worn, but it didn't bother me. My only complaint -- and it may sound strange -- the bed pillows were horrendous. I can't believe such a high-class establishment would put such uncomfortable pillows in their rooms. One night, I simply could not sleep because of the pillows -- they're small with bunched up, lumpy foam. To the hotel's credit, though, the front desk had a replacement pillow delivered to me in the middle of the night, and it was fine and my sleep was fine after that.

I just did not find the place \"fun\" or \"relaxing\" and could not stand the smoke. This is an older building and lacks modern air purificaton systems.

The hotel was also uncomfortably cold in all the common areas e.g restaurants,corridors as the air conditioning was on full blast. Luckily we had an air conditioning unit in our room which we were able to programme ourselves. The area where the hotel is located is grim and ugly. There's no ( advisable) way to get to the central strip ( where all the more glamorous hotels + fun is) unless you get a taxi for the 10 mile ride. The taxi cost us 25 dollars each way. The less advisable way is to catch a local bus from the nearby bus station. We tried to do this but failed to do so as we were given such poor info from the receptionist who just wanted us to catch a taxi! The bus station environment was pretty dodgy looking too. If you're going to Las Vegas to gamble and nothing else then this hotel is probably OK as it has a casino.

There is not one nice shop, simply not one. Only a few ordinary souvenir shops and a few casino's, that's it. If you spend half an hour in Fremont Street than you've seen it. In the hotel and in Fremont street you have to see the crowd. I've never seen so many ordinary people together in one place, the crowd in the hotels on the strip is very different. Sorry I have to say this but most of the guests in the Golden Nugget are rather low class. I sometimes felt uncomfortable. You can certainly leave your best clothes at home. Beware the distance to the strip, a taxi ride will cost you 25$ one way with tip. When checking out early in the morning computers were down, they couldn't even tell me the amount of my bill.

We were not disappointed with our stay at The Golden Nugget and enjoyed Fremont Street tremendously. We were booked in for 11 nights. Check-in was quick and easy and I requested a room with a good view and had the choice of downtown or the mountains. I opted for the latter. We were located in the South Tower, which is very close to the pool area, Carson Street Caf\u00e9 and one of the 2 Starbucks operating within the hotel. The room was extremely spacious and very clean. It comprised of two double beds, a bedside table between the beds with a lamp, telephone and digital clock. There was a large chest of drawers with ample room for clothes, on which sat a huge plasma screen television. In addition was a good sized round table, two comfortable chairs and a very large wardrobe with an abundance of coat hangers, one iron, ironing board, hairdryer, two dressing gowns and a safe. The window does open and there is an air-conditioning unit underneath the window frame, which was quite effective in the intense heat we experienced. Also within the room was a vanity unit with two good mirrors and an ice bucket (there is a free ice machine further up the corridor). The bathroom was a good size with a large vanity unit, bath and shower. An abundance of clean towels were provided each day and we were never without the free toiletries as these were replenished each day. The Golden Nugget is a beautiful hotel, extremely clean and comfortable with a good atmosphere. All the staff we dealt with were friendly and eager to help. The beds were as comfortable as those we have at home and housekeeping was without fault. It was such a pleasure returning to our clean and tidy room each day. The breakfast buffet was extremely good value with a huge selection each morning, all freshly prepared and quite delicious. We also ate the Champagne Brunch at the weekend and again the food was fresh and delicious with a wide selection to choose from and the champagne was flowing freely with our glasses topped up regularly. We ate several times at Carson Street Caf\u00e9 and we were constantly impressed at the excellent quality of the food and the very reasonable prices. Again, it was a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were efficient and friendly. We enjoyed several mornings at the Shark Tank and Pool on very comfortable sun loungers. The pool area is very attractive and again extremely clean. It is an amazing experience to swim alongside the sharks and other fishes in the tank. There are two bars, which serve drinks and food (although a little expensive) and a good mix of music plays all day, to suit all tastes. It did become a little crowded over the weekend and the sun loungers are quite close together. However the terraced area was quiet. The pool also has a hot bath, which can hold up to 50 people. In this area are comfortable seats and day beds. There are also several Cabanas for hire. The slots were kind to us at The Golden Nugget. On joining the Players\u2019 Club you are given $10 free play. I proceeded to win $70, which was rather nice as it didn\u2019t cost me a penny to bet! My husband and I could not fault The Golden Nugget and if we were to return to Las Vegas we would not hesitate to stay here again. Downtown is a different holiday to that of the Strip. There is a party atmosphere each evening with live bands and street entertainment. During the day it is very relaxed and you do not get tired walking to the casinos as they are next door to one another. Also, the price difference is very noticeable with Fremont Street being far cheaper and better value than the Strip.

First time in Vegas. This hotel is great! It's a lot cheaper than staying on the Strip, and in my opinion, the area where it is (Fremont St/Downtown) is far better. It is so much cheaper and smaller (much easier to get around) than the Strip. its the original Las vegas! If you want to go down to the Strip, just take the bus (The Deuce) for a couple of $. The hotel is smaller than its Strip counterparts but it really is lovely. The pool is unbelievable - a huge shark aquarium, water slide, water falls, hot tub! There are lots of good places to eat - a cafe which serves breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner; the buffet is fantastic; and italian. There are 2 starbucks on site. Nightclub and a bar also. Our room: we asked for a smoking room but learned our lesson. After coming from smoking-unfriendly New york we assumed Las vegas would be the same....WRONG! you can smoke indoors in Las Vegas. Our room stank of stale smoke and all our clothes (even in the wardrobe and suitcases) smelled bad. We thought it would get better (there is only A/C so no actual ventilation) but it didn't. We should have asked to change room but we didn't. Oh well, we will know for next time!!! Staff are very friendly and approachable. Casino is good too, but we didn't do much gambling; far better to watch someone else put $5000 on red at the roulette ;) all in all, great hotel for the money, very luxurious. P.S We seen our friends room at the MGM Signature - Penthouse suite which was amazing but it was their honeymoon $$$$$! they said that they actually preferred our hotel amenities and location. Plus they arrived to be told they had to pay an extra $15 a night for \"service charge\" for use of the pool!!

The bellhops were not too pushy and the desk clerks were friendly. The wait to register was about 10 minutes on a 08/12/08, Tuesday 4:00pm check in. We were staying at the South Tower which was located on the opposite side of the casino, but you got to view the shark tank pool through the a.c. lobby as you walked to your elevators. The negative was the time share people just outside the elevator hallway hawking you with \"Hi, are staying here for a couple of days ..... blah,blah,blah ..... \" as we just walked by and ignored them. The rooms were very nice and clean. They had a vanity top inside the restroom and just outside the bathroom was another vanity top for the ladies to get ready, while the restroom was being occupied. The beds were very comfortable and we requested feather pillows to be sent up to the room. The rooms come with a free to use digital safe, which came in handy. The a.c. was the under the window type which was no distraction to us. Overall, we were satisfied with the rooms and felt they were larger than your standard room, because of the vanity area. These South Tower rooms are nice and no upgrade is needed to be comfortable. The valet pick up was busy and slow, so we opted to use the self parking garage, which was actually very close to the South Tower. This made going to your room very easy and fast as opposed to using the valet and having to wisk your way through the casino, past the Shark Tank Pool and then the restaurant row, then your elevators. Use the self parking if time and distance is of the essence. The breakfast buffet was great and cheap at only 9.95 per person and it included an omelet station, salmon, fruit, salad, dessert, and free drinks. The line was brisk and we even got to use the buy one get one free coupon that we picked up at the front desk upon arrival .... must be staying at least three nights according to our travel package. The 24 hour diner was also included on the buy one get one free coupon and the oriental salad was big and good along with the world famous bread pudding that Steve Wynn's mother recipe.... also free with coupon. The blackjack tables are tricky in that some pay the 6-5 odds on blackjack as oppossed to the standard 3-2 payoff. You have to ask for the 3-2 tables to ensure you are not getting ripped off or read the sign for the 6-5 warning. The tables were mostly $10 min. bets and shoe dealt were available along with single deck. The best blackjack tables I found were the Las Vegas Club and The Cortez which both had double deck, $5 min. bet dealt out of the shoe and open faced. You have a better advantage this way in tracking cards patterns. In my experience, The 4 Queens offers the best comps for your play as far as time played equates a free meal at their Magnolias Cafe. The best prime rib special was the the Main Street sports grill/ brewery for $7.95 with the best tender prime rib, vegtable, and potato. It was better than Magnolia's $7.95 prime rib. Overall we felt safe and well taken care of at our downtown stay at the Golden Nugget and will be back soon.

They are building a new tower behind the pool but the construction noise didn't bother us at all, the only thing we ever heard was the crane blow it's whistle when it was moving something. The room was big & the king size bed was so comfortable. Everything was clean & spotless, the maid service was great, everyday they had our room cleaned & new towels etc before noon.

The room was a nice size, but the bath was small - only one person at a time in there! There was a desk, internet accessability, etc - but one thing to note, no fridge/mini bar. They were also very accomodating in the buffet restautant. I wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go to the buffet - but asked my boyfriend if he could bring me back some toast and cottage cheese. They never allow you to take food from the buffet - but they were kind enough to transfer the buffet credit to the cafe where he was able to get me my requested lunch.

The room was awesome...a comfy bed with fresh linens and lots of pillows, a modern bathroom with a tv in the mirror, a corner seating area and a 42\" flat panel TV. The a/c worked perfectly and kept our room nice and cool. Also, our room was about 3 doors from the elevator so it was a very short walk. Ate at the breakfast buffet using a coupon from the booklet at check-in. Very good breakfast and $11 for two of us. I thought it was a great value. Also ate at the cafe for lunch.

The Nugget is trying to compete with the hotels on the strip and it's not working. They would be better off to just be the nicest hotel downtown..

We had been to Vegas before, but always on the Strip, never downtown. So we decided to stay downtown for the first four nights of our stay. After some research, I determined that the Golden Nugget was the only four star hotel downtown. Armed with that info, I was able to get a great price for a holiday weekend -- only $75 a night - on Priceline. We got a room in the (older) South Tower, and based on some other reviews I had read I wasn't sure what to expect, in terms of whether the rooms might be run down or noisy because of ongoing construction near the tower. The room, however, on the 6th floor, was very nice. It was quite large, with only minor wear, and very quiet (even on July 2, when there was construction going on). The pool was nice, but crowded. The breakfast buffet was fantastic -- for only $9.99 we had all sorts of great food, a waffle and omelet station, and unlimited coffee and juice, all in a brand new, renovated restaurant. The prime rib at Tony Roma's across the street from the Nugget was also a good deal. I am a card player. The Nugget poker room was very nice. For blackjack, however, I walked to the casinos at Four Queens and to Fitzgeralds, which were very close to the Nugget, to find the five dollar tables with more favorable rules (e.g., permitting surrender). The Nugget only had ten dollar blackjack tables. One night we went to \"Defending the Caveman,\" a one act play running at the Nugget. This play has been around for awhile, and both my wife and I had seen it before, but it is a fantastic play and very well done at the Nugget. You can get discount tickets to this show, and many others, as well as restaurant discounts, at a \"tix4tonight\" booth in the Four Queens Casino right next door to the Nugget. Check in and out at the Nugget were very easy, unlike our experience at the Luxor on the strip. But that is another review. Tip: Car rentals are CHEAP in Vegas, and I recommend that you consider that if you want to get around a bit. We got a full size car throught Hotwire for $17 a day. All the casinos have ample free parking (no surprise, eh?) so its easy to access them all by car travel.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwestern, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNicely surprised by the Golden Nugget\u201d", "Author": "stkn1", "ReviewID": "UR17790850", "Content": "I had read the reviews of the Golden Nugget only after I booked a room for my two almost-grown children and myself in the south tower.

The room was beautifully appointed and clean. The beds were so comfortable I couldn't believe it. I've never stayed in a hotel where the beds were so nice. The pillows can be exchanged for feather pillows at no additional charge, but we didn't feel the need to do that because they were comfortable, too. The bathroom was nice and the dressing table outside of the bathroom was a luxury since I had my teenage daughter with me. The pool is beautiful, but a little small. It also closes around 8pm nightly, which we thought was way too early. Customer service in the hotel is quite good. One word of caution: The food at the hotel buffet is not good, it tastes like you are eating a bad frozen dinner. However, there is a restaurant in the hotel, Carson Street Cafe, that I recommend. They are open 24 hours, serve breakfast around the clock, the food is delicious and the servings are huge. Oh, yeah, the prices are reasonable, too. The fitness room and spa areas are gorgeous, top-of-the-line facilities, but they charge you an extra $20 per day to use them. Bottom line: The Golden Nugget is great, but I didn't like the pool hours, the buffet food or the extra spa charges.

I think the very low ceilings has a lot to do with this. Comps are also nearly non-existent at the Golden Nugget, surprising for this type of an establishment. I guess the biggest difference is that people staying downtown seem to be much more hard-core drinkers and gamblers and the strip is more about having better food, nicer rooms, bigger pools, etc. I just found the downtown area to be a place that brought some of the bad things about Vegas more to light, things that the strip is better able to hide.

We had two upgraded rooms and one of the spa suites. It may seem like a lot to pay for a hotel room, but check out the deal you can get on these suites - I'm pretty sure they are half the price of the suites at the Venetian and other hotels on the Strip. And what a room it is! A duplex with a second floor that has a huge master bedroom and a \"bathroom\" that is larger than most NYC apartments. There are floor to second ceiling windows as the bedroom opens out onto the first floor where you'll find a full-size living room, dining room, and wet bar. We found it was a great place to have a few drinks (just hit a liquor store on your way in from the airport) and practice our poker game before hitting the tables. That is not to say the other rooms weren't also excellent - oversized and recently renovated - just a little dark. Obviously you'll spend most of your time gambling, but that is the great thing about downtown - get bored at the Nugget and you can stroll outside to hit Binions, the Four Queens, or some of the ahem, let's say less glamorous establishments without traveling 15 minutes between casinos like you do on the Strip. That's not to say you shouldn't venture out there are well, either for the spectacles or the food (can't say enough good things about Bouchon at the Venetian - checkout the raw bar or steak frites and revel in Mr. Keller's creations while you're friends sweat it out on the wait lists at Per Se and French Laundry). The buffet at the Nugget wasn't worth it, either for breakfast or dinner, but the coffee shop and noodle restaurant are always good bets. And of course there is the renovated pool complete with shark tank. It may be a little over the top, but it is sooooo much fun. We went down the slide which passes through the tank five times in a row, squealing with delight each time as the sharks and schools of fish passed overhead. Skip the bar drinks out there - way over-priced, unless you're playing at one of the three pool-side card tables. One more suggestion that has nothing to do with the Nugget: visit to the Neon Sign Museum or \"bone yard.\" Volunteers will take you on a one hour tour of the old neon signs of Las Vegas taken down to make room for the new, giving you a healthy dose of history along the way.

The ONLY reason I didn't mark excellent for our stay at this elegant hotel is because I wasn't very impressed with the beds. Rather lumpy and I swear even with my pillows I felt like my head was lower than the rest of my body. It's the first time I didn't sleep well my entire stay at a hotel and I've stayed in a lot!! However that negative aside, wow what a place; what a location!! The Tank or what some call the Shark Pool was awesome. The lounge chairs were the most comfortable I've ever sat in at any pool. I had heard some complain that you're \"sardined\" in at the pool side but I didn't think it was that bad at all. NOTE: If you want to stay out of the sun, I recommend the chairs closest to the hotel windows to the right of the entrance. The pool itself is salt water and quite refreshing in the hot summer sun. Deep enough to swim in which I like. The slide is fun if you want to climb the 3 stories to get to it. I did it once. The music ranges from mostly 80's to current. Great sound system. The drink service is pretty good or you can walk over to the Dive Bar and order. The bathroom at the pool and in the casino were very clean and impressive.The pool is right there next to everything too, so it was very easy to keep track of your party if some were gambling, or in their room or at the pool. Our meeting place became the Pool. Also, they were very strict about checking your room key so not anyone can go into the pool area during the day. Another plus about the pool, was the whole sitting area is open until 1a.m. so parts of our family would just hang out down there and visit in the warm summer breezes, have a few drinks and watch the sharks. Now for the hotel location: Having stayed several times on the Strip, we all are now sold on the downtown atmosphere. There's so much less walking involved going from casino to casino and to restaurants and little souvenir shops. The Goldent Nugget is literally in the middle of all the nightly action. The Fremont experience just rocks!! There's something for everyone, all ages! The service at the Golden Nugget was exceptional. The doormen were great; the gentleman at Check-In was friendly, as was the lady at Check-Out. Our housekeeper was a lot of fun. We visited with her every day and tipped her well. She did a nice job. Oddly enough, as much as I loved the Golden Nugget, I did very little gambling there; I thought the slots rather tight. I did like the fact that the BJ tables at the Pool were only $5. So that was fun, especially in the evening. We also didn't do much dining there. My mom and I ate breakfast once at The Carson Street Cafe. A little pricey for breakfast and not as good as the $4.95 breakfast next door at 4 Queens. My sister and brother and spouses ate at Lillie's Noodle House and were not impressed with the amount of food they got for their $$$. My sons, however, ate several times at the buffet at lunchtime and were quite satisfied with their meal. We stayed on the 21st floor and even with my 78 year old mother, the walk from our rooms, to the elevator, to the casino was not at all bad. I'm sure we walked at least that far when we on the Strip. Our view was the mountains facing west which was breathtaking. The rooms we all had and hallway were always very quiet.

They give you water one night and then the rest you have to fight with everyone else for bottled water that is left out by the elevators (which I don't understand because if someone new was checking in each day, paying our same rate, they would get a new big bottle of water)and food left out and the bowls are open so who knows what kind of germs are there. Housekeeping was so-so. The buffet is WAY overpriced (eat at Main Street for a great buffet or in the Fremont for better deals). What bothered us the most was the terrible service. Random waitresses with attitude (one woman had asked for a lime in her coke and the server walked by, dropped it off sans the lime and the server said \"yeah yeah, no lime I will catch it next time\" and walked off before the woman even had a chance to speak! Javier at the bar was the saving grace for this place. And the COMPS! Good golly they were terrible! We played less then $300 at Mandalay and walked out several hundred ahead (loved playing there and at the Luxor), we were treated like we really mattered and earned 2 free meals. We spent 3 times that at the Nugget, the Casino Host was rude and we didn't even earn enough points to START the comps!!!!!! Nothing was paying either, not even enough to pass the time. The pool is in the middle of the hotel and so it sucks the wind in. The chair situation is insane with no sort of rhyme or reason. The Spa was alright but showing signs of age and not clean enough for my taste with a rude staff. All in all we will only stay down on the Strip or if we are being budget friendly, we will stay at the Main Street Station on Fremont Street. The Golden Nugget is WAY to big for it's britches and just not even near what it should be.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cWas plenty fine\u201d", "Author": "MNJoy", "ReviewID": "UR17058046", "Content": "Just realized I didn't post a review for this last spring, so will just recount my couple of memories from looking at others' reviews.

The room was just fine and the walk to the south tower elevators was very short compared to any hotel on the strip. I've never been approached by a time share peddler at a hotel in Vegas (here's the tip if you like to be polite - make eye contact and smile while you're still too far away to be approached, then deliberately look away while you pass them). However, the part of our group which visits Vegas several times each year managed to get upgraded to the VIP rooms for a small charge. Their rooms/views/amenities were great, and there was certainly a difference in the way we were treated by staff for the rest of the stay. The cabana was worth the price to have dedicated space at the pool, along with some shade, a television, a fridge, and attentive servers.

The GN has The Tank, a pool that surrounds an aquarium filled with large fish and sharks. Only a thin, clear barrier sits between you in the water and the shark swimming at you. The Tank also includes a water slide of moderate length and only a couple of twists, but its highlight is a clear section that runs through the center of the shark aquarium. There are some decent waterfalls, and a section of the pool is permanently shaded by the second and third levels of the pool complex. We got a great price for our mid-week visit. The south tower room is a bit of a walk, but it was certainly no further away from the action than some of the strip megaresorts. The room was large enough and clean enough, except for a bit of mold in the shower. The TV showed only a dozen or so channels. Comparing the pool to the others in our tour, the drinks and amenities were nicely priced, and a slide of any kind is great for the kids. Going face-to-face with toothy sharks was a unique thrill. But after that's all said, the pool is a little small. My sunburned back was grateful for the shade, though. Valet parking is friendly and convenient for check-in, and self-parking puts you near the south tower elevators. The second-floor buffet had the best bread pudding we've eaten in a while (the bourbon sauce was what made it special), but the buffet seemed a bit pricy for the relatively ordinary selections at dinner. Of course, the best part of the GN is that it's downtown. In a short walk, you can pass competing (read: inexpensive) souvenir/sundry sellers, hop between casinos, and watch the Fremont Street Experience at night. We also went bowling at Jillians at Neonopolis. To sum it up, the GN showed us a good time at a reasonable price.

AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING - THERE ARE NO CONSTRUCTION LAWS IN VEGAS - THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BUILD 24 HOURS A DAY and sadly we were right next to the construction site. Drilling started at 5am and never stopped. There were nights were it was just impossible to get to sleep. So ask for a room near the top where apparently it's quieter as we were on a lower floor, or check to see if they've finished building next door.

Two things I didn't like about the room: No central air but a noisy air conditioner that ran 24/7 and bathtub design is a little difficult to get in and out of even for the most agile person. I feel sorry for the maids having to climb in and out of there to clean it. The maid service was excellent, but there were room service trays constantly in the hallway that seemed it took hours and hours to get picked up. We went to the gym daily but didn't go to the pool much. We found a great liittle Hawaiian style restaurant in the skywalk corridor between Main Street Station -- great architecutre and a must see that used to be a train station -- and the California. It's called Aloha Specialty Restaurant and it is cheap and good! If you like rice bowls and soups, then this is the place. I had kalua pig with cabbage, rice and macaroni salad for like eight bucks and it was delicious. We discovered it late but would have eaten there daily.

There is some construction that is going on around the hotel 24 hours a day, which caused a problem for my friends in other rooms, but my room was quiet.

We stayed for a week from April 10th to 17th and when we arrived at 2pm we were served straight away at the check-in desk, and were in our room within 5 minutes. Our room was on the 19th floor of the south tower and it was very nice and clean (see pics). We didn't hear any construction noise. The room had a big bed with plenty of blankets (not that you need them!), a colour TV with a few basic channels, Internet connection ($12.99 for 24 hours) and a very nice bathroom with shower, hairdryer and marble floors. There was also an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. In the hotel there are a couple of decent restaurants, The Grotto was our favourite with it's reasonably priced Italian food. There are also two Starbucks. The only problem we encountered was the Time Share People who linger outside the elevators just waiting to catch your eye and hound you. My advice is to either ignore them and walk as fast as you can, or pretend you don't speak English (I knew my GCSE German would come in handy one day!). My husband and I hired a car for the week so we were never too far from the fun and games on the strip. But even if you don't do that, Downtown Las Vegas is still a fab way to spend a few days in this fantastic city, and we will definitely stay here again!

The whole place was very clean. The service was excellent. The pool was very nice with the 'tank' and waterslide. The pool area is small with lots of shade but if you were only there a few hours each day it was not a problem. We stayed in a basic room in the south tower and it was more than adequate. Plenty of space with a nice bathroom. The south tower is farthest from the casino and main exit so anyone who has trouble getting around should request north tower. There were people selling timeshares next to the south tower elevators that were not as big a nuisance as others have made it out to be. The only restaurant we ate at was the breakfast buffet and it was pretty good. I normally don't like buffets so I would not be a very good critic. The Fremont street experience was a nice touch. The light show was fun and the entertainment was very good. We mostly gambled at night anyway so we caught most of it moving between casino's.

We did VIP check-in to the Gold Club rooms and there was no line. The VIP attendants were very nice. Elevators are 30 feet down the hallway from the lobby and only steps away from the casino \u2013 really a nice change from the huge strip properties. Gold Club Rooms are brand new and were $240/$220 per night on Sat/Sun. These rooms are beautiful and the hallway was quiet. Warning - my opinion of the room has a lot of \u201cbuts\u201d. We loved the look of the room \u2013 dark brown with a leather couch, chair and ottoman, mood lighting (kinda dark), nice bed with upgraded linens, Ipod docking station, plasma TV, DVD player, safe, etc. We thought the bed was really comfortable (on the firm side) but the five pillows were unbelievable soft and I had to use three just to get any neck support (they looked brand new but compressed flat with any pressure). There were lots of decorative pillows on the bed and one weird fake fur \u201croll\u201d. Ewww. That one was thrown onto the couch where it stayed the rest of the time. The AC in the room worked great but was loud (older beneath the window unit). The bathroom was gorgeous but was not planned well. I understand they only had so much space to work with since the hotel is old. The closet is behind the bathroom door and has two double doors, so the three doors competed for space \u2013 you had to choose which you wanted open since all three was not an option. The bathrobes were a nice touch and the in-mirror TV was great, although you really had to stand to see the screen due to the glare. The ceramic sinks sit on top of the marble vanity and have cool faucets. There are shelves underneath and towels were plentiful and somewhat plush. There is a lighted makeup mirror along with a chair and knee space. The toilet is not in a separate area and is less than eight inches from the bathtub \u2013 kinda awkward. The tub was a disappointment, although it looked really cool. It was an enclosed tub with a door that looks like it should slide open but doesn\u2019t \u2013 it swings open and gets in the way in the already narrow bathroom. You have to step into the deep tub and it is awkward and seems a little dangerous \u2013 plus you have to get into the tub to turn on the water unless you have very long arms.. The bottom of the tub was rough and not pleasant for a bath. The rainshower fixture was nice but you couldn\u2019t turn it on and get out of the way, so be prepared to get wet immediately. The toiletries were very nice G & S products. We didn\u2019t have enough time to take advantage of most of the room amenities (DVD player, spa access, etc) but the bottled water and morning coffee in the elevator lobby was nice. They also have snacks (M & Ms, nuts, raisinettes and fruit) but it was self serve and did not have any napkins or plates, so you know people were putting their hands into the bowls, so we passed on those. For some reason, the construction crew worked all night on Sunday night (and loudly, with even a concrete hammer) \u2013 very annoying but we thankfully had some earplugs in our bags. Surely they get lots of complaints about that but I\u2019m not sure what could be done, other than providing ear plugs, ambient noise machines or window seals. Some advance warning would have been nice since it caught us by surprise. We liked the vibe in the Nugget casino and they had $5 tables open during the day. We did 95% of our gambling there for the weekend. Some dealers were great and others didn\u2019t seem happy at all. That was the recurring theme here. You would see one in perhaps four employees that seemed happy, the rest were either blah or even kinda rude. Maybe they are experiencing cutbacks (we didn\u2019t ask) The pit CWs were great but the slots CWs were few and far between. We went for very casual food this time. Grotto was not packed at 8pm on a Saturday night yet the service wasn\u2019t good at all and everyone seemed in a bad mood. The food was extremely good, though \u2013 if the atmosphere would have been better, this would have been a great meal and decently priced ($70). The Carson Street Caf\u00e9 had good, dependable food (we had breakfast on Sunday and salads the next day). Prices are OK and they have an extensive selection but again, the wait staff just didn\u2019t seem to be into it. The view of the pool from one section was really nice and we never had a wait. Fremont Street wasn\u2019t crowded at all, even on Saturday night. We saw two light shows (the Queen tribute was great) and watched two bands and one saxophonist. Nice vibe early on, but drunks prevailed the later it got. The pool area at the Nugget was gorgeous. The new waterfall/slide/shark tank is brilliant. I wish it had more room since the place was packed both days. Maybe the new portion of the hotel will provide more sunbathing room \u2013 the chairs took up all the space and every one of them were full. There is a new portion of the casino in a hallway leading to where the new wing will be connected \u2013 and a sushi restaurant called Red is right in front of the doors. We played the Golden Monkey machines here both days (won the $25 progressive, but at $1.25 a pull, we put it all back in) but never saw the sushi place open. Checkout was at noon on Sunday and the VIP pointed us to the host\u2019s office before we settled up. They comped the Saturday night room and the Carson Street Caf\u00e9 ticket for us and offered a lunch comp, but we were already full from breakfast. It wasn't our most fun trip but we did enjoy ourselves. We wouldn't hesitate to return to the Nugget, but I'm not sure the Gold Club rooms are worth the extra $$ unless you can guarantee a comp.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cgreat time\u201d", "Author": "marie4899", "ReviewID": "UR15674233", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here last year.

With the cheaper food, gambling and entertainment downtown, we could afford to stay more nights there than on the strip. Our room troubles started with a clogged drain in the shower/tub. After one night in the south tower (farthest from the casino) we were transferred to the tower that faced west on the 14th floor. Not too close, but in sight of the hotel expansion. We forgot that everything in Vegas is 24/7, including construction. All night pile drivers and very heavy machinery kept us up. After complaining, were were moved us back to the south tower facing north and were comped the night. I talked with other guests that also couldn\u2019t believe the racket went on at all hours.

We were pleasantly surprised at how large this hotel is. It has 4-5 restaurants, and a Starbucks. At check in, you get a very valuable coupon book, for buy one get one free drinks, buffets, etc. This saved us a good bit of money. We first had a Deluxe Room in the South Tower, that was very beautifully decorated, although the view wasn't very good. We ended up hating Vegas (not the Golden Nugget) and decided to spend more time at the hotel, so we upgraded to a Gold Star room in the North Tower for $50 more per night. This gave us VIP passes at the buffet line, which can get pretty long, so that was great. It also gives you free access to the spa, which was INCREDIBLE. To get to your Gold Star room, in the elevator you have to put in your room key. So the people that are staying in those rooms are VIP and in the hallways there are fresh fruits, bottled water, coffee, nuts, candy, etc. That was really nice. The Gold Star hotel room was incredible! The decor was amazing, there was a leather sectional, and upgraded mattress and linens. There was a large plasma TV, but the hotel doesn't have them hooked up in HD, so the picture wasn't impressive. The bathroom was beautiful, tile and granite. There was a TV in the mirror, which was neat. Separate vanities, and upgraded lotions, shampoo, razors, etc. The pool area was really nice, lots of chairs, couches, and beds outside. The pool was too chilly for me, but my husband got in and really enjoyed the shark tank and waterfall. The jacuzzi is really big, and there are beds around it, too. That was my favorite part. We only ate at the buffet, as the other restaurants in the hotel are pricey. I liked it, and my husband absolutely LOVED the food. As far as the casino, it was nice as far as casinos go. They all seemed the same to me. The cocktail waitresses, though are pretty slow. We found ourselves out of drinks constantly. Not enough waitresses for how big the casino is. The Golden Nugget is in downtown Vegas, not on the strip. I like downtown, Fremont Experience, etc. The most economical way to get to the strip is to take the Deuce city bus. This was cheap, but took forever. And there are some pretty weird characters that ride that bus. I wouldn't take it at night. Overall, we hated Vegas.

It was my husbands 30th Birthday present so I sprung and booked a Gold Club room, I have stayed at the Nugget many times in the past with my family so I was excited to be staying there for the first time after renovations. **Warning this could get lengthy but I wanted to give a detailed review of the Gold Club room. VIP Check In: We arrived at 4:15 ( more than an hour after check in) we were matter of factly told our room wasn't ready and were told to check our bags at the bell desk and come back in an hour. The girl said this like it was routine and going to be no big deal for us, she didn't even offer for us to stay in the VIP lounge and enjoy the free appetizers and the drinks (I didn't see them or I would have had some) Basically VIP check in was a joke, the regular check in line had 4 people standing in it and I am sure they were all in their room way before me and my husband were. We walked around for an hour, came back and were given our keys, I asked for a coupon book , after all I paid upwards of $600 for the room I thought I would get one but she told me the coupon book didn't come with that room (I could have booked a North tower room for half of what I paid and recieved a coupon book). Gold Club Room: The room is very nice, it is dark but there is a electric shade for the window to let in plenty of light, the room does look exactly like the pictures online. However there are many things that bothered us about the room. Bathroom: shower is a deep tub with a rain shower head, the entire shower is enclosed , while taking a shower there is no ventilation and your shower quickly turns into a sauna, fixture is difficult to turn off without shower dripping all day. With the shower being enclosed you cannot sit and have a nice bath and watch the tv in the mirror. The closet is behind the bathroom door and is VERY inconvienient, there are 2 doors that are pretty heavy and they do not stay open, to get your luggage into the bathroom and into the closet is a real trick. Robes are nice idea but not soft at all and the slippers are cheap disposable ones, never used them but did see some women with their robes at the pool. Room and amenities: Beds are very nice, pillow top with 4 down pillows and 4 down comforters. Clock radio in room with IPOD docking station was nice, TV is huge but it is high def and the hotel only has cable, makes for a huge tv with a fuzzy picture. There is a DVD player in the room and I believe there was supposed to be some DVD's however there were only a few Sinatra CD's. Complementary Fiji water was nice however it was never replenished. There is NO turn down service what so ever, never saw any maids at night going into the rooms. There really should be a refrigerator in a renovated room like this,my husband used the 2nd sink in the bathroom as a cooler by running back and forth to the ice machine , I wish they would have done away with the recliner and added a wet bar with microwave and fridge. Our room was not made up on our 3rd day, we left the room at 10am and saw that the maid was next door to our room, we came back at 2pm and our room was how we left it, we saw a maid on the floor and asked her about it,she said to call housekeeping because she was working on the rooms for new guests. We called housekeeping a few times before getting an answer, we were told they would be there within 15 minutes, instead of showering and getting ready for our last night like we had planned we went downstairs and came back 2 hours later and our room was still not made up, I then made the bed myself. Coffee, newspapers, water and snacks (M&M, raisinettes, trail mix, nuts) by the elevator were the best amenity that came with the room. Pool: Very nice, we layed out 1 afternoon. Water was too cold for me but many others were in, my husband enjoyed the waterslide but you go too fast to see any sharks while on the slide. Lots of cocktail waitresses walking around, strawberry daquiri was very good with fresh berries but hardly had any alcohol. The only other problem I saw was the sun only shines on half of the chairs at a time, we got there at 10:30 and by 1 the sun was going behind the south tower and people were trying to find new seats in the sun. Other VIP amenities: Buffet Line pass, we went to the breakfast buffet Friday morning, there was no line so we didn't get to use our line pass, when we came out after eating the VIP line was actually longer than the regular line. Never used any other passes. Dining: Only ate at the buffet for breakfast which was pretty good . Other than that I must say that the Grotto has some highly suggestive artwork on their walls, I am not a prude but I find it tacky to have artwork like that at a restaurant where kids may be at. I am talking melons and martini's with olives placed in particular places, interesting to say the least. We did visit Gold Diggers while waiting for our room it was not busy at all in early afternoon, it was nice to go up there to sit and people watch over Freemont Street. I do highly suggest going to Main Street Station (walk down to the Plaza turn right, if you don't like the area ,walk through the Las Vegas and California Club and walk across their bridge) I have always loved their buffet and we just discovered their 777 Brewery $5 for their award winning beer sampler (5 different beers) and the pizza and garlic fries were very good. Deuce Bus: walked to the main station (walk down the street between Freemont and Horseshoe) The main station was very \"sketchy\" but once we found the double decker Deuce at the far end of the station we got on right away with no wait, fare is $5 for 24 hour pass or $2 for one way(beats a $20 taxi ride!). It did take 1 1/2 hours to get to New York New York but we wanted to be able to drink and it was a good way to not deal with the traffic and see all of the strip. The passengers on the bus were mostly tourists, a lot better crowd than the city bus, and you can get to the airport and outlet centers also. Other tips: Check out Changs Hong Kong Cuisine for excellent Dim Sum (on Decatur off the strip) I already want to go back! Go to Hooters Hotel (across from MGM) for a Nipper Juice at their poolside bar, this is a rum drink with tropical juices, very strong, you only need one and it puts you out of commission for awhile! To sum it up we did enjoy ourselves very much, but the price we paid did not coincide with the service we got. Although the room is beautiful I would have had just as much fun if I was in one of their regular rooms. Out of the amenities they list for the Gold Club we only really enjoyed the snacks the others were deemed useless for us especially the not so VIP check in.

We stayed three nights and on yet another day, no housekeeping services were provided. I was only able to get clean towels by taking them off a cart in the hallway.

When the Golden Nugget was owned by Steve Wynn, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. We loved the downtown atmosphere and we loved staying at what felt like a 5 diamond hotel. We have been going there for years at least twice a year. It was a tradition my parents had started and when I got married my husband loved the Golden Nugget and Las Vegas as much as I did so we contintued to stay there. When MGM bought Mirage hotels we went back and found that not much had changed. The customer service was still the best downtown, the building was still beautiful and we were happy to see the same employees each time we went. Then when the two young guys Tim and Tom bought the Golden Nugget we still went back. Things changed a little, they wanted to bring back old vegas but at the same tried to cater to young people. We loved watching what they were trying to do and loved knowing the employees were still there and the service was still great. Even though we could get good or sometimes better room rates on the strip we liked the Golden Nugget atmosphere and employees. We even loved the food. Carson Street Cafe had menu items we craved when we weren't there. Some employees we had grown to know over the years. We didn't sign up for the marketing campaigns but still got great deals and we didn't even mind spending more at the Golden Nugget than we would have spent other places. Since Landry's has bought the Golden Nugget it has only gone down hill. Yes they have done some remodeling and it looks nicer. But looks are not everything. The employees don't care anymore. There are very few employees left. You don't see employees cleaning everything little corner and door anymore and you wait forever, for slot and cocktail service. We don't even bother with the restaurants anymore. The Carson Street menu no longer has the items we loved. The Buffet is okay but not worth the price, Grotto and Vic & Anthony's are the kind of places we eat at when we are home, not what we want on vacation. But we do love some of the restaurants at the other downtown hotels. The morale of the employees has gone down due to what the employees call masssive layoffs. Now you can see that there are not many employees left who care. The service is mediocre. Landry's is a restaurant company but they have the type of restaurants that are mediocre food for high prices. We eat at Landry's restaurants in our home town, they are not that great but they are okay. In Las Vegas we like to have great food at low prices. We stayed there last week 3/26 to 3/30, morale was even lower than before. We heard employees talking about more lay offs. They talked about a lady who had worked there for 23 years and was laid off, then they said there were more who had worked there just as long and were laid off. It sounds like Landry's doesn't want experienced Hotel and Casino employees. They must want part time college kids like the ones who work in the their restaurants every where else. It was sad to hear them talk about people we had been counting on serving us that past 15 years we had gone to the Golden Nugget. I am writing this from the Airport. It is my fairwell to the Golden Nugget. I miss the old days of great service, great food and wonderful happy employees. We will go to the strip next time.

At first we thought we would be disappointed that we were not on the strip, but overall we weren't all that disappointed. It is certainly the most up to date hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Here are a few of my observations from staying there. Rooms- The North Tower is the rennovated tower. Book a room in this tower, the bed was comfortable and the sheets were fresh daily. The 42\" Plasma was nice. The bathroom was a bit small. The carpets were very dirty and to be sure we sprayed lysol on everything we could. The A/C was noisy and seemed a bit old. The rooms in the south tower might have a view, but they are old and in desperate need of rennovations. Food- The Cafe was nice, service was fast during non-rush times, however they get bogged down during the meal-time rush. The steakhouse was spectacular, we sat with a large group and the staff seemed coordinated and took care of everyone seemlessly. The Grotto was the same thing...great food, decent prices, and the staff worked hard to take care of everyone which they did. We ordered room service quite a few times as well and it got to our room fast and fresh. The only complaint would be that they have two set times a day that they pick up the carts from your hallway and it might jam up with carts. The buffet was not worth the money. I left there disappointed as did others from the conversations I had. Bars were nice, drinks were stiff and the staff was friendly. Gambling- Didn't do much of it there, however compared to a few of the older casinos on the strip, the nugget topped them all by keeping the areas clean and things smelled clean as well. Freemont St- The overhead show seems out of date but drew a crowd regardless. The problem with Freemont is the moment you wander off the street you get the uneasy feeling as if you might get mugged at any time. It's old Vegas. Pool- The pool was packed every day and was kept in great shape all time time. The shark tank is small but worth a look! Overall- The Nugget was better than expected, the staff did their best to take care everything and they delivered where-ever possible. The timeshare people were not aggressive like those on the strip and were kind enough to give directions without a salespitch. The Nugget definately brings a breath of fresh air to an old downtown, hopefully the other hotel's there will take a que from the nugget.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MikecDallas", "ReviewID": "UR14415248", "Content": "Stayed here for a business meeting.

I ordered two rolls of sushi and the bill was $20. In addition, we visited one of the bars got 2 glasses of wine for $20. The service and food was very good.

We booked a Gold Club Room directly through the hotel website about two months prior. In early January, I checked the website and the rates had gone down. We called the hotel and they gave us the lower rate with no hassle. We arrived at the hotel around 9AM and went to the VIP lounge to check in. They advised a room would not be ready until later. We left our luggage with the bell desk and went to play slots for a while. Around noon, we went back to the VIP lounge and asked if a room was available yet. The clerk said the one we had reserved was not clean yet, but there was another GC room that was ready and she would put us in that one. We were assigned room 1619. As previous reviews have stated, the rooms seem very dark. However, after I turned on all the lights, it was fine. The room was nicely decorated with a large 42\" plasma tv mounted on the wall, a couch, a reclining chair and a large dresser/vanity/entertainment center. All of this is pictured on the GN website. The bathroom has two sinks, a vanity area with chair, and a rainshower showerhead/tub combo. The shower/tub is standard-sized and not a jacuzzi bath. There is also a closet located not-so-conveniently behind the bathroom door. There are bathrobes, slippers, extra pillows, iron, ironing board, and blow dryer in the large closet. There is also a TV in the bathroom mirror. Our room overlooked the pool area and the side of the Plaza. We could also see the mountains in the background. There was not any hallway noise and only occasional noise from the pool area during the day. There are several other little \"perks\" to the room which may or may not be important to you: - IPOD alarm clock - pay per view movies - video checkout - dvd/cd player - a few cds and magazines in room - large safe - lots of toiletries in the bathroom - internet available on the TV for a fee - free internet access for your laptop - free bottled water in room - free bottled water/coffee/snacks by elevators - turn down service w/mints on pillow Also with the GC rooms, you get a VIP pass which allows you free access to the spa and a line pass for the buffet and cafe. If I had to find something wrong, it would just be little things. One is that the window shade does not completely darken the room. In fact, it lets quite a bit of light through. Another would be the TV reception. For a plasma TV, it was very fuzzy, like something was interfering with the signal. However, these were very minor issues for us, so overall we were very happy with this room. One thing I would caution people on the GC rooms: they are regular-sized rooms, not suites. It is simply a regular hotel room that has upgraded amenities. We also ate at the Grotto, Vic & Anthony's, Carson Street Cafe, the buffet and the grille. All were good. We gambled quite a bit and found the dealers to be friendly and a good variety of slots. I also had some treatments at the spa.

While the hotel is still very nice in the public areas and very clean, it is lacking the \"friendly customer feeling\" it once had. We checked in and the receptionist at the desk was very nice but would only upgrade our room if we paid $100 extra a night. So we decided to just stay in the North Tower. The girl told us to come back in about 1/2 hour for the keys as she called housekeeping and asked them to clean our room. We went back in a little over an hour and got a different girl who checked and said the room wouldn't be ready for another 1 1/2 hours. Plus she must have been having a bad day because she never looked even looked at us! Even when addressing us. She looked down .The rooms are getting worn. The rug in the hallway is worn. Our room was very dimly lit. Even with every light on in the room it was still dark. The maid did an excellent job in providing us with what we needed and doing the basic cleaning. However, when I pulled out the books from under the nightstand, the dust was so thick, I started coughing. The TV area was not ever dusted either. AC was very loud. The pool area is beautiful but they took away so much room with the addition that the lounge chairs are right on top of each other. And the sun hardly hits the area. Hope they plan on expanding this area. One last note...we didn't see a one person hit anything big on the slots. It really drained your money. I think the casino should at least give you a few winners. Must have used all the money on remodeling. We decided we wouldn't stay at the Nugget again until they change it somewhat. We'll pay the extra and stay on a nice place on the strip. A tip to everyone: If you book your room online or call them directly, keep cheking back on their website because as the time gets closer, and they don't fill the rooms up , they drop their rates.

We expected it to be packed, and it was, just like the rest of the city. Positives: The property itself is great and the upgrades they've done are all nice. We had a North Tower room (the Gold Club rooms were all reserved) and it was nice--no complaints. The decor looked a bit like my grandma would have liked (very floral and lots of gold), but it was in no way old looking or shabby. Another couple in our party said their bed was awful, so maybe they have not finished replacing all of the mattresses. Apparently, some rooms are better than others. The casino was great, pool and shark tank was fabulous although it was a bit too cold to enjoy. The restaurants were all good--we especially liked the new sushi bar, which was very fresh and just as good if not better than much pricier places in town. The spa and the boutique are also first class. The Negatives: The staff, although we did not encounter anyone that was outright rude, was extremely overwhelmed, misinformed, and generally not very much help. New Year's Eve in Vegas is busy every year, so it's not like they didn't know it was coming. We arrived early so we weren't surprised or upset when our room wasn't ready, but what was upsetting was all the misinformation and wasting of our time. The first desk clerk told us she would put a rush on our room and it would be ready in 30 minutes and to go to another window (which did not exist). The second clerk told us it would be another hour. After that hour plus some had passed, the third clerk told us that it still wasn't ready and that housekeeping was behind, but that she would put a rush on it because there wasn't a rush noted previously--apparently a lie by the first two clerks. After that and a couple more hours, we called the front desk from one of the house phones in the casino. The clerk on the phone literally told me to hold while he checked (he took my name) and then never got back on the line! I called again (this is the fifth clerk mind you) and they said our room was finally ready. We got no compensation or upgrades for this inconvenience as all the better rooms were booked. That's to be expected I suppose, I just wish they would have told us we had to wait four hours so that we could have gone to do something else rather than waiting around for our room. After this major frustration was over, however, our trip got much better. Also, I agree with other reviewers that, although the property is nice, it's more fun and a younger crowd on the strip.

We were very impressed by the greetings we received coming into the hotel by many employees. We went to ask to see if we could check in...No Problems they said. Very nice since we had had a long morning flying from a eastern time zone. We were able to freshen up and relax before going down to the casino. The room was very lovely we had a King room with updated furniture. It was very clean and we had a view facing east torwards downtown and the mountains. We were on the 11th floor of the South Tower. Very quiet side of the building not facing the Fremont Street Experience. The hallways were very clean and very modern. As some reviewers have said the timeshare people can be a pain at the entrance to the elevator area of the south tower. But I found a nice way to avoid them. Every time I went past the desk area I pretended to be on the cell phone...It worked great. Although most of the time they were not really pushy with us. Awesome Pool area and Shark tank is really cool. It was cooler outside, so we could not use the pool. I was impressed with the set up of the casino. It is the nicest Casino in the downtown area hands down...I was not impressed with some of the rules of their blackjack. You cannot double down after splits and you can only split Aces once. Kind of takes away some player advantage from you. I did not do very well on any gaming action at GN but sometimes the gambling gods are not with you no matter what. One tip for visitors. A great place to go eat is the Golden Gate Hotel just up the street. Inside is Bay City Diner, they had great meals and lots of food for inexpensive prices. They are world famous for the 99 cent shrimp cocktail and it was great. Also they have a Prime Rib special for 6.99 and it was pretty good.

We were a bit skeptical at first due to some of the reviews and a few of the photos. We decided to go ahead and take a chance on the room when we got a $69/nt rate and the 3rd night free. The hotel does not provide a free shuttle from the airport, but you can reserve a ride through several shuttle services for about $14 each passenger one-way. We got a great weekend rate on a rental car, so we did not have to take a shuttle. We expected to get the worse room available due to arriving at the hotel just after midnight; but to our surprise, our king non-smoking South Tower deluxe room was clean, roomy, and rather modern. The bath was marble and very clean. While the rooms have been recently renovated, the tv sets were not updated. No plasmas here----and very few viewing channels. Nobody goes to Vegas to watch tv, but it would have been nice to have more than 10 channels (4 of which were hotel only channels) to choose from when having a little down time in the room. Another downside to the Golden Nugget is the towels. They are a dark beige color, which cause them to appear dingy/dirty. The hotel has excellent water pressure and very hot water. So be careful when you flush and when you shower. We enjoyed the shark tank and the on-site Starbuck's. We did not eat at any of the restaurants, so I cannot comment on those. The gaming was okay. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful---I used the business center to fax & the employee was very courteous. Avoid those pesky time-share people in the lobby of the South Tower near Starbuck's----you'll waste a lot of your vacation if you get sucked into listening to their script. Parking is free---parking deck across the street from the hotel---show room key for easy in/out access. Steps away from the Freemont Experience. Check out was quick---South Tower has it's own front desk, but it closes around 5 pm. Overall, a very good stay.

There are cabanas on the second and third floor in the pool area to rent and also a topless sun bathing area that is private. The water slide is very neat and something you must do. It goes right through the shark tank and is super fast. The kids will enjoy it as well as any adults. We didnt swim too much while there because it was cool outside but we did sit out by the pool and enjoyed watching the sharks swim and drinking some cocktails. EXCELLENT way to relax! The best food inside the Golden Nugget is at Vic and Anthony's steak house. It is pricey but oh so good. You have to treat yourself there atleast once. Everyone talks about the long walk from the South Tower, it really isnt that bad. In Vegas you are going to do alot of walking anyways. Now, to gamble...we did not have any luck downtown at all.

We were checked in in minutes, they advised us they didnt have any non smoking kings so would it be ok for us to have a double for the first night and then swap the next day, this was no problem for us. The next day they phoned our room to advise us that the king room was now available, so we went to the front desk and swapped rooms, while at the front desk I asked the helpful lady were the nearest duece stops were, she advised me to get on at the terminal but it was probably not best to stay on to the terminal at night as it was a little quiet down there after dark so she advised us to get off at the bottom of fremont. we sometimes got the duece back from the strip on a night and it was all quite safe to ride it to fremont street.

Although the nugget is located downtown, we were still visiting the strip everyday, it very easy to jump on the duece at the terminal (to get there take a left out of the lobby and its 2 blocks down) there is always a deuce in bays on the far side, getting on at the terminal is better than getting on at the bottom of freemont as normally there is a line of people getting on there, if you get on at terminal you can just jump straight on a duece. It will take around 40 mins to get the to the top of the strip, but its quite enjoyable and there are a few characters who ride the duece. Our first ever duece ride was hilariuos, the driver was singing down the mic and cracking jokes all the way to the top of the strip!, something you dont get on public transport in the UK!!! and for $5 24 hr pass its well worth the ride.

I read in TA a few times where folks were looking for a review of this newly introduced room. VIP check-in does come with this room. Bypass the standard check in lines and go into the VIP room for a speedy check in. The Gold Club rooms are located in the North Tower so from the VIP room, head left towards the elevators. The Gold Club rooms are on floors 16 & 17. The top floor 18 is for the apartments (2000 sq feet) and the executive suites. Our room was 1616. View / Noise level The room view was okay. You could see the beginning of the Fremont Street Experience and the tops of some parking garages. Nothing special. The noise level at night was fairly loud for being that high up. I was a bit surprised. Bring earplugs \u2013 that solved the problem for us. You could hear the Fremont Experience (light show), the bands playing on Fremont Street, the cars/fire trucks/ambulances from the street below and could always hears lots of folks yelling. What you could not hear, was any \u2018inside\u2019 noises (meaning folks in neighboring rooms). Bathroom Excellent \u2013 Top Notch. Tile, clean new fixtures, very modern. Robes and slippers provided. Iron and board provided. Bathtub was very nice but I had expected it to be bigger (wider) and to be jetted. It was a deep soaking bathtub. Very nice, just not what I had in mine for such a nice room. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bath sponge, lotion and bar soap all provided. Room itself Magnificent !! King bed with clean, white, crisp bedding and down comforter. High end. Lots of pillows. Large sectional sofa in the corner, plus an extra chair. LCD flat screen TV and combo DVD/CD player. Plenty of lighting. One thing I don\u2019t think they advertised well was that you have FREE internet access in these rooms. We had wanted to do our airline check in early that afternoon but they were charging $10 pp downstairs at the machines so we decided later to use the internet through our room and picked the rate of $5.99 for two hours. When we checked out, we found out it was free internet (when we asked why the charge wasn\u2019t on our bill). Had we known this we would have checked in hours before and gotten better seats. Nightly bed turn down service was provided. Hall way Take advantage of the free coffee and bottled water by the elevators. The water bottles in your room at $4 each, but the ones in the hallway are free. Just get them early because by mid-afternoon they are all gone. General Didn\u2019t check out the spa at all. Used the VIP line pass at the buffet and Carson Caf\u00e9 several times. This saved us tons of time waiting in line as we were eating at the same time as everyone else on a busy weekend. All in all, the room and service we received exceeded our expectations. The \u2018virtual tour\u2019 pictures on the hotels web site were 100% accurate as to how the room looked.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cMixed service experience\u201d", "Author": "michal_chour", "ReviewID": "UR11299223", "Content": "Rooms are large and clean.

This is the second time in all those years that they couldn't put us in the north tower. While the south tower is nice it is true the walk is far from the casino.

We opted for the VIP check-in. When we arrived, there was one desk clerk and one customer. We sat down to the cheese cubes and bottled water. Within 5 minutes, the desk clerk was ready to assist the next client (me). A couple had walked in and were standing at the counter but deferred to me by moving (slightly) out of my way so I could check in (I think the man was mad that I had \"cut\" in line - he didn't seem to understand that VIP means not having to stand in line). After our very quick check-in, we left and there were 5 people waiting to check in. The clerk was unsure who was next. They should have a sign-in book at the entrance so everyone can sign in then relax. The Tank - The pool area is gorgeous and we spent much more time than expected just watching the tank sharks. The chairs are very close together (similar to a cruise ship) but were never crowded. I was surprised that the area is open to everyone - not limited to resort guests. The water is heated but the water was quite cold in the late afternoon. I did get into the hot tub for short while but with so much foam (foam=chemicals trying to kill body oils), I stayed only a short while. Except in the morning, the music level is so loud, you have to shout to hold a conversation. Grab a towel when entering. The chairs/couches are comfortable but you'll want to put a layer of protection between you and some of the stains. Room - The rooms were nice and spacious, no complaints there. Staff - Except for one slightly snippy bartender at Rush Lounge, all the staff we came into contact with were very nice and helpful. I even approached a craps table and was made to feel welcome though I am clearly a rookie. Slots-I enjoyed my corner where there are four Star Wars slot machines complete with sound effects. It paid enough so I could continue playing for a long time. Smoke - You can't escape the cigarette smoke in Las Vegas unless you're in your car. It is everywhere!

So instead of checking in around 2pm on Sunday, we checked in at 2 am on Monday. Being that it was 2 am we were expecting a short wait to check in once we got to the Nugget. Sadly, we waited nearly 45 minutes in a rather short line only to find out that the only room they had available was a smoking room. We are not smokers, and the thought of getting our much needed rest in a smoke filled room nauseated us a bit. I had recently been to the Nugget's website and noted that there were newly remodelled Gold Club rooms that they offered and asked if there was a possibility of being upgraded to one of these rooms, just for the night, and then we could relocate later in the day to the standard room we had booked. The staff agreed to this upgrade and we were informed that we could switch rooms after we have slept, etc. The Gold Club room exceeded our expectations. It was spacious, with a living room, bar area, two bathrooms and a sitting area in the bedroom as well. Plasma TV's everywhere and modern furnishings made us feel immediately better after such a long, drawn out day. The bed was so comfortable and we slept very well. Upon waking, we decided that we would rather stay in the Gold Club room for the remainder of our stay and inquired to the front desk on what the additional charge would be to stay in our current room. We were informed that it would be about $100 extra per night, an amount that we could live with and gladly agreed to charge it to our room. We ordered some room service breakfast and settled down to chill for the next few hours. Right as we finished eating, the front desk called saying that we would need to leave our room due to \"unforseen mechanical issues\" with our room and that the Nugget would gladly buy us lunch while we waited for a new room to come available. We had not even showered yet after our dreadful first day and were not in any condition to leave our room. I told the front desk this and asked what they could do for us instead. We were told that they could upgrade us again to a Spa Suite at the current price that we were paying for a Gold Club room. I had seen these rooms on their website as well and was satisfied with that solution. A bellman was to our door in 30 minutes, ready to move us to our new suite. I looked online and the Spa Suites go for about $400 a night and at the rate of $150 that we were paying... I felt this was a pretty good deal. The Spa Suite was a bit dated but very spacious. The floor to ceiling windows were great! The ceiling height made the suite feel huge! Almost too much for only 2 people! The bedroom suite part had a great 2 person steam shower, vanity, seperate toilet area and a jacuzzi tub. The lower level had a bar area, dining area, living room section with tv and stereo setup and another bathroom. Our view was pretty nice, over looking the pool. The jacuzzi tub over looking the city at night was very relaxing. The bed was also very comfortable. All in all, the Golden Nugget took care of us after an initially rough start. I don't know if I would pay to stay in a Spa Suite again, although I will most definitely stay in the Gold Club rooms next time we choose to stay on the old Strip.

One thing spoiled our stay and that was upon check in (at this time of day there where no queues) we arrived at about 9.00 PM on a Monday evening and they only had smoking rooms left. Even though you have paid for a room it is take it or leave it. They offered to deodorise the room but it does not mask the smell of smoke and it smelt like an ashtray. It must say something to hotels if the only rooms they have left are smoking rooms that is nobody wants to sleep in a rotten smoke stained ashtray of a room if I smoked I would not want to sleep in it so it is no wonder it is all that is left. They compounded this by not offer any refund or compensation it was a case of we are sorry but that is all we have until the next day. The next day we changed to a different room in the South Tower. This was on a non smoking floor and was a lot quieter and much better than the noisy North Tower. Most hotels let you reserve non smoking rooms why can the GN not do this? In my view save your self some money as there is no difference between the 2 towers apart from a 40 Meter walk to the lobby and where I come from that is not \u201ca long hike\". The rooms were nearly identical in size and fittings the levels of cleanness was OK but could have been better there was dust under the beds in both rooms. Apart from this complaint the GN is the best hotel located Down Town. I have stayed on the strip and I like both locations for different reasons it has improved it does offer good value for money but it is lacking in levels of service and could still do better.

Being Vegas, I took the gamble and it really paid off. We arrived around 4:00 on a Wednesday and there was absolutely no wait at the regular check-in counter where we were processed in about 2 minutes. Our double room on the 4th floor of the south tower was enormous, with a sparkling clean bathroom and firm but comfortable beds. We didn't have much of a view but probably could have asked for a higher floor. Being on the lower floor, though, we never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. Not bad for $69 a night. If you really want a view of the surroundings, you'll need to get a room on at least the 10th floor. The hotel is quite large, thus I would suggest that those who will be gambling a lot pay the extra money and get a room in the north tower which is much closer to the hotel casino and other venues on Freemont St. Those, however, who prefer access to the self-service garage, shark-infested pool, and a slightly more isolated experience can do better in the less expensive south tower. The pool was kind of neat but the water just a bit too cold for swimming or taking a slide through the fish tank. Towels are available poolside. We had a good dining experience in the Asian restaurant in the south tower lobby area. For breakfast, save a couple of bucks and try the Freemont Casino Paradise Buffet across the street. All in all, an excellent experience, and the only good gamble I made in Las Vegas.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cGreat!!!\u201d", "Author": "tryanythingonce", "ReviewID": "UR10483024", "Content": "Stayed in a Spa Suite for just one night in transit thru Vegas to Denver and was so glad we did.

We had a steam room in the bathroom and a two person hot tub - after a 10 hour flight from London, this was SO welcome! The sitting area was beautiful - great wet bar area, lovely comfy sofas, downstairs guest toilet and the best bathrobes. Upstairs the bedroom area was lovely with a very very good bed (better than at the Bellagio!!) and Bose wave hi-fi. We ate in the Asian restaurant, which was really excellent. The pool area is just great - the slide goes straight through the shark pool, and the staff were so accommodating. Freemont Street is a must see - at night. In the day, it is a bit tacky and a long way from the strip, but I would be very happy spending a few days at the Golden Nugget without leaving the hotel except to view the Freemont Street show.

The old coffee shop is still there and still has good food, but service is extremely slow so bring a newspaper or book to read.

All this and the fabulous atmosphere and choice that Fremont Street has to offer right on your doorstep. My top tip is to walk down block or so to catch the Deuce which is the strip bus.

One of this things that has changed about Vegas in the ways to get around as there are now several monorail systems and above ground walkways - very impressive.

The lobby is too small, so it makes the line seem even worse, but pay the extra for VIP check in - I'm glad I did. We stuck with the standard south tower, and it was fine. Yes, it was a walk, but not the end of the world. The room was in generally good shape, but older. Some renovations had been made, some could still stand to be done.

Apparently $70 million of the $100 million that Landry's has spent was on the pool. I have never seen so many chaise lounges squeezed into such a tight space, though.

The Grotto was as good as the original in Houston, and Vic and Anthony's might have been better. The only problem there was that they let people into the restaurant in shorts - they need to enforce a dress code. The casino turned out to be one of my favorites. Reasonably priced tables for a hotel casino ($5 BJ) and the best music of any casino I've been in - a lot of classic rock from 70s and early 80s. Only drawbacks are sparse waitresses and only one restroom location in the middle. Downtown is not the strip, and it's not quite the same experience.

A door to the left was the master bedroom, the door in the middle was the living area, and the door to the right was the second bedroom. Each bedroom had a full bathroom, and there was another in the living area, which made three full bathrooms. It was beautiful. The beds were the most comfortable I have EVER slept on. The living area was quite large. It had a full size couch & table, dining area, wet bar, and of course at television. See the photos! Bell desk had our luggage up within minutes of calling! We dined mostly at the Carson Street Cafe. Food was good there and had quite a selection. From breakfast, to sandwiches, to steak dinners, there was ample to choose from. We did have the breakfast buffet one morning, which was pretty darn good for buffet food. I don't like to eat at buffets all that much, but everything seems quite fresh and hot! Breakfast was $10 - great deal! The Grotto was our favorite stop for food. They had the best thin crust pizzas there! Drinks were a strong there, much stronger than the freebies on the floor. And not to ridiculously priced - $15.00 + tip for a Captain & Diet and a Pina Colada. Room service we used only for coffee in the morning - $15.00 for the pot plus tip. I'm glad only three of us drank coffee!!! The pool is amazing! It has the \"shark tank\" in the middle, and the pool goes around it. There are also other fish in the tank, maybe food for the sharks??? They have a slide that goes right through the shark tank - and it's clear so people can watch you and you can see the sharks as you fly by. There was seven cabanas on the upper level that you could reserve. I think the price was $150 for the day, and you had to be out by 9:00 pm. They had a fridge, television, safe and comfy couches! We got cabana #4, which was right next to the \"adult sunbathing section\". Hot tubs stayed open til 2:00 am too! The casino was plenty big with lots of tables to play cards. Not alot of waitresses going around offering drinks, but when you found one and treated her well, she would remember you! Slots were pretty tight, but we all had fun gambling here! Valet guys were awesome! Quick and efficient. The day we we're leaving our guy actually took the time to write down the directions to the car rental place for us so we wouldn't get lost!

The towels were fluffy and they even supplied robes. These are items I'd expect in a much more expensive hotel. Everyone we met except our waiter the final morning was extremely nice and helpful. Didn't use the pool but it is great. Loved watching the fish. Ate at The Grotto one night and the food was wonderful. It's entirely open so it's noisy or it would have been more enjoyable.

Beautiful chandlers. Kinda reminded us of a cruise ship. The pool is one of a kind. The pool is not large in size, it circles the tank. The tank is awesome! Beautiful at night. There pool is open til 9PM. Two waterfalls for a nice head massage. The lounge chair area is not large but there is a lot of movement so you may have to wait it out for a lounge chair. Way too many towels to make it look like it is occupied, a lot of guest just get up and leave the towels. They should be more strick on the distribution of the towels and this would not happen. But what a cool pool, you will never get this close to a shark, when they swim by the glass you can see all their teeth. The water slide is two flights of stairs up, but what a blast. You must do this at least once while you are there. We had breakfast every morning in Carson Street Cafe in the hotel; they are open 24 hours a day. Food was good, breakfast special starts out at $7.95. Pot of coffee $2.50 with a cafe left on the table. We also had dinner at their buffet upstairs. We do not usually do buffets, but theirs was awesome. They had Food stations labled with different foods. Salad, soup, Seafood (peel and eat shrimp deveined), sushi, fried shrimp, shrimp gumbo, Oriental stir fry, egg rolls, carved beef, turkey, ribs, Italian dishes, fresh made pizza and a dessert area. Much much more, but that is all I can remember at the moment. $17.99 including your beverage. The portions placed out were small but replenished often so it does not get old and dried out, very fresh. Grilling meat as you watched. They also have mixed, and specialty drinks at a considerable reduced price. If you go make plans to eat there at least one night. It was excellent. All the food was very yummy. Dessert were excellent, cakes like you would see in a bakery, carrot cake was excellent, cookies, sugar free deserts, hand scooped ice creams and sorbet. Big Bang for your buck. Grotto, Italian resturant, we had pizza there thin crust chicken which was very good. Two starbucks coffee shops available. One with an outdoor cafe on Fremont Street. The are doing some renovations, so no need for an alarm clock or wake up call, the worker show up daily for work. Their work area does not interfere with your stay.

The rate of stay for Friday and Saturday in the standard king room was $189 per night. When I called to make reservations, I learned I had earned four complementary nights at the hotel using my Preferred Arrangements (PA) Card. (If you don\u2019t have a card, call the hotel and ask to become a member. It\u2019s free of charge). I also learned, by staying on the nights I booked, I would earn double PA points (you earn 25 points during a normal stay Sunday thru Thursday and 20 points for Friday and Saturday). This meant, we could pay for the first two nights at 50 points a night and comp the last night, and not loose any points already earned. Good stuff huh! I also want to tell you I researched the latest information on the hotel via Trip Advisor and learned of a VIP program where you could pay $15 dollars through VIP services and use them for check-in and out, eat light snacks during your stay (cheese and cracker plates in the lounge while open) and arrange any type of concierge issues you might have, like booking shows on the strip or Limos. I called and paid for the service prior to our trip. More on the VIP service in a moment. My wife and left out of San Jose, Ca on an afternoon Southwest Airlines flight and arrived in Las Vegas on time. We took the free shuttle bus to the new rental car center and picked up our compact car at Advantage for $13 a day. Once the car was loaded, we were off to the Golden Nugget. We arrived at the hotel around 4:15 pm, and I noticed the line for check-in was extremely long. An easy 20 minute wait. Here\u2019s where the $15 dollars for the VIP services comes in handy. Just off the check-in area is where the VIP lounge is located. We opened the door and were greeted by a young lady behind the counter who asked for our last name (oh, I forgot to mention there was no one waiting to check-in inside the VIP lounge). Once she had the name, we were checked-in and handed our room keys and our coupon book. We were given a room in the South Tower. The South Tower is located away from the Casino floor, heading towards the pool and Carson Street Caf\u00e9. I\u2019ve seen a few post on here about the \u201clong walk\u201d and how horrible the distance is from everything. I didn\u2019t see it that way. Yeah, it\u2019s not right next to the Casino and the restaurants, but you\u2019re only in the room to sleep, right. Our room was 1499, located at the far end of the tower. The room\u2019s are older, but never the less, clean and quite. We put our things away and made our way back down to the Casino level to explore the hotel (I had not been to the GN since 2005). We went outside to the pool area and I can\u2019t express to you how nice the pool area is now. The Shark Tank and water slide that goes through the middle of it. There were Cabana\u2019s, air mattresses, a Hugh Jacuzzi and even an 18 and over, European Tanning Area. That\u2019s right, a nude tanning area (located on the 3rd floor, south end). The rest of the hotel looked fantastic too. The new owners have done a great job with their renovations. We had dinner at Grotto\u2019s, known best for its Outstanding Pizza, WHICH THEY ARE by the way. The wife had Lasagna and I had a pasta dish that was out of sight. After dinner, we did some gambling. The tables were $5 dollars a play on Wednesday night and went to $10 on Thursday through Friday nights. The casino\u2019s across the street from GN stayed at $5 dollars a hand during our entire stay. The Fremont Street experience was good, but the thing that really impressed us was the Spray Painters who did paintings using nothing but their talents and spray paint. They are incredible. Make sure you take the time to watch one of these guys do their work. On Thursday, we decided to grab a Caba\u00f1a for the day. They have a total of seven. Four are located on the 3rd floor and three on the 2nd. There\u2019s a private bathroom located on the 2nd floor, and the entrance to the water slide is on the 3rd floor. The Cabana\u2019s are $150 dollars Monday through Thursday and $200 dollars Friday through Sunday. Included with each Cabana is a 42 inch, flat screen HD TV, a refrigerator, a safe, two wicker chairs and sofa and four lounge chairs outside. You also get your own drink hostess and concierge. The service was great and I had a great day just relaxing and being pampered all day. Well worth the money. On our last night at the hotel, my wife and I had dinner at Vic & Anthony\u2019s Steak House, located inside the GN. The food was FANTASTIC! I highly recommend dinner there and make sure you make reservations. The only other place we dined at within the hotel was the Carson Street Caf\u00e9. The food was okay, nothing great to report. Take a look at the photo\u2019s I posted and if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me.

I had packed 3 evening outfits and my husband had suits along and we did not bother to get dressed for the evening. The hospitality staff (restaurants, housekeeping, and valet service) were all polite and accomodating however the Front Desk should be ashamed and sent directly to be taught manners and customer services skills. We stayed there to relax at the new pool. This was definitely my mistake! It smelled like chlorine so strongly that I was afraid for my skin to even get my tootsies wet. The pool area is nothing more than being on a cruise ship for its' size and the lounge chairs are tightly lined up that made personal space uncomfortable. Basically, we got what we paid for.

Booked a Spa Tower Suite in the North tower with VIP check in. I will try to hit all the highlights and be brief: Check in: a breeze with VIP service. You can pay an additional $15 for this service for room other than suites and it is well worth the money. We arrived about 4:30 p.m. Sunday and lines were long but there were more than 2 people at the front desk. Walked straight to VIP lounge and was checked in in less than 5 minutes. Left luggage to be delivered later. Got to room and called bellman for luggage. Was delivered within 10 minutes! Wow! Room: WOW! WOW! WOW! 1,500+ sq. ft. of sheer bliss!! 2-story, with tons of lighted mirrors that give an even larger perception of the room. Marble and granite everywhere. Jacuzzi tub upstairs with a view of the strip from the ceiling to floor windows. Spiral staircase leading to the most amazing master bedroom/bathroom I have ever seen. The shower could easily fit a dozen adults--not that I would recommend that! but it is that big and includes a steamer. Automatic drapes and lights that can be controlled from either upstairs or downstairs. Coffee maker, fridge, hairdryer, iron/board, wet bar, ice maker, stemware, tons of towels. Bed was huge and comfy with tons of pillows. Entry door on lower and upper level. Lower level goes to foyer and upper level goes directly to bedroom. The room lacked nothing. Private elevator for Suite Tower guests only. Only has 5 suites per floor. We thought the elevator was just for us because we never had to wait nor did we ever run into anyone else. Suite key must be inserted to use elevator which is located right off the casino floor. Pool: \"The Tank\" with a 3-story waterslide thru the aqarium was awsome. Lounge chairs are close together but there was plenty of room to move around. Never totally full. Pool water cool and refreshing in the hot sun. Closes at 9p.m. Beautifully lit at night. Restaurants: Tried the Carson Street Cafe twice for lunch. Service was quick and friendly. Food was good and price was reasonable. Very casual atmosphere. Less than $20 for 2 adults. Had dinner at the Grotto. Again, service was quick and very friendly. Food was amazing! You must try the cheesecake!! Less than $60 for 2 adults. Attempted the buffet but line was too long so went to Carson Street Cafe again and got right in. Casino: We're not table players, only slots and certainly not high limit. Won some, lost some but Golden Nugget has best casino on Freemont. Layout is good and drink service is also good. Casino hosts readily available when needed and very friendly. Location: Freemont Street!! Forget what you have read...downtown is not dirty or filled with homeless or winos. Yes, we saw a few homeless people after dark but you can see that anywhere. Free concerts, acrobatics, artists, musicians, etc. After dark, the street comes alive but there is still plenty of room to move around. We are smokers so I pay attention to certain things and not once could I find a cigarette butt on the ground! The entire street was very clean--and had a safe/secure feeling. Transportation to and from strip: use the Duece - terminal within easy walking distance from hotel and ride all day for $5. We walked to the terminal and had no problem getting a seat but bus does fill up quickly. I would not want to wait in the hot sun on the strip to ride it back. We rode from terminal to the Wynn then walked our way up the strip for the rest of the day at a leisurely pace. Returned to the Sahara from Bally's via monorail. Cost was $9 for 2 adults. Then took cab from Sahara to Freemont. Cost was $8. You can get a 24-hour monorail pass for a few dollars more but we didn't need it. When you get off at the Sahara, be sure to try Peco's Mexican Bar and Grill. Best mexican food we've had. Cost was less than $20 for 2 adults with a couple of drinks! Overall stay was sheer perfection. We will be back and we will always go back to the Nugget! The strip is nice to visit for a day of sightseeing, but if you really want to relax and not walk miles and miles, the Golden Nugget is the place.

We tried several others for breakfast and lunch, and none of them compaired to the Nugget's quality of food. It was good. And I'm really not a \"buffet\" person.

I have stayed at the Golden Nugget two other times, mid-week mind you, and was impressed, unfortunately, this time was different. Check in is at 3pm, but my flight came in earlier at 12:30pm, so I wanted to try anyway. When I arrived at the front desk, wow, the line was horrendous. There were only 2 clerks checking in and the wait took about 30 minutes. Luckily, I was able to check into my room right away. The next day, I had come back to my room after turn down service, only to find out that no additional toilet paper nor soap was given. I called the front desk and they did send housekeeping up to the room. I did take one day to relax in the pool. You have to get there early, by 10am and grab a chair before they are gone. The slide is great, if the line is short, or having a short spurt. It is noisy and crowded, but with a Peach Belini drink and a lounge chair, you can forget the rest. It is worth it for a cool dip in the desert sweltering heat. So far, not too bad, but the stay turned for the worst. If you are lucky enough to receive a Golden Nugget Coupon Book, do so, but if you make your reservation through the hotel directly, not using Orbitz or some other third party, you most likely will not be given this coupon book. In the book, there are free admissions and discounts for their breakfast/lunch buffet and other goodies, as well as upgrades on your next stay. Instead, I was only offered a $25 room credit, great I thought, enough for 2 people for breakfast. I was told it can be used anywhere in the hotel, except for gambling. My last day, I decided to use the credit for the breakfast buffet, ok food, liked the eggs benedict the best, especially if it is for free! To my surprise, this offer was more headache than it was worth. I was looking to have my last couple of hours in Vegas to be relaxing, but instead I had almost misssed my flight. The room credit had to be used in it's entirety (the whole $25) or else you could not use the Express Check Out from your room. I bought a couple of tiny items from their gift shop and even paid a couple dollars out of my own pocket to be sure I used the whole $25. Needless to say, their lack of communication skills forced me to wait in the Check Out line at the front desk, another nightmare even on a Monday, and then wait another 30 minutes until a manager could help sort the problem. My frustrations had reached their limit, I just wanted to leave to catch my flight by this time. The manager blamed ME for not understanding the rules and did NOT appologize nor seem to be bothered by my bad experience. In the end, I did make it to my flight on time, barely, but will not stay at the Golden Nugget again. Very poor customer service in situations when you need it the most.

This had to be one of the finest rooms I have ever been in. The only thing I could compare the room to was the view as seen through the huge windows. The casino was great, though packed, and the food was everything you would expect. Even the Ruben I got at the grill in the casino was exceptional. Landry's is doing an outstanding job of creating a hotel experience to compete against the giants on the strip. We took a couple of side trips to the strip hotels to see a show, shop and gamble but found the size a bit too much and were happy to return to the confines of the Golden Nugget each time. Those huge hotels are nice to look at but downtown is much more relaxing. The \"Tank\" (pool) is really something now that it is finished and everyone seemed to enjoy it. As far too many kids as some reviews noted, I saw just as many on the strip and they did not seem as well behaved as those I encountered at the Nugget. There is still construction going on as they expand the hotel/casino but we were not disturbed or inconvenienced by it.

The pool features a separate and enclosed aquarium within the pool in which there are lots of big sharks with huge teeth. The tube travels through the shark aquarium. It is a rush. When standing in the pool you can get right up against the aquarium glass separating it from the pool and observe sharks about 2-4\" from your face--seeing their dozens of huge teeth. Two waterfalls flow into the pool and it's very, very beautiful. It is absolutely a blast to fly down that tube and I'm 59 and I loved it. Rooms are extremely clean and the hotel, in general, is terrific. The nighlty 11pm light show outside the hotel is unbelievably innovative and entertaining.

The tournament itself was very enjoyable. I did have what I consider a major issue with the hotel. I checked into the hotel on 12 July and had a reservation until 17 July. One night I came back to my room (room 1617 North Tower) and my key would not work. I called to the front desk and was told that I had checked out of the hotel. I had not checked of the hotel and asked why they had checked me out. The front desk manager did not know why , but after checking, advised the cleaning staff not seeing any luggage in my room thought I had checked out. I had a backpack on this trip and it was with me. This is why there was no luggage in my room. After about an hour the front desk manager gave me another room, which I thought was also in the North Tower. It turned out to be in the South Tower. I really did not want to stay in the South Tower and I was tired of fighting with it, so I returned to the front desk and checked out of your hotel and went to Paris. Upon checkout I asked for a receipt where there were charges on the bill that were to be comped off the bill. They were not and I was told that I would have to take it up with the 24 Karat Club. At this point I was not in the mood to deal with this issue, so I left the hotel. I did ask for the managers name and was told it was Martha Sanchez. The next morning I called and spoke with her Admin Assistant, who took the information and advised that she would have her call me back. She never did call back. The next day I came back into the hotel and advised the 24 Karat Club supervisor on duty that charged had not been comped off. She looked into her system and said that notes had been placed in the record to comp off the charges and that the front desk should have been able to see the note. She then took me to the front desk and had the charges taken off. At this point I had still not received a call from Martha Sanchez. When I was at the airport yesterday, leaving Las Vegas, I tried to one more time to call Martha Sanchez and she was in. She told me that the hotel has guest check out without telling the front desk and that it was assumed I had left even though my reservation was through the 17th. She made me feel like the whole thing was my fault and that was just the way the hotel is run. In all my travels I have never been checked out of my hotel room while I was still there. I expected a lot more from the Director of Hotel Operations. I had the feeling that because I was comped the room and not a paying customer or a high roller, that I was not worth taking the time on.

It was very cheap ($64/nt), easy, and we got to check in on Saturday. I think that if you book through their website-they don't allow check-ins on that day. There was a line when we arrived at about 3, but it wasn't terrible. We waited about 20 mins. We did end up having to wait another hour for our room to be cleaned, but we filled that time easily. The rooms are huge and clean. The only problem I saw was that there was black mold growing on the grout of the shower. I don't have mold in my own shower at home, and don't expect to have it in a hotel room. This I think was probably due to a cheap tiling job-where they didn't seal the grout like they should have. Our maid was great and did excellent cleaning our room. Another negative thing was the people selling timeshare in the lobby and as you enter the hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights and trust me, after the first or second you want to tell them to kiss it. I thought this was bad that the hotel allowed them to hound their guests. At least make them set up outside. Very un-classy of the Nugget. We ate the buffet once at breakfast and it wasn't very good. Not a lot of variety. VERY VERY greasy. I paid $9 and ended up with toast (which I actually had to wait for) and cereal. Not my idea of great. There are better options for breakfast in the other hotels. The pool is very nice, however I myself am a designer and I saw several problems. First was the mold on the bathroom floors (another cheap tile laying issue.) Second of all, the pool is very small for the amount of people that are there. Every chair was nearly taken-every day. The chairs are also 4\" apart-at the most. So if you use the armrest you are holding hands with ur neighbor. They also have large mattresses out there. This is not really a concern to me, because I wouldn't use them anyway. But the designer should be smacked on the hand. It was a waste of $$ for the nugget as the pool area is not even 6 months old and shows significant wear-especially on those dirty matresses. Other than those few small things...that really you can live with, the Nugget isn't bad. It is by far the nicest hotel downtown. If you can get it cheap it is worth it....but I would definetly not pay over $100 ever to stay there. I would prefer the Strip for that price in a second.

I went with 6 friends, and we all thought it was great. They set us up in two adjoining rooms that were tastefully decorated, quiet, comfortable, and very clean. We spent most of our time at the hotel pool and gambling along Fremont Street. The pool (which features a $3m renovated shark tank and GREAT water slide!!!) was lovely. The poolside drinks were delicious... I recommend the pina colada especially... and the lounge chairs were very comfy. You can also rent nice-looking private cabanas if you want. The pool & shark tank, which you can swim right up to when you're in the water, are by far the best part of the Golden Nugget. I must admit that I did not dine at the Golden Nugget except for getting a sandwich and coffee from the Starbuck's downstairs, however some of my friends said the breakfast at the restaurant wasn't so tasty. As far as gambling, they offer lessons every morning at 10am, and I learned how to play craps there from several very patient and experienced dealers. My friends and I were served numerous free drinks from the cocktail waitresses, who were always ready to freshen our beverages. Furthermore, if you want to see the \"real\" Vegas, you can easily walk up the street to the Beauty Bar or the Griffin in the evening for a drink. There aren't many other nightlife options downtown, but the Deuce bus provides shuttle service to the strip, and a taxi ride is only about $20 (cheap when shared with friends). The bottom-line is this... if you are on a budget, and your expectations are not exceedingly high, the Golden Nugget is just want you want. It's clean, comfortable, inexpensive, and is by FAR the best hotel downtown (I checked out several others, and they were rancid with cigarette stench and full of worn-out-looking old people who appeared to be having very sad thoughts). The Golden Nugget, on the other hand, was like a breath of fresh air on Fremont Street... smelled nice, upper-middle-class clientele, and definitely a notch up in quality.

The situation didn't improve on checkout either as everyone and their brother was trying to checkout at the same time and the line was well over 120 people deep with only 2 counters open! The check-in/checkout process at this hotel is the worst I've experienced in my 7 or 8 trips to Vegas over the past 4 years. Once checked in, we made our way up to our room. My fiancee at the time is a bit of a princess and is very picky about accommodations and the only way I was able to talk her into staying at the Nugget was that I told her it had been recently remodeled and that I thought it wouldn't smell like an old hotel/casino and on top of that we were in town for only a few days for a sporting event so the price was right. From the moment we walked in the door, I was eating my words.... The Nugget had been remodeled, but then redecorated in the same 1970's style decor as it probably was before. There was no way to tell that there had ever been any upgrades! The extremely long haul to our room let us take a look at all the old style furnishings that made me feel like I was watching re-runs of old TV shows. The place smelled and looked extremely dated (pretty much what we thought of the entire downtown Las Vegas scene to be perfectly honest). Our room had an A/C unit that would work part of the time and then just blow out lukewarm air, the bed was comfortable but the decor was severely dated. Our dining experiences were subpar both within the Nugget and anywhere in downtown LV. The cafe within the Nugget had some of the worst food I've ever tasted and was so greasy it was disgusting. The places to eat in downtown were slim to none. Very disappointing. The gaming at the older casinos was also very surprising. The dealers at the Nugget, Four Queens and Binions were all terribly rude and caused us to pick up our chips, cash in and leave after 5 games. I was shocked by how they had barely any dealers that appeared to speak english and how absolutely rude they were. I even let the pit boss at the Four Queens know that we tried 3 different dealers and were treated poorly by all 3. He seemed like he couldn't give a heck so we just bailed. I mean everyone has to experience old downtown Las Vegas at least once I suppose, I really wish we had not. It was dated, smelled and I found very little entertainment value here. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to stay on the strip where there are things to do, the accommodations are clean and you are within walking distance to anything you could need.

Our room was as nice as our room at Caesar's, the food at the Buffet and Carson St. was great, the pool was amazing, and I'd say the staff was the best I've ever dealt with (I've stayed everwhere from Bellagio to Stardust). Each and every staff member was nice, kind and courteous. The valets were genuinely thankful when I tipped them for cab service -- as opposed to other places like Wynn and Venetian where it's \"expected,\" and if not received, the cab door's slammed harder. The Nugget's casino is laid out wonderfully, easy to navigate, and the dealers are all friendly. Drinks were aplenty too. Wait staff at Carson St. seemed like family and delivered 1st rate service. The French Toast (at 4:00 AM) was as good as I've had anywhere too. The pool simply speaks for itself. Incredible. I witnessed a number of people who weren't staying at the Nugget visit the pool area and say they were staying there next time just because of how cool the pool looks. I agree that none of the other downtown hotels can even come CLOSE to the Nugget, and if I stayed downtown again, I'd only stay there.

There was room for more to work plus a whole other check-in area but it was closed! Then, surpirse....rooms were not ready. Yes, at 1:30 AM. Very strange that it was ready an hour later because housekeeping is not even there! Others had to wait for a room also. This hotel is run like a Super 8. I expected better from them. They knew we were coming, why no room ready? Then, they offered us $30 ea. food credit, but the CATCH was we had to eat it all THEN at 2 AM! No thanks. Who wants to eat a $30 meal at 2 am before bed??? We convinced the clerk to let us have our food credit on account. He promised to put a note in the computer. Of course, this was NOT done and we had to WAIT again at the front desk to argue this later in the week.

We bought the expensive internet service (which should be free) only to have it not work when we really needed it because they closed the account service after 1 day.

There are tables that overlook the pool, but you only get to sit at one if you ask. We ate there 4 times and sat in the aisleway each time! When returing to get our bags at 4 pm Thurs, there was a very huge line to check in, and again tiny staff of 4! Are there no people to employ in that town?

Sharing a pool with such a throng must be unsanitary, personally I wouldn't put even a toe in that water.

We wanted to check in on June 9th, but we were told that the Golden Nugget does not allow Saturday arrivals, so we checked into The Fremont for the first few days. We wish we'd stayed there, but we wanted to try GN's pool. Check in was crowded at 5:00pm and we waited about 20 minutes or so. Not too bad. We asked a bellman (one of four standing around discussing their weekend) to help with our 9 bags and he directed us to the bell counter. Another bellman kindly offered to help us since the first one blew us off. Not a good start. The rooms were large, clean, and the bath was large enough for one person, but you didn\u2019t have to leave for the other person to get past you and into the shower. We went to the ticket counter at 8:30am Wednesday to book a pool side cabana for Thursday. We had heard of the demand for these things and wanted to be the first in line. The counter was supposed to open at 9:00am, but at 9:15am, there still was no agent to help us. Someone from registration finally found someone for us. It was money well spent. Cabana #2 is very nice and is most in demand from what the staff told us. Drink service was frequent and friendly. We\u2019d do it again. We had a few issues that required the attention of the front desk, but were never able to get them on the phone. The recorded messages that told us how important our call was to them were apparently a lie. We never got a return call. On the way to our room the first day, we saw a discarded napkin and a fast food taco joint sauce packet in the hall on the floor. They were both still there when we left, 5 days later. The public areas were spotless. The only staff that were friendly were at the pool, and the wonderful ladies that clean the rooms. We went to the registration desk and asked for a late checkout on Saturday as our flight didn\u2019t depart until 6:00pm. We were told that we could have the room until 1:00pm. I asked that if no one could check in on this day, why did we have to be out so early. The agent helping us asked why no one could check in. We told her that it was Saturday. She asked what the day of the week had to do with it. A man chimed in from about 10 feet away and told her that it was a standing policy of the Golden Nugget that Saturday check ins are not allowed. I asked him, then why we had to be out at 1:00pm if no one was going to be checking into our room. He actually turned his back on us and walked away. When we directed out gaze towards the agent that had been helping us, she turned to have a casual conversation with the agent next to her as though we had disappeared. When we spoke louder to get her attention, she spoke louder to her friend. She might as well have stood there with her ears covered, stomping her feet, and doing the \u201cLa la la\u201d thing. She never addressed us again. We just stood there in disbelief. We were VERY disappointed with the service there, and will not return. The service just does live up to what we experienced there 5 years ago. We will however, gladly return to downtown, but stay at another hotel. The pool is awesome, but the lousy staff at the hotel makes it not worth it. We did not try any restaurants there. We ate mostly at Magnolia's at the Four Queens.

I had never been to Fremont Street before, where this hotel is located and after reading the not so favorable reviews about it, I went in prepared for something horrible. Well, I am now proud to say that I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED that Fremont Street was NOT the dump that I thought I would see. There was not ONE SINGLE piece of refuse or trash on the ground, the ground is immaculate, nor did I see one homeless person or any sleeze hanging about outside. The parking situation here is kind of dicey, as the self-parking is somewhat of a schlepp to the hotel lobby entrance which is on Fremont Street. If you don't want to deal with carrying heavy luggage for two blocks, I would say go for the tip based valet which takes you right to the hotel lobby door. The rooms at the hotel were gorgeous, very tastefully decorated, even though we were in the South Tower. Many have said that the North Tower rooms are much nicer, but we saw both and the only difference is the price. Our room was the deluxe one which is 364 sq. feet, very spacious and the marble bathroom was absolutely immaculate. We were very happy with the front desk staff as well, we thought they were very professional and kind. We did wait in the check-in line about ten minutes, but it moved fast and we got into our room pretty quickly after that. I want to say again, that the surrounding area of the hotel was not at all filthy or run down. Granted, it is not the Strip, but then again you aren't paying Strip prices at this four-star hotel. I feel that the hotel is an excellent value if you want to escape the crowds on the Strip. By the way, the Strip is FAR DIRTIER in terms of trash in the streets and overrun with tourists/locals, etc. than Fremont which we found to be very quiet.

It is modern and I love the daily hold'em tournaments but there are only 10 tables and they are so close together that you are pressed up against the table your sitting at.

Rates were good; all services, including check-in and check-out, were fast and courteous; the entire property is very clean and well-kept; all eight elevators were fast; our room was fairly large and very clean. I didn't care for the brand of toiletries provided in the bathroom, but maybe that's just me. The pool is wonderful: the clear waterslide goes right through the middle of the huge cylindrical shark tank. (Of course, you''re sliding so fast that you don't enjoy the sharks from that angle.) The steps to the waterslide were better than any others I have seen. Instead of open-back, slippery stairs, these are solid concrete, and they feel very secure. To fully appreciate the shark tank, one must swim up to the cylinder and get face-to-face with the sharks. From that vantage point, the third of the tank which is below the pool surface is visible. The pool isn't very deep at any location, maybe 6 feet, which is nice. There are plenty of comfortable lounges around the pool, and chairs and couches and tables, too. Just don't forget your sunscreen. A guy I met said he paid $26 for one tube at the little pool store because he forgot his. Of course, Las Vegas hotels, including the GN, don't have in-room coffeepots. That wouldn't be so bad, except if you're in the South Tower as we were, you'd better be in good physical shape to walk all the way down to Starbucks and back. I will never stay in the South Tower again; it's way too far to walk. I have two complaints with the bathroom: the sink and the tub. They are placed so high that we could barely reach the sink, and I was afraid that my mother would fall getting out of the tub. (We are 5'2\" and 5'4\" and have never encountered this before.) All linens were excellent quality. The Carson Street Cafe has very good food, and so does the breakfast buffet on the second floor. Be sure to look at your coupon book, because there are coupons for those restaurants. Although the buffet says that breakfast ends at 10:30, they replace the food gradually, so you can still get breakfast items at 10:30.

If none of theese things bother you the hotel is nice the rooms were nice the casino was nice the game wheel of fortune the game I traveled all that way to play are restricted to only pay out small amounts so even when you've paid and finally won a spin they dont even allow you a fair chance at winning, this makes me sick, mabey thats just the way vegas is but I have stayed at hotels like treasure island and felt very much like a hotel guest and not a money rape victim. the bottom line: This isnt a hotel with a casino in it, its a casino with a hotel in it. and there is a difference!", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPool is the Bomb\u201d", "Author": "hostetterj", "ReviewID": "UR7416675", "Content": "Honeymoon in Vegas!!

We had a great view of Fremont St. and the mountains. I thought the lights from Fremont St. would bother us but they did not, the curtains were very heavy and shielded the light. My aunt ordered room service and she absolutely loved it, my friend and I ate in the 24 hour cafe and the food and service were great. The buffet in the morning was awesome too.

I had read a number of reviews from here; some great, some bad, and most just average, so I was not really sure what I was to expect. As far I was concerned the Golden Nugget is not a Strip facility, but comes out on top in old Las Vegas. The rooms were very clean, large and in great repair, house keeping was excellent and every request was met with no disappointments. The only thing I did not like was the $12 a day internet fee, that since I was there on business was forced to utilize. I just see this as a huge cash grab. The casino is smaller than the bigger places, but how big do you really need it. The casino hostess and bar tenders keep the drinks coming if your gambling, better than the large casinos.

I had been in the Golden Nugget in the past and in their pool area so I thought it was a good choice. CHECK IN We were booked for a standard room in the South Tower. When we got there to check in, they were full so the desk clerk tells me they have upgraded us to a Parlor Suite in the North Tower at no additional charge. Hey I was thrilled! The line was pretty long to check in and I did notice that their front lobby stayed pretty busy with check ins. ROOM The room was on the 14th floor and was really nice. It had a king bed that was so comfy I wanted to bring it home. There was another room with a bar/kitchen area along with a living room & dining table. There were 2 bathrooms, one with a jacuzzi jet tub and the other with a steamer shower. This was a lovely treat. The room was very clean, with everything you could think of needing in it. Absolutely wonderful. POOL The pool area is nice. The shark tank is fabulous and is much better when viewed from in the pool than from the side. It goes down deeper and them sharks swim right up to you. The slide is quite fun, goes pretty fast but by the time you get to the clear portion going through the tank you can't see much. But still fun. The pool gets pretty crowded. Lots of people just sunning, more than in the pool, but the weather was a bit mild so that might be why. In the morning the left side of the pool near the bar gets full fast as it is sunny & the right side is in the shade for awhile. The jacuzzi was nice - it said it had a 52 person capacity, but I couldn't quite envision that! It was really hot though. All in all I would stay there again. I wasn't expecting the suite, but was glad I got it. I would be happy in a regular room as well as I felt the Golden Nugget was very clean and fun. It is definetly not for those who are looking for relaxing privacy though.

We waited about 10 mins and there were 3 people in front. We found the staff courtious and made the check in a reasonable experience. We had been deposited at the south tower entrance by the limo, and it was a bit of a hike to find the main desk with our luggage in tow! We then had to lug it back again as our room was on the third floor in you've gussed it the south tower. Nobody offered to help with the luggage although we did not request anybody to do so. The room was clean, and ready for us. Irrespective of what time we left the room, we always returned to find the bed made and bathroom cleaned. The shower was wicked, if somewhat complicated to work! I have to agree with previous reviews regarding the towels. Plenty of them but they could do with a bit of fabric conditioner as they were stiff and clearly a bit old. My only other comment regarding the room was the aircon. It was a little chilly one night and we wanted a bit of heat. We had to endure a quite revolting burning skin smell as the heating function had clearly not been used for some time. As the windows do not open more than 1 inch, this was rather unpleasent. If you are reading this Mr Nugget, I suggest running the heating once a month to avoid guests having to endure this experence. 1 final pain was the Nugget car park across the road. Nothing worse than a noisy motor bike rider parking on the top floor and deciding to leave the car park at 4.30 in the morning. I shared his exit from every floor, and his obviouse relief when he finally got to the bottom and roared away!! The hotel public area's were spotless. Staff were always out in the late evenings polishing the mirrors and brass, and one night we saw a guy on his hands and knees scrubbing one of the carpets. Very impressed! We are not gamblers so I can make no comment regarding that facility. It was however a very interesting place to stand and watch others playing with their banks money! I do have 2 gripes. They both revolve around eating! The Carson Cafe staff were not the friendliest, and there was a considerable amount of waiting for food. The quality was not special either. I had southern fried chicken one evening that was so over cooked I could not eat it. The chips were not any better! My new wife tells me however that the pancakes were great. My other gripe was the Buffet. It shuts at 10, and we arrived at 10 to. There were 2 staff at the desk and a waitress at the entrance. We made a move towards the waitress and one of the staff at the desk stopped her conversation and said \"You have to pay here first\" It was not the content that annoyed me but the way she said it. There were no signs to say \"wait here to be served\" and , at the end of the day I was a customer! We turnrd on our heals and left her to her conversation. Clearly an overtired employee, or a fed up one. The nice part was the pool area, which was fully open, and had nice fluffy towels!! This area will be a hit! One point for Mr Nugget however. It is nice when you are on holiday to spend an evening outside in the fresh air with a nice drink and good company. I was therefore suprised that we got booted out at 2am because the bar was closing. The Nugget does not match the hotels on the strip. However, we were very glad that we chose the Nugget and would certainly revisit if ever we could afford another trip to renew our vows. Dream on!! As for Vegas as a holiday, A week is long enough! A lot of walking in spite of the fantastic DEAUCE buses. We have been home 3 weeks now, and I have had plenty of time to think about the stay.

The pool, in my opinion is the best in Vegas at this time. The water slide through the shark tank was a blast. My husband and I both went down it and had a great time. Nice, comfy lounge chairs and patio furniture all around the pool and loved the lawn beds in the water. Great way to keep cool and watch the shark tank. The rooms are always nice and the beds comfortable. Housekeeping is very good, with a supervisor coming by to check the rooms after they have been cleaned, I saw this myself. We ate in the Carson Street Cafe and it was very good and reasonably priced. And the Grotto bar was fun with very friendly waite staff. Overall, this is a beautiful hotel and they have just made it even better with the new pool and new lounges and restaurant. We will stay there again no doubt about it. We were comped very well and my hubby did good on the dollar flaming 7 machines. If someone writes a bad review about this place, they better pay the extra and go stay at the Bellagio or Wynn. We have stayed at several strip hotels in the past and the Golden Nugget is by far our favorite.

This weekend, however, even the low-end hotels on The Strip (Sahara, Circus Circus, Tropicana) were going for around $140 a night. So for starters, no, don't stay at the Sahara or Circus Circus. They're scary, plain and simple. The Tropicana at least has a good location. But I digress...We booked a room directly through the hotel using the Spring Lucky '07 promotion posted on their website: $99 a night and a coupon book. Always book directly through the hotel, as most of them will meet any travel website's price and you don't run the risk of Orbitz \"forgetting\" to pass your reservation along. (Yes, this happened to me when I booked a room for a production crew in Buenos Aires). Just so you know, you can't use most of the coupons in your book during the weekend. We drove up to the Golden Nugget around 5:30 PM on a very busy Friday. The valet was full to visitors and only taking hotel guests. After reading reviews here, I expected to stand in the check-in line for at least an hour. We waited for about 15 minutes at most. Although the promotional rate was for a room in the south tower, the young lady at the front desk was nice enough to upgrade us to a north tower room (albeit a smoking one) at no additional cost, simply by asking. FYI: you're supposed to tip front desk staff $10-$25 for upgrading you. The room smelled bad, yes. But we bought some incense at a liquor store on Fremont Street and it made a huge difference. North tower is definitely better than south tower. The room was tidy but not super clean. We moved one of the chairs in the room and found an old bobby pin on the carpet. No big deal. The bathroom was small but seemed clean. The Golden Nugget seems not to have adopted the \"green\" towel policy: a towel on the floor will be replaced, etc, etc. We put towels on the counter and on the towel rack and they were still replaced. Towels are fluffy, by the way. Location: The Golden Nugget seems to be the place to be in downtown. It is definitely the nicest hotel and casino there. Hip casino with music playing all day and all night, AWESOME pool, etc, etc. The spa was just ok. The Buffet was good. All in all, the Golden Nugget is not as geriatric as you would imagine. They are making a huge effort to attract the young crowd. Getting to and from the Strip: we took a cab from the GN to Caesars and paid around $20. We hopped on The Deuce for the trip back and paid $2 each. The Deuce dropped us off on the other end of the Freemont Experience (near Neonopolis). Bottom line: Don't stay here if you plan on barhopping/clubhopping. Don't stay here if you're looking for \"glamorous\" Vegas. Don't stay here if this is your first time visiting Vegas. Don't stay here if this will be your only time visiting Vegas. Stay here if you can't afford anything on The Strip.

It's nice to be treated like you are truly appreciated, and not just cattle. They went above and beyond every time we needed anything. Freemont was fun and there was plenty to do and see there -- and we felt as safe or safer than we normally do on the Strip. The only drawback might be being away from the strip, but we had a car, so we didn't have any troubles. For us, the lower room price and the excellent service was a fair trade for not being on the Strip.

Our suite on the 4th floor in the north tower was roomy and clean. There were two bathrooms, one with a jacuizzi tub and one with a shower. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and the plumbing rattled pretty loudly when you used the hot watter, so that was disappointing. The bed was comfortable but we couldn't get the room quite cool enough and had to rotate between using the comforter and kicking it off. We got coffee at Starbucks every morning and ordered room service one night, both were pretty good. We didn't try any of the other restaurants at the Nugget. Tony Roma's at Binions was fair. My wife found that she had much better luck playing slots on the strip (Caesars, Ballys, O'Shea's, etc.) than she did at the Nugget or the other downtown casinos. That could be simply her luck, so I would read too much into that. Although we played on the strip during the day, we played primarily at the Nugget at night. I spent three nights playing blackjack and pai gow until the wee hours of the morning but I don't think that they did a good job rating my play. When I checked with the rewards desk the morning of checkout, they said that they only track slot play and that I needed to check with a casino host to see if my table play qualified for any room discount. When I finally did run down a host, they said I didn't meet their requirment for a room discount. . . . Whatever, I can only tell you that I gambled for several hours three nights straight and was down over $2k when done. No big deal losing, that's not their fault but I would have expected some comp on the room. I think when I moved between tables they did not keep up with me. Is that my responsibility? In contrast, the limited amount of time we played at Caesars we were given $100 in comps which we used to eat a nice dinner at the Flamingo Japanese Steakhouse.

It bugs me that I had to do it, but it was SO WORTH IT. We checked in at 3PM on Friday, and the line at registration was long. Using the VIP check in, we checked in three of our rooms, got a couple of bottled waters and were on our way to our rooms in a matter of minutes. We stayed in the South Tower. Some complain about the South Tower, but I prefer the easy access to the self park. Rooms are relatively spacious. They're not strip quality, but they're satisfactory.

Several members of our group reported this to still be the case.

It has recently changed hands (Landry's/Fertitta) and much has been touted about its renovation under the new owners. We were there this past weekend (2/23-2/27/07). We booked a room in the North Tower (more expensive than South Tower). We were unable to get a King Room as we had reserved except on a very low floor. We opted for an available double on an upper floor. We had a faulty showerhead, sewer gas coming up out of the sink drain (permeated the entire room if drain left open), and an a/c/fan unit that didn't draw in outside air with the Fan Only (weather was cool and we just wanted some outside air) and made such a racket with the A/C that it was unuseable. As a result, the room was stuffy and uncomfortable throughout the night. The Hotel no longer triple sheets its beds and a very nasty looking dingy white blanket was on the bed. Upon my request, Housekeeping did oblige and triple sheeted for our stay but I had to specifically ask about this. We had no glasses for the bathroom - again, had to ask. A tray of partially eaten nachos sat in the hallway across from our room from Saturday night through Tuesday morning. For this we paid nearly $200 night. The rest of the so called renovations are not terrific enough to draw me back: The spa hot tub in the renovated spa had a grey/brown film that had deposited itself on the tiles - disgusting! Amenities in the spa were barebone, e.g., no brushes or combs. The Hotel pool area - which used to be pleasant in the winter to use - was only partially open and the pool itself was drained with workmen drilling and plastering. Incredibly, the in-hotel TV channel showed the pool fully open - there were even pictures of people sunning and swimming! (?) Same with the billboard and magazine ads about the hotel currently in circulation. So much for truth in advertising. My husband tried the buffet (now located on second floor) and said the quality of the food was average at best and the layout confusing and congested. From what I could see, the main renovation has been a reshuffling of floor space in the casino to accomodate more slot machines which are placed in a congested, maze-like configuration. The Nugget staff and fellow gamblers still are friendly (with the exception of the front desk personnel) but we left grumpy and feeling like we had been nickel & dimed to death - you are even charged - rather heftily - for printing out your airline boarding slip at the Hotel's on-line center! While we will probably continue to visit downtown vintage Vegas in the future, we will stay at a hotel on The Strip. Landry's/Fertitta ownership of the Nugget has removed any value it might have had in the past.

Valet was very slow but they did have our car ready when we checked out. The bed linens and towels are very poor quality and the shower barely worked. The towels were very rough and scratchy and the bed linens were very old .We ate at the buffet twice and did not find it up to the standards we expect in Las Vegas. Also had the buffets at the Orleans and Red Rock Spa and Casino and both were much higher in quality. Also Sam's Town breakfast buffet was far superior. The hotel is beautiful with lots of brass and marble everywhere. In the casino there is a wide variety of slots and video poker as well as table games and it is laid out well. They definitely need more staff for the front desk and better quality linens. If you decide to stay here, pay more and get the North Tower which opens out to the Fremont Street Experience and is adjacent to all the casinos downtown. We would not stay here again and do not recomment the south Tower for anyone over 50.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "rager999", "ReviewID": "UR6892985", "Content": "We enjoyed the stay but the service was terrible, especially at the eateries.

I don't carry a credit card, so could not upgrade to a suite, or access any of the premium movies available in the room.

First off, we did not wait in the long line that many complained about, you can purchase a VIP check in for $15 prior to arriving and you are then (and only then) guaranteed a king bed, non smoking room. Our plane was extremely late and the VIP girl stayed and waited until we all arrived as she had known about the plane delays. I would say the whole process took about 10 minutes. The walk from the South Tower to the casino, not bad, I can see if maybe someone had some type of walking disability, but pretty much for us Vegas is a walking trip, so we were not bothered by this. We ate at only two places at the hotel, the Grill and the Cafe, both, we were treated very well by the staff and the food was good. The room is what seemed to disappoint me the most, we had a beautiful view of the lights, on the 20th floor, but for spending all this money on remodeling, I just didn't see it in our room. The wallpaper in the bathroom was all peeling off, the tub all scratched up, the TV case looked like something purchased out of a resale shop. The bed was the worst I have ever slept in, very hard, no covers to speak of, and 3 small pillows. But on the bright side, you dont really spend much time in the room. The time share people didn't bother us, yes, they asked us if we wanted to get free stuff, but when do you ever get \"free\" stuff?? so we knew right away they were time sellers and weren't interested, when you told them politely your not interested you were greeted with \"have a great day\", no pressure. It was a beautiful day on Saturday so we went to see the very talked about Shark tank and it was closed (covered by a huge cloth) due to construction around the tank being done. However, we did get a peek before we left and it was really cool. I can imagine in the summer months having a drink, laying on those very padded comfy chairs, it would be great. We did take a cab to the strip for $14- $16 each way, I love the strip but my husband and I were excited to get back to the slower pace, more quiet Freemont Street in the evening. I would say overall our experience of the Golden Nugget was good. I would recommend it to our friends. The price is right and the hotel is really beautiful, you just have to overlook the room issues.

It's definitely seedy, and there isn't anything to do like there is on the Strip (except the light show at Fremont Street). As far as the hotel itself goes, it doesn't compare to some of the fancier ones on the Strip, but then again it's under $100 a night during the week, so you can't expect it to be the same. Our room was nice enough; I can't really complain. They are still doing major construction on the street just outside the front entrance, but luckily our room faced away from there so we didn't hear anything. Service was poor. There was a line at checkin, and although it wasn't very long, there weren't enough people working the desk so it took half an hour to check in. I think that is way too long considering there weren't that many people ahead of me. We had to retrieve our luggage from the storage room (too complicated to explain why we didn't have it with us), and the bellmen seemed to have disappeared. Employees kept coming in and out of that room, and although they saw people waiting there to get their bags, nobody so much as glanced at us or said it would be just a moment. I actually had to open the door, stick my head in the room and ask when someone would be out to take care of us. Then there was the time-share desk! I'm sure all the hotels have them, and now that I know how it works, I will ignore them in the future. What they do is ask everyone who walks by if they want cheap tickets to a show. I didn't remember having been asked this in the past, so maybe it's a new thing, or maybe my memory is going bad, but in any case I thought this was a bona fide offer so of course we went over to listen to them. This woman goes on and on about the shows she could get us into for $10. When we looked interested and started discussing dates, she then says that we have to go look at their timeshare property in order to get the tickets! And she didn't even use the word \"timeshare\" but we knew that's what it was. It's just so slimy not to tell people this right away, and if the hotels think that they are helping themselves by doing this, they are wrong. It does not make good business practice to piss off your guests. We didn't have time to go look at it and even if we had time we wouldn't have been interested. The whole thing was just plain annoying. We didn't eat at the restaurant, and the Starbucks concession in the lobby was charging double what a regular Starbucks charges. I know this is standard practice throughout Vegas, but it's still ridiculous. We found a Starbucks two blocks away from the hotel, so we went there instead.

Second, there's no light over the dining table so it was useless after it got dark. Third, the water pressure was very low and it took extra time to rinse. Fourth, the complimentary body wash, shampoo and conditioner was poor quality. Fifth, housekeeping doesn't do a very good job of cleaning under things. While searching for my son's toy I ran my hand under one of the side tables in the living room and found sticky fruit. Sixth, even though we were in a suite, we never had turn down service or chocolates on the pillow. And seventh, the renovated buffet is nothing to brag about. It's small with a very limited selection. Oh, one other thing...eighth...the suite we had on 10 was right next to the elevator and ice machine and a room for staff only. Staff members were in and out of that room at all hours of the day and the door would bang closed. Not very considerate of guests. I realize I've said some pretty negative things about the Golden Nugget. However, I like the property and it's where we usually stay when we go to Vegas.

The staff is mostly friendly and so helpful. The restaurants are good. Room service is fast and efficient. And it's easy to park in the garage. The suite itself was OK. The thing I liked best was it had three bathrooms and three different doors to enter from the outside. That was great when our son was sleeping. The Nugget also provided a crib at no extra cost and that was nice. I do have to add that a suite of that level should have a microwave and not just a fridge and coffee pot. There were also phones in the bathrooms. That's a neat feature if you need it. :-) And there's a TV in the bathroom by the wet bar. We'll definitely stay at the Golden Nugget again but we won't spend as much as we did for a suite when there were so many things that could have been better. It's a nice suite but when you're paying several hundred a night, you want a light above the dining table and no sticky fruit on the floor. :-) And we won't eat at the buffet again. We saw the pool.

Although the VIP check-in gives you unlimited access to the VIP lounge, this is of limited value. There's a comfortable seating area, but no cocktail service and very limited/inconsistent refreshment selection. Do it for the quick check-in, and the professional, careful service. This was my first stay at the GN -- normally we stay someplace very low-budget downtown. It was worth it. We chose to pay slightly more to stay in the North Tower, which in my opinion is totally worth it. It must be $10 more, but the elevators come *right* down next to the gift shop, *right* next to the casino. I was so glad to be so close to the action, and then, so close to the room when the action was over! Oh, and I am obliged to mention that the elevator service was extremely efficient.

We spent 2 nights at the hotel and checked out on 12/29/06 and drove to San Francisco where our parents lived. When we received the American Express bill, however, we found out that we were charged 2 extra nights on one of the rooms (as a separate charge, and of course much much higher rate). We called the hotel immediately to correct the situation. We were advised to call back during the business hours, M-F, and speak to someone at the Accounts Receivable. We came back home early on Friday to call them, during the day, and spoke with someone at the Accounts Receivable. She briefly transfered me to the Front Desk to see if they could see what is going on. The person at the front desk (we found out later that the person was a manager) told me that according to their note, the cleaning crew found some luggage in the room and notified the front desk on 12/29, and the frond desk assumed that we decided to go back to the room (after checking out completely??), thus charged our card using their year end rate without confirming with us at all. He rudely transfered us back to the Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable rep at this time was very nice and promised to get back to me by Tuesday after doing the needed research. On the following Wednesday, since we did not receive any call back, we called her back. At this time, she was no longer nice. She said that she did not have any authority to post any credit, hence she will have to transfer the issue to the Front Desk Manager (after wasting several days). She abruptly told us if we don't like it, we could call the credit card company and dispute the charge. She transfered the call to another Front Desk Manager. This manager was not friendly at all (based on her tone of voice). She said since she did not have any evidence that shows that we really did not occupy the room for the two nights, she could not give us the credit right away. She needs to speak with the first manager who spoke with us. That will take few days, she said. At this point, we are waiting for this unfriendly front desk manager to get back to us. We have traveled a lot and have had to face few hotel related problems, but they were always very friendly and helpful and never took this long. This time, Golden Nugget is treating us like we are trying to cheat them. They are giving us run-arounds and dragging their feet in giving the credit back for the error they created; they are charging us for the days we spent in San Francisco.

My latest stay was in November of 2006. I must admit, I read many reviews here, and was somewhat worried that since the Landrys group took over operations, that things may have changed for the worse; however, I can happily report that nothing could be further from the truth!. My room in the South Tower was large, quiet and immaculate!. The renovations they have done have certainly raised the bar for hotels at this, or almost any price!. The rooms in the North Tower are a little more pricey, but even nicer, as in the past I have stayed in them as well. Yes, the towels are a little scratchy, but they are functional, and you get plenty of them. Plenty of closet space, an in-room safe, auxiliary vanity mirror in the bathroom, and a nice large TV I can watch from my King Sized bed, just add to the comforts you get at such a value. I almost didnt want to leave my room! The buffet is now located on the second floor, and includes such wonderful items as crab legs, a tex-mex bar, italian bar, and some of the most succulent Prime Rib you will find anywhere. Vic and Anthony's now lives where the California Pizza kitchen used to be, and presents itself as a steakhouse which I can attest to as world class. Even the famous coffee shop has the highest quality food you will find anywhere on the strip, or downtown, for that matter. Even room service is top flight, and operates around the clock; I highly recommend the French Onion soup. They have a new lounge, called \"Rush\", and it is a nice, quiet alternative to the crowd and slot machine noise you will hear so much of in this town. Its a nice place to unwind. But best of all, and what makes this establishment a four diamond hotel, is the service. You will not find a more responsive, courteous, and helpful staff anywhere. They are all as nice as they can be, and you will not find an attitude anywhere in this house.

If you are used to and loved staying at TheHOTEL at mandalay bay, or the venetian you might be dissapointed. Personally I love staying at the nugget. The rooms are nice, the bathrooms are a little small though, the hotel is clean, and the gambling is pretty good as well. The south tower is a bit of a walk but if you ask for a room that looks down on Freemont street you can watch the show from your room. (backwards) The food at LIlly's upstairs is excellent and the fun pass they give you at check in gives you buy one get one free. The ability of walking to numerous other casinos is the true attraction here. Next door is the four queens and I love the bar there( it is open to freemont experiance.) Binions is across the street, as well as all of the old school casinos left around. Check in was a little slow check out is super fast as you can do it from your room. The Bell boys were great, and the staff at the nugget was helpfull. One thing that I dont like but you see it in most places are the people trying to sell you a time share, buy giving you tickets or a cruise or whatever. there seem to be a lot of them here. If you want to hit the strip you can catch a $11.00 cab ride. Overall I liked it and at the prices you can get(air and hotel) it is by far and away one of the best deals in vegas. A lot for a liitle $ thats not even mentioning the new pool that is being worked on right now. when done it should be great. It features a slide through a shark tank!

The construction was not finished. We booked on Priceline and apparently got a Priceline room, in the distant South Tower with no view but a death-ray sun coming in the window in the morning. Parking is free. The staff was generally friendly. We rented a car and had no problem with the hotel's distance from the Strip, but it would be an issue if we were without transportation. It's located on Fremont Street, which is worth some strolling. There are also some fun low-limit games along Fremont although those casinos are a little warn, and sometimes downright ragged. The Nugget and some other casinos don't have low-limit games without imposing unacceptable rule changes, such as 6-5 blackjack payout. (If you have a car, you may want to see the new Red Rock Casino, about 20 minutes away ... it has low-limit games with good rules and is new, pretty and friendly.) The Fremont Street light show is mildly entertaining, but don't go out of your way just for that. The room was of good size and it was quiet. There was a safe and an iron and an extra luggage stand, which is always welcome. There was no coffee service (perhaps because of the Starbucks downstairs, and a second on the way). The Starbucks was a bit pricey, had a line and the coffee wasn't very good ... too weak one time, with a lot of grounds in the bottom a second. However, there's a McDonald's nearby in a Fremont Street casino, and no line. The shower water pressure was poor ... never more than a heavy dribble at various times of the mornings. Towels were cheap synthetic that were scratchy. The climate control was an air conditioner under the window, like a highway motel. The high-speed internet service cost $11.99 per day ... I can't imagine why they don't catch up with the Travel Lodges and Holiday Inn Expresses of the world with free internet, but then there's a saying: What money you bring to Vegas, stays in Vegas. Check-in was easy, although the clerk didn't want to take my credit card for incidentals, the first time that's happened. I assumed I'd just pay on checkout. But ... when I tried to make a local call, the phone wouldn't work until I gave them a credit card downstairs! Local calls were $1 for 30 minutes, sufficient for checking email. The television service was out for one night. There's a large, two-station ticket office downstairs, but it's only for tickets in the Golden Nugget. We didn't use the concierge. The cafe service was good, and food often came right out, because it apparently had been prepared en masse long before. Also, someone was checking for hotel keys at the elevator of our tower. I don't know if they were screening for hookers, thieves or people sneaking coffee pots into their rooms. If you can get a room at the Nugget for a really good price, it would be worth it. There were no horrors here, but it's not a hotel that is going to win your heart or impress you with considerate little details. You'll be tolerating a lot of niggly things as noted here, things that could be fixed which is why I refer to them as underachievers.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui HI", "Title": "\u201cConstruction & Promotions\u201d", "Author": "parpat", "ReviewID": "UR6012517", "Content": "Stayed for six days, construction all over the place.. though we never heard any noise (were were on the top floor though.. the new swiming pool will have a slide that goes through a giant aquarium .. still not done..

Since we usually stay on the Strip, we were looking forward to a new experience staying downtown. Check-in was fast and easy, and we were very pleased with our room.

We had a vacation package that included a $40.00 hotel credit and we saved it for the Sunday brunch that was very nice. We found many good dining options on Fremont St. Good $5.00 breakfast buffett at the California and also a good breakfast restaurant upstairs at the Vegas Club.

I was not informed at the desk when I paid that the jacuzzi was under construction and not available. I was diaspointed with many aspects of the spa. I should have taken a little tour before paying $20 to use it. It is very small, and only 2 lounge chairs to put your feet up for ladies to use. They were stingy with bottled water ( if you wanted one, you needed to pad out to one of the desks and ask for one and they were also warm) and the juice was just out there on the table warm with no ice to put in a glass for it. I very much enjoyed the sauna and the steam room, but outside these two rooms was one hook in which to hang your bathrobe. So the 7 ladies using these facilities had to pile as many robes as we could on the one available hook and the rest used the floor. There was the bare minimun of amenites for skin and hair care at the vanities. I cannot imagine the facility on a busier day......there would be no place to sit.

We had a view of the west and all the mountains, very pretty. The room was pretty clean and big for the price, which was nice. I wasn't particularly happy with the maid service though--we ran out of shampoo and were not given another bottle, and 3 nights she forgot to give us a new bath mat. Also, there was an unusual stench in the bathroom that wouldn't go away anytime we were there. I read an earlier review saying the same, so it must not be just me. They charge you $1 a minute to use the computer, which I believe should be complimentary to the guests. But if you're lucky and receive the coupon book, you get 10 free minutes. If you plan on using internet there, bring your laptop and use it in your room. It's $12 a day, but a much better deal than the $1 a minute. It's a good downtown location, but too far from the strip to walk there. We booked this thinking we could walk to the strip, being it was only a couple miles away. We were obviously wrong! Walking 2 miles to the strip sounds easier than done, being that it's very hot and being outside for a long time can really drain you. If you're looking to stay downtown, I really recommend renting a car. We took the Deuce one day, which was pure hell. The other days we had our car, which was much better. Rent a car if you can, much more freedom and less time consuming getting around. You'll be approached by people looking to sell you timeshares and such, almost everytime you walk through the hotel. Avoid them by nicely telling them \"I live here\" and they will keep their distance. The hotel is a much older crowd; you hardly see kids around it. My boyfriend and I are in our early and mid 20s, but we like nice, quiet places that don't have such a party scene with a younger crowd. So in that aspect, we really liked it since it wasn't ever loud. It is ok if you have kids, but I just don't think this hotel is very kid friendly. Especially since there isn't any pool. It's a nice hotel, but I don't think we'll be staying here again, being that it's too far from everywhere we wanted to go to on the Strip and off the Strip.

The room was a really good size, very clean; it had a big, comfortable bed, a good sized bath and a very powerful shower. We were in the South Tower which meant a little bit of walk when we wanted to go anywhere else in the hotel, but the peace and quiet and quality of the rooms more than compensated for this. Check in was fine - we arrived around 1600hrs and there were no queues. I think we were quite lucky though as on other days/times when walking past registration we noticed it was quite busy. But there always seemed to be lots of check in staff on duty. We used the fast check out facility through the TV so didn't have to contend with queues either at the end of our stay. We visited the breakfast buffet most mornings - and only on the last morning of our stay were we put off by the queues. And we found it to be very good value - lots of variety, good service for $8.99. We were on foot so getting to the strip was a bit of a concern. However the local bus service - the Duece - was good, frequent and cheap - $5 for a one day pass to take you up and down the strip. And the nearest stop is just a short walk from the hotel - one block further on from the end of Fremont Experience, on Las Vegas Blvd. It was our 30th wedding anniversary during our stay, so we decided to celebrate by going to the Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere. A high quality revolving restaurant over 100 floors up with incredible views over LV, it was a tremendous experience. The food and service was first class.

There were no problems with the Orbitz reservations. We got exactly what we booked (non-smoking, King). Valerie, at the front desk was so helpful, informative & kind. We did not feel like second class citizens because we booked on-line. Valerie even arranged for us to have a room just down the hall from our friends.

Upon check-in, we were upgraded to the North Tower which is very convenient to the front of the hotel entrance, check-in, valet. The South Tower is a bit of a walk, but not very far at all. This was our 3rd stay at the GN and we stayed in the South Tower on our 1st visit in March 2005 and our 2nd visit in November 2005. Our room in the North Tower overlooked the pool construction. The 1st night was peaceful. On our 2nd night, we heard construction noise, equipment, etc. most of the night. The next morning we asked to move to the other side of the North Tower and were given a new room with absolutely no problem. We are Private Arrangement members. This is the GN 'Frequent Stay' program where you earn points for your stays and then redeem them for future stays or take dollars off your bill upon check out. The pool area is under construction and we were advised of this when we made the reservation. There is an architect's model in the lobby of what the pool area will look like when finished. It looks like it will be great! Hopefully, GN will do some marketing offering good future room rates to those who stayed in July and August when the pool was under construction. There is also various, minor other construction projects going on inside, but we only saw it late, late at night / very early in the morning--never disruptive in the busier casino hours. We ate once at Carson Street Cafe inside GN for a quick dinner. We both had hot sandwiches. The food and service was great. We also ate once at the Buffet for breakfast on the morning we left and it too was fine for food and service. Bar service was great. These meals and one trip to the bar were basically free because of the $40 food credit that was part of the Summer Special ($40 credit was linked to room, so you had to charge the restaurants/bars to your room in order to properly receive the food credit). We used the business center once. The hours are a bit limited (9A- 3P). We were there around 2:45, checked our flights and printed a couple of pages. The employee was ready to leave and she told us she was shutting everything down. She wasn't horrible, just not as great as all the other employees we encountered. The guy at check-in reviewed the package we booked (how the coupons worked and how the food credit worked). The lady at check-out went over our bill completely and our Private Arrangement account. Housekeeping made up our room everyday. The valets are some of the hardest working guys. They were great. We called down several time and asked them to bring our car from the garage at a specific time and it was ready every time. Best tip money ever spent. I am not sure why people staying at the GN use the self-parking garage?!?! I cannot say enough good things about the Golden Nugget. While in Vegas this time we went to Lake Mead one day and did the cruise around the lake and hoped to rent a PWC but thunderstorms prevented that. We ate lunch one day at Commander's Palace ($18.80 Martini Lunch - Excellent!!). We rent a car every time - cheap and convenient. We prefer to stay downtown.

The Sports Book is also majorly shrunk down right now - hopefully it will reexpand after the renovation. The rooms are still very nice, and the bathrooms are the nicest downtown. The bathroom fan and the AC unit both seemed a little underpowered, leaving the room a little muggy after 4 people had showered. These rooms are a cut above standard Strip fare (Trop, Flamingo, Harrah's, Strat). The Nugget no longer compares with the top places in town - Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian, etc., - but it is far more affordable. The gambling is more Strip-like than downtown-like - meaning many $10 minimum tables and very few $5. There is a lot more high roller/black action here than anywhere else downtown. The drink service is pretty good. The atmosphere is nice but not over the top like the big Strippies. Parking is fairly easy, and free for hotel guests - nothing like that super-long walk from a mega-parking structure on the Strip.

Purpose: Visit after 5 years to see what has changed. Picked the Golden Nugget because of some of the positive reviews, and wanted to see what was there. It was a BUDGET trip to explore changes, so the $40 food credit was great. (Does not apply to gratuity.) Arrived late Monday night, check-in (North tower location only. South tower was closed.) was fast, though counter did not ask smoking preference. I was assigned a room in the South tower. Room was good size, and comfortable. The walk was long, but it is a great way to work off the food. Construction was located on the west side of the North Tower. Throughout my stay, I did not hear any construction noises. (Not quite sure whether pool will be opened by end of summer based on what I saw!) Overall, the place looked nice and classy. No one tried to sell me anything. Staff encountered were all pleasant. Restaurants: Only visited the lunch buffet and the Carson Street cafe. Food was good, but not spectacular. Service was a little slow during late night/early morning in the cafe. Bread pudding is a must try in the buffet. Travel: If you plan to use the Deuce (double decker bus) to travel to the strip area, be aware that the published schedules were not followed well at all. It would be fine except the temperature was in the 110s during the days. Bring liquids with you. Cool bus though, and you can see a lot from the upper deck. Entertainment: Found a same day half price ticket booth (service fee applies.) at the 4 Queens one block east. Good variety of shows. Location opens about 11 a.m., and will display the available discounted shows. Decided on the Beatles tribute at the Aladdin, and the Elvis tribuite at the Fitzgerald. Both were excellent, though the Fitz had a more personal environment. Fremont experience was okay. Street entertainment was actually very good with both the Sax (near the middle of the Fremont expereince), and the piano (West end). Strip: Things have changed. The mega hotels were really spectacular, but every place seemed extremely commercial. You cannot walk anywhere without feeling someone pressuring you to buy something. Things have also goten expensive. There are also many desolate areas when you travel between the Downtown and the Strip. Extremes in contrast. FREE internet (?): Hotel charges about $12 oer day. Walk two blocks east to the Krispy Kreme donut at the Fitzgerald, buy a donut, and surf for free. Donut quality is great, but coffee is subpar unfortunately. If you cannot link or connect to the internet, have the counter reset the router. It is a 11 mbps DLink router, and it is a little subpar performance- and reliability-wise. Not many know about it however (No one else was using while I was there.) so Happy Surfing! (If you are looking for free internet connections, visit [--]) Airport: Allow extra time on your return.

This was my first trip to Las Vegas in about 10 years so I didn't really know what it was like now. The \"Freemont Experience\" and the Nugget I booked a room at the Golden Nugger because of reviews on this site and the price ( I'm kind of a value conscience consumer ). It looked like a good value but I never visited downtown and was apprehensive about staying there. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I was prepared for the atmosphere by reading the posts here so I was not really surprised by the kind of age of the places down there. I never felt unsafe at any time and really enjoyed the gambling and atmoshere at the Nugget, Fremont and 4 Queens. The \"Fremont Experiences\" is more than just watching the light show , which I admit was kind of disappointing. The Nugget was a great place to stay in my opinion. Since I had a rental car, transportation was not a problem but I can see it could be without one. I had room 1876 which was an East facing room in the South Tower. The only negative was the AC was loud ( which I shut off at night ) and there was some road noise from cabs which seem to queue up on the street below at night.The buffet was OK but not great. The room came with a $40 meal credit so I ate Breakfast and one Dinner there. I think the buffet at the TI and Bellagio were much better but also much more expensive. For the money, it was a good deal. All in all, I would have no problem returning to the Nugget for my next stay. BTW, don't worry about the contruction. I never would have known it was going on if they didn't have the portholes to see the progress. Gambling I really only play blackjack so I can't comment on the other games. I enjoyed playing at the 4 queens as all tables are 3-2 with $5 - $25 dollar and some single deck tables. Freemont was good too, I played there several times. The Nugget though was mostly 6-5 and usually had higher limit games $10 and up. It was hard to find a $10 table on the stip and never saw a 3-2 game ( didn't look real hard though , not saying they are not there just hard to find ). I have a hard time sitting down to play blackjack at the Bellagio with $25 minimum multdeck shoe and 6-5 payoff when I know I could go the 4 Queens and do a lot better. That's just me though. The Strip Wow. Lots of walking but some really nice places. Visited TI, Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn and was really impressed. It's something I think you really have to see but, it's very crowded and expensive. It's kind of like the saying, \"It's a nice place to visit, but I'm glad I don't live there.\" Shows I really didn't come to Vegas looking for the shows but I was again pleasantly surprised. I saw Mystere and Blue Man Group and was blown away. They are not cheap ($60 - $150 ) but they were great particularly the Blue man group. There are several outlets called Tix4Tonight around town, one at the 4 Queens downtown that sell show tickets at very good prices. The selection may not always be there but you should be able to find something. Overall Lots of walking especially on the Strip, not so much downtown. Good Buffets. Downtown's got good gambling and values. Strips got good sightseeing and crowds for those that like that sort of thing. Nugget is a good value. See some shows!

We were told that all they had left were smoking rooms, and with a group of 8 people, thought that might be a problem. We were pleasantly surprised. One couple did switch rooms, but it was only because they wanted a better view (they were on 2nd floor). Our room was on the 16th floor in the North tower, with a decent view of the Plaza, although there was construction of the new pool going on below. We never had a problem with noise from other rooms, the hallway, or the construction. Our room was huge! The bed was comfortable, and we were happy to find an extra pillow in the closet, along with an ironing board, iron, blow dryer, and safe. The carpet, upholstery, and bedding were all in good shape, and despite the fact that it was a smoking room, did not smell of smoke, so we opted to stay put. It would have been nice if the room also had a refrigerator and/or coffee maker, but for what we paid, we couldn't possibly complain! There was a Starbucks in the Casino, so we were set. Everyone we encountered: from the front desk personnel, to the shop clerks, the housekeepers, the casino attendants, to the waitresses in the restaurants - everyone was very friendly and helpful, and seemed eager to please. Special thanks to Betty in the Carson Street Cafe - that woman knows customer service! We never had to ask for anything, she was always one step ahead of us. If you go there, get the hot turkey sandwich, it's fabulous! And ask for Betty! The casino and hotel were very clean, and we were impressed with the attention to detail. Despite the construction going on, (which we barely noticed), everything just gleamed. We had rented 2 vehicles (and got a free upgrade at Thrifty to an SUV because we got there so late, and they only had 1 full-size vehicle left!), and it was easy to park the vehicles, drive to the strip, etc. Parking was free for hotel guests, and pretty convenient. We felt very safe downtown, and didn't worry about the vehicles the whole time we were there. We were all very happy with our decision to stay at the Golden Nugget, and will definitely be back! On a sidenote, if you get the chance, go to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam! We rented a boat at marina in Hemenway Harbor for 2 hours, and had the best time. The water is crystal clear, and the view is magnificent. We went home with some great pictures. That was probably the high point of our trip!

But I still want to warn you if you are sensitive to noise, you want to tell the front desk about the noise concern. Ask them to put your room away from the construction side of building. Oh, the pool is also under construction, so if you must splash into cool water after a hot day, you may want to choose other hotels. I book the room directly on the Golden Nugget website and with their special promotion rate, we get great rate (average $65 a day) with $40 food credit.

This time, with the Landry's purchase, I noticed a definite difference in the amount of staff visible and I also had issues I had never run into before at this property. Construction-We stayed in the North Tower, but the construction really wasn't disturbing us except at 6:30 AM when the equipment started up. It's construction, it is what it is. Staff-No doorman on our arrival at 6:00 PM. The usual daytime doorman was there at the south entrance on other days, but apparently this is the only door staff they have kept on. He is a gem-always knows what's going on, who needs to go where, etc. If they take him away, I will really be disappointed. Anyway, on arrival, we were told there were no double bed smoking rooms in either tower, only 1 king smoking or double beds/no smoking. When I stated that wasn't acceptable, the desk person magically came up with a double bed smoking room in the North Tower and wanted to charge us an extra $25.00 a night for it. I said no, this charge was taken off and we got that room for the price we originally paid. Housekeeping--on past visits, the housekeeping staff was very generous with matches, shampoo, soap, etc. This is a small thing, but I noticed that every day we got exactly 2 books of matches and nothing else. I don't dine at the Nugget since there are many other reasonable places to go with better food, so I don't have much to say about it. They are hiding the construction well, so I really wouldn't say that the hotel or the casino are torn up. The pool was closed for construction, but I expected that so I wasn't disappointed. I am in the process of planning another trip to Vegas later in the year and I think that until the new tower is open, I'm going to stay away from the Nugget....it wasn't a horrible visit, but it was different than my previous stays, which were all great.", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baytown, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPrevious favorite, now may not return...\u201d", "Author": "sbowen0823", "ReviewID": "UR5068521", "Content": "I have only stayed at the Nugget once before, and my mom has stayed every year for the past 5 years or so.

We will probablly not return, as my mom, who is a perferred member, may not return as well. Front Desk - To being with, the South Tower Registration desk was closed, so we had to wait in line about 30 minutes to check in at the main registration desk.The staff at the front desk was friendly - however, after asking for rooms on the same floor, but NOT next door to each other...we recieved rooms next door to each other. Spa Staff -Upon getting to our rooms the guys headed out to gamble and the two girls inquired about getting a pedicure at the spa. Being a Sunday late afternoon we didnt think they would be too busy. After calling 2 times in a row, and sitting on hold for about 10 minutes each time, without anyone answering, I called the operator for assistance. She rang the spa on the same number and on a different number but could not get anyone to answer either. She told us to go up to the Spa and that we should be ok to get an appointment being that we were hotel guest and would be a priority. Once we arrived at the Spa, the girl was on the phone and had us stand waiting for another 5-10 minutes. Once she finally got of the phone, she took another call and after a few minutes put her PERSONAL call on hold....and THEN addressed us. We asked if there were any appointments or openings for walk-ins availble for pedicures and she gave us a sharp and rude no. I asked \"even for hotel guest?\" and again got the same rude no and went back to the phone call. At this we turned to leave. Housekeeping - Once back at the room, we orded 4 drinks through room service and these arrived fine. However - the tray that they arrived on was still in the hallway 2 days later when we checked out. Along with my empty glasses on the table, which also sat there for two days. Housekeeping came and made the bed, but that was about it. We had to ask for more toilet paper the next day as well, again, after housekeeping came. They did not replace the soap or shampoo and conditioner either.

We did rent a car, which was very convenient as all of the hotels on the strip have free valet or self-parking in their garages. We still did walk a lot as we would just park at one hotels and walk to all of the others. We also drove down to Hoover Dam and took the tour which was interesting and only a 1/2 hour to 45 mins away from Vegas. As far as food, we at the Carson Street Cafe at the hotel once and it was ok. My husband asked for his steak cooked medium and it came back rare. We sent it back and it came back well-done. The server told us that they don't know what medium is and you'll either get it rare or well-done...maybe eating at 1:00 in the morning had something to do with it? I think that his ribeye steak, eggs, hashbrowns and toast was only $7.99--a special from 12-5am. We also had the lunch buffet which was $7.99 as well and had good food for the price. They even left some breakfast foods out for those of us who slept in and missed breakfast. We did go to Bellagio for the lunch buffet and it was PHENOMINAL, of course it was a lot more expensive ($19.99pp, I think) but it was worth every penny. If you stay at GN, don't forget to check out the downtown area. We didn't notice all of the shops and restaurants until the morning that we were leaving as I went to go search for another casino to check out. The laser light show is connected to the hotel, but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to see it.

It is classy but not snobby. When and why we stayed: We stayed at Golden Nugget for 3 nights in April 2006, during a holiday in the United States. Cost: $69 a night plus taxes. We booked with the hotel direct, via their website. The Room: We stayed in Room 1584 in the South Tower. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, with a huge king-sized bed and a view of the mountains. We were very impressed with the service. One evening our toilet started overflowing. I called room service \u2013 within minutes a plumber and an army of housekeepers appeared to fix the fault and clean up. The Hotel: The Golden Nugget Laughlin is a casino. It is elegant and stylish, decorated with chandeliers and mirrors. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. We ate in two of the hotel\u2019s restaurants: twice at the Carson Street Caf\u00e9, which serves well-cooked and reasonably priced (by UK standards) food. The service could have been better. We ate breakfast at The Buffet. It may not be fancy like Bellagio\u2019s or Wynn\u2019s, but is cosy, cheap ($6.99 for breakfast), with typical buffet breakfast fare to fill empty stomachs. Don\u2019t miss the buffet\u2019s speciality bread and butter pudding \u2013 creamy and delicious \u2013 cooked to Steve Wynn\u2019s (a previous owner) Mum\u2019s own recipe. The service is attentive and friendly. There is also an open 24-hours Starbucks \u2013 its patio makes a great place to chill out, take a caffeine-fix, and watch the amazing Fremont Street Experience light show. The casino set the prices \u2013 they are noticeably higher than in Starbucks elsewhere. The 24 Karat (slot) club was offering a $10 free play offer for new members, so we joined, despite our British scepticism that if something is too good to be true then it probably is. We were wrong - this was a genuine offer. The 24 Karat club gave same-day cash back and we played (and lost) enough during our 3 days stay to be comped two buffet breakfasts. Location: On Fremont Street, in Downtown (old) Las Vegas. I think Downtown Vegas is vastly under-rated. Along with gambling, it offers history, entertainment, shopping and excellent restaurants. For somewhere special - eat at the Center Stage in the Plaza \u2013 reasonably-priced gourmet food and service in a romantic setting with spectacular views of Downtown\u2019s neon and the Fremont Street Experience. A pianist playing standards serenades you. The strip is a short drive or bus ride away. The city: Las Vegas is the greatest city on earth.

Yes, we got put in the south tower, last room on the floor... but it was very quiet! Maid service was great.. make sure you leave a tip! Room was exactly what I expected it to be. Nice, clean, no complaints! We wanted to head out for the casino to check out the action. We're not big gamblers, but had a budget for each day, and was chomping at the bit to use it. First headed off to sign up for the 24 Karat Club, and get our playing cards. Did that at other casinos downtown, because I knew we wouldn't gamble just at the Golden Nugget. Played a few slots, headed off to Fitzgeralds, where I had already signed up online for their players card. Nice... took only a few minutes, and off to hit the slots. Remarkably, we played quite a bit (as entertainment, mind you, knowing we would eventually lose)but still have fun in the mean time. Stayed 'up' for the first 2 days, gambling on our winnings. The only games we played at Golden Nugget were penny machines, where we could play for hours and not lose over 40.00. The buffet at the GN was pretty decent. I liked the variety, and never walked away hungry. We managed to eat only two meals a day, and saved a bundle on our food budget. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try other places out, but we were very satisfied with the buffet there. We did try out the Carson St. Cafe one night, and the portions are big, very satisfying. Service is okay. Drink service is good when playing slots. Make sure you tip... they remember you and your drink! : ) For all you Video Poker Players out there, Golden Nugget has mostly 8/5, so I didn't play them, but there sure were alot of other players on them! I went down to Fitzgeralds to play there, and eventually into 4 Queens, where I won $400.00 on slots very easily! We ended up going to Laughlin, NV and the Grand Canyon in-between our stay at Golden Nugget, but had to return to Vegas to fly back home. While waiting for our flight to leave later that day, we went back downtown for about 5 hours, and hit the same spots to see what our luck would be. The 4 Queens was kind to me again with a 272.00 payout on slots, but I quickly burned that away at Golden Nugget. All in all, our stay there was great.

Unfortunately, the view was hindered by the construction going on directly below. Construction started at 8:00 am every morning, but not your usual construction. Heavy machines making pulsating jackhammer-ish sounds constantly for hours on end; therefore, sleeping in was not an option. Every night/morning I dreamed that the housekeeper was knocking on the door, but then I awoke to the construction sounds. I can only compare this sound to the \"Chinese water torture\"- constant and slowly drove me crazy. I expected more from this hotel-more gaming machines, more room and more clean air. I think because the hotel is under construction that the actual gaming facility was reconfigured and \"schrunched.\" I thought there would be more modern slot machines, but only a handful were to be found. The casino contained more older three reel machines than I have ever seen at another casino. Rarely were people playing those machines. The air quality in the casino would be an issue for non smokers (as I am). I am concerned that the GN casino's ventilation system is not up to par. There was a constant haze of smoke hovering around the casino, especially in the evening. The smoke just lingered in the room. My eyes often teared up and watered, I would often sneeze and cough while in the casino; however, if I went to a nearby casino (Fremont, Binions or Fritzgerald's), I did not have this problem. Once again, it may be because of construction. The hotel did not have a pool or spa/salon open during construction, which was a bit of a disappointment. I thought that maybe the hotel would offer guests the option of accessing another hotel's pool/poolside, but they did not. I spent more time at neighboring casinos and won a small amount.

I went with two friends for a vacation. We are all in our mid twenties and have been doing a lot of research to find good deals on places to stay, eat, and play in Las Vegas. Although many people have recommended for us to stay on the strip, we liked the low minimums and cheap eats that the downtown had to offer. We did rent a car and visited the strip everyday. We decided to stay at the nicest hotel downtown...the Golden Nugget. I read some great reviews and poor ones as well, but we tried our luck at this hotel. I found a great deal on Priceline for $60 a night ($17 a day for a full-size rental car with unlimited milage as well!). The check in lines were all bunched together and it seemed unorganized. After checking in, we had to call back down to get another room because our non-smoking room was stinking of smoke. Finally, we settled in to our room. It was very average. The beds were small and nothing like the 2 queen beds that were promised. I expected more from a 4 star hotel. We also made a reservation with the front desk (as recommended at check in) to get the airport shuttle so we could pick up our rental car the next day. The shuttle never came (we waited 45 minutes). After asking the front desk about it, they said there was nothing they could do because it's a separate company. Why offer a service then? I could have just called myself and made a reservation. The pool and fitness center was being renovated so we couldn't use either of them. After asking about an alternative location to work out in, they said they couldn't do anything for us. Overall, I felt that the Golden Nugget didn't offer very much and didn't try to accomodate us. The casino dealers were not very nice either which was surprising for the many donations we made to the casino! I was even charged 40 cents for a cup of water at the Starbucks inside! I didn't like the lay out of the casino either. I can't put my finger on it, but my friends and I thought it was very odd. We're use to going to the Tropicana in Atlantic City, NJ (which is only a 3 star hotel) and the Tropicana blew them out of the water with amenities and services. The only thing I did enjoy was their $5.99 breakfast buffet which offered many healthy choices and was very good. We enjoyed the downtown scene and liked that we could walk to a variety of casinos within 5 minutes. The minimums were very low ($1 at some tables) and we had fun trying out the different drinks. Mermaids sell frozen drinks for a dollar, but they sell out of cups quickly (before 6pm) so try to get them early. The Four Queens sell a 52 ounce football for $6 which made us all feel better about our losses. The 99 cent shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate was surprisingly good was one of our favorite night time spots. On the next visit to Las Vegas, I will definitly stay at a strip casino. They are beautiful. There is free valet parking at every strip casino and each one we parked out was quick and polite. The strip casinos don't seem as smokey and there are more to see and do. The Golden Nugget did not impress me at all and I probably will never stay there again.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverdale, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest in Downtown - But not the Strip Experience\u201d", "Author": "JQuatt21", "ReviewID": "UR4691560", "Content": "I had just recently stayed 5 days and 4 nights at the Golden Nuggett in downtown Las Vegas. The purpose of this trip was to attend a training conference for my business. This was my first real trip to Las Vegas (my first strip was when I was a child) and did not know what to expect. Here is what I think about the Golden Nuggett. Rooms: For Value, The Golden Nuggett is the best in downtown Las Vegas. If you dont want to spend $200 and above for a room like you will at some strip Casino's but stay in a nice hotel; the Golden Nuggett is the place for you. The room was clean and had everything like soap, shampoo, lotion etc. It also had an ironing board, iron, safe, high speed internet access ($12 a day)and in house movies. The room also had a safe so if you wanted to place some of your valuables in the safe, you could. The room in which I stayed in was a standard King Room. The bed and pillows were nice and comfortable. ( I was in the South Tower - 22nd top floor) There are no balconies at the Golden Nuggett and I did not have much of a view. (View of one of the Plaza Hotel Towers and the parking garage below) The room did not smell and was extremely quiet which was nice when I wanted to sleep. Casino: The Casino at the Golden Nuggett is small but the cleanest and classiest of all the Downtown Casino's. You can tell a difference when you enter any other casino downtown and you enter the Golden Nuggett Casino. It is probably the busiest downtown but the tighest with slot payouts. If you want loose slot payouts, try Fitzgeralds down Freemont Street. They have many 5 dollar tables during the week but once thursday came along, $10 minimums were the norm. Try any other Casino's downtown for constant $5 dollar and less hands. They have a small high limit area that was usually empty along with a small high limit slot area. If you are a true high limit player, this is not the casino for you in the fact that they have few high limit machines to choose from. If you are a nickle and penny player, I did not see many nickle machines and not one penny machine. Mostly .25 cent and dollar and up machines. Try Fiztgeralds, 4 queens, binions, or golden gate for smaller machines. Finally, their slot club \"the 24 karat club\" currently at this time gives you when u sign up $10 in free slot play. You then accumulate points towards merchandise and other comps so they say. I played mostly at the Golden Nugget and played max credits on .25 and $1.00 machines all week at hours at a time. In 5 days, I earned about 650 points which I though was good. I asked and was told that I needed 1500 points for a meal comp and $15 slot play. Also, if you dont play over $25 a hand on the tables, you dont get rated. (it states it on the back of the card) The slot club is not worth it unless you visit yearly. Food: Most of the restaraunts are closed at this time due to renovations. There are three open at this time which are \"Carsons Street Cafe, The Buffett, and Vic and Anthony's.\" Carsons Street cafe has a little of everything and allows you to play Keno while you dine. Its a relaxed atmosphere with decent service. prices are ok and the restaraunt is open 24 hours. The Buffett has decent food. It is prob the best buffet on the strip by quality of food, atmosphere, and service. It is the most expensive buffet (14 dollars for dinner and about 8 for breakfast) but food quality is the best. Vic and Anthony's is the Golden Nuggett's version of a fancy strip type restaraunt. I did not get a chance to eat there but people say the food is pretty good but there is better value on the strip and better views on the strip. Finally, there is a small snack bar and starbucks located by the front entrance to freemont street. Service: The one thing about the Golden Nuggett that stands out is the service. Everyone from the bellman who picked up my luggage to the front desk, operators, and bar tenders; everyone was excellent. Even one morning, I called for a wakeup call and woke up ahead of schedule. i had forgotten to call and cancel. I then hear a p.a. announcement for me on the loud speaker. I call the operator and she just wanted to track me down to make sure I was ok because they didnt get a hold of me. I though that was excellent. I had no trouble checking in during the day and when I went to check out, they allowed me to use the VIP checkout because the front desk was extremely busy. (start of NCAA Tournament - Everyone was checking in) I thought that was excellent. Getting to/from McCarran & The Strip: If you take a cab from McCarran Int'l Airport, plan on paying about 25 to 30 bucks with tip to get to the Nuggett. It dosent matter if they take the highway or the side streets, its all the same money. If you can afford it, its the fastest way. If you want, you can take a shuttle service that you can book online from an indepent company. If you want to go to the Strip, you will pay a hefty amount each way. Its about 20 buck each way from the Golden Nuggett to The Venetian for an example. If you want to save some money and have the time to spend, you can take the Bus which is called the \"Duce\". For 5 bucks, you can buy a 24 hour pass which you can ride as much as you want for 24 hours. You can pickup the bus at the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Freemont. The Bus makes many stops and takes about 1/2 hour to get from the Nuggett to the Stardust for an example. Meeting Rooms: The Convention Center and Meeting Rooms were very cozy and can accomodate many different types of groups. Our group had about 212 people and it was perfect. Nice place for small meetings and groups. The pool, spa, and fitness center were all closed at the time. All in all, if you are looking for the Vegas that everyone knows, the Nuggett is not the place! This place saw an older crowd and dont recommend it for younger people. It is better in the fact that the table limits are cheaper and room prices are cheaper but if you are looking for the strip experience every minute of the day, dont stay downtown.

Although the changes are just beginning, I think the Landry Corporation is going in the wrong direction. The first problem we encountered was that both Lillie Langtree\u2019s and Stefano\u2019s have been closed, yet last week both were still listed on the Nugget\u2019s web-site. That leaves only Vic and Anthony\u2019s as a dinner house choice. While I\u2019m sure that Vic and Anthony\u2019s is a great restaurant, their menu is a little pricey for Downtown, similar to those of Morton\u2019s Steakhouse. There were 9 people in our party and we all noticed that it appears there have been some cuts in staffing. There was no security at the South Tower elevators after 10 PM and considering the neighborhood, that was surprising. The staffing problem was also evident at the Carson Street Caf\u00e9 on Saturday morning. There was a long line for seating which extended down the corridor, yet when we were seated at least one-third of the tables were empty. We asked why and were told that were no servers for those stations. It was also next to impossible to find a cocktail waitress in the Casino all three nights we were there. I talked to some employees that I have known through staying at the Nugget four or five times a year, and the plans for the Nugget are surprising for a downtown hotel. They are adding some Designer Boutique stores, an large aquarium with a seafood restaurant, and a grotto type swimming pool with a waterfall. I\u2019m sure the hotel will be lovely when all the renovations are complete, and I am equally sure that the cost of the renovations will be reflected in the prices. I do hope the Landry Corporation understands that no amount of renovation will attract the people who prefer the strip to a downtown hotel, no matter how elegant.

I thought that staff was friendly and I liked how there were vending machines on each floor. The cost for the tables were reasonable during the day. At night they went up to $25.00. I think that is a bit high for this hotel considering it is in downtown and not on The Strip. We ended up gambling at other locations down the street which only had $5.00 black jack tables. The biggest problem about staying down town is trying to find a good place to eat. There is a couple of restaurants at the Golden Nugget but outside of the hotel there is not much to eat. We managed to find a McDonalds after walking around and also a Tony Romas. If you want to just gamble and not do to much else, than I recommend staying here. If you want to see a lot and be entertained, I recommend \"The Strip\" area. Downtown is about $20.00 -$30.00 from The Strip by Taxi. Also, check out some hotel called The California in this area. Tons of people from Hawaii stay there. I didn't know about it, but maybe it is nicer than The Golden Nugget. If you do stay at The Golden Nugget, make sure you see the largest found \"Golden Nugget\" which is on display near the spa tower.

The pool is closed and the spa is closed. We would not have come to Las Vegas had we known this, and when we complained, the offer of compensation was $20 off our room rate. So silly - considering our room was comped anyway. A real insult. Management was firm and unyielding. Without the spa and pool, the Golden Nugget is just an expensive downtown hotel room. If we just wanted a room, Binion's has them for $39. We were sadly disappointed at the poor planning (taking reservations without telling the potential guest that amenities were out of order) and even more troubled by the \"Joe's Crab Shack\" mentality toward resolving the issue. We will give the Nugget another chance - ONE more chance. Landry's has yet to learn the fragility and importance of loyalty when it comes to Vegas regulars.

The only 4 star hotel for 29 years running. If you have never been to Las Vegas before or are under the age of 35, you are probably better off staying on the Las Vegas Strip. Downtown is quieter and more for the 35 + crowd. Downtown hotels offer buffets for $5.00 - $6.00 cheaper than their strip counterparts. The Golden Nugget, Freemont Hotel and Mainstreet Station hotel offered cheaply priced buffets and we found them to be very tasty. Binions offers a $4.99 12oz steak special in their downstairs restaurant which was also very good.

My client had recommended it and frankly I was skeptical -- I'm more of a Bellagio kind of guy. However, I was surprised at how nice the hotel was. It's undergoing a nearly finished renovation and it simply sparkles! It has sort of a 50s chic thing going -- elaborate, glittery, over-the-top. The public areas are clean and polished and very appealing -- if you like the older style. For the price, The Golden Nugget is hard to beat! My room was in the south tower, which is a distance from the casino and restaurants. Not a big deal, but it could be a bother if you have problems getting around or make frequent trips to your room. The d\u00e9cor was nicely done with new paint, wallpaper, carpet, and furnishings. I had a problem with the TV when I arrived, but that was promptly repaired. The only negative regarding the room was the old-fashioned air conditioner/heater, one of those units mounted inside the room under the window -- it was loud, so I had to sleep with it turned off. But the room was otherwise quiet and the bed comfortable. Nice bathroom, too. Good high-speed Internet access, but at a price of $12 per day. But like most Vegas restaurants, no coffee in the room -- that sucks! Also, the hotel is a long way from the Strip, so if your going to Vegas to see the Bellagio, the Wynn, and all the other truly wonderful places on the Strip, you probably won't be happy here. But if you're coming to gamble, to relax, and to see a bit of OLD Vegas, this place is great! A couple of observations: Compared to the high-end hotels on the Strip, this place is Sun City. I estimate that the average age of the patrons during my stay was over 70 years old. That makes it easy to get in the restaurants -- most oldsters seem to prefer the buffet or the inexpensive coffee shop or one of the cheaper eateries in the nearby hotels. But the odd thing, at least to me, was how busy the casino was -- much more action than in the Strip hotels where I usual stay. The first night I ate in the new streak restaurant, Vic & Anthony's, which had been open only 2 weeks. I travel all over the U.S. on business and pleasure, and I don't deny myself nice meals in good restaurants. I thought this place was incredible! It's one of the most sensuous eateries I've seen in a long, long time. Dark, moody, great art deco surroundings, excellent service, great food, but expensive even by L.A. standards. The second night I ate at the Italian place in the hotel, Stefano's, supposedly named for Steve Wynn, the big-deal Vegas hotel developer who owns or once owned the Golden Nugget. Just OK. D\u00e9cor was like something out of Disneyland -- a silly, over-the-top version of Italy. Waiters were not Italian and were dressed in cartoonist Italian waiter costumes -- but at least they didn't sing (they are supposed to be singing waiters, per the advertisements for the place). Didn't work for me. I ordered the osso buco, which believe it or not was so tough I sent it back. It was also only luke warm. The replacement was only slightly better. It came on a bed of what was supposed to be risotto Milanese, but it was cooked to the point that the rice was just mush, and it tasted predominately like the sauce in which the meat was cooked. Dessert was tiramisu, which was good but too sweet and not very Italian. So, skip this place. If you want good Italian food, drive to Henderson and go to Gaetano's.", "Date": "January 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "Title": "\u201cThe New Golden Nugget (Almost)\u201d", "Author": "capitol5555_8", "ReviewID": "UR4325483", "Content": "I have stayed at the GN various times for over 20 years.

Nice thing about staying downtown, is that you are very close to other casinos, of which I had better luck. We visited the strip one day, and what a traffic mess! Tons of families dressed like slobs trudging thru the hotels and casinos. Visited Wynn's new venture, nice, like the Bellagio, buy very very expensive. Self parking is very convenient. We visited the high end shops, no price tags on the merchandise! Guess the clerks guess what you can afford to pay for their goods. We will never stay on the strip due to the crowds and traffic.

We did not receive the $10.00 in free slot play. We were told that you have to join the Nugget Club first and earn 1500 points first before you are rewarded.The coupon book was based on \"4 people sharing\" eg: $10.00 off breakfast in the book = $2.50 off each person in a party of 4 spending more than $10.00 each. There was a 2 for 1 @ the buffet. We went to the G.N.dinner buffet @ $12.99 per person and both of us ate for $12.99 plus tip. The buffet was average and had a good variety of choice. We each made ourselves a great salad plate and enjoyed the roasted turkey breast on the side. Just that would have cost us $12-$15.00 ea. had we gone to a regular restaurant for a chicken ceasar salad. We knew Vegas was expensive for eating and so we just watched for specials. Best one was at JJ's in Paris Hotel. Turkey wrap with soup and a cup of coffee was $6.50. Buy an extra cup of coffee and split the \"large\" bowl of soup and the wrap and you have lunch for two.

(read my comments on that please!) Day 2, we left the room around noon to go shopping and arrived back at 6 pm. to find the room not made up. I called housekeeping and explained. They said, someone would be right up. I asked if they could do it between 8 and 11 pm. as we would be out at a show. They said, \"No problem!\" We returned at 1 am. to find the room not made up. \"Another call to housekeeping!\" \"They said, within the hour they would be up.\" Great at this hour of the night! I then asked them to just bring dry towels and I re-made the bed myself. It was a bit disappointing.

The water pressure was great (as this tends to be an issue in most las vegas hotels). Our only complaint was that the cable kept coming and going because (I think) the wires in the back of the TV were lose or torn. The other issue is that it is NOT on the strip. It is on a section called Fremonte Street which is on the most northern end of the strip. There is a city bus that will take you up and down the strip for $5 a day. Its well worth it. The only problem is that it stops soooooo much, it will take you an hour to get to the south end of the strip on that bus. Taxi? Well the taxi cost $30 from the air port, so you can imagine how that can add up if you take a taxi when going down to the strip. I think a good option would be mandelay bay because it is very close to the air port and is on the strip. All the hotels are beautiful, venetian and cesaers being the nicest (not that I would pay it). Treasure Island was a surprisingly nice hotel, though the pictures dont show it.

The bathroom was beautiful, nice amenities, plush towels and a large lighted make up mirror in the sitting area outside the bath. The lobby and halls were well kept and the friendly maids did a great job keeping everything clean. The Caf\u00e9 serves reasonably priced meals and the line moves fast due to a friendly well-trained staff. You can give them your name and they will call you in turn if you do not want to stand in the line. We ate there three times for breakfast and once for lunch for under $20.00 and the food was very good. We loved Fremont Street, no one clicks cards at you every few yards and the Veterans Day events were outstanding. Walking is limited and the more relaxed low-key fun atmosphere was a nice break from the strip. We met our friends from California there for the weekend and they had a room with a beautiful view looking right up the strip. Dinner at Lillie Lang try\u2019s was enjoyed by all the food was very good and the service was excellent, our waiter suggested that we add two house rice dishes to our order when we received the bill at $7.00 each I'd avoid this when we go back. The casino was great, full of people having a good time. The free show in the lounge had people clapping and dancing. I took advantage of the free 10:30am Pai Gow Poker lesson from Dave and had a ball playing the game. When we took the cab from the Strip my wife noticed the Vegas Premium Outlet Mall off of 15 and it was one of the first places we went on Friday afternoon. It would be a five-dollar cab ride but our friends drove so we went over. The girls had a ball shopping but four hours of this was enough for me. Overall Fremont Street was great fun the Golden Nugget is a super hotel at a reasonable price and we plan to return on our next trip to Vegas for another Strip sandwich.

The Nugget is a almost-Strip quality hotel in the middle of downtown. The hotel was clean, attractive, right on Fremont Street, and - best of all - $59 a night! First, the room. The room is an average hotel room, but nice, spacious, and clean. The bed is average - too firm for our tastes, but might not be a problem for most people. The cleanliness was the most important thing. The room looked and smelled clean. Our room was in the South Tower which is more of a walk from the casino, but really not that far to be a big deal. Valet parking (in the mode of Strip hotels) is free. It was also quick and easy. (Tip: The entrance to the valet is on Casino Center Drive.) We didn't eat in the Nugget so can't comment on the restaurants. However, we've heard from many that the buffet is second only to Main Street Station downtown. Then there is the casino - fantastic! Wonderful, friendly dealers. Clean air (especially compared to other downtown casinos which were downright hazy). And a fun fun crowd. Also lots and lots of low limit tables. We had a great time gambling at the Nugget. We were up on our play here and the environment was a major factor. The one downside was signing up for the slot club card. There were two people working the desk and the line moved very slowly. Signing up in advance made no difference as apparently they couldn't find our info in the computer. This was the only negative of our stay. Downtown is something definitely to be experienced. It is tacky and gaudy and just plain FUN. It's Vegas the way Vegas used to be. The Nugget is a great way to experience it. Also - cheap deals are just about always available here.

From the time we arrived there until the time we left we absolutely loved every single minute in Vegas! Checkin at the hotel took about 5 minutes and we received the room we originally requesed with a king bed/non-smoking. The room was exceptionally clean and large! The colors were nice and rich and the bathroom was done in all brown and creams colors with lots of marble. I am very finicky about hotel rooms and this was gorgeous (and the rates were cheap). We never heard any noise from the hallway or neighbors. That was nice because we often slept late into the morning after being up very late. The main restaurant serves great food - did not have a chance to check out the buffet though. A great buffet downtown is the Main Street Station - excellent food and very nice staff. Best breakfast is downstairs at Binnions across the street. See Steve Connelly (the Elvis impersonator) at Fitzgeralds. He is amazing and totally looks, acts and sings like Elvis. Also another good show (if you like the \"old\" Las Vegas) is The Rat Pack Tribute at the Greek Isles Hotel just off the strip by the Stardust. We love that era of music and we were so happy we went. They let you take still pictures of the whole show so I was able to take some great shots. When booking make sure you book a VIP booth - well worth the extra money. Tip the guy seating you and ask for a booth. Downtown Vegas is amazing! The atmosphere with the light show, outdoor bands and freemont street was the best time I have had in a long time. The strip is beautiful too but not as intimate the Old Vegas downtown. The slots are looser downtown too. Check out all the hotels on the strip - the are really breathtaking and each one has a theme. There is always something different happening at each one. Caesar's Palace has the forum shops which are a must if you are a shopper. Just gorgeous! The Bellagio and Treasure Island have their outdoor shows so try to catch those - incredible! Paris Paris has the most beautiful casino I've ever seen. The new Wynn Hotel is a 2 billion dollar project and owned by Steve Wynn. You must take a walk through this place -your jaw will drop! Lots of beautiful people with lots of money! The best place for supper with a view is the Voodoo lounge. The food is great and this place has one of the most spectacular views at night! A must see. I could go on an on but I just have to say the Golden Nugget is the best hotel downtown and you can't beat the service and the rates.

When the bell hop arrived with our luggage, I mentioned something to him and he said that he would send someone up. The maid arrived shortly after and sprayed the air conditioning vents and the carpet and other areas. We could open our window a little bit (about 12 inches) and we kept the window open the remainder of the time. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible. Thank goodness they had a vanity with a light up mirror. Without that mirror, don't know how I would have applied makeup. Our room safe only worked the first night. We kept getting error codes on the safe. Security came up and reset the code and it worked for a couple of hours. When we went to get money out of the safe, we got the error code again. We ended up using the hotel safe which was very inconvenient. If anyone is going to this hotel, request the North Tower as the South Tower rooms are a very long walk! We played video poker at the bar a couple of times and everytime we ordered a drink, we still were charged, even though we were playing the machines! Gambling is much better across the street at Binion's. Now for the good points..... Ate a late night breakfast the first night we were there at the Carson Street Cafe. Very good food and very good waitress staff. Room Service was excellent. Hubby and I ordered two cheeseburgers and stated that we really needed them delivered within thirty minutes as we were renewing our wedding vows that day and the limo would be there within an hour to pick us up. Room Service had the food up to our room within fifteen minutes which really impressed us! The burgers were very good too! Room Service also delivered us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries as a gift from a friend from back home and they made the arrangement beautiful! On Sunday we all wanted to watch the Eagles Game and were seated at the bar at the Nugget. We asked the bartender if the game was going to be on that television. He checked the station and couldn't get it in. Maintenance arrived and tried to fix the problem. After a few minutes, the Maintenance Man told us to follow him and he would show us where we could watch the game. He took us to a little restaurant in the Hotel, I think it is called Zax. We had the whole place to ourselves to watch the game on a huge screen television. The waitress was excellent and very attentive. What a way to watch the game! We also were only approached by Timeshare people one time and I just stated No when they started talking. It was great being on Freemont Street and just having to step right outside to see the light show and listen to the bands. Security for going up in the elevators was very good. Had to show our room key each time we passed Security. Bell Hops were very attentive and fast! Would we stay at the Golden Nugget again? I don't think so.

The food in the cafe was quite good. They could use more restrooms on the main floor (there was only one in the casino that serves the entire main floor, at least that I found). The crowd skews older than on the strip, probably an average age of 45 to 50. The muzak in the casino caters to this age group. Be ready for Carly Simon and the Bee Gees. The other hotels and casinos on Freemont strip are pretty much dumps, though the people watching is great. The great equalizer was the price, about $250 for four days including a Friday and Saturday.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cRude Service\u201d", "Author": "cubsd", "ReviewID": "UR3803637", "Content": "I used to enjoy the high level of service at the Golden Nugget, and the low table limits at downtown Las Vegas casinos. Unfortunately, both of those are over. I complained at check-in and check out, and then came home to send this letter to the Golden Nugget. START OF LETTER I have been a patron of your hotel/casino for over ten years. I used to enjoy gambling in your casino, eating at Zax, Stefano\u2019s, and The Buffet. However, following my recent stay with you July 17th \u2013 July 20th, I doubt that will continue. I called casino marketing two months prior to make reservations for a non-smoking, king room in the north tower. I inquired if there was any tournament taking place at that time and was told \u201cno\u201d. I stressed that I wanted to be in the north tower, and I was told that the request would be made. When I arrived on the 17th, I was told that there was nothing in the north tower. I explained my disappointment, because I did not wish to hike from the south tower to the casino. The desk clerk explained that it was because of the poker tournament that was on-going. I told her that I would reluctantly accept a non-smoking king room in the south tower. After hiking to my room, I discovered that she had put me a room with two doubles. I called the front desk, because I did not want to hike back to the front desk for nothing. After explaining the problem, I was transferred to casino marketing. I then had to explain again to a casino host, who said she would call me back. When she did call back, she stated she had been told by the front desk that they had no non-smoking king bed room available. I told her that was unacceptable and that the front desk had said they did have a king room in the south tower, they had just put me in the wrong room. The host then told me that she thought that she shouldn\u2019t be involved anymore, and gave me the direct extension of the front desk manager. I later found out that you have many \u201cfront desk managers\u201d. This call took place July 17th at around 5:00pm. I called the front desk manager and began to again explain the problem, when she impatiently cut me off, and began to lecture me on \u201croom requests\u201d. I told her that I understood she may not have a room in the north tower like I reserved two months ago, but that doesn\u2019t excuse being lied to over the phone about the poker tournament, put in a room without the correct bed type, and being given the run-around. She sarcastically told me I had not been given the run-around, as this was the first time she had spoken to me. I informed her that if she had let me tell her what had previously happened, she would know what was going on. She told me to go back to the front desk, and they would put me in a king room that I had previously been told didn\u2019t exist. The entire time, she addressed me in a hateful, disrespectful tone. After waiting in line again at the front desk, I asked the same desk clerk why she had put me in a doubles room, when all we had discussed was a non-smoking king. She said \u201cThat\u2019s what you asked for\u201d and then smirked. After arriving in my room, #22124, I realized why she had smirked; she had put me in the farthest room from the front as possible. The room stank of carpet cleaning, and the TV had horrible reception. In addition, the guest services on the TV did not work. Because of my previous experience, I did not call to complain, because I was tired of being jerked around, and treated with disrespect. Later during the stay, I realized that the internet did not work either, and despite calls to maintenance, and three different men working in the room, internet service was never provided. Because of this, my partner had to make three phone calls from the room, which Golden Nugget was only too happy to charge $45.00. Because of what had happened, I did not gamble much at your casino, and instead cashed out my points. It is sad for me to see a place that used to offer high customer service fall so far. I do expect a reply to this letter, and an explanation as to why I should continue to stay at the Golden Nugget, when there are so many other places to stay, eat, and gamble. END OF LETTER The day I sent this letter, I received a form letter from the Golden Nugget that said they were sorry I didn't enjoy my stay, but didn't address any of my concerns. It was a complete blow-off. I never received an actual response to my letter. Goodbye downtown Vegas! Your table limits are no longer low, and the only decent place to stay is no longer decent. AAA four diamonds? I think not. It's the strip for me, where there are plenty of places that don't lie to me and treat me rudely.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Marlboro, MD", "Title": "\u201cThe best place to stay downtown\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3800688", "Content": "Had a pleasant stay at the Golden Nugget.

Much more strip-like than any of the other downtown places. The Fremont Street Experience is right outside the hotel and is great to watch. As far as downtown goes though, I was not impressed.

Had no choice but to accept the smoking room. The desk clerk did offer to have the room \"deodorized\" (cover up any odors with perfume) but the staff clearly didn't care at all about only having smoking rooms available at a pretty early check in time by Las Vegas standards. The room did smell quite smoky, and there was also a used bandage near the bathtub, and the hotel guide binder was on the floor behind a table with most of the pages strewn about. There was also a blue chalk line on the carpet near the window for some reason. Cleaned the room, then opened the window and left the room for a few hours in hopes it would air out by then. My friend called the hotel about midnight pretending to inquire about booking a room for the night and asked if there were any non smoking rooms available. They were told that all that were left were suites. Of course, I have been upgraded to a suite at no charge in the past at strip hotels, but apparently this is not done at the Golden Nugget. Their website does state, \"We will note your preferences for room type and/or location, however due to arrival and departure patterns, we are unable to guarantee any room requests.\" so this may be why the staff is not concerned at all about room requests not being available. I had a second reservation for the following two nights, was able to change it to a single night, and was allowed to switch to a non smoking room for the next night. This room was better maintained with no major issues. There were still some positives about the hotel: -On a night when the parking structure was quite full, there was security limiting parking at the time to hotel guests only so all guests would have a place to park. -We noticed a large spill in the hallway near the elevator on our floor. When returing to our room, two security guards were walking the halls and one was calling housekeeping to clean the spill. In short, this is still a decent hotel with a nice casino and atmosphere, and is still a good choice if you want to stay in the downtown area if good rates are available. However it seems like some of the rooms may be showing their age and sometimes are not cleaned completely. So if you are a non smoker, keep your fingers crossed that a clean non smoking room is available and try to check in as early in the afternoon as possible.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "De Pere, WI", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Jodie1906", "ReviewID": "UR3796566", "Content": "We spent the last evening of our vacation to the Las Vegas/Grand Canyon area downtown at the Golden Nugget.

We had requested a room with a strip view and the first person at the front desk put us on the 11th floor which had a view of the garage. When I called down to the front desk, they offered to move us to another room. The second room was on the 19th floor, and you need to be on the 18th floor at least to get a decent view of the lights at night, which were very pretty. The room itself was large and nice, clean, with a smallish bathroom. One thing that was great was that I never heard a sound from another guest the entire time! Maybe it was the corner location (19125), far from the elevator, but worth it in a good night's sleep. Overall, we were very happy with our room. We ended up gambling at the casino several times, and the staff there was fine. Some dealers were very friendly and some were just blah, but none were rude. It is smokey, but several of the casinos we went into were, too. I used the salon to get a haircut and was pleased. Now for the bad. The first two mornings, the line at the restaurant was long so we just decided to go to the Starbucks in the hotel and eat a big lunch. Starbucks is very popular but the line moved fast and we enjoyed our coffee and pastry. The second morning, same thing, long line to get in for breakfast, so we got our coffee at Starbucks and went down the street to get Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Third morning, we had a late flight so we decided to just wait to eat a nice breakfast and were looking forward to it. We both ordered eggs, hash browns, bacon. I ordered my eggs scrambled and when we got our order I took one bite and they tasted terrible! My husbands eggs were OK but both of our hash browns were unedible. When I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat my eggs, she asked me if I wanted \"country scrambled\" eggs instead. What's the difference from what I ordered, I asked. \"Well, they are real eggs, and these you got are powdered!\". I could not believe that a restaurant of this supposed quality would consider using powdered eggs, and she acted like she heard this complaint every day. I can't say we will never stay here again, but any hotel that can't provide a decent breakfast for $25 gets downgraded by me. It's not like it was included free in our room rate of $139; no one expects those breakfasts to be much. And, if you are staying downtown, there's not much choice elsewhere to eat breakfast.

When we arrived after a long flight, we were bombarred by GN reps wanting to give us their promo package. Here's what they offerd. If you took their tour of there upcoming new Casino the Grandview in south Vegas, you would get 50.00 in Casino money or a three day trip to Florida or Las Vegas. My suggestion, DO NOT TAKE the promo. They will tell you at the desk that it will only take two fours. Not True!! My wife and I left at 10.30 a.m. and did not get back till 2:00 p.m. and that is after we told them that we were not interested in purchasing a time-share apartment. That's right folks, they try and sell you a time-share at the Grandview Hotel & Casino for as little as $8990 with a deposit of $890 and between 71.00 to 89.00 per month depending on our credit rating!! The $8990 is their cheapest package. Once you get to their site, you still have to go thru their who cycle of talks even if you are not interested. Of course, we did this just to get their promotion package which included a free 3 day trip to Florida or Vegas and free tickets to see Gordie Brown which was their nightly entertainment at that time. If you were to purchase the entertainment tickets it would cost you 99.00 for two.In my opinion, the show was not worth 99.00 nor worth free tickets. As far as food in concerned, you can eat just as good and cheaper outside of the GN. We ate, after a tip from one of the GN employees, at the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino at the Bay City Dinner. My wife had Prime Rib for 5.99 and I had pasta for 4.99 and it was great!! I found the GN casino not to be the highest payout casino as mentioned in one of the LV review magazines. I did poorly at GN and it was not until I played at the Golden Gate and Fitzgeralds did I hit my big wins. Finally, if you are planning to stay at the GN I suggest shopping around first. There are so many better deals elsewhere and even on the strip that beat what GN is offering. I feel that once south Vegas is up and running, GN will have a run for their money. One GN employee stated that it is not going to affect GN because they have 450,000 people coming to Vegas every day of the year. I beg to differ.

We found certain elements excellent and others slightly below average. Making a reservation was a breeze. We booked directly with the GN back in March with a rate of $59 per night week day and $99 per weekend. A couple of weeks later they dropped the weekend price to $79 dollars on the internet. I called to see if we were able to get that price and they said there was not a problem. They didn't even blink an eye they just did it. For the entire week we only paid $513 USD including all taxes and fees. An excellent price for such a classy place. Check in was easy but we were there at 11:30pm. The atmosphere was elegant and the attention to detail was excellent, I was forever seeing someone buffing the brass or cleaning the glass on the doorways. It was hard to imagine that the hotel was over 50 years old. The rooms did not look their age. They were simple but very clean. We stayed on the 7th floor in room 7111. It was a bit of a trek from the casino but at that price who cares! We had a smoking two queen bedroom, but the room didn't smell smokey. (I'm a non smoker whereas my mother is). We also had a table and two comphy chairs and a vanity which was handly because the counter was really high in the bathroom so it made it difficult to put my contacts in. The bathroom was a little small but large enough to get things done. The maid service was EXCELLENT! The room was always very clean and done promptly. The first day we had a bit of trouble with the bath tub not draining well but it was because the drain was not fully open. Once we figured that out we never had another problem. Our flight out was not until 4:30pm so we called down to ask if we could check out later and they said it was not a problem and there was no fee involved. We ate in the 24 hour Cafe twice and we had the Champagne Brunch on Sunday before we left. The food in the cafe was okay (Canadian equivalent Pantry, ABC) and hot, but the pricing was exactly the same as back home. Example $9.95 for a sandwich and fries. The service was indifferent the first time we went and good the second. I was disapointed with the Buffet. The selection was great but the food was cold and the service terrible. The guy we had was always reaching across our food to grab our sugar packages that we used for our coffee. No excuse me or asking if we needed anything. He must have really hated to see used sugar packs on the table. It got to the point that we politely hinted to leave us alone. He also didn't pour our champange and orange juice properly either. I ended up making a mess when I tried to mix the two. We found the Cashiers snarky when we were cashing in our travellers cheques, but the doormen very friendly and helpful. Bar tenders were also friendly and the time share people didn't bother us. The pool area was very pretty but the pool hours were horrible. 9am to 7pm. Dawn down there was at 4am and after a night of gambling it would have been nice to go for a dip before we went for a nap. Security was hot and cold. Some were not paying attention and pretty much let anyone up the elevators and others were checking everyone's key card. We found the slots to be very tight (I put in a $20 into a wild cherry quarter machine and didn't even make a single quarter) and the table minimums way too rich for our blood. ($15 Black jack, $5 Roulette with $25 down inside and another $25 outside) A couple of pointers: 1) Ask for a room closer to the elevators if you have trouble walking because it's a long walk just to the elevator from the casino and another long trek to your room. 2) Tip your maid. It's amazing how quick they'll make up your room if you leave $1 per person for them. 3) Book directly online you'll get a better rate 4) Don't use the phone in the room for local calls it costs you a $1 each time. Find a payphone downstairs. Overall I will definately stay at the GN again but I will not eat or gamble there.

The casinos around the Nugget offer lower limit tables and very friendly dealers. There seems to be a more laid back atmosphere downtown. Don't expect a great pool. It is more like a kiddie pool with a swarm of pool chairs. You have to wait in line in the morning to even get a chair. Not worth the wait. (We went to the Wynn.

I do have to say, for the money, the rooms are fairly decent and clean and the hotel itself is nice but that's about the only good thing I can say about this hotel. The biggest frustration and disappointment for us was that the small pool area didn't open until 11:00 and only had about 40-50 lounge chairs for a hotel with almost 2000 rooms. If you're not standing in line when the pool opens (yes there's a line) you can forget about having a chair. My friend and I went down to the pool around 11:15 and there was only about 15 people around the pool but every single chair was \"saved\" with either a a towel or personal items laid on them. Several people were upset like ourselves and when we inquired with the pool supervisor, he said there was nothing he could do, we should have gotten in line before the pool opened! We waited for over an hour and still most chairs were not \"physically\" occupied... I realize that gambling is the main purpose to go to vegas but for many people lounging by the pool is way up there with trip importance. Our group gambled at the GN for 3 days and no one won or let alone saw anyone win on slots. We also played table games but were very turned off by the cranky dealers. Occassionally there was a great dealer but most everyone one we encountered seemed miserable. The food was very bland and below average for the price, except at Stefano's. Stefano's was excellent and one of the only bright spots during our stay. Settling our bill at check out took more than 45 minutes as we had to stand in line for almost a half hour. There were only 2 people at the desk with a very long line. You get what you pay for at this hotel, I do not see whatsoever how this could be even close to a four star hotel..

Golden Nugget is situated in downtown Vegas and is central to the Fremont Street Experience and is half an hour's bus drive away from the main strip. However the public bus service is not very reliable and when the buses do arrive they are often too full to get onto so I would recommend if you have the money to get taxis to and from the strip in peak hours. I would recommend that people visit the Red Rock Canyon which is a magnificent experience, that is only 30 minutes away! I would recommend the Showtime Tours in Neveda as a good sightseeing company which can to take you to Red Rock & other excursions on offer in the area. We were able to see Red Rock, Elvis -A- Rama and Ethel M Chocolate factory and Botancial Gardens for $49.99 which is a bargain.

This was the 1st time we stayed downtown on the \"old strip\" and we enjoyed every minute of it. Our room was outstandingly modern, spacious, and everything we were looking for. We stayed in the south tower on the 17th floor room number 17106. The walk to the main casino was nothing really and we were approached by the timeshare sales people but paid no attention to them as we walked right by. The hotel is very decorative with all the polished brass and marble floors. Our check in was extremely fast and the counter person extremely professional! We did manage to eat breakfast and lunch on three different occasions at their buffet restaurant and the food was awesome. The spreads of many different foods were astounding and delicious, especially the sushi and seafood! The cost of the lunch buffet was a great deal at $8.00 per person! We also ate at the hotel cafeteria, Lilly Langtrys and had excellent fare there as well. We really enjoyed staying downtown and seeing the old strip along with the Freemont Street Experience light show..........this is truly a show not to be missed! The cost of food is much less on the old strip and we also enjoyed playing the old style slot machines which payback with coins instead of a printed ticket. For a small $5 daily fee, one can purchase an unlimited use bus pass for 24 hours on the city transit to take you between the old and new strip.

We actually enjoyed Freemont more than the strip. Slots were ok, better at the hole in the wall Mermaids on Freemont. Binions s----- as far as looks and the smell, but I won quite a bit of money on the quarter slots there. The loosest slots were on the strip at the Luxor, and we won the most ($500) at NY NY.

For a 4 star hotel you can often get a room for the cost of the average 2-3 star hotel in Vegas - and we got free show tickets and free food tickets along with the deal. No internet access available in room. I don't know when all of today's hotels are going to get on the ball and have WiFi available as a standard amenity. No minibar, I had hoped, but that's ok - they're always overpriced anyhow - just go to the Walmart and get a styrofoam cooler, some beverages, and some ice from the ice machine in the hotel - all set. The casino seemed much like they all do, no better or worse. The in-hotel food options were also comparable. One of the better buffets in Vegas, and low cost too. The parking across the street (it's also one of the few hotels in Vegas that have a pay lot - cept it's free for hotel guests when you present your room key) was a bit inconvenient, and the garage was often quite crowded, but when compared to the garages of some of the other hotels...even if they are attached to the hotel itself they are so far away from where your room actually ends up being, there isn't much difference. The golden Nugget is a bit less daunting in size - you don't need marathon training to get from one side of the hotel and back.

The first part of our stay we stayed at the Palms (see seperate review). The second part of our stay, we stayed at the Golden Nugget. We wanted to get a taste of downtown and have heard so many great things about The Nugget. We checked in at around 4pm and were assigned a room on the 17th floor of the south tower. Check-in was quick, friendly, and efficient. Our room was a \"standard\" deluxe non-smoking room. The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. It was on-par with a better Hilton. The view was looking toward Main St and the Plaza Hotel. There were only two small annoyances with the room. First, the air conditioning unit was a little noisy. Second, the towels were a little rough. The casino seems oddly laid out and a little cramped. You will find all of your favorite table games and slots ranging from 1 cent all the way up to $500 a pull. Cocktail service seems quick and friendly. My wife and I like to play slots and video poker occasionally and it seemed like the slots were tighter than most places downtown. We had two meals at The Nugget. Our first morning there we had breakfast from The Buffet. The food was very good but the buffet area was small and the layout wasn't very efficient. Also, the line to get in to the place was quite long. The next morning we had room service which was fast, hot, tasty and pretty reasonable. One thing I really want to address are the timeshare sales people located throughout the resort. You have a few options with these people. Option number one is ignore them (very easy to do). Option number two is tell them you are leaving that day or early the next day if they ask how long you are there for (this will get them to leave you alone for the time being). And option number three, talk to them and listen to their sales pitch. They are just doing their job and really aren't that much of an annoyance. And finally, if you were a fan of The Casino telelvision show on Fox, you most likely will see people you recognize from the show. We spotted a couple of the people from the telelvision show working (one was a dealer, the other was a floor person). The Golden Nugget truly is the Gem Of Downtown.

Our confirmation assured us a Deluxe, Smoking Room. Upon our arrival, at 2am, a Smoking Room was not available, so we were given a Non-Smoking Room in the North Tower. We were greeted at the elevator by a gentleman who welcomed us to the hotel and wished us luck in the casino as he pressed our floor and sent us to our deluxe room. The room was beautifully and tastefully decorated, the bathroom included a jacuzzi and separate dressing room with wall-to-wall mirrors. There was a bottle of water on the table and a letter from the management, welcoming us to the hotel, wishing us luck in the casino and offering high-speed internet service via our televisio. A keyboard was under the TV and the letter stated that a technician would have to enter our room to set it up. Since we knew that we were moving to another room, we decided we could wait 8 hours, until we were settled. We were assured that our smoking room would be available by 10am and that we should contact the front desk for the new room assignment. ...15hours 40minutes, 3 phone calls and several trips to the front desk later, we were informed that a Smoking Room was now available and that \"we could move our bags to the South Tower.\" Upon arrival in the South Tower, we were certainly not greeted by anyone holding any elevators, we were however stopped and made to produce our room key before we could proceed...not once, not twice, but every trip for the entire week, whether it was 5 hours or 5 minutes since we had passed that point. We were also swarmed by a band of headhunters, hawking free shows and dinners if we would simply sacrafice an hour or two of our coveted vacation time to visit another resort so we could be harrassed further for not buying whatever they were selling...all this negative excitement within 5 feet of the elevator that led to our bedroom for the week, but not one person in this group ever offered to hold an elevator, much less push our floor...on the contrary, they inevitably caused us to miss the elevator and prolong the agony of their abuse even longer. If we showed the slightest displeasure at this belittling situation, the representatives of the Golden Nugget became defensive and gave us attitude that plainly stated, \"So What...Who Needs You!\" Our deluxe room in the South Tower left volumes to be desired. The decor was dated, at best, there was no jacuzzi and the drains was so slow that you had dirty bathwater above your ankles while you showered. There was no separate dressing room of course, but you could barely get into the closet due to a narrow, sliding door that invariably knocked you in the head with the ironing board each time you opened it and one lamp was in need of a bulb. There was no bottled water, no letter from the management, no letter about high speed internet service and no keyboard with the TV...upon tuning into the hotel menu on the TV, we were informed that those services were not available. We ordered room service and were informed that we were on a \"Cash Only\" basis as we did not have a credit card on file with the hotel...all previous transactions had been completed with my VISA. On our 4th evening, we returned to the Golden Nugget around Midnight, following a full day on the Strip, including a sumptuous gourmet dinner at the MGM, a couple of world-class shows at the Tropicana and Treasure Island, along with a satisfying winning streak in various casinosl. Excited to change our clothes and hit the Fremont Street Experience, we opened the door to our room to discover that it had not been touched by housekeeping...dirty, wet towels laid in the floor and added a musty, mildewy scent to our already less that aromatic room. We called and demanded that someone come up immediately to rectify the problem...a maid showed up in about 30 minutes, gave us fresh towels, took the dirty ones, emptied our trash all over the hallway and was on her way. On our final day in Las Vegas, our plane left at 10:50pm, we asked the Golden Nugget if we could possibly keep our room just until 5pm instead of the scheduled 1pm check-out, so that we had somewhere to keep our luggage and we could get a shower before having to get on a plane for 7 hours after gambling in their casino all day - - of course, that request was out of the question. We were so disappointed in our stay at the Golden Nugget...we chose that hotel because the name itself says \"Las Vegas\". Their advertising stood out from the rest with emphasis on the deluxe accomodations. We are nostalgic by nature and this experience took something from us that we will never be able to rekindle. We will return to Las Vegas, there's no other city like it, but we will never return to the Golden Nugget and will be forced to tell anyone who asks, exactly what kind of lasting impression was left by the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino.

I am a bit of a hotel snob and frankly, I was disgusted at the idea of staying downtown. While I agree that downtown Vegas is, well, yucky, let me tell you what the GN experience is like...You pull up to the valet (valet parking is free) and are offered immediate bellhop service. there is a doorman waiting for you at the entrance. Now you are looking at a lobby that is so elegant, with chandeliers, marble floors and counters, and huge floral arrangements. The front desk staff is accomodating and efficient. You step to the elevators and realize the reason the lobby is so classy is that the casino is nowhere to be seen - it is around the corner, out of sight and earshot. Nice. At the elevators, and ever-present attendant calls the elevator and pushes your floor button for you. At this point I can suggest requesting a room near the elevator, as the hallway offers you a very looong walk otherwise. Also, request a room in the South Tower - we were in the North Tower and the view was of the freeway - no good. The decor of the hallways leaves a little to be desired - it is two-toned beige on beige. You arrive at your room, which is really quite cute. Our king size bed had a headboard and drapes at the front. The carpet was clean, the walls were two-toned with crown molding. The closet was mirrored and contained a safe, iron and ironing board, and coat hangers that were not attached to the rod. There was a vanity with a nice stool to sit on, and a magnified makeup mirror. The heating and air worked wonderfully, and the tv worked fine as well. the bathroom left a little to be desired, as it was very small and the water pressure was low. There are no coffee machines in the room, but room service is available 24 hours and has a nice big menu. The room service charge is $4, and they are very fast (and delcicious). One negative is that the walls are thin - I could hear our upstairs neighbor as she came into her room in high heels across the floor and flushed her toilet. The draperies in the room were great -when I woke up in the moring I seriously thought it was about 4:00am...turned out it was 11:30am. Nice and dark! For food: There are 2 nice restaurants, one is Italian and one is Cantonese (called Lillie Langtrys), where we ate. This restaurant is simply breathtaking. It is classy and elegant but not stuffy. The service is amazing - very fast, friendly, helpful. The food is simply out of this world, and not terribly overpriced (slightly cheaper than Spago). We also ate at the 24 hour cafe, which had a small menu but the hamburger and sandwich we ordered were delicious. The cafe is very very adorable and the service, again, was spectacular. There is no food court, but there is a little deli and a Starbucks. The gift shop is open 24 hours which is great if you need aspirin, ciggerettes, cough drops, etc. There are a couple other stores to spend time in as well. We did not visit the pool area, but our room overlooked that area and it did look very nice. I can assume it was well heated because there were no less than 30 people out there on a day that was about 65 degrees. The casino was not up to our standards, as it was very crowded. We never even managed to get to a table. There was no problem with the slot machines though - there are plenty (from 5 cents through $5). For table play we walked to one of the other local casinos and had no problem finding a couple empty seats (although the surrounding casinos are not very pretty, but when you are in a mood for roulette or let it ride who cares). There are two poker rooms at the GN, with a great variety of games. Check-out time is noon which is great, but it was madhouse downstairs. If you are checking our on a Sunday, do yourself a favor and get up early. Go checkout and have the bellhop take your bags. He will have them held until you are ready to go home.

We were offered free show tickets and it wasn't even part of our Expedia package. If the bathtub had been marble, I would have rated it excellent instead of above average. The only negatives were just minor things: 1. The lighting in the room was very dim. No wattage printed on the bulbs, but they couldn't have been more than 40 watts. 2. The business center is only open 7am-5pm Vegas time, which I couldn't understand in a business that caters to tourists from all over the world. Internet access was expensive too, at $1 per minute with a $5 minimum. 3. The people hawking timeshares for Grandview were annoying, but just say no and walkaway if you don't want to deal with them. 4. Cab ride to the airport was ~$28.00 each way, plus tip. A designated Nugget shuttle to the strip/airport would be a bonus. As far as staying downtown, it was nice to have several casinos close together, as opposed to a half mile hike to the entrance of each one. Some were nasty (Lady Luck-eeew, what a pit!), but as long as you keep your wits about you, you'll be fine. Saw many police officers on bikes, which was comforting. The bottom line is: If you're expecting the Bellagio, then quadruple the GN room rate and get a room at the Bellagio. But if you want a nice room in a safe location, then the Nugget is your best bet.

From all I've heard, the Nugget is the only real downtown hotel if you're high maintenance or demand good service. The GN delivered both. I stayed in the north tower. The rooms have recently been tastfully remodeled and are quite nice. Although the remodel was not thorough. The newer wallpaper covers obvious wall disrepair but it's not too bad. The rooms are furnished nicely as are the bathrooms. Water pressure is a little weak but still usable. The casino is decent, not too big and not too loud like some of the annoying casinos. It could use some newer gaming but it does the trick. I found everything in the hotel quite nice and clean. The food for room service, the restaurants, and the buffet was all excellent. No complaints and the service was quick and friendly. Now the downfall; Location. Fremont street is nice and they've done a great job redoing the street. Also wouldn't be surprised if the screen is extended to cover some new building that's going on. However, if you like the shows, restaurants, shopping, and sightseeing on the strip, you will be bored with downtown quite quickly. In a mere 3 days I spent several hundred in cabs. (I know, I should take the bus) If there is ever a monorail that runs to downtown, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Nugget again. It really is a great place.

The food at the buffet was good, but as I was leaving with a half of a muffin wrapped up to take out, I was stopped by the staff and chided that I could not take any food out. VERY EMBARRASSING.

We'd seen the TV show, and the rates were reasonable ($65 a night Sunday/Monday) so we gave the Nugget a try. As it turned out, we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel other than the rooms and the casino (in other words, the perfect stay from a hotel-owners perspective), but what we were able to see we were pretty impressed with. Once you get off the main level and up to the rooms, the hotel approaches 5-star territory. Very tasteful decorating, new TVs with all the bells and whistles (almost - more below), and large marble bathrooms are all the equivalent or better than what we've stayed in on the Strip. The room was also the quietest we've stayed in in Vegas. What we saw of the rest of the hotel was OK, but certainly had none of the \"wow\" factor you might get on the Strip. That might be to be expected - all of Fremont street is probably not much longer than the roadway in front of the Mirage, so there's not a lot of room downtown for spectacle (the overhead thing is pretty cool though, speaking of spectacles). The Casino was unremarkable (and small by Strip standards) except for one thing - the fabulous leather chairs. Very easy to spend a lot of time on these things. The drink service was also a little on the slow side, but mentioning that to management rectified it in a hurry. A few complaints - first, when we checked out there was a $75 phone charge on our bill because somehow the phone didn't hang up after we had finished speaking to our airline. The hotel should have clued in beforehand that we didn't spend 500 straight minutes on the phone, but they did take care of it when we brought it to their attention. Second, how a couple of internet millionaires allow the TV internet service in their own hotel to be so bad is a little puzzling. Slow connections, poor interface and maddening wireless gizmos mean don't bother paying for this. Plus I thought their website was crappy, but see they have since updated it. Third, I agree with the other complaints regarding the shysters in the lobbies (and throughout the rest of Downtown I might add). Are the sales for whatever these jokers are selling (we never stopped) really worth annoying paying customers? Overall though, these annoyances were minor in the grand scheme. As for the \"Freemont Street Experience\" downtown, now that I've been downtown I'm not sure I'd stay down there again. We did have a lot of fun at some of the casinos (the Mermaid and Nugget in particular), and even walked away with some extra cash, but if you're into shows, restaurants, shopping and the other amenities of the Strip, Downtown is not quite there. While the Strip is only a short drive/cab ride (or soon to be Monorail ride, apparently), the scene here was much older (I'm talking senior's home older), and the fact is that you spend most of your time near where you are staying, otherwise, what's the point? I'd probably go back downtown for a night of gambling and hanging out, but to me, Vegas is the Strip. If I do go back however, I would definitely stay at the Nugget, and if you happen to be someone over 50 or so, I'd recommend it highly. I'm not saying that disrespectfully - I think if my 55 year-old parents go back I'll recommend the same to them, as the Strip can be quite gruelling due to all the walking and the crowds. Downtown is quieter, more \"compressed\", is quite a bit cheaper, and there's still quite a bit to do - if you get bored of it then take the cab to the Strip, but bring your walking shoes. One last thing, stay far, far away from the Tony Roma's \"deals\", such as the $9.95 steak and lobster they have advertised everywhere. The lobster is OK, but the size of your thumb, and the steak is the poorest excuse for a piece of meat I've seen.

We had never stayed downtown before and didn't know what to expect. We arrived very late around 11:30 PM on Thursday night and rooms were only available in the South Tower. There were also no king size beds available. The room was very clean, comfortable and had an excellent view - also it was very quiet. The next day we asked if a king bed was available and they moved us to the top floor and we had a beautiful view of the mountains and the Stratosphere hotel. We feel that this was probably much better then the North Tower rooms. We enjoyed the gym although we were surprised to have to pay $15 each to use the facilities, but the equipment was very good and the area well maintained. The only annoying thing was that the swimming pool didn't have a bathroom so I had to traipse through the casino in my towel to get to the bathroom. Also, the casino was well ventilated, bright and the cocktail waitresses were plentiful. However, the tables were a bit pricy and we chose to gamble at the Four Queens, the Main Street Station, the Fremont, and Fitzgeralds. The wait for the bus to the Strip was 45 minutes, the bus was packed, there were many unbathed people on board and it took us nearly 45 minutes to reach the strip. I think it's worth the 12-15 bucks to take a taxi. Also, I do not think it is worth waiting an hour for the various all you can eat buffets in Vegas. We ate at the Nugget Buffet and the Stratosphere Buffet and our experiences at local restaurants were MUCH better. The food at the buffets is all fried and obviously had been cooked in the morning or even days earlier (desserts). The brewery restaurant at Main Street Station is excellent, the Carson City cafe in the Nugget has an excellent breakfast and lunch and we found a gem of a place downtown which I think is called Mamacitas.

You will not find any 1 cent or 2 cent slots, but they do have nickle slots. There is no question they want this to be the upscale casino of downtown. I found the best slots at the Vegas Club and Main Street Station. I also met a number of people from the Nugget playing at these casinos. Overall if you are going downtown the Nugget is the nicest to stay at, but I found the buffet, slots, and happy hour at the Main Street Station better.", "Date": "August 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, SC", "Title": "\u201cThe GN deserves 10 stars\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2433491", "Content": "Just arrived home from five days at without a doubt the best hotel casino in Vegas.

After 10 visits to Las Vegas my wife and I decided to take a break from the \u201cVegas Strip\u201d scene and enjoy the downtown Vegas atmosphere. The Golden Nugget offered a wonderful location if you are interested in staying and playing downtown. The hotel accommodations are glitzy, marbled, and pure Vegas over-the-top (similar d\u00e9cor as the Mirage). There are no other downtown hotels that will offer you luxury for less than the Golden Nugget. I requested a free room upgrade to the North Tower upon advice from other travelers and I my request was accommodated. The North Tower is definitely a must in order to place you close to the primary casino/hotel action and amenities. In addition, the North Tower allows you immediate access to the main exits placing you on Freemont Street where you will find the rest of the downtown casinos and entertainment venues. The South Tower\u2019s location places you out of the main casino/hotel traffic patterns and will require you to find your way to the main casino and other hotel venues. A summary of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino follows: North Tower Room: Large and well appointed. The view is not spectacular but little time is usually spent in the room looking out the window. The South Tower rooms are reportedly smaller and their location takes you away from the main casino action. Hotel Room and Hotel Amenities: All of the usual amenities of a nicer hotel (e.g., toiletries, towels, plenty of hangers) though the maid service only left three towels a day (we prefer four or five) and there is no coffee maker in the room (Starbucks is just a short elevator ride down to the casino). Like most Vegas hotels you will not find HBO (or other premium channels) in your room thought the local television choices are adequate for the late night or early morning television viewing. The king size bed and pillows in the room were rather uncomfortable. I assume that the GN doesn\u2019t want you spending too much time in bed, drinking coffee, and watching television when you could be losing money downstairs. As for the pool, spa, and gym I found each to be quite nice and since we left the children at home we were pleased to see that other couples did the same while lounging around the pool. Restaurants/Buffet/Dining in General: The GN buffet/cafe was fine but not noteworthy. For the better downtown buffets you will want to make your way over to Main Street Station buffet and to the Freemont Paradise buffet. For a great prime rib deal visit the Golden Gate\u2019s restaurant ($5.49) or the Freemont\u2019s Tony Roma\u2019s ($7.50 \u2013 also Tony Roma\u2019s offers a nice $10.50 late night steak and lobster deal). There are plenty of bargain food venues throughout the downtown area that are worth encountering (e.g., .99 cent shrimp cocktail, .99 cent beer and hotdog). If you are looking for a fine dining experience downtown Hugo\u2019s Cellar in the Four Queens Casino is truly a spectacular dining experience. The access to the Golden Nugget\u2019s Starbucks was quite nice and my wife and I enjoyed sitting outside on Freemont Street in the Starbucks outside dining/sipping area watching tourist, locals, and various street people wander by our roost. Hotel/Casino Staff and Services: The hotel staff was friendly though not remarkable. The casino staff was friendly in general. Casino Action and Entertainment: The Golden Nugget offers little for the bargain or small time gambler (short of .50 cent roulette with $2.00 minimum bets on the inside and outside lines and a few lower limit Hold \u2018Em table buy-ins) with the majority of the blackjack and craps tables starting at $5.00 minimum bets. If you are looking for cheap gambling you will want to make your way over to the Freemont for the $2.00 blackjack table (though they usually only offer 1 table), Binion\u2019s Horseshoe for $3.00 blackjack tables and plenty of lower limit buy-in tables for Hold \u2018Em or wander down to the seedy El Cortez, California, and Lady Luck casinos for cheap tables; though I would recommend making the El Cortez and California walk only during the day. If you are a slot and machine player then dropping your coin in any of the machines is just as good as the next. There are plenty of free (or inexpensive) and generally kitschy Vegas lounge acts downtown (especially at Fitzgerald\u2019s Casino). That said, the Golden Nugget definitely offers finer comedy/variety/singing entertainment options for persons not looking for Cirque and people painted in blue. Once again, the downtown is not a venue for the first time Vegas visitor or the visitor with children (though everyone should wander downtown at night to enjoy the \u201cOld Vegas\u201d feel and encounter the Freemont Street lightshow). The Vegas Strip is still the best location for first timers and families. That said, if you are looking for a change on your next Vegas vacation or wish to avoid tour groups and children the Golden Nugget Casino and Hotel in downtown Las Vegas is an ideal location for close proximity to casino action, Vegas atmosphere, and an overall fun and \u201cold school\u201d Vegas vacation.", "Date": "August 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson, MI", "Title": "\u201cI liked our 1st stay downtown on Fremont Street...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2311131", "Content": "We normally stay on the Strip, at a Condo, the Hilton or Rio.

While a bit of a hike from the elevator, the room was quite nice, clean, and exactly as expected. If you stepped back from the window so as not to see the municipal parking garage directly below, the view was quite spectacular, especially with the strip lit up at night. All of the staff were helpful and considerate, the pool was OK although I found the music somewhat overly loud (maybe I was too close to a speaker?), and Fremont Street was far less annoying than the crush of the strip with lines of guys hawking \"escort service\" handouts. Two minor complaints about the Nugget was the low water pressure (perhaps somewhat due to being on the top floor), and not having an in-room coffee maker - I guess they love selling the $6 pot of coffee from room service. This is easily resolved by going to the Walgreens by Neonopolis and buying a 5 cup coffee maker for $10 and a pound of coffee - you now have endless in-room coffee! Walgreens was also good for late night/early morning snacks, and don't forget a couple of coffee mugs for .99 each (or 2.99 for the same ones at the tourist shops). Returning for a moment to my being a light sleeper - no complaint here with the hotel as they did everything they could to accommodate me, but even 22 floors up there is no getting away from sirens all night and back-up & bus beepers all morning. There were a few occasions where all you could hear for 20-25 minutes were police/ambulance/fire sirens until there was a lull before the next set started!

I went to the management to get this 65 plus year old some help. The so called managers were less then 30, and; they could care less about the older ladies plight. For hours this older lady worked her fanny off while others sat idly by. The comps were no where near what they were even a year ago. Changes need to be made at this place, as many employees, who have worked there for many years are seeing valued customers leave. The bellhops and other permanent fixture type employeees at this casino/hotel all asked me to write to get the place back to what it was.

Motel DT hotels are 2 or 3 star while the Nuggest is 4. This equates to better rooms, towels, toiletries. You get normal towels that dont flake off in your hair and decent bath products. Marble bathroom and a decent bed. I found the check in to be fast but the staff are just rude. I mean they do not care and make it apparent that they despise looking at you. It wasnt just me, I talked to many guests that had the same experience. Vegas is like that in general. I wonder why they get jobs at a hotel if they can't be nice. From what I've read and experienced the rooms do vary at this hotel. For instance, upon checkin we were given a room with two double beds. Even though we reserved and asked for a King bed. The check-in girl said we had a king but no, it was two doubles. Did they think we'd just take it? AFter many phone calls we finally got the manager. IT took 20 minutes of politely demanding what we paid for. After being told they had no king rooms one magically turned up when things heated up with us ready to take our $ and leave. Why do hotels always play this game? It makes no sense to me. Las Vegas is the worst. You reserve a room type and you get the opposite everytime. Anyway the first room we got was different. When we got to the room with a king bed it seemed nicer. I guess different parts of the hotel have more recent upgrades. THe rooms are comparable to the Mirage rooms on the strip. Prices are no where near the Mirage though as downtown isnt like the strip at all. Downtown is definitely an older crowd. The fremont St experience sucks. It really is uneventful and the light display is certainly not dazzling but left me feeling they used very old technology as the images look like a commodore 64 created them. I like to take off gambling downtown as I feel its the place in Vegas where you stand a chance at winning. The strip slots are tight and the table rules to tight. Downtown has little dives everywhere that have to offer better odds to get you in the door. THis is good for gambling but its bad if you want to gamble and your lady wants to walk about. Downtown is full of undesirable characters and wander off Fremont you'll find yourself amongst a slum. If you are young and looking to hook up with other young people then hit the strip. I'm early 30's and I like to gamble. WHen I come to Vegas by myself I love downtown as I can wander casino to casino in mutes not hours like on the strip. ALso I can hit my favorsite little shops shops and eat for $4. When with the girlfreind theres much less to do since she doesnt like the dives so much. Men can eat of $20/day easy but put a woman into the mix and suddenly that doesnt even cover your juice tab. IN summary, if you are used to nice hotels and want to stay downtown then its the Nugget for you. Theres decent accomodations all around but mostly not places to take your girl too. Gambling at the nugget is the worst downtown. I gamble elsewhere. Also having that trouble at check in didnt make me feel obigated to give them any more $.

For some reason they have very small pillows though. Odd. The rest of the hotel was great. Good sportsbook. Nice casino. It is smaller and laid out better than most of the strip hotels, easy to navigate. All the service we encountered was friendly and helpful. Good location downtown right in the middle of everything. Close to bus to the strip. 2$. Though the GN didn't have many 5$ tables or good slot machines, the rest of downtown is great for gambling. Good pay tables on the video poker and plenty of 2-5$ tables. Spent a lot of time gambling at the Four Queens. The Plaza has a good coupon book and is good for gambling also. Bottom line if you are on a budget downtown is much better. Just jump the bus and visit the strip. Not much else to do otherwise downtown, but i went this trip to gamble. I was looking forward to seeing the lights at the Fremont St exprience. I must say, to my surprise, i thought it was lame. I took one look up and said big deal and never payed attention to it again. Don't understand why people think this is so great. The time share people downtown are a little annoying, but no big deal. I would recommend staying downtown if you are on a budget and want to try something different. That said, the GN is the best place to stay. I will probably stay downtown again, since i don't like 10-15$ blackjack tables and low paying slots. There is a lot more to do and see on the strip however.
