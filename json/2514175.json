Clean rooms, nice staff, and reasonably priced! Broadway at Times Square Hotel used to be a Comfort Inn. We have stayed here 3 times, and I am leaving a review as the they have left the franchise and are now 3 or 4 hotels in the NYC area under the Apple Core hotels. They are updating the lobby of the hotel soon, so if you do choose to stay you might want to call, and check to see how much noise you might encounter. Our last visit was last year, and the desk clerk greeted my husband by name...that's great customer service. The hotel is clean and less than block from Times square, and the TKTS Discount Ticket Booths for Broadway and Off Broadway shows. The rooms are small, but clean. I really don't care too much about the size as we don't spend any time in the room anyway, but the bathrooms are decent size. We had a king bed, but truthfully the room we had was not family friendly. It worked for 2 people, but no room for a crib or to move around the bed. The pillows are my only complaint....small and no support! Beds are very comfortable. Not big breakfast people, we grabbed a bagel and coffee in the morning, but they do serve a breakfast buffet with the room price, but it's nothing fancy. Head towards 6th ave away from Times Square to eat cheaply. You can walk to Times Square in less than a minute, and to any Broadway theater in less than 5 minutes. Restaurant row is a 10-15 minute walk, and 10-15 minutes depending on the crowds on the sidewalks you can get to Macys in Heralds Square to shop floor after floor. There are many small restaurants on 6th for quick inexpensive meals, and 46th has many quaint taverns to visit. Havana Central is just a few steps away with good cuban food and the mojitos are the best! 4-7pm is happy hour M-F and Mojitos and other drinks are half price! Blue Fin Bar and Restaurant is fabulous less than 5 minutes away in Times Square. Just across from the Blue Fin is TKTS Discount Ticket Booths for Broadway and Off Broadway. You can get in line for half price or discounted theater tickets, and the line moves quickly so don't get discouraged if the line is long. There is a Catholic church next door, and the sounds of the bells ringing occasionally were the only noise we ever heard, and it was not loud or bothersome. *free WiFi Internet access *Computer room & free printing of boarding passes or faxing *free phone calls nation wide *nice fitness center *safe in room *iron & board *coffee maker *hair dryer *personal shampoo, soap and lotion", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA great choice for us\u201d", "Author": "swvalaw", "ReviewID": "UR127315126", "Content": "I went to New York for a short trip with my new family, hoping for a great adventure and worried about what all might go wrong. This hotel was just right - the price was among the lowest, the location made things easy, the wifi worked, the rooms were small but with comfortable beds. There were six of us, so we got two rooms with two double beds each - rooms 308 and 408. Their location was at the very back of the hotel, and very quiet. The only outside noise we ever hear inside the rooms were the church bells from next door, which were not too early. We walked easily to Rockefeller Center and all over Times Square, and used the 42nd St. subway station which made for an exciting walk. The hotel staff were very kind and friendly. This trip was an important first for us in so many ways that I was so happy and just plain relieved that we had a good place to stay where the people treated us well. The breakfast was popular with the girls because they offered donuts with chocolate icing and sprinkles, besides the usual danishes and breads. The breakfast space was small but not painfully so, and some people would eat on the chairs in the little lobby. The elevator was slow and there is only one but we were walking everywhere all the time anyway.

The room was small and efficient as expected for this price. It was a bit dark which made it seem smaller. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The steam heat was pumping out and needed to be turned down, but it's better than freezing! The closet was small, but there was plenty of bureau space. 32\" lcd tv worked well, the iHome iPod clock player was a bonus, individual led reading lamps on the head board was a nice touch and the work desk had power in easy reach. There was no view from the rooms unless you were right in the front or right in the rear. The benefit was that it was quiet until the bells on the church next door started to ring at 7:45am. WiFi access was free and there was complimentary breakfast each morning. I didn't partake in the breakfast due to schedule, but I checked it out and they had a good spread of fruits, yogurt, muffins, waffles, etc (continental plus) that would satisfy most people's quick breakfast requirements.

Boiling water source is also readily available with coffee/tea/milk etc. Room for improvements are definitely the elevator which many have already pointed out is painstakingly slow especially if you are on a higher level floor and possibly any safety risks associated with it which I feel is of high importance.

After much research on places to stay, we landed on this spot. At first glance it seemed affordable, liked the location, and there were NO reports of bed bugs anywhere to be found. After staying here, it was more than worth the value. The hotel was what it stated to be: a boutique hotel in the heart of Times Square. We got in much earlier than expected and the hotel staff had no problem checking us in early, which was a huge bonus. They also were willing to hold our luggage the day we left while we finished up seeing the sights. The hotel rooms were small, but that's to be expected of NYC and a boutique hotel. Plus we didn't stay in NYC to stay in our hotel room. So if you plan on staying in your whole trip, don't stay here, you'll be very disappointed. Our only chief complaint was that the room got very hot at night. We couldn't open the window and weren't sure how to operate the air conditioner. We probably could have had it fixed, but didn't bother. The elevator was a bit of a pain as it's slow and can only fit 5 people but there never was an instance where we had to wait that long... if you're in that big of a hurry take the stairs. The free Wi-Fi was great, definitely came in use when we wanted to find our next adventure and yes the breakfast wasn't fantastic but it did the job.

Our desires were to be located near Times Square, in a non-smoking property, paying a rate which we deemed to be budget-friendly given the overall inherently expensive nature of our trip. Late October tends to be a difficult time of year for securing good values in midtown Manhattan, however we felt we had done just that by being eligible for the AAA rate. Comfort Inn Times Square manages to be in the \"center of it all\", and \"off the beaten path\" at the same time. As light-sleepers, we had requested a high floor, and that is just what we got. (In fact, had our room had a king bed, which is what we had reserved, instead of the queen bed we received, we would have listed the overall rating of this property as 5 stars, instead of 4). Our room was on the highest floor of the hotel - the 9th - toward the rear, facing east. There was no view, but blissfully there was no street-noise, which along with being a 100% non-smoking hotel, are our greatest priorities. The room was large enough, particularly with the decent-sized closet, that we had sufficient space to move about, without our cruise luggage being in the way. The queen bed was comfortable. The bathroom size was fine, and adequately ventilated. We did not find that housekeeping noise was a problem. There is just one elevator, and on one of the 2 mornings we experienced rather long wait times, as we competed with the housekeepers who needed to move their large carts up and down. This isn't a complaint, but I thought I'd mention this, as potential guests who are unfamiliar with New York should be aware that it's normal for older buildings to have just one elevator to accommodate several floors, and to expect to wait a prolonged time if situated on an upper floor. People with limited mobility should take note, as well as others who may object to taking the stairs, and perhaps ask for rooms on lower floors. Breakfast was abundant and varied, which is always welcomed. Every member of the staff with whom we interacted was pleasant and helpful.

I picked the latter. I knew it would not be as fun as staying in some neighborhoods, but we were looking for speed and value this time around. While this Comfort Inn is just a block off of Times Square, etc. and all that madness - the Naked Cowboy seems to never age - I had one of the best sleeps I've ever had after returning at midnight from said show. We were on the fourth floor with a \"no view\" window facing two brick walls and it was absolutely silent (and dark because of the walls). I guess room choice really does make a difference. Room is NYC small but I've stayed in smaller here, actually - there was space in this one for a chair and a desk. The bed was comfortable, HBO on the TV though we didn't watch it much, a clean and workable bathroom with hair dryer, tissues, shampoo, soap, We did use the safe to store our valuables. It's in a very large closet with light, which would be nice for stowing suitcases if you were staying for several days. The staff was kept busy as there were a number of senior citizens staying who seemed to need extensive help with directions, and foreign tourists. I do greatly appreciate we were able to get a room when we checked in early. Breakfast consisted of waffles, bagels, cereal, fried egg patties, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, raw fruit, coffee and juice - plenty of choice for me though I guess it would get old every day. Cramped and crowded in the breakfast room so we ate in our room. And yes, the elevator is verrrrrrrrry slow. Overall, this is a fine budget hotel, but keep the word budget in mind. If you want something a little nicer or in a more interesting neighborhood, scan the sales in advance.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cExactly as described when booking - perfect location\u201d", "Author": "emertoff", "ReviewID": "UR118231294", "Content": "Staying anywhere in Manhattan is not cheap however when one wishes to combine value for money with convenience, the Comfort Inn Times Square is an excellent option to consider. The location is just 2 minutes from Times Square and is yet on a quiet street. It is an excellent base from which to explore NYC, and it found it particularly convenient in the evenings when returning from a show, as Theater Row is within easy walking distance and thus no need for a taxi. The police presence in the city (partly I imagine due to the 9/11 anniversary) was also especially noticeable, and I felt completely safe at all times. The hotel itself is pretty much as described on its website, there is a standard continental breakfast from 6:30 am to 10:00 am. On offer are breads, rolls, waffles, fruits, cereal, yoghurt, egg, tea, coffee, juices etc. I found it perfectly adequate to start the day. The breakfast room itself is small - I counted just seven (7) tables, however at least for the first hour of service, there was plenty of room available. The room was bigger than I imagined and everything worked! Most importantly, there is an in-room safe and at least for a solo traveler, plenty of storage space. There was also a very useful NYC guidebook in the room (not to be removed) and in addition, the hotel themselves also provided a very useful guide to their amenities and polices as well as a lot of other general information about NYC - attractions, theaters, transportation etc. Not that you would be inclined to spend much time indoors, but there is a large Plasma-Screen T.V with something like 35 T.V Channels included, 2 in Spanish and the remainder in English - covering all the big networks - News, Movies, Sport etc. There is also a pay-per-view option. The rooms also have an FM Radio beside the bed which includes an iPod dock, and a reading light which I always like. There is no 'room with a view' as others have commented, and the room pretty much looked out onto a shaft/brick wall, however again and as for most people, I did not find this an issue considering the minimal amount of time you will spend in your room. The en-suite facilities were also fine, perfect water pressure from the shower nozzle and temperate control excellent. Housekeeping of a very high standard with facecloths, towels, and complimentary toiletries (shampoo and shower gel/moisturizer) replenished daily. On two occasions though, I returned to the room at around 1pm to take a break between points in my itinerary and at that point of the day, the room was not yet serviced. However, this is not a issue I would regard as in any way significant. The shower tray was also very small, and really only had enough space on which to put the free toiletries provided - which then kept falling off. I would have appreciated a bigger tray or a rack. I found that I did not have cause to interact a lot with staff as I really did not have any problems here - however from the front desk staff to the bellman, I found them all to be courteous, pleasant, and professional. In addition to the breakfast room on the ground floor, there is also a fitness center and business center, both of which are accessed using your key card. There is a printer in the business center and access was never a problem. The business center has 2 PC terminals and comfortable chairs. The lobby itself is very small and perhaps useful only when one is awaiting a taxi. Ivonne at reception called a taxi for me on departure and made several follow-up phones to ensure it was on its way and that I would be on time for international check-in. I would just have two minor issues - one with the in-room Air Conditioning as I found you could either have it switched on at full velocity or not at all - there seemed to be no 'medium' option. Secondly, the elevator must be the slowest I have ever encountered and so often frequently decided to take the stairs, again this is not a significant problem but it may slow some people with lots of luggage. Overall, I was very impressed with the value, service, and location on offer here and would heartily recommend it as an ideal and convenient base for a stay in Manhattan.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Arielun", "ReviewID": "UR118085968", "Content": "Great Hotel,Best location in the heart of Times Square!!!

I opted for a sheet change so I could witness clean sheets being put on the bed and they sent someone up very quickly.

No need to use the in-room pot. The room also has it's own ironing board and iron and a hair dryer that works. The plus of the rooms is that they provide four comfy pillows per bed and the mattresses are good-not extra firm or too soft. We asked for a two bed room, which I later learned are all in a row on each floor and do not have a view of the street. The window is high anyway so it wasn't important and the location was very quiet. We were on the 6th floor and heard no traffic or neighbors. The only negatives we found was that the door to the bathroom was mostly glass and you could see through it! Amazing, huh?! We had brought a garment bag for wedding clothes and there was a hook over the door on the bathroom side that we could hang it and cover the glass. Otherwise no privacy in the bathroom-beware! Also, like most places, they could use an upgrade in toilet paper and tissue. I did like the design with the sink and mirror in the bathroom and not in the sleeping area. I would definately stay here again to be able to walk to the theater and dinner. The savings over comparable hotels is probably $50 a day.

There are several restaurants within one block, along with two deli's. We enjoyed St Andrew's Pub and Restaurant, right across the street. The continental breakfast at the hotel has the usual items, toast and bagels, a couple of cereals, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.

We arrived at 11 PM exited and even planned a late dinner after check-in in a nice nearby restaurant. However the reception person printed a registration form with rates about $50 higher per night. When I showed him my printed confirmation letter which showed the original rates, he said there's nothing he can do and \"either sign the form withe higher rates or you cannot check in\".

He then tried to call Choice Hotels. It took some 20 minutes of waiting to talk to them, and amazingly they declined my rates too! After finally talking with Choice Hotels supervisor, it turned out that my rates were raised \"because I called them to ask for a room facing the back-side\" to avoid street noise. Needless to say - they never mentioned it would change the rate, and the hotel does not charge any extra for that anyway. It was after midnight when we finally checked in after giving up and agreeing to sign the registration form.

No wonder they have so many good reviews - it's truely a great choice of hotel when in Manhattan (Times Sq area). What we didn't like in the hotel was: 1. the rooms are really tiny - especially those not facing the street but this is not unusual in NYC hotels. The window we had was kinda fake cause it was facing the wall of another building, there was almost no daylight in the room due to that and it was very hot, but again it was also quiet. Also, you can't even open the window and have to rely on the airconditioning. 2. The A/C is very noisy and not great - sort of like too powerfull, it was soon very cold and \"windy\" in the room once it was on. But iit might be a good thing when the summer's hot... 3. Staying there is not the cheapest - but you pay for the area. We also found a great deal on hotels own website - they had a way better deal than all major hotel booking sites so definitely check it out! And now the things we liked and made our stay so pleasant: 1. the rooms & bathrooms are spotless clean, the cleaning staff are doing a great job! 2. we also enjoyed free continental breakfast - again the staff in the breakfast room are very efficient, very nice and helpfull, the place is clean, food is great - good choice (yogurts, juices, tea & coffee, waffles, bagles, pastries, donuts, fresh fruit etc.) & always very fresh & yummy. the tea & coffee is there all day long and you can take a cup to your room in the afternoon etc. 3. location is great - 2 mins from times sq, you can walk everywhere, to all major attractions, shops, sightseeing double-deckers etc. There's also plenty of good and not so expensive restaurants and bars (e.g. 2 Irish bars just opposite hotel), good quality take-aways etc. 4. There's also a tiny business centre (PCs, fax, printers, internet) at the hotel and it's all free of charge - e.g. we always travel with a laptop (free wifi) but we leave the printer at home;) - if you need to print your broadway tickets or other confirmations - you can do it for free in this hotel. very convenient I have to say if you're booking your attractions online and last minute. 5. They also have iPod docking stations in rooms - well done! wasn't expecting this and was delighted:) All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it.

We visit in February because the rates are lower; we have lots of fun despite the cold. We feel safe here. It is about 1/2 block down 46th St. from Times Square.

We were located on the 5th floor. Positives \u2022 The location of this hotel is awesome. I think this Comfort Inn should be renamed to the Times Square Comfort Inn instead of Midtown because Time Square was just at the end of our street. \u2022 Hotel offered free wireless therefore could connect from your room (given you have your own laptop). The wireless speed was really quick too. They also provided a business centre area available 24hrs and could use their pc\u2019s for internet and printer for printing. \u2022 Rooms were cleaned everyday although I don\u2019t think sheets were changed every day. \u2022 We had a closet in our room which was a bonus, we utilised this space to store our luggage. \u2022 Safe was available in room \u2022 An ipod docking station was also available so we could play tunes but we mostly used it to recharge our iphone \u2022 Free breakfast was included with stay. Comfort Inn provided different types of breads, pastries and cereal as well as coffee and juices. \u2022 There was a small gym area which was accessible 24hrs. There was a treadmill, bike and stepper but their equipment and was old. \u2022 There was a group of kids staying next door and were mucking around the hall way knocking on each other\u2019s door. We called and complained to the front desk and believe they resolved issue as noise and children ceased slamming doors soon after. \u2022 Room was very quiet could not hear street noise. \u2022 Flat screen tv with cable was available \u2022 The staff and service we experience was very good. During our stay we also experienced (at different times) a broken smoke alarm which kept beeping every couple of seconds and we managed to block our toilet as well. Each time concierge was more than willing to assist us and resolved the issues seamlessly. \u2022 The cost of Comfort Inn Time Square was a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area definitely value for money staying here. Negatives \u2022 Rooms are small but everyone who has stayed here and posted past reviews we\u2019ve read has mentioned that so it was no surprised. \u2022 Room needs a revamp of modern sleek furniture to utilise the limited space more effectively. We had a big wooden dressing table and a big wooden side table in our room which we didn\u2019t use. Changing linen and curtains wouldn\u2019t hurt either. \u2022 Room lighting was a dull probably cause of the colour of the walls and lack of natural lighting available. There was a small window in our room which gave us the view of a brick wall. \u2022 Room walls are pretty thin can hear neighbour\u2019s music, but then again we did have teenagers next door who liked to play music at 1am when it should be dead quiet. \u2022 Radiator needs updating. When on it makes a whistling noise when it is heating or cooling which would wake my husband up at night. When we turned it up it would be too hot once we turned it down it took forever to a point we would turn on the aircon. \u2022 Elevators were slow and could only fit probably 4-5 people at a time I\u2019d stay at Comfort Inn again because of its prime location to Times Square and the competitive cost.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston area", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice for a mom and daughter getaway\u201d", "Author": "bostonienne", "ReviewID": "UR25222125", "Content": "I hadn't visited NYC since before having my kids.

We walked to the Gershwin Theatre to see Wicked, which I highly recommend. Very clever story, fabulous special effects. Also within a few blocks, we went shopping up and down 5th and 6th Avenues, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Rockefeller Center, M&M World, the Plaza Hotel lobby, and more.

Overall, the hotel is clean, comfortable and has a great location. There were two issues that came up during our stay....the elevator and the check-in process. Our room was located on the 4th floor (there are a total of 9 floors) and the elevator was only functional part of the time. For us, this was not a major problem...since we are relatively fit and travel with carry-on size baggage. However, for guests with mobility issues or large luggage, this could be quite a problem..there are a lot of stairs and it is a narrow stairway. Next, The check-in process was time consuming and rather involved. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm (knowing that check-in was at 3pm), and asked if it was possible to check-in or else be able to store our bags until we could check in. The man at the desk stated that our room was not ready, but that we could certainly store our luggage in a secure storage room, and that our room would be ready at 3pm. Not a problem. We stored our bags, proceeded to walk around Times Square, and returned to the hotel about 2:45 to get off our feet. Much to our surprise, the lobby was full...all the seats in the lobby were occupied with guests waiting to check-in and the only place to sit was in the adjoining breakfast room. Needless to say, we were told that our room was still not ready....along with all the other people waiting. We sat down and waited until 3pm. Precisely at 3pm, everyone lined up (at least a dozen people) and waited to go through the check-in process. The man who had been at the desk during our intial arrival was there, along with one other gentleman, apparently a reservationist that had just recently started his shift. The original reservationist started to help a guest and seemed totally incapable of helping her...she was apparently checking in using \"Rewards Points\" and he told the lady that she would have to come back later and see the other reservationist. This original reservationist then proceeded to go in the back room, get his jacket and was leaving because his shift was now over. The remaining reservationist did an admirable job of getting us checked in and was left to deal with all of the guests....by himself. It then became clear to everyone standing in line that the reason the original reservationist (who went off-duty) told everyone their room wasn't ready was because he didn't want to check them in...he wanted to leave it to the reservationist with the next shift. It appeared that he didn't want to do his job - or simply didn't know how. In any case, it was a poor representation for the Comfort Inn. I should point out that it was just this one original reservationist that seemed to do a poor job, he had no aptitude for customer service and genuinely seemed disinterested in the \"comfort\" of the hotel guests. I sincerely doubt that the rooms weren't ready, because the cleaning staff did an amazing job. They were very thorough and efficient. For example, we had left our room at one point around 10:30am and returned less than a half hour later to retrieve an additional guide book and the room had already been cleaned. Due to the location, clean room, comfortable bed, and wireless internet access, we will likely give this hotel another chance. We travel frequently to the city and have stayed at a variety of locations. We have stayed at the Novotel and had very good experiences - they seem to have a higher level of service, with slightly higher prices.

There is also a continental breakfast offered here too (the area is a little small in that room, but to get a quick eat before you head out was great). There is a parking garage across the street that charges you $23 with validation from the hotel. My car was cared for, no problems at all and I was very nervous about that. We were also nervous about a lot of the hotel reviews that we checked out online, but this met our needs 100%. Really, how much time do you spend in the room anyhow?

I got extremely lucky (I think I may have gotten the last room available when I checked in), but even though I was a solo they gave me a room with 2 double beds - which the bellman said was one of the \"big\" rooms. This greatly added to my personal space to have the extra bed to pile my stuff, but the room was still a very tight squeeze - the foot of the bed is so close to the tv desk that you have to scoot sideways to get by. I'm sure the double room I reserved would have been unbelievably small. I had also requested a quiet room, and the room overlooked the back alley and the backs of other buildings. I heard almost no street noise. The only noise was some bells that clanged every morning at 7:30 am, which to me was the perfect time to get up anyway (I think they were from the church next door). That said, my experience was fantastic. The staff is great - everyone greets you with a smile and hello, answers any questions, is very helpful. The whole place is very clean. Breakfast is adequate. And the location is beyond compare - half a block to Times Square in one direction, close to several different subway lines. I felt safe at all times. Now, some people I think have been disappointed because they see all these 5 star ratings so they think it is a 5 star hotel - it is not - but it IS a 5 star VALUE...the 5 stars here on TA come from answering the question \"Rate your overall experience\" - and to most of us, it was 5 star. I will also post one of the few negatives here - my a/c unit was very noisy, so I couldn't run it all the time. I would turn it on for a short period, it cooled off the room quickly, and then I would shut it off. It might be a problem if the weather is very hot for your entire stay, for me it was not. And one great positive that I didn't expect and didn't know about until I checked in - free US phone calls! Anywhere! I called my husband and daughter on the west coast several times a day, made and cancelled many local reservations, and was charged not one cent for telephone charges! What a great bonus that was! Someone a few posts down said they were asked to write a good review on TA, and therefore the ratings are skewed. NO ONE asked me make mention of the hotel to anyone, this review is written purely based on my personal experience.

The room was clean and not as small as I expected after reading some reviews here on Trip Advisor. I shared a room with a girlfriend and we were both able to move around comfortably. The bed was large and comfortable. I only had two complaints and I wouldn't even call them complaints. There is only one elevator and it's really slow. Also, the room we were in had a weird bathroom door.

It was a late minute booking, as we had found fantastic rates for flights only a few week before we were due to leave! Comfort Inn Midtown was the cheapest hotel we found and included a continental breakfast which was perfect. I was a little scared at what we would find after reading some reviews on here, but we had none of the problems others' found, save for the noise issue, which I'll go into later. \u2022 The Hotel The hotel is located less then half a block away from Times Square. From our window we could see Times Square's TGI Friday and all the lights and billboards. It is also very close to train and bus links and we never had a long wait hailing a taxi. If you are coming to NY for the first time, or just want to stay where the atmosphere and livliness is, then I'd definately reccommend this hotel. As it was booked as a suprise for our anniversary I contacted the hotel and asked if something special could be done for our stay, like a complimanary bottle of wine or similar. I was in contact with an amazing member of staff called Anu. He was so helpful with all my questions about the hotel, it was more like 5 star service! When we arrived, it turned out we had be upgraded to a brand new HUGE room! The downstairs features a small gym, the breakfast room, a toilet, luggage hold (which is free) and a computer room (again, free) \u2022 The Room We stayed in room 902, overlooking the street and the Muse Hotel. Again, the room was amazing. We had plently of room for our suitcases and the bathroom was huge and well appointed, with a shower, bath, loo and sink. The hairdryer was loctaed in the bathroom in it's own unit. I'd heard rooms in NY were teeny, but this was bigger than some rooms I've stayed in in the UK by far. As for the main bedroom, we had two huge windows which let in a lot of light despite the massive buildings outside. The fire escape on the outside of the building looked amazing (a small point I know, but at least it fit in with the character of the room and building!) The bed was huge. WE have a superking size bed at home, and this bed was a little smaller, not by much though. There is also a flat panel TV with about thirty channels (Check out the adverts... so unbelieveably strange!), a dest with powerpoints for your laptop and a chest of drawers to keep clothes in. The coffee make was on top of the chest of drawers. Next to the entrance was a cupboard with the iron and ironing board, a rail with hangers to hang clothes, and a shelf (we didn't use it, but it could be great to keep the suitcase in) It was clean (all except under the bed, don't look under there if you're a clean freak like me!) and tidy and didn't smell at all! \u2022 Service We found all the staff to be welcoming and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy, and only took around five minutes. We were always greeted with a smile and a 'Morning!' or 'Afternoon!' which was a pleasant change form the NY'ers brashness! \u2022 Breakfast Breakfast was served from 7am til 10:30am. We mainly ate around 8ish. There was a wide variety of food. Cereal: Corn Flakes, Alpen-like nutty cereal and I think Rice Krispies. Bagels in every flavour were available, as well as Dunkin Doughnuts (which was a treat!) There was also toast and waffles too. Coffee, cappucino, tea and herbal teas were on offer, as well as OJ, AJ, Coke and Redbull (perfect for a much needed engery boost!) Everything was well stocked early morning, however on the few days we got up later (about 9ish) it was much harder to find exactly what you wanted, or a place to sit. Papers were available free of charge. \u2022 The Noise When I booked this hotel, I was a little anxious about it being loud. I have problems sleeping, acute insomnia means it takes me at least an hour (in silent conditions) to fall asleep, and being a light sleeper means the slightest noise will wake me bolt upright. A little annoying. Bearing the fact we were staying so close to Times Square in mind, I took earplugs and hoped for the best. The first night we were so jet lagged we fell asleep about 7pm (and woke up at 4am) No problems at all. The only thing that woke me was the next room coming in about 9pm after a meal and letting the door slam shut. The doors are quite noisey. The rest of the holiday the only noise we heard from the hotel was the occasional door slam (from the highly inconsiderate neighbours next door). Outside, there was a lorry-loading area which was the main problem. It started about 4am and didn't stop for an hour. Basically, they load metal pipes and things onto the lorries which then drive off. Reversing beeps, the noise of the carriers being loaded and the drivers and workers swearing and laughing at each other kept me awake, however with ear-plugs this wasn't a problem, and I slept like a baby! We also found the window wasn't quite shut properly (despite the fact they shouldn't have been opened) so once we closed it properly that muted the sounds a little. I would definately reccommend earplugs if you're a light sleeper. My bloke is a heavy sleeper and didn't hear a thing! \u2022 Pros and Cons PRO's Fantastic location Great staff Amazing room Breakfast choice was brilliant Cheap for the location! Any problems we had (Like the next room smoking which made ours smell disgusting) were quickly attended to.

Big room with small ensuite. TV with cable, hairdyer etc - what you would expect. I advise anyone to plan ahead before going to New York. We pre-booked our tickets for the Statue of Liberty Ferry at home before we left, and therefore didn't have to queue! We did go early in the morning however! Also I advise you to be at the Empire State for 8am - as the queues become huge and I'm sure you don't want to spend half your holiday stuck in one! We also pre-booked a helicopter flight across the city - which was fantastic! Yes, you can take your own cameras - dispite some reviews! The breakfast at the hotel was typically 'American' and sugary! But hey, it was lovely! Different selection of doughnuts, bagels with cream cheese, various cereals, juice, eggs. This was an added bonus, as most NYC hotels don't include breakfast in their tariff.

We were on the 8th floor in room 800. The elevator is small....actually the entire hotel is small in stature. It's very narrow and tall. Our room was small but well appointed. It had a queen bed with one end table and a desk. There was a tv, a window w/ AC and a bathroom. There was an ironing board and iron and a hairdryer. The room was exceptionally clean! The bed was very comfortable. I have never slept so well in a hotel before. I don't think it was all the bed I think it also had something to do with the amount of walking we did on Friday and Saturday! The view we had was of a brick wall but other than the initial first few minutes of being in the room we never really needed to look out side because we were...well....outside ourselves. The bathroom was spotless and once we let the water run a bit in the a.m. the hot water was plentiful. If you are undecided about staying at this hotel and you need a few reasons to tip the scale in favour of it then here are some: 1-Continental breakfast!!!! Do not underestimate the value of not having to think about the first meal of the day. This was such a nice feature, you get up and eat and you're off to see NYC. The bagels were really really fresh and delicious too. 2-Staff, they were very friendly and helpful! 3-Proximity to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Broadway Shows are literally on your doorstep. 4-Cleanliness 5-Efficient If you are there for a weekend definetly use the hop on/off tours by grayline. You can't miss them there are ticket sellers on every corner in Times Square.

It was an excellent value at under $150 per night. I planned to stay there again this year; however, when I checked the price for this year's trip, I was astounded to see that the price had doubled, so I looked at other options. I ended up staying at Comfort Inn Midtown, which was just a couple of blocks away and was now practically the same price as the Econo Lodge. (I paid $240-$270 for each of the 3 nights I stayed--Saturday, Sunday, Monday.) I was pleasantly surprised because Comfort Inn's bedrooms were twice as large, as was the bathroom. In addition, unlike the Econo Lodge, the Comfort Inn had an exercise room and an office with 2 computers; it also had a larger lobby and more soda machines. The breakfast was also a bit better. It included cereal, donuts, bagles, bananas, apples, mixed nuts, dried cranberries and white raisins, frozen waffles, yogurt, boiled eggs, coffee, juice, cappuccino, and even Red Bull (regular and sugar free). The location is ideal, as it is just a few blocks from the main activities in Midtown Manhattan, including Broadway, Times Square, 42nd Steet, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave, and the Museum of Modern Art. Although it is just a few hundred feet from the busiest part of Manhattan (the real core of the Big Apple), it is not excessively loud, because it is half a block off of the main strip. The view is not great. In fact, the only window in our room overlooked a tiny enclosed court; the only thing you could see were the windows of other people's rooms. The staff was generally friendly and helpful. I forgot to bring shaving cream. I inquired at the front desk if they had any. The woman at first said they had none. But, as I was walking away, she took the extra step of asking the man who is apparently in charge of supplies (he supplies the breakfast area, for example) if he knew of any. He not only found me a travel-sized shaving cream but even a couple of razors (which I didn't even ask for). They also went out of their way to help me arrange the receipts for a complicated payment arrangement that I had. Granted, this is not the Marriott Marquis (which is literally right across the street), but, then again, it costs only about half as much as the Marriott. Unless you are planning to spend a lot of time in your room while in Manhattan (who does that anyway?), choose this hotel as a great mid-level hotel. If you are on a tight budget, check the rates at the Econo Lodge first, but, unless it is substantially cheaper (at least $50-$100 cheaper), go ahead and book at the Comfort Inn because it is much roomier and has many more amenities.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood location in Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "Silvermannen", "ReviewID": "UR8686424", "Content": "Great location, good and clean hotel.

The bad: since we were on the front of the hotel, the noise from the garbage trucks seemed to go on all night long, the window air conditioner was quite loud (although, it does help drown out the garbage trucks!), the elevator is (still) quite slow, which was not a real big problem because the hotel was not anywhere near 100% occupied for our two nights. The staff, as before, was fabulous. What amazed me is that I remembered most of the staff from my visit here two years earlier. I did not expect that the same people would be working the front desk, the bellman positions, etc. This is the kind of stability that says something about a little hotel such as this. As before, is it the Marriot Marquis? No, that's one block to the West! It's also $400 bucks a night.

We drove in and needed to unload and park. We found the hotel, but the unloading area was full and there's no other parking on the street. We called the front desk to see if we could just park and they said to come to the front to unload anyway. After going around the block (which is a 15-20 minute undertaking in NYC), we were able to park in front. We then found that the hotel was short staffed and rooms were just being cleaned. They said 15 minutes, so I decided we'd park in the garage with the hotel rate and check in after that. Of course, the entrance to the garage was just a bit in the wrong direction on 46th. So around the block again for 20 minutes to the garage. When we got back to the front desk, the room was still not ready (he said 15 minutes again) but offered to take our bags so we could go look around. But before we got a chance to leave, good news, the room was ready so we went up.

The rooms at Comfort Inn are small, but perfect for one person or for a couple. The best part about this hotel is its location. You look outside the front lobby and you are literally looking right at Times Square less than a block away. It's also within easy walking distance of the north part of Midtown like Rockefeller Center. My first experience upon check-in was not positive, but the experience improved significantly. The TV in my first room did not receive CBS and March Madness was in full swing. They changed me to another room and the air conditioner did not work. It was March and chilly, but I need air to sleep. The maintenance man was ready to send me to another hotel but the manager took care of me. Third time's the charm and the third room was great. Aside from the small room size, the only other drawbacks were that the shower was extremely small -- not to be disrespectful, but an overweight person could not use the shower -- and the hotel seems older with old carpet, etc. But everything did seem clean, which is more important to me than new. The positives far outweight the negatives. The staff seemed friendly (especially by New York standards) and willing to help. The breakfast room offered a free continental breakfast. Two days I sat down and had toast, yogurt, fruit, etc., and two days I grabbed a muffin and coffee and headed out the door. Both ways saved me at least $10 to $15 a day. The other nice freebie is Internet service. There are two computers and a printer. I was able to check my e-mail every day and print my boarding pass for my departing flight. People were friendly and willing to share -- no one hogged a computer for hours. We did our business and moved on. There was also a treadmill but I was too lazy to use it.

As University students, we don't exactly have a lot of cash to spend on accomodations or transportation, so we decided to stay somewhere affordable and close to Times Square. Those two aspects of this hotel is pretty much where the positives end. I may be a little bit biased as I am used to travelling with my family, and we tend to stay at luxury hotels when we go away. However, I have stayed with friends at Comfort Inns before, several times actually, and I have never been as unpleasantly surprised as I was with this particular one. The room was small. When I say it was small, I mean small even by New York City standards. The two double beds were practically touching and I couldn't even pull my suitcase from one side of the room to the other. The bathroom was a tub and a sink, and it was freezing cold. The heater was a very noisy window unit and the temperature did not stay consistent. The main hallway was nice, but it is decieving. We stayed on the fourth floor, and the rooms were so close to each other that we could hear everything that was going on in the room next to us VERY clearly. On the last two nights that we were there there was a couple across the hall that seemed to be filming rather innapropriate amateur movies quite unabashadly, and with the door to their room wide open. We called the front desk, but no one did anything and the nonsense went on until about 3AM, when they finally shut their door. Room service was fine. The pillows were quite lumpy, the beds were hard and the sheets were clean, but very old and faded. We didn't have any problems with our maid service. Due to our familiarity with luxury hotels, we often lef cash sitting on the desk and bedside tables by accident, but it was always there when we returned at night. Breakfast was wonderful. it was actually oddly out of place in the otherwise budget hotel. There was fresh coffee, a cappuccino machine, bagels, muffins, several types of cereal, waffles, a toaster and fresh fruit. They also provided Red Bull free of charge every morning, which I found quite nice. I'm not a breakfast eater, but I did find myself waking up specifically so I could go down for some in the mornings. I probably would have returned to stay if I hadn't been so insulted by the manager when we checked out. The staff had, up until this point been very very friendly. The breakfast attendant did not speak any english, but he was always smiling, the maids were friendly and very accomodating, the front desk attendant was very nice and I had a good chat with him almost every night. However, the manager, a woman whose name I can't remember, was very rude. When we were checking out we noticed that there was a long distance phone call on our bill for $10. We looked up the area code and it was a call to Quebec. None of us had made a phonecall from the room, we all used our cell phones. At one point we tried to order pizza, but couldn't even get the room phone to work. Despite our best efforts, we couldn't even get the manager to care or check into it. She just kept shrugging it off and telling us we had to pay. I mean, it was only $10. We insisted on talking to someone else, but she told us there simply was no one else, and then announced that she had to go home as her shift was over.

After a four-night stay my conclusion is that I agree to previous reviews in the sense that this hotel is a very good option in New York City. I do not have new things to add to the many reviews posted here, but I would like to comment my agreement on the following advantages of the Comfort Inn Midtown: Price.- Very affordable considering the hotel is closely located to Times Square. Room/bathroom cleanliness.- They were spotless in my experience. Room amenities.- No luxuries here but you find adequate space for clothes (corner closet), iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffee maker, radio alarm & TV. Hotel amenities.- I found the free Internet access (two computers in a \u201cbusiness room\u201d), complimentary breakfast, and free daily newspaper as a plus. There is also a fitness room but I did not use it; it seemed small but adequate. Location.- As it has been repeatedly noted, the hotel is close to Times Square and the Rockefeller subway station; the convenient location gives you the chance to walk and be part of many activities or to take the subway or a bus wherever you want to go. Staff.- In my experience, the maid and the breakfast room attendant were even friendlier than the front desk staff, but in general terms all of the employees are kind and attentive. On the other hand, some travelers have noticed weaknesses and noted them here; I have an opinion on the following: Slamming doors.- Yes, doors do slam, then it is a good idea to be careful when closing them. Elevator.- It is old and small indeed but no big deal; my room was in the sixth floor so I usually took the elevator and its service was functional enough. Room size.- I do not know other New York hotel\u2019s room size, thus I lack a point of comparison; the room seemed small (I got a queen-size bed) but I do not need more space. Perhaps the rooms are too small if you travel with your family, but I did not have the chance to see a two-bed room to have an opinion on that. Temperature.- Other reviews complained of rooms being too hot\u2026 no problem in my stay, since tropical storm \u201cErnesto\u201d brought rainy days to the city. As a side note, throughout the almost 250 TripAdvisor Traveler Reviews about the Comfort Inn Midtown, there are some descriptions that are actually referring to the Comfort Inn Manhattan, which is located in 35th St and has a total of 12 floors; the Comfort Inn Midtown is a smaller hotel, with a total of 9 floors (new readers of these reviews, please take this into account\u2026 any descriptions of a 12-floor hotel and two elevators are actually not referring to the Comfort Inn Midtown).

We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awful\u2026). In addition, it\u2019s New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square.

Total price per night including taxes was $200. We usually stay at 3 or 4 star hotels but tried out a 2-star for a change (and price was much better). The hotel was small (in size and number of rooms) which was nice for a change. The elevator was big enough for about 8 people (or 3 with luggage). Warning - watch out for the elevator door! It slams FAST and HARD and I still have the bruise on my hand to prove it. The halls were very narrow. Our room was the smallest I have ever stayed in but was adequate. I called it a \"one-way room\" because only one person could walk around at a time! The window air conditioner was great and not loud at all - just a quiet hum. We were on the back facing the church next door and heard the church bells a lot which was nice. Actually, that was the only noise we heard the whole trip from our room. The bathroom was larger than I had expected. It even had a large frosted window in it and a large ledge to sit your stuff on. We only had the breakfast 2 mornings and it was fine - bagels, toast, boiled eggs, cereal, donuts, fruit, coffee, orange and apple juice, cappucino, coffee and tea. One person said there were only 4 tables in there, but there were 8 (I think). We did have to wait a couple of minutes one day. I think it would have been nice if the people who were finished would have left and given up their table instead of sitting there planning the day's itinerary while we stood there. The computer room (2 computers, free internet) was a nice plus because we could check on a few things while we were there. All the employees were friendly. One other thing - the doors really do SLAM when you leave your room. They usually started around 7 a.m. All you have to do is keep your hand on the handle and pull it shut and it won't slam. We couldn't figure out why people let them slam so much. Rude, I guess.

Check-in was lengthy because I arrived on March 1st, the day a new computer system was introduced, so there were some glitches with it, but that was to be expected and I didn't mind, since I was early anyway. The room I had this time, while still a queen-size, was a bit larger than the last time I stayed there, as was the bathroom. However, it seemed a bit more worn down than before: the bedspread had seen better days, the carpet was shredded where it met the bathroom, the telephone cord was frayed, the phone books were outdated, and there was a strange dent in the wall. I was on the sixth floor on the church side (the hotel is adjacent to a Catholic Church) so I did hear the church bells regularly. The room was very hot. When I asked the cleaning lady how to adjust the heat she simply opened the window, in the middle of a snowstorm! And there's still the problem with the doors that close themselves and slam loudly while doing so. If you're a business traveler and needing to get up in the morning this might not bother you, but I was there on pleasure and didn't enjoy the slams at 6:30 in the morning.

Back in April (2 1/2 months before our arrival date), we reserved two double rooms at the Comfort Inn Midtown for 3 adults and 3 children (reserved on ChoiceHotels). When we arrived at the hotel in July, we were told that there were no double rooms available because the hotel was undergoing renovations. (We didn't see any signs of renovations during our stay.) The front desk clerk offered to put us into two rooms, each with one Queen bed and a cot. We said this would be OK, but only if we were charged the rate that was advertised the previous evening on ChoiceHotels for this room type and date ($55 less per room than the rate we were quoted for our double rooms). He said he could only offer us a 10% discount ($14 less per room). He offered to walk us down the street to another hotel if we didn't want these rooms. We said this was unacceptable since we had to get ready to go see a show in a couple of hours. We then called Choice Hotels Customer Service (CHCS) using the front desk phone. I told the CHCS clerk about what had happened. He asked me if the hotel had offered to pay for our rooms at the other hotel. I told him that they hadn't. He then put my call on hold and contacted the hotel to get more information. The office manager told him that they had one double room available and that they had told us this. When the CHCS clerk came back to my call, he told me this and I informed him that this was not true. I told him I was fine with having only one double room, but only if the single room was at the same discounted rate as listed on the web site the previous evening. He put me on hold and contacted the hotel again and discussed this with the office manager. She spoke loudly and sounded very agitated. After their call, my call with the CHCS clerk was cut off. The office manager said it didn't matter, since the CHCS clerk would just tell me that there was only one double room available and the other room would be only $14 less. Again, I said this was unacceptable and asked her to reconnect me to CHCS. She then told me that they had two double rooms available. She said that we would need to pay $12 extra per person though. We said that we would not pay any extra charges than those on the printed copy of our reservation. She did not seem happy this response, but proceeded to check us in. She said something like \"I thought you would have been more understanding, but I guess you don't want to work with me\". I thought it was very unprofessional for an office manager to behave this way while other customers were in the lobby, overhearing this entire fiasco. Because our check-in process was so disastrous (about 20 minutes), none of us enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We would definitely warn others not to stay at this hotel, based on our experience, plus other reviews we've read since then. Make sure to check out other reviews with low ratings. Several of them describe very similar stories. There are several other nice hotels in the same area and price range, so make sure to choose your hotel wisely. When we filed a formal complaint with CHCS, we were told that someone in upper management of the hotel would contact us within 7 days.

I chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site and write-ups in a couple of travel books. Everyone's comments proved to be very accurate. The hotel is 1/2 block east of Times Square directly across the street from the very hip looking Muse Hotel. The street is quiet and we did not have any problems with security. In short, the location can't be beat. Great access to several subway stations gets you wherever you want to go in minutes, theater district is just a few blocks away, Radio City right around the corner, MOMA a couple of blocks past that. Many restaurants are within walking distance. You could walk to Grand Central if you weren't lugging bags. The hotel is very clean, the staff quite pleasant. The wi-fi worked perfectly. Breakfast is included, served in a small room off the lobby, and it is simple (bagels, doughnuts, dry cereals, fruit), but plenty to get you on your way in the morning. This is a small homey-type hotel, the photos on the web site make it look larger than it is. There is a small sitting area and window seat in the lobby, the front desk, a small exercise room, computer room and meeting room. The lobby is very clean and nicely renovated. I believe there are only 8 guest floors, with maybe 12 or so rooms on each floor. There is only one elevator, but we did not experience the excessively long waits that other reviewers have described. Our room was on the 5th floor, and it was an easy walk to take the stairs instead if we wanted. The room itself was quite small, maybe 10x12 feet? with a Queen bed, nightstand, small desk, small armoire with TV. The view out the window was of the brick wall of the next building, it would probably be nicer to choose one of the front rooms if you can. Each room has a window-mounted A/C unit - and this was our biggest complaint, it was very loud when on hi speed, somewhat less noisy when on its lowest setting. The bathroom was relatively large considering the bedroom size, and very nice, tiled all around with a pedestal sink, toilet, tub/shower. The towels are rather thin. Soap and shampoo/conditioner combo are provided, other than that, you'll need to bring your own toiletries. At the end of our stay, we checked out in the morning and checked our bags with the doorman until we were ready to leave later in the afternoon. When we returned to collect the bags, one of the people at the front desk called to me and told me I had left something in my room. I was very pleasantly surprised that she knew me by sight and room number as she handed my camera charger to me. I am normally a more luxury-oriented traveler, so I was concerned about choosing a \"value\" hotel. If you're the same way, but are willing to forego some of the amenities, this is a great choice. When it came right down to it, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The breakfast was a nice bonus, the location was fantastic and you can't beat the price -- we were able to happily spend our money instead on fun things like show tickets, etc. -- all in all, it worked great for us. P.S. If you are a AAA member, show your card when you check in.

By staying at the Comfort Inn, my wife and I had more money in our pocket to go out and enjoy the city - which after all, is what it is all about! Our 7-night stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown in May, while having no outstanding features, was comfortable and trouble-free; in other words, it did the job we wanted of it, and it did it admirably! Our expectations of the hotel - and our reasons for choosing it - were based on the reviews here. I guess we expected something a little run-down (but not too much), somewhat noisy at the front, perhaps occasional problems with the cleanliness of the bathrooms or linen. A few reviews suggested that some people found staff to be a little unfriendly or brusque, and that the breakfast provided \"ran out\" if you weren't there early enough. So we figured that at worst the hotel may be a little unpleasant, but for $130 a night we could live with that. It was a pleasant surprise then, when even our minor apprehensions were proven to be dead wrong. The room was clean and seemed quite new. Despite the fact that we had a 5th floor room at the front (after a check-in request for \"something quieter\" than the 2nd floor room at the front we were booked in to), we slept soundly through each night without any problems. The towels and bathroom were clean and fresh each day. The breakfast, while a little bland by the 7th morning, was plentiful (though glazed doughnuts for breakfast?!) And most importantly, the staff were out-going and helpful at all times. Best Points: * THE PRICE! * The location - although given the efficiency of the subway, next time I'd be tempted to take an even-cheaper outer boroughs hotel that was next to a subway station. * Room size was much larger than expected - a good 80cm on either side of the queen bed, and at least 1.5m between the foot of the bed and the TV cabinet. * Free internet access - a nice bonus. * Free newspapers at breakfast (if early enough) Not so good points: * No fridge in the room - I guess we assumed there would be one, and had plans to get groceries for lunch and some of our dinners. A fridge can be arranged, but costs an extra $10 per night. No thanks: we ate out. * Slow lift - unless the lift was already at our floor, the only time we waited for it was for luggage. When going down 4 floors, the steps were often faster than the lift. * Toilet often required a couple of flushes, and even blocked once; but was promptly fixed after we asked at reception. But really, these are minor quibbles. None of them produced more than transitory annoyances. For where it was (and compared to the reviews of other Manhattan hotels in the price range), the Comfort Inn Midtown was wonderful. The bottom line: would I stay there again?

So, one of us had to sleep on the hard-as-a-rock floor in a tiny little room. We were informed that we would get extra blankets for the person sleeping on the floor, although we only received 2 extra (not enough to make the foor even somewhat comfortable!) Also, there is only one tiny elevator in the whole hotel making it somewhat difficult and long to get up or down, as sometimes you had to wait for several trips before you could get on the elevator. On a good note, the continental breakfast was great. As we were leaving to go back to the airport, we asked the concierge to call us a taxi, as we were waiting in the lobby, they told us our cab was \"here\" as they literally pushed us out the street and made us walk up to times square with our suit cases to hail a cab ourselves! It was very rude. Not sure I'll be back to the comfort inn on my next stay in NYC!!", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, location and clean!\u201d", "Author": "madelynium", "ReviewID": "UR3471507", "Content": "I stayed here for 4 nights in May and was very pleased with the results and am glad that I trusted the reviews on this site.

What I really enjoyed about this hotel was that it was a non-smoking hotel. So many times even if you stay in a non-smoking room the lobby and halls of older hotels have an off odor to them. This was not noted at this hotel, I think, because of this policy. We were located in the back on the 7th floor corner room. Did not notice any noise except when it rained one night it came down onto the air condition unit and was kind of loud. Not unbearable. The couch in the lobby was tattered. I think it was an antique. I wasn't sure what I would find in the rooms but found everything said on this forum to be true. Clean rooms. Clean white towels. Maid service everyday. Family used the breakfast room and was satisfied until lunch came. We were out of our rooms by 9 am every morning and back shortly after dinner to get ready to go out again for the evening. Everything was always put back together after our rush of showers. We had a room that had the bathroom tiled. It was a small 3 inch step that all of us tripped over a couple of times. Bathroom was clean, no mold visible and new soap put out everyday. Rooms weren't especially pretty, but location was great. Would stay here again.

I constantly looked at the site for new reviews to see how this hotel measured up as I thought at $107 a night, how nice could it really be. But after reading consistent good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. And let me say that I am glad that I did. My mother and I went to NYC and just wanted a place that was clean and in a safe neighborhood. We wanted something centrally located and this hotel couldn't have been in a better location. Just yards away from the heart of Times Square and located near theaters and subways, it couldn't have been better. I requested a room with 2 twin beds and on a corner since I heard they were bigger. I was told that they didn't have corner rooms with twin beds, but when we checked in our room seemed significantly bigger than the other rooms on our floor. We were in room 307 which was in the back side of the building. It was a bit hot in the room and we didn't want the heat on or that noisy ac unit, so we opened the window a crack which let in a cool breeze. Let me say that it was like we were in the country. No noise whatsoever...you would never imagine we were only yards from Times Square. The room was kept clean and tidy during our 3 days and everyone was super friendly, especially the breakfast man. (Don't forget to bring some money to tip him). We were lucky and got a table each morning for breakfast, but it seemed to be quite full at the busier times in the morning. There is only one elevator..the only problem I see. But being on the 3rd floor we often walked down the stairs which weren't too bad. All in all this hotel was great and I would definatley recommend it to anyone who is looking to be in the heart of the city, have a clean room, breakfast included and save the money on a room you are never in for the finer things NYC has to offer.

If you are unfortunute enough to get a room at the front, allthough it may be roomy, you will need earplugs.The noise at night is horrendous horrendous horrendous. At times I was woken in the night terrified of this loud thunderous noise! But this is also because the hotel is on Times Square which is a NY version of Leister Sqaure - tacky busy and awful. Avoid at all cost Bubb gump Shrimp on Times Square, the service is the worst, the food is in edible and you cant see out the windows for the dirt. A must however is a drink at the Marriot Marquis. The bar/restaurant \"The View\" is on the 48th Floor and the views are fantatsic. Do not have dinner here though. Its a buffet with the smallest plates and apalling service. The best restaurant is opposite the comfort inn called Le Tre Veneizie. Its the best Italian with excellent customer service - a very rare thing in NY. Sights: Empire State: A busy gift shop with a view. Huge let down. Sky ride: Dont do it. Statue of Liberty: Worth a look Central Park: Wonderful if sunny, the Zoo is brilliant, avoid the horse drawn ride, you get 20 mins around the front bit of park for $40, disapointing. Pier 17 & South Street Sea Port: Stop and a have some clam chowder. Brooklyn bridge: A walk with a view - brilliant. New York public Library: Good for 10 mins to kill. Grand central: Loved it. A good affordable place for lunch. Macys: Busy and hot but good bargians: Go to the Visitor counter, show a passport and you get a card giving 11% everything in the store including sale items. For dinner get a cab to Greenwich Village or Little Italy. Overall, New York is an okay place to go for a trip but i would not go back.

My girlfriend and I just got back from a 5-night vacation in New York City, and we had stayed at this location. We went there because of price and the positive reviews on this site. I knew that I wanted to minimize my costs in NY while staying at a decent hotel, so this place fit the bill. So, let's get on with this review, and I'll try to detail it as well as possible, since I just got back from there today (it's still fresh in my mind). The lobby area is elegant enough. Nice marble floors give way to the concierge and the dining room, which is used for the abundant breakfast items (nothing fancy, but there are bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, various cereals, strawberry yoghurt, and coffee... I'm not sure if I'm missing anything, since I ate there 2 of the 5 nights there only...) There is a small exercise room up the hall a bit, with a treadmill, a bicycle machine, and I believe a stairmaster. Overall, good lobby amenities. Nothing out of the ordinary, but what is there, it's done well. We stayed on the second floor in the back. The view was nothing to write home about, simply facing a brick wall. Beware, as very little light comes through the black-out curtains and the brick walls. We wanted to wake up early and go sight-seeing, but since no real amounts of light made it into the room, we had a hard time getting up, since we were so comfortable and lazy in our cozy bed. Of course, that does ensure that you get a good night's rest, as there is very little noise and light that comes into your room! The room ameneties are excellent for what they are. Quite a large, decent TV, with about 35 channels. A comfortable, queen-size bed. A nice chair and table. Drawers. A beautiful painting hung over the bed. Just little things that you can find in every hotel, and done well here as well. The furniture, as far as I can tell however, was not run down or did not seem that it would break in an instant, a good sign. The bathroom was excellent, having a shower stall and a modern-looking basin. There is a hair dryer in there as well. Water from the shower was good, cold and hot, and the pressure was good. The rooms were kept spotless, which I was thankful for. Clean towels every day. Clean sheets every day. Amenities replaced as needed, such as new soap bars. Vacuumed every day. It was wonderful, because I cannot live without cleanliness. I've heard horror stories about some other hotels, and I'm glad this isn't one of them. The cleaning lady was one of the sweetest lady I've ever met. You'll know her when you see her. She is so sweet, in that little accent of hers, telling us when our room would be ready again, and always greeting us warmly whenever she saw us. This was a nice touch, especially when you meet lots of people in the city who are too rushed or care too little for niceties. This warmthness also extended to some of the staff members, but she was definitely the person that stuck out in my head. Oh, and so is the guy who encourages you to eat breakfast heartily. He just keeps encouraging to take food! He was also a nice guy. Staff at the front were friendly and helpful for the one time I asked for help, and that was how to take the subway to get to the airport. So I can't really comment on that. They seemed generally friendly though, always ready to answer questions that you had. Overall, a great value hotel. Clean rooms are important to me, and this had them. Oh yes, and there was plenty of space to move freely around the room. It's not a big room, but it's a big-enough room to be comfortable enough.

Simple as this: If you're doing New York on a low to mid-size budget, you simply cannot go wrong with this hotel. The location is perfect - a 20 yard stroll and you're in Times Square. It's in a great position for all of the main attractions (Empire State, Guggenheim, Central Park and all the main shopping districts are within 10 minutes walk) and conveniently placed for the subway to other areas. There's an excellent choice of Deli's and restaraunts around the hotel (Check out the Guinness in the Irish bar next door!) As for the hotel....well, It's pretty good, even aside from the location. Yes, the rooms are small. But what do you expect for $99 per night - a butler?! The bed was very comfortable, the shower was hot and it was clean, tidy and pleasant. Internet access was free downstairs and there was a small selection of exercise machines downstairs (No-one mentioned this!!!) The breakfast is a big bonus. There are doughnuts, bagels, rolls, fruit, yogurt, cereals and tea\\coffee, apple and orange juice. I don't know what people are complaining about - there's loads, I found the service friendly and it was the perfect way to start the day. Not many New York hotels offer breakfast, it's a real benefit. Staff are friendly, helpful and polite. We were able to check in an hour early, and they kept our bags for us on the day we checked out. Look, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel. If you want the lap of luxury - sure, there's much better hotels. But you will pay for them - and how!!!

The hotel is pleasant enough, in a perfect location, but I found my front-facing room looking on to 46th Street extremely noisy. At all hours of the day and night, garbage trucks would pull up a few doors down the street and stand there for up to an hour, grinding refuse. Fortunately I'd brought ear plugs, which came in very handy when I was regularly woken at 3 or 4 in the morning. There was also a permanent roaring, whooshing sound coming from outside - possibly from a big airconditioning unit on a building opposite. On the plus side, the room was spacious, and definitely nicer than the quieter but smaller and stuffier rooms at the back of the hotel, which look directly on to a brick wall, so I decided to rather put up with the noise. The breakfast that was included in the price was also a plus, as was the unlimited internet access available in the little computer room off the lobby. I also enjoyed having a coffee-maker and hairdryer in the room. However, on my next visit to NYC, I'll probably go back to the Portland Square Hotel where I've always stayed before. It's round the corner on 47th Street, so the location is just as perfect, and the price is far less - $105 for a standard double ensuite, compared with $162 at the Comfort Inn. I've always asked for a street-facing room there and have never had a probem with noise, and at least you can open the windows and get a breath of fresh air, which you can't do at the Comfort Inn. The rooms might be a bit more worn-looking, but are spotlessly clean with towels and linen being changed daily, and the bathroom pristine, with all the usual toiletries provided. There is also air-conditioning, cable TV and an in-room safe - very handy. No, breakfast is not included, but one can get a cheap, delicious breakfast at the Evergreen Diner right across the street, so that's not a problem.

We always got seats and the guy setting it up is VERY helpful.

We booked online through Comfort Inn's web page and got a AAA discount at a great rate from midweek (June3-5). The rooms were tiny, although clean and quiet. The location made up for the small room. Being so close to Times Square and the subway were an added bonus. I would definately recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and want a room close to the action and in a safe location.", "Date": "June 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland, UK", "Title": "\u201cOasis and a real Haven in manhattanin...!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1757990", "Content": "We stayed at Comfort Inn..23 thru 30th March 04 Fabulous wee smart quiet hotel...staff genuinely friendly..if you make the effort also ! Rooms clean and functional....although you may face a wall !...however because of its superb location you will be out most of the times ..strolling around ! Watch out for your Air con Unit..ours needed 'fixed' as rooms built up quite a heat Some room doors can bang shut..so do think of other guests ! Breakfast room is a treat ..Antony'hovers' and makes sure everybody is serviced (with a genuine smile.. not the \"have a nice day\" insincere nonsense either) ...good selection of all you might need in a continental breakfast. 46th Street is a very mixed activity area..with a Church next door.Bells calling the faithful are quite pleasant..& not loud We enjoyed our strolls morning and night....with no real worries Would defineatly go back.....saw the large 'lines', at other Hotel check in/outs..you wont get this here !!", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coon Rapids, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value for NYC\u201d", "Author": "BarbDale1956", "ReviewID": "UR1756913", "Content": "Stayed here from March 17 - 21. This is a great value for a hotel in NYC. We paid $107 per night, which included a fairly substantial continental breakfast. First - the room was a decent size. We did not feel cramped. Second - the bed was comfortable, as was the temperature of the room. Third - we barely heard any noise from neighboring rooms even though the hotel was sold out. Fourth - breakfast included coffee, capaccino, juice, cereal, good fresh donuts and bagels, apples, bananas, yogurt and jellies, cream cheese, etc. Many days we only snacked in the afternoon and ate our next full meal for dinner. Fifth - room was done beautifully each day, asked for extra pillows and they were there when we returned. Sixth - you could not ask for a better location - 1/2 block off of Times Square. Seventh - we felt safe in the neighborhood and in the hotel. Eighth - staff was very friendly and helpful. Only negative - our room faced 46th street. Needed ear plugs to block out the garbage truck noise each morning around 5 am. Believe me, it was loud. Ask for a room away from the street. We will definitely go back to this hotel.", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Broadway at Times Square Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d112021-Reviews-Broadway_at_Times_Square_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$114 - $353*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">129 West 46th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10036</span></span> (Formerly Comfort Inn Times Square)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514175", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/44/65/70/guest-room.jpg"}}
