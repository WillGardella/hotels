Small kitchenette was great to make b'fast and coffee. Next visit we wanted to stay in one of the small studios with private lawn area. I was in SD about a month before scheduled family vacation at Bahia. Drove over, picked exact studio I wanted. Made reservation with specific instructions. Called a few days before to confirm. A ok. Called morning of departure to confirm specific request. \"No problem\" from hotel. Arrived after seven hour drive and my requested (and several times confirmed) studio rented out a half hour earlier. Having stayed in many, many hotels on business trips, I just backed up and asked how we could resolve the problem. Manager showed me two other available units. One smaller studio behind their marina, one studio directly downwind from trash dumpsters. Both not ok. Asked again what we could do to resolve non-availability of much confirmed studio. End result: five days in Presidential Suite. Top Floor, facing Seaworld. Welcoming wiine and fruit basket. This time wine and fireworks from private balcony every night.

Very spacious room and very clean. Having a small kitchen and table was wonderful for easy breakfasts, snacks and chilling out with a glass of wine in the evening while enjoying the view.

It is close to Sea World and other family oriented attractions. My taxi from the airport was $25 including tip. There is also a shuttle from the airport that makes multiple stops and is $12 per head. If you drive your own car, you will be able to part for free near your room. While there is no taxi queue, the hotel has an agreement with the local Yellow Cab to dispatch cabs on call. When I checked out to got to the airport, the cab was there in about three minutes. The hotel also has an agreement with Yellow Cab for a flat $20 fare to the airport. While some of the family attractions are within walking distance, the hotel will arrange shuttles or taxis to others or to shopping. My taxi dropped me under a port corcher and I entered a small neat reception area. This intimate area, along with the cafe and lounge, comprise the interior public spaces of the hotel. There was no real gathering spaces in which to meet other guests. I did find the guests open and welcoming in the cafe and lounge. Check-in was OK. I did not have to wait. I was surprised that my credit card was put in an imprinter, rather than just scanned, and that I had to fill out my name and address. While it was not yet the \"check-in time\" and while there were a few people waiting for their rooms, my room was ready. They offered help with my luggage but I did not use it. Directions to my room were offered and clear. Rooms open to the outside and the walk-ways were not covered. I happened to arrive on one of the 20 days a year where that matters in southern California. The design and decor are north African but not too cutesy. The furnishings were ample and sturdy but not terribly creative. I had a parlor suite with a very large living and dining space and a small bedroom. There was a fully equipped kitchenette. There was a small range with oven. a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and Toaster. There was even a garbage disposal. There was a sliding door to a full-size deck with two lounges. My room overlooked a small beach, a small marina accomodating boats up to forty feet, and beyond that the harbor. Closet space was adequate for two for a few days but might have been tight for a family of four for a week. Drawer space, on the other hand, was very good. The lavatory offered two bowls and a large mirror. There was a private room for the tub and the toilet. The shower was in-tub and offered the curved shower curtain bar that some of us have come to like. Plumbing is modern, hot water is ready, and flow was good. There was a hair-dryer, ironing board, and iron. There was a telephone and a large flat-screen TV in both rooms. In addition to about 30 TV channels both offered current-in-theater movies. The one in the living room had a keyboard and joy-stick for internet access and games. The hotel offers free Wifi Internet access in rooms, conference rooms, and public spaces. The access code was on my check-in sheet and was pointed our to me on check-in. It was difficult to guess but easy to remember. Access, coverage, and speed were good I never saw a housekeeper but every time that I returned to the room everything was freshened and in its place. Food was excellent, portions, generous, and prices moderate. I ordered the Wedge and Rock Shrimp Macaroni and Cheese. They offered to box what I left and I got a great lunch the next day. For families, order family style. They serve in the Bahia Cafe with al fresco dining, and the Tangier Lounge. I ate breakfast in the Cafe (a little chilly and damp for al fresco that day) and dinner at the bar in the Tangier. Service was informal and personal. Guests were gentile, friendly, and in resort attire. Incidentally the Tangier has antique belt-driven ceiling fans; a nice touch. There are guest washers and dryers and an outside valet offering one-day service but no on-premise laundry or dry cleaning. Other amenities include spa, swimming pool, fitness center, video arcade, playground, tennis, shuffle board, gift shop, ATM, and business center. There is also a marina adjacent to be property that offers sailboats and powerboats for rental. The hotel operates a 2-deck paddle-wheel boat for dinner and harbor cruises. There is no charge but space is limited so ask for a ticket. For groups, the catering was very good. We got everything we asked for promptly and unobtrusively. In addition to our four hour meeting We had a sit-down dinner for 15 people. I had the prime rib, served with salad, potatoes, carrots, asparagus, and dessert; excellent. One last word. There was adequate staff and active management. I enjoyed the gardens and the lighting. On one stroll I noticed that a ground light had been smashed. The next time I passed that spot, the lamp had already been replaced.

Our first impression of the property was that it seemed very lush with mature tropical plants, giving us the feeling that we were visiting an exotic tropical resort. Upon entering our room, we found it to be clean, but the furniture seemed to be somewhat worn. Thankfully, my girlfriend isn't the type to act like a princess, so it didn't seem to matter. The bed was nice, and the proximity to the beach was fantastic. Our breakfasts were included in the 3 night reservation (thanks to Allegiant Vacations) and we were very happy with the service and quality of food. The prices on the a la carte menu were very reasonable, so we were not restricted to eating from the buffet. Upon checkout, we made our way to the airport and with less than an hour to go for our flight back to Bellingham, we realized that I'd forgotten to take our passports out of the hiding spot in the drawer in our room. Frantically, I phoned the front desk of the hotel and asked if they could find them for us and send it in a cab to the airport terminal, as we had no time to come and go. This is where the service gets very impressive: - the bellman Cody, offered to drive our passports himself to us so that we could make the flight and not have us worry about a cab driver potentially messing up the situation. 20 minutes later, he showed up with our passports, just in time for us to make the flight :) So all in all, I'd say with all the positives that we'd experienced during our stay, we found that the dated furniture was very insignificant and probably allows the Bahia resort to be as affordable as it is.

For the duration of our vacation I was actually looking for something to complain about the Bahia so I could justify the reviews, but it never happened. Our check-in was smooth and we got a fantastic Bay View Room. Our big balcony overlooked the bay right outside our room. The room was large and clean, and had a kitchenette with full-size fridge and sink, microwave, coffee-maker, stove, and cupboards supplied with pots, pans, cups, and silverware. The bathroom was very clean and had an outside vanity area. Our king-size bed was comfortable. The room also had a sofa sleeper (which we did not use), 2 bar stools, 3 chairs and a table. We had asked the hotel for a crib for our toddler and when we went up to our room the crib was already there waiting for us. The hotel grounds are gorgeous! Lush landscaping everywhere! There is a large pond spread throughout all the foilage and trees and it has acquired a few resident ducks. There is also a seal pond where the resort holds their rescued seals. We watched the daily feedings several times~such a nice perk to a resort. The gift shop was tidy and held a variety of souvenirs. We ate breakfast at the cafe almost every morning and the food was fantastic. I would say the pricing is average for a resort cafe ($8/meal for breakfast). I'm not sure what people expect when they are on vacation? There are a few fast food places around that have cheap food, but we were on vacation and wanted nice meals. We ordered room service and it was promptly delivered and the order accurate. My husband accidentally left his wallet on the tray after we were done eating our food. We put the tray outside our room and left it for room service to pick up. We heard a knock on our door about an hour later and an honest hotel employee returned my husband's wallet to us...with everything in it! We visited Sea World (2 mile walk) and walked Bay Side a few times to surrounding restaurants and stores. There is a store just up towards the pier that you can stock up on necessaties and food. We wanted to check out Belmont Park, but when we arrived they were closing at 5PM. Their hours posted were that they were open till 8PM but we were told their hours are subject are to change.

The hotel staff were always friendly and accomadating to us. The only thing that we were disappointed about was that when we booked our vacation through Sea World Parks we were told the hotel had airport transportation.

Having read all the negative reviews, as discerning and regular travellers, we were filled with great trepidation and so emailed the hotel ahead of time to ensure that the requests we had made to Travelrepublic had been noted; quiet location, bay view and non-smoking. We had a very helpful & reassuring response and even free breakfast for 2 up to the value of $35/day - probably as we were staying for 15 nights which is longer than most. We flew into LA and had a 2\u00bd hour drive to the Bahia. Stunning location along the coast, set back from the main road. It had a lovely driveway with exquisitely maintained gardens throughout. Our check in was very smooth with Scott, who was both courteous & charming. We were also delighted with our free upgrade to a suite! Our room was in a 4 storey high block right at the end of the hotel grounds, overlooking the bay. Parking was easy, we always found a space to park near our block. We were absolutely delighted with our suite which was massive & had everything we could possibly need. The firm bed was so comfortable and there were numerous good quality pillows.There was ample storage, large TV, lounge area, well equiped kitchen - we only used the fridge, separate area with a dressing table with plenty of plug sockets and a good sized bathroom with plentiful towels. The balcony overlooked Mission Bay and the marina. As many birds also wanted to enjoy the view, the ground covered with the plastic grass was not as clean as it might have been and the one lounger was rather tatty; no worries we didn't use the balcony apart from to enjoy the view. The air conditioning was effective. The walk from our block to reception was about 3 minutes - perfect as it meant we were well away from the regular weddings that took place. There was a visitor information desk with staff on hand to help you plan trips and print out routes. The hotel had preprinted lists of the main tourist attractions with 'spot on' directions of how to get there - so useful. There was also free high speed high internet access for guests. The inside dining area was pleasant but far more beautiful was outside with lovely large parasols. The choice for breakfast (6.30am - 10.30am, very good timings) was excellent, either a buffet for $14.99 or \u00e0 la carte. We opted for the latter and could particularly recommend the American breakfast with delicious bacon and potatoes saut\u00e9ed in lemon, the eggs benedict, eggs florentine and granola. Service was sometimes slow, but when you're on holiday does this really matter? We had 3 evening meals there and were less impressed ($9.99 - $15.99 for an entr\u00e9e, reasonable but not great food) . One evening there was an outage which affected the whole of California! The hotel supplied us with fluorescent wands and then as we were advised not to drive because the traffic lights weren't working, they cashed in on the opportunity to provide a BBQ at a very steep $15.99 pp. This was very overpriced, the quality of the food poor and there were numerous complaints. There was a small gift shop, the Tangier bar and a lovely landscaped pool for 2 seals who had been rescued by the hotel. The hotel's pool was spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds; occasionally all were occupied but there was always the beach instead. There was a charming, friendly lady who worked at the bar. Bit of a palava though with towels, signing a paper each day to take towels, return the towels then the paper was returned to you. The gym was well kitted out, but we didn't see anyone using it! We loved the beach, a few steps from our block and it was always deserted, so there was no pressure to get there early for beds. The beach was raked daily, the beds were very comfortable and views breathtaking. The hotel was a popular venue for weddings and they took place with great regularity often on the beach, mainly at weekends. Guests would often then transfer to one of the hotel's two paddle steamers for the dinner. For the other, reception desk had free tickets for hotel guests to enjoy a short trip leaving daily from 6.30pm and thereafter an hour later to take you across for the 20 minute ride to one of the sister hotels; The Catamaran Resort Hotel. During the short passage you have time to enjoy the views, have a drink and the live music. Having seen this other hotel which was much more expensive and formal and along a very busy, noisy high road, we were so pleased to be at the Bahia. The Bahia was well situated to visit so many places. We would particularly recommend the Gas Lamp Quarter (eat in Rock Bottom) and Little Italy (eat at Zia's Bistro), less impressed with Sea Port Village. We ate 3 times at Tony Roma's, famous for its amazing ribs, 5 minutes away along Mission Boulevard. We loved the Old Town, really buzzing, the old historic houses to visit, lots of bars and restaurants playing live music. We had been told about Rocking Baja (mexican food) which was outstanding - live band playing Eagles, Beatles etc - wonderful! We visited Coronado Island and walked round the famous Coronado Hotel - beautiful. The upmarket La Jolla is also a must, 15 minute drive. La Jolla Cove with the seals basking on the beach was delightful and take a look at the historic hotel La Valencia. Del Mar, about 20 minutes drive is stunning, the town is pretty and the beach magnificent. Balboa Park, is also 20 minutes away and packed with many interesting museums and galleries to visit. Very good shopping at Fashion Valley, a 10 minute drive away. Ate in two of our favourite restaurants; California Pizza Kitchen and The Cheesescake Factory. There were two good outlets about 30-40 minutes from the hotel; Carlsbad was the better. We loved our day at the Wild Animal Safari Park, about an hour's drive; worth paying the $80 to do the Asia & Africa tours - look for coupons in the magazines, got $7 off pp. As we had done Seaworld, 5 minutes form the hotel and other places on other trips, this holiday was more relaxed and less frenetic.

Parking is free and you have no problem parking by your room. The food is ok...we had dinner the first night there and breakfast the next day but we were on the go everyday. Mission bay is great to Kayak too...over by the hyatt the sea ions come right up to you! Great having a room w microwav,bigger than average small fridge. Kids had fun playing tennis. The grounds are nice to walk around. the beach area has small playground for younger kids And the views are pretty.the seals are nice to see ,wasn't around for feeding time. It's a nicer place to stay than mission valley /hotel circle not too far. Not as urban as the downtown areas. Still was quite pleased to stay here than by Seaport Village. \"look beyond the surface impressions\" if you have doubts. It was a nice place to stay.fairly priced.

This time, my wife and I were accompanied only by our daughter. Previously, we had stayed at the Paradise Point resort, which is very nice generally, but on our last visit , the beach was a mess and we found ourselves irritated by the extra charges, like parking and internet access, tacked on our bill. Surprise! So, this year, we decided to give another resort a try. After some internet research, we settled on the Bahia. All in all, I would describe the experience as . . . okay. It wasn't as expensive as Paradise Point,and there were no surprise charges. However, our room was a typical mid-range hotel room, not a bungalow as we had at Paradise Point. Bungalows are available, we just didn't get one. The Bahia is old, built with a Moroccan theme that must have been very cool when the Rat Pack was still around. The place is frayed around the edges. One of the couch cushions was torn, and the curtains were a bit ragged. Everything was clean, though, and was kept that way. The staff is friendly, but quite young, and seemed a bit inexperienced. The amenities were not terrible, but did not live up to my expectations, which, admittedly, I had built up in my imagination. The fitness center, which I had imagined as rows of gleaming dumbbells and the latest machines, turned out to be a small room with four treadmills and a home gym. The free arcade, which I unrealistically thought would be a veritable Dave and Buster's, was a small, dark, chilly room with about ten machines of ancient vintage. My daughter liked it, though.The grounds, advertised as lush and tropical, were just that, but were only about twice the size of my front lawn. The private beach was a narrow strip, clean enough, but not ideal for swimming. We did not rent paddle boards or boats, though they were available. The lounge chairs on the beach were elderly, but comfortable. The pool was good, and though the area filled up in the afternoons, it was still possible to get in a decent swim. The tennis courts could host two games at once, but were under some kind of renovation. The cafe was a little pricey, but good for breakfast, and the service was attentive and friendly. Possibly the best thing about our room was the view, morning, afternoon, and night, beautiful. All in all, it was not a bad experience, but neither was it one that will fill me with fond memories in years to come. Whatever inadequacies the resort held were made up for by the city of San Diego, where the weather was beautiful, the food good, and entertainment easy to find, as usual. I would visit San Diego again, I will stay in a resort again, but I don't think I'll go back to the Bahia.

There's nowhere in walking distance to buy supplies to make use of the kitchen area. We found one but didn't like the flies on the inside of the bagel packets!! We had dinner in the cafe which was better. Over the weekend the bay does get very busy and noisy. It isn't really private as anyone can walk around the place. Mission Beach is like Blackpool in the UK and not really our scene. We had a drive up to La Jolla and wish we had stayed there instead. From here it was a quick and simple drive to the zoo and the city area too. The trip on the Bahia Belle was nice. We were given complementary tickets and used them on our last night.

Or maybe a lot nervous LOL. Been there. Depending on how many opinions you have read, you are probably staring at the pictures on the website, and looking for the more positive reviews - especially those that tell you not to pay attention to all the bad ones and that the place is actually quite charming and wonderful and that you will have a great time. I understand. I was you. I read all the same reviews; chose to believe the ones I wanted to, looked at the pictures and convinced myself it couldn\u2019t be that bad. I booked a four night stay in a Bay Front Suite. The location of this property gets this review two stars - and this is generous, very generous. Again, if you have been reading other reviews then you are already worried about the smelly military-bunker quality of many of the rooms here - especially the ones closest to the water. Apparently some of the rooms facing parking lots have been \"upgraded\" but I took a look inside a few of these and was not at all impressed. Our room was old, smelly, dingy, and just gross. The bathroom was nasty with mildew we could see and smell on the shower curtain. We found clumps of dirt on the carpet and actually found a few nuggets of weed on the floor. Not entirely a bad thing, but not with a toddler finding it first. So, assuming you are going to book anyway, LOL, let me at least give you some important advice. Make sure you CALL your reservation in. DO NOT book through Bahia\u2019s website, or Expedia, or any other method. We booked our stay using the Bahia website, and from that moment we were treated like second class citizens. Not knowing or understanding this of course, I figured that booking through the website was a good idea - it is 2011 after all. I also made a simple request on the reservation for a ground floor room. I also called the reservation desk a few times leading up to our visit with the same request. On our way down to San Diego I called the front desk directly and asked again. Now, I have worked in hotels and I know it is tough to guarantee anything until you are standing in the lobby and the desk clerk checks what is available. I get it. So when after all of this, I was actually booked in to a nice ground floor room I was excited and was prepared to overlook lots of other issues that may have cropped up. The room was not ready when we were checked in since we showed up two hours before check in time - no problem - I expected that. So, we drove around for awhile checking out the area. About a half hour later I got a call from a \"manager\" at the front desk telling me that there was a mistake and that I could NOT have the room we were already \u201cchecked in\" to and that there was no other option or suggestion. This was very disappointing, but again, I am reasonable to a point. When I questioned this further I was told point blank that my reservation was booked online and therefore I was being bumped from the room in favor of a guest with the same request who just showed up but who had CALLED in their reservation instead. Again, I booked this reservation using Bahia's own website - NOT Expedia or some other bargain hunting website. I paid the posted rate of nearly $400 per night, but alas, my money, my request, and my family were somehow not as important because I had the nerve to use their website to book. Huh? Seriously, huh? I was floored. I mean, at least make something up that is a little more reasonable than that. Hell, I talked to the Bahia reservation desk several times too \u2013 I just booked through the website. I still don\u2019t get this at all. Further attempts throughout our stay to fulfill various requests were all met with a level of disdain and contempt one might expect asking a cranky night clerk at 2:00 a.m. at a roadside Super 8 for three wake-up calls, extra towels, and to come up and fix the TV. To sum, this is definitely not the place for us, and I would strongly caution anyone with expectations higher than a dirty surf shack or your kid\u2019s tree house to skip it all together.

I loved the location of the hotel, we could walk to Mission Blvd and the ocean, very close to Seaworld and town. We were on the Bay side with a main floor suite- pull out couch bed in living area (even though our reservation said 2 queen beds...), and a room with a queen bed. The room was old, the mattress on the bed was very uncomfortable, the pull out couch bed wasn't bad though. We had an infestation of little sugar ants- no big deal, other than that the room was clean and not moldy or musty. The bedroom window has shutter windows so that the sound from the parking lot- right outside the room was very loud. Also when room 140 was shutting their door- they slam- it felt like they were in our bed with us. Our room was next to the housekeepers closet room, so not ideal for sleeping in. I'm told 131 is the concierge's favorite room, although old- it does not have noisy feet above it (like ours did) and is on the corner- so neighbor only on one side. I'm also told that the 300 level rooms are the best right on the water. Their view is obstructed though by the two large \"paddle\" style ships that are moored there and it is on the boardwalk that you would take to go to Mission Blvd- so lots of eyes outside your sliding door. I liked the location of our room because it was more private. You walked out the slider and right onto a patio, then grass, then sand, then water- NICE! The bay was perfect for floating, renting boats, sailing and laying out on the loungers that they have. There is a public beach right on the other side, but lots of vegetation make it difficult to walk through on the beach side. The towers have been remodeled, they look like they have great views, but they overlook the public beach which had lots of people, parties, hangers out. The people at the resort were very nice and the pizza in the restaurants was very good. The breakfast we had at the resort was good too. The pool was awesome (not large, no slides or anything like that- just a nice hotel style pool with a hot tub.) They have a nice workout room with treadmills- good air conditioning in there and next to that is the video game room- all the games are free!! Very popular with our family- Golden Tee and car race games. My understanding is that they are remodeling the resort one section at a time. Although the tower rooms are better, I don't like their location as well and we wanted to be right on the sand. The weather on the bay was better than the beach- not as windy and cloudy.

After a speedy check in two hours early (thank you!) we parked next to our harborside room. We were thrilled with the kitchen suite with two queens, huge balcony, fully stocked kitchen (with seating!) and vanity. The condition was spotless. I could not find a speck of dirt anywhere in the kitchen or bath. The daily cleaning staff did even more than I expected, which included washing our dishes. I couldn't find a note to let housekeeping know we didn't require fresh linens every day, (to conserve energy), but I couldn't find such a note that is found in most hotels these days. First night we strolled their extensive and mature gardens and marveled at the sheer quantity of lush palms, flowering trees and pond and fountains. We said hello to the blind harbor seals, now safe in a habitat at the Bahia. Checked out their nice giftshop and bought discount tickets to San Diego Zoo there, as well as some snacks and drinks. The lounge at the Bahia is really fun. Walk through a Morroccan door and you feel like you are in a movie set with crazy fan contraption overhead. I with we had time to dine in the outdoor restaraunt with fountain and fireplace and beautiful tiles. Maybe next visit! We continued the walk ten minutes to Belmont Park (amusement park) and California party beach, Mission Beach. Next day we also walked the 2.5 mile boardwalk to resort neighbor, Paradise Pier to check out their lookout tower, which we had seen from our room. We saw an entire wing of the resort is being renovated. They were putting in new rugs and furniture while we were there. In the evening we dunked in the awesome hot tub and loved the set up with lots of space, and tropical colors and music. The conference room had the most gorgeous full window view of the charming bay with triple-decker antique paddleboats (more on that below). Also, the conference beverages, lunch and cocktail hour were fantastic, as were the staff. The view also showed a playground right on the sand for children and various rentals, including bikes, kayaks and sailboats. Weekly beginning Wednesdays, the Bahia Belle vintage paddle boat cruises around the picturesque harbor (which we got a \"free\" evening cruise as guests). There is live music and cheap yet great cocktails and sanwiches on board. Guest get off and on the boat every 60 minutes or so. Or better yet, just stay on it for the night (adults only 9:30 til the wee hours).

It was large, clean, and inviting. And quiet, too! We met many people in the hall during our stay, but nothing interrupted the peace of our room. Did the TV have a lot of channels? No, but who comes to San Diego to watch TV anyway? And to the guy complaining about where the TP holder was placed, how come my 5 yr old could reach it and you couldn't? Get a grip. Every morning, we would leave our room to go to the dining room. It was a beautiful walk with flowers and friendly people. Every person, from the gift shop, to the groundskeepers wished us a good morning, and were extremely helpful when asked questions.

My girls enjoyed the small playground and the sand (I wasn't afraid of them taking off their shoes). The trip around the bay at dusk was beautiful, and the boat crew were very good about answering questions about the area. Normally, when visiting hotels, I refrain from using the pool and hot tub, as I usually find them dirty, but here, there was a large pool that was in very good condition. The staff also went so far as to stretch lane ropes across the pool where the depth changed so that children wouldn't be taken by surprise. The hot tub, as well, was taken care of very well. Both pools were clean, well lighted, well maintained, with safety devices in place. As a former lifeguard, I have very high standards, and was very impressed. The location of this resort is perfect. We came for SeaWorld (5 minutes away) and the San Diego Zoo (20 minutes away), but found that it was fast and easy to get over to Ocean Beach for dinner too.

The room is very outdated and really showing it's age. There is a musty smell coming out of the carpet. Every thing needs to be updated. The kitchenette was nice to have but the stove was worn out and the oven would not regulate the heat as no matter what it was set on it would go right to smoking hot. The bathroom was showing mildew that paint and silicone would not cover up. The placement of the tp holder was one of amazement to me. It is mounted under the bathroom sink that you have to be pretty agile to reach it. The TV in the room was very old and the selection of channels was not very good. They use something called \" Hotel Network\" and it has a very poor selection of channels that do NOT follow the local TV Guide. Four channels are just about the hotel and it's services. The place was very noisy and rowdy that I had to call the front desk several times 3 nights in a row. The night security is nonexistent to maintain order and quiet at night.

As far as the service and basic amenities go...I thought they were very poor. They make you pay for a newspaper while eating breakfast in the morning (hell, the Best Western gives you free US Today's M-F). I ordered a cab from the front desk that came 20 minutes late due to a \"mix-up\" as well as an extra pillow and coffee that never came. I physically had to go to the front desk to get these items. I guess this could be bad luck, but still frustrating. Lastly, the restaurant opened late for breakfast both times I chose to eat there.

The most important issue is that this hotel was unsafe for children. The balcony on our second floor room had rails that were spaced easily a foot apart; we were terrified that our daughter would get out there and climb right through them to a fall in the concrete below. Secondly, even when bolted, the doors open from the inside simply by pulling our the door handle. Our child could easily have exited the room and run into the parking lot behind. The second issue was the noise level. The hotel has virtually no soundproofing. The windows facing the public beach are single paned which provided no sound insulation for the party that was happening on the adjacent public beach. Worse still, the bedroom windows are louvered, and certainly have never been replaced since the 1960's or 70's. This provided no sound proofing from the constant foot traffic at all hours of the night passing as we were trying to sleep. Worse still, security made no efforts to eliminate noise of rambunctious guest which occurred all through the night. There was a very loud party in the room below us which went on until 11;00 Pm before we finally had to call security ourselves as they were obviously not patrolling the area. Although the loud guest did leave temporarily, they returned at 2 am when the bars closed. I perhaps got two hours sleep the night we stayed here. Finally, the hotel vastly over-represented the quality of the hotel. Our room looked like a 1970's museum. I'm sure nothing from the bedding to the lighting to the flooring has ever been replaced. Worse, the old plumbing creates unbearable noise. When our neighbor turned on the shower at 5:00 in the morning, we were sure a poltergeist was shaking the walls. The outrageous price that is charged for this room is for location only.

We booked with this hotel because it was recommended by several friends familiar with the San Diego area. We're so glad we went with this hotel. The location on Mission Bay was perfect for all of our activities. We were within close driving distance of La Jolla, downtown San Diego, and Coronado, without having to pay an arm and a leg for parking. It was one of the few hotels we found in our preferred areas that offered free parking...and plenty of it! We were also able to walk from the hotel to Belmont Park and Mission Beach, which was nice. We stayed in room 491, on the fourth floor of the tower all the way at the end of the road. While it's a longer walk to get from that building to the pool and the restaurant, we had no issues with noise from the reception areas, as I've seen other people complain about on here. We booked a Bay View Studio, which had a king size bed, a sofa and arm chair around a coffee table, a small dining table with two chairs, and a kitchen with microwave, toaster, stove and oven, full-size refrigerator, sink with garbage disposal, and a pass-through with a breakfast bar and two stools. We also had a balcony with a great view of the bay and a lounge chair. The accommodations were clean and comfortable for the two of us. Housekeeping always kept the towels, tissues, toilet paper, and bath products refilled, which is something we've had problems with in other hotels. The amenities at the property were great, too. They have two lighted tennis courts (which we did not use), a heated pool and jacuzzi (LOVED that jacuzzi!), an exercise area and arcade, an indoor/outdoor restaurant and bar, and shaded lounge chairs on their private bay beach. They also offer bicycle and water sport rentals. On Friday and Saturday nights, they offer hotel guests free cruises on the bay on their Bahia Belle boat. (This is offered nightly in the summer, but we stayed in November.) Non-guests can pay $10 and enjoy trips back and forth the bay to the Catamaran Hotel. There are family hours and over-21 hours, a bar, and live entertainment. We spent an hour on the boat on Saturday night and had a really great time. Our favorite part of the Bahia is the seal pool. They've rescued two blind harbor seals and they live in a pool near the lobby. You can watch their feedings twice a day, and they were a treat to see as we came and went from the hotel. As adults, we found them so entertaining. If you're traveling with kids, they will love this added bonus. The only real negative we experienced was noise from our neighbors. I've read complaints about noise at the Bahia, but I don't blame the hotel for what we heard. I blame the parents. There was a family staying next door with at least two young children and every day from 6-8 am, we were treated to high-pitched screaming. This wasn't an issue of a fussy baby, these were young children playing. When they weren't yelling inside, they were yelling outside and the noise from the balcony was even worse. We had no noise issues with any other neighbors...reasonable volumes can't be heard between the walls. But if you're unfortunate enough to be next to a room with parents who can't or won't discipline their children and remind them that they aren't at home, then you might have a problem. Even with that, I would return to the Bahia.

I was very interested in this hotel because I plan to bring my spouse to San Diego for a vacation within the next 6 months. I went with two colleagues from work and we all had separate rooms which were scattered across the complex. All three of us refused the rooms they put us into and we upgraded to better rooms. One colleague's room smelled strongly of cleanser, another room was dark like a cave and my room was spacious, smelled like an ashtray (a non-smoking room) and the furniture was out of the 70's and looked dirty. The carpet was filthy and I was uncomfortable setting my belongings near the floor. The staff was very good and upgraded all of us (for more money). We all ended up in a modernized wing but my room was still too dark for my liking. While we were upgrading, a couple of newlyweds came back into front desk after seeing their room. They were from Europe and bride was crying and saying that the Hotel doesn't look like what is shown on the internet. We stepped back and suggested to the staff that they should help the groom out of his predicament. The staff seemed to do a good job with the newlyweds. The location is within walking distance of Pacific Beach and that is the biggest plus for this hotel. The problem with this hotel is that it is old and in need of a significant modernization. They have two (or three) modernized wings that are non-descript rooms in a 5(?) floor arrangement. The rest of the hotel has rooms that are like stepping back in time along with the original-appearing furniture and carpet. I will return to San Diego for a vacation but will not be staying in this hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cDilapidated, dumpy, and disgusting\u201d", "Author": "gt3smitty", "ReviewID": "UR84756548", "Content": "The hotel isn't dated, it's a complete dump.

This is a pleasant hotel in a wonderful location, right on the beach at Mission Bay. It is somewhat out on a limb, especially if like us you do not have a car. The bus fares do eat into your cash as you need to use the buses to get into the city. The hotel, although fairly large, has very little in the way of amenities. We didn't make use of the restaurants or bar, preferring to go out to eat in the city or somewhere else on the bay. There is a paddlesteamer which sails across the bay at night in the season and Friday and Saturday nights off season, it is free for hotel guests and takes about 30mins each way. Our studio suite was large with a kitchen, and was elegant, high ceilinged and with 2 Queen beds, large sofa and armchair, small dining table and 2 chairs. The decor was a little old fashioned, but very clean. There seemed to be quite a few different types of room, single storey, two storey and studio blocks about four floors high. The reception area was quite small, the staff efficient if a bit distant, but when we arrived at 1.30pm, we were informed our rooms would not be ready for at least 3 hours This meant we were forced to wander around the area to find something to eat while we waited.

We booked a bayview suite on the 2nd floor. Location of the room was great. It overlooked the marina right where the Sternwheelers were docked. I loved that the \u201cbeach\u201d was right below with plenty of covered lounge chairs on sand. We arrived a bit late on Friday night and there were a few parties (or so it sounded like a few) going on. Loud music and loud voices until after midnight. There was a wedding (or weddings?) going on so lots of doors slamming and people talking in the parking lot behind our room (which was where the bedroom was located). Even louder parties the following night. To me it was a minor annoyance and thankfully it didn\u2019t keep my 4 yr old awake. The Bahia Caf\u00e9 had decent food and great service. We ate there for breakfast both mornings. We also ordered room service one afternoon \u2013 the sandwiches were not great. I ordered a club sandwich that arrived cold with cold French fries. The rooms were very spacious, especially the living room area. There was also a small kitchen that was stocked with dishes, mugs and pots & pans (no silverware; I assume you need to request it). The showers did not have the best water pressure. The full-size bed was really too small and not comfortable to sleep on. Housekeeping wasn\u2019t on the ball; we left our room for 4.5 hours and they did not visit during that time. Instead they called us at 4pm and asked if they could clean the room but we had to decline since our son was napping. They couldn\u2019t come back at a later time as they were only there until 5pm. I would\u2019ve been more annoyed if we were going to stay longer. If you plan on visiting soon, be advised that they are doing construction on the property and the parking area close to the bayview suites is partly closed off. This made it very inconvenient to park the car close to the room (worse at night). We got lucky the night we arrived but had to park on the opposite side of the property the following night (just after going to dinner and coming back around 8pm). And the parking lot is not the easiest to maneuver through; there is hardly any room for two cars to pass each other and it was dark to drive through. I\u2019m not 100% sure I would stay there again if only for the noise factor and parking situation. The rates were decent though so I\u2019m not saying never.

We love the vintage look and style of the hotel -- it's definitely not a cookie-cutter motel like similarly priced options. You can't beat the location -- a private beach on Mission Bay, 5 minutes from Sea World, a few blocks from Mission Beach and Belmont Park, and a quick drive from hundreds of dining options in the Pacific Beach area. The lush grounds are immaculately landscaped, the rooms are private and most have a stunning view. The patio of our room was shaded by a canopy of ancient knarled trees and was just steps away from the private beach. Each morning our 4-year-old daughter delighted in feeding the flock of ducks that made their rounds around the resort. The hotel also houses two blind harbor seals that are a joy to watch. The hotel has a great pool with a large heated spa and free pool towels. We swam every night. For older kids, there is a free arcade located off the pool area. The fitness center looked nice, although we didn't use it. The restaurant is okay. The service is fine and it is very kid-friendly. The food is not bad and is fairly affordable. The breakfast buffet is a convenient stop before a busy day of fun and sight-seeing. There are a lot of great restaurants to the northeast in the Pacific Beach neighborhood just a short drive away. The rooms are acceptable. Ours have always been clean and comfortable. (My husband is an exterminator and always inspects every room we stay in for bedbugs -- nothing ever noted here at the Bahia.) The furnishings are not luxurious, but are usable and comfortable. We particularly enjoy the privacy afforded by the layout of the rooms. We have never had a problem with finding parking close to our room. In response to the many bad reviews on this site: This is definitely not a 5-star luxury resort. It is a clean, comfortable, friendly place that is conveniently located to all the fun that San Diego offers. I would not consider it a \"destination resort\", although it does offer a lot for the price we pay for our rooms. Speaking of price, I would not advise booking a room directly from the resort, as their \"rack rates\" are pretty high for what the hotel is. Book through a tour company like Get Away Today and you will save a lot of money and will definitely get your money's worth.

Before I start with this review allow me to tell you that I am your average 40 hour a week worker . Not rich , not poor . Just middle class family man . So if you fall into this category then this review is perfect for you ......... You ( like I did ) probably read all these reviews about the Bahia , and probably had your head spinning trying to figure out what to believe . I will put all the questions to rest . The staff seemed fairly friendly . In all honesty other than checking in/out you never see them again . We paid $118 a night for 3 nights to stay in a garden view suite with a kitchen room 480 . The Room itself .......... Met all my expectations and then some . Very very clean . Nothing wrong with it at all . Very good sized . In fact you can spend more money on a Bay view suite ( which is on the other side of the hallway facing the bay ) , but to be honest with you its not necessary . From our room you could see a long stretch of the beach anyway . So not really feasable to pay for the upgrade unless you MUST see nothing but water . If there is one thing that one could argue its the size of the bathroom . You literally have room to stand in the bathroom , or jump in the shower . They chose to make the living space larger and a smaller bathroom instead which didnt really bother me , but some people may be annoyed with it . The shower was a bit odd cause the shower head was literally at neck level . I am only 5-9 so I know its not because I am tall . lol I had to duck down a bit to wash my hair . Again not really a deal breaker when judging a room to me . I care more about size , and cleanliness which this room far exceeded my expectations after reading all those reviews . One thing I will say is that you will see a lot of reviews that claim an \"odor\" . I cannot pinpoint it , but when you first walk into your room there is a odor . Not a good smell , but not a bad smell either . The best I can explain is that I have stayed in beach front hotels in Maine , and N.H. before , and it honestly just seems to be a smell that comes with an ocean front hotel . So anyone familiar with the beach can probably relate to what I mean . If it was a terrible smell I would have said something , but it just smelled beachy ! The Grounds ...... Pretty darn good I must say . Now I dont want to say flawless like the Hawaii resort I once stayed at , but very nice surrounding features without a doubt . Lots of tropical plants , palms , flowers etc..... And everything from what I saw was well maintained and clean . The Beach .......... The beach was great . You are a 10 minute walk or a 2 minute car drive to the main beach with the waves , stores , shops etc... or if you just stay on site you are on a nice secluded sandy beach where the peninsula ends . We took the kids for a walk every morning and evening , and saw maybe 5 people total . The water is also a tad bit warmer there than the main beach . The Bahia was a great stay for us . I would rate it a 8 star of out 10 . Again its not Maui , but considering the fact that we have stayed at hotels in hotel circle for $150 a night . I would take the Bahia over those places at the price we paid in a heartbeat . Definitely above average stay . Great food , very nice room , and pretty cool beach too . If you have any questions about this resort , or the surrounding area please feel free to email me at Chowdahead76@yahoo.com We were here for a vacation with the kids that included the beach , Disneyland , California Adventure Park , and Seaworld .

I was staying with my youngster, so upgraded in advance to a suite so I wouldn't have to go to bed too early. The room was sadly disappointing for the high price (did not look like the website) because everything was old and grungy. Carpet was threadbare and falling apart, ancient astroturf on the balconies, 70's furniture and weird room layout, was supposed to have a full sized fridge but it was still a bar fridge. The bathroom had splatters of old toothpaste on the tile by the sink and no where to put your toiletries, no fan to control the humidity. The bedroom beds were comfortable, furniture dinged and a rubby gruncy gas fireplace (unsealed! can you say CO2, not that we used it - but ick). I checked every morning for bedbug bites, and appeared to have maybe one. We would come back from Seaworld to let my boy nap and at 2pm the room was not 'cleaned' - and then they would finally come around but I didn't want my boy to be disturbed, but even on the days when they did come around it appears that cleaning consists of replacing towels. In 7 nights, my room was 'cleaned' 3 times. Location is great as it is walking distance to the beach and Seaworld, but that's about it. Bus service is right outside, easy to get anywhere on a couple of bucks and 10 minute bus to Old Town transit centre. Staff was friendly enough. Never ate at the hotel. Boat cruise was nice, and we could see the fireworks from our balcony. Annoying school bus showed up and idled outside our room for 20 minutes at 6:30am then shut off then start up at 8:30 again!, and then again in the evening at 9pm - it would arrive and idle and then finally shut off, not sure why you need to pre-warm a bus up 2 hours before you are going anywhere and I certainly did not need to wake at 6:30 on my vacation! Bus should have had to park out by the highway! With my 'upgrade' (ha ha), I paid probably $200/night - way too much for this dump.

One of the amenities the hotel features is a free boat cruise of the surrounding harbor. The hotel's boat cruises hourly during the day for family cruises. At night, the boat becomes a floating bar were you must be twenty one to be on the boat. Overall, a nice hotel with a great hotel. At one point I am sure that The Bahia was a top of the line resort in the early 1970's.

It is also just a few steps from a nice bay-front walkway that heads north, much nicer than walking on the road to reach several restaurants a bit north of the hotel. It's also a nice little walk to the University of San Diego boathouse, where you can watch the rowers. If you are on a higher floor as we were, we had a nice view of the pool area, water and boats.

They will even arrange for a spa treatment at Catamaran. Currently, winter rates are about $99, but at the time we stayed the minimum was about $119 for a garden view.

It is close to Mission Bay, Belmont Park, Sea World and a host of other area attractions. Secondly, there is a bit of quaint-ness associated with the hotel that make it interesting...a small lagoon with rescued harbor seals and a small private beach (with a completely blocked view due to bloats in the slips) add a certain charm. That is where the luxuries end. We stayed in a bay view suite. The room had an ok layout, but was tighter than I imagined from looking at the photos online. The curtains, beddings and other tapestries were at least 20 years old. The carpet was shameful, stained, ratty and in worse condition than any place I've EVER stayed (rental apartments included). The room included a small kitchen, I considered this to be a plus...until I entered the room. The hotel is next to a small bay where one might rise early to fish; apparantly the previous guest had done just that and proceeded to clean those fish right in the kitchen. Upon opening the doors the first time I was met with an offensive odor that seemed to permeate the entire suite. I believe that the fisherman may have cleaned fish in the sink and then garbage disposal-ed the remains and guts. The smell lasted the entire stay. Next, we had intended to eat dinner at the hotel restaurant but missed the serviing hours due to traffic. We ordered room service and were truly disappointed. We were served leftovers from that morning's lunch buffet. The salad was limp and nothing resembled anything fresh. The house champagne shared by my husband and I was more like Squirt soda. In addition, we were told our food would arrive within 40 minutes. Over an hour later it finally arrived. With three small children in tow, waiting that long for food is not acceptable. After dinner I planned to get the kids settled down by purchasing a movie from the television system...at a price of close to $15.00 per movie we decided against it and we drifted off to sleep while watching the local news. There were other things that led to our disappointment as well: a lack of supervision in the pool area, where a large team of teenage soccer players took over the hot tub and proceeded to \"dive\" into the spa, splash and worst of all...wipe their runny noses on their hands and them rinse them in the water (this is where we got up and left). In addition, as spa owners, we were very concerned that the spa did not appear to be heated properly...as it was several degrees too low. The worst part of our stay happened four days after we checked out. I looked at my online banking statement and found that the hotel had overcharged me by $438.00! I phoned the front desk and was told that it was a system error. The woman didn't seemed surprised at all, and stated that it was happening to a lot of people. That I should call my bank. She then gave me a number to an accounting department to call in the morning to have the charge reversed...I just phoned and that number has been disconnected. I can understand a billing error...but considering the fact that she knew and was aware of this problem I should expect that a \"resort\" would CALL ME immediately and my bank to explain THEIR ERROR. I now have to give up my time to repair their flub. I went to the Bahia for two reasons...they were listed on the Sea World web site and they claimed to be a world class resort. Sadly, I will not return for many more than two reasons.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henderson", "Title": "\u201cAwesome resort!

We booked through a travel service and pre-paid for 5 nights. We only stayed 3. We booked a kitchenette room. We were in the fourt story building at the end of the property. When we entered the room, we noticed a musty smell. We then discovered that the toilet was plugged. The closet doors were not on their tracks, but were leaning against the closet. The sofa had holes in the cushions and you could see the padding. We asked to be placed in another room. We were moved to a room on another floor. This room had a working toilet and the closet doors were connected. However, the sofa was also worn through with stuffing poking out. The carpet was old and threadbare. My wife was afraid to walk on the carpet in bare feet. We had two double beds. These double beds are not large enough to sleep two people, so my son and I tried the pull out bed in the sofa. The pullout bed was worn so that we both rolled to the middle. We could not sleep. The kitchenette had a good woring refrigerator. We did not try the stove. The cupboards were just bare boards when opened. Our first day there we woke up and went to Sea World. We retruned to our room at around 5:00 p.m. and our room had not been visited by the maid yet so we wandered around grounds by the bay for awhile. The second day we were there we were awakened early in the morning by strange noises. We later found out that the building had plumbing problems and they were using a snake to try and clear the sewer lines from the building. The day after the third night there, our toilet plugged. When I called the front desk I was informed that the sewer lines from the building again had problems. sure enough, the snake was again employed. Because we could not sleep, the plumbing prolbems, the run down furnishings and the general disrepair of the room, we left and checked into a different hotel. When we left I spoke to the peson at the front desk who acted if this was not the first time this had happened. The only bright spot was the cruise around Mission Bay on the hotel ship. It is a short \"cruise\" but my family enjoyed it, except for the fact that we are non-smokers and there was no designated smoking area so it was hard to escape smoke.

I was really looking forward to being able to sit and enjoy the view. Parked in the street outside our room were three large motor homes. They were there the whole time of our visit, so we did not see the sea from our room at all. I understand that it is a public road outside, but I doubt very much if it is legal for motor homes to stay there night and day. The reception staff were indifferent to my complaints and not sympathetic at all. From my point of view I did not get what I paid for, so should not have been charged the full amount. I would have been better off having a room near the pool at a lower tariff.

The patio doors were very hard to open/close/lock and didn't come with screens or sheers, only blackout curtains, so if you wanted light you had to rely on very old yellowish lightbulbs, or be open to everyone walking past to view your room. When you move on the bed, the lights would flicker, depending on where the cord was.

I recommend this hotel with a few caveats: 1) It's old. I liked the feel and ambiance, but others may find that it isn't modern enough. 2) Since it's adjacent to Pacific Beach, it can get chilly, especially in June. This is no fault of the Bahia, but some guests apparently don't understand San Diego and that this is common up and down the coast there. 3) The beds were a little uncomfortable. My wife and I couldn't quite pin down why since we've slept on harder beds without a problem. It might have just been the smaller double beds we had. 4) The food on premises is VERY expensive and VERY family unfriendly. Fortunately, there are several family restaurants in the area. 5) The TV didn't always work well for pay movies.

They view of the garden was amazing and the families of ducks that were always moving around the property made my sons day. While I will admit that there were minor problems with the room such as some updating to items that had rusted (rails for closet door), there was nothing else wrong. We went to Sea World which was a 5 minute drive at the most and downtown many times which put us in the perfect place. One issue we had was that the boat, \"The Bahia Bell\" only ran on Friday - Sunday during the spring, but we were advised that it ran everyday in the summer and is free to resort guests. The grounds I will say again were amazing!!! They had their own private beach, which we took our son down to play on some of the slides and swings along with picking up sea shells and playing in the sand. The Seal pond for two of the animals was a perfect size. We actually spoke to someone when at Sea World that knew the hotel and we were told the care of the seals was one of the best along with the enclosure exceeding the normal standards. Every one of the staff we spoke to were very knowledgeable to the animals on property and would give you times to when the seals are fed so you can watch. The pool area was great also.

It was a typical motel-type room. It was clean, but just \"felt\" dirty and was pretty depressing to look at. There were water stains and bubbling paint on the ceiling. The only natural light source was a sliding glass door, so in order to let any light into the room you had to open the blinds and every person that walked by could see into your room - not very pleasant. Our air conditioner made a terrible noise when we it was on, so we couldn't sleep with it on at night. I cannot stress enough how awful the room was - we tried to only sleep in it and spend as little time as possible in it. Also, the walls are paper thin, so we could hear our neighbors conversations and it was loud at night. The staff was friendly. Our only complaint is that we had the desk staff order us a cab the day we checked out to take us to the airport. They forgot, then forgot again, and finally on the 3rd request we were able to get one. We got to the airport a lot later than we wanted to.

I am the trip-planner of my family and i ALWAYS check out tripadvisor.com before booking any hotels! I truly do not know how this hotel has the rating it has on here! FIRST of all, the pictures on the website for this hotel are extremely deceiving! This is NOT a resort, it is not even an hotel, i would call it a MOTEL...you motor in and park and walk to your rooms. The pool is much smaller than pictured, the \"private beach\" is a bay/marina filled with ships, rental boats, dinner-cruise ships, etc. It's a bay, so this is expected, given, but it is very crowded with vessels up on the beach. (Please be aware, your kids cannot get in this water! Its nasty, like any harbor would be. AND the sand is dirty, muddy.) While we were waiting for our room to be ready (4pm checkin with kids is horrific) we tried to go to the little outside bar/restaurant, but noone greeted us, asked us if we even wanted anything, we sat ourselves and after a few minutes got up and left. Outside the bar they have this little sad \"pen\" with a little bit of water in it where they keep two sealions. They looked miserable. When we finally checked into our \"Bay Front Suite\" on the first floor on the \"private beach\" I walked in and immediately told my husband, \"I am not staying here!\". Call me a hotel snob, but this room was reminiscent of the cheap hotels my dad used to make us stay in after a long day's drive in our stationwagon on our way from Ohio to Oklahoma to see my grandparents. This room's walls were completely bare, exposed cinderblocks painted white, one small tv sitting on stand on a wall opposite two Full sized beds, both covered in those nasty old quilted bedspreads that are sewn to fit the bed like a slipcover. The room did seem clean, but i would NOT have let my kids sit on that bedspread just for the sheer fact that it was probably 25 years old. I honestly did not even look in the bathroom, i just turned back towards the sliding glass door that led to the little patio, and walked out. Once we made our way back to the lobby to refuse staying here at all, we noticed several cars full of teenage boys, maybe college kids checking in, and it totally dawned on me that this was the equivelant to the beach motel that i stayed in my senior year of high school with girlfriends for spring break in Daytona Beach. NOT the scene for family with small kids. This place should have cost about $69 a night, that is the most i would have paid to stay here (if i was 18 and on my first trip w/o the 'rents). At $189 a night it was a total ripoff!! The girl at the reservation desk didnt bat an eye when we said we werent staying. She checked us out and didnt even say goodbye. We immediately called the Hyatt which was right next door, basically, and got a great deal for $159 a night! Go read my review of THAT hotel, because WOW!! We loved it!

I would not stay here again. I would, however, compliment the photographer that took the photos posted on the hotel website, because he/she is a photographic genius. The place did not look similar to what was advertised. We booked a package deal through Orbitz, and I got the general impression that this may have been part of the problem. We arrived at about 3:30 in the afternoon, 1/2 before check-in time. There was a problem with the reservation, which took them 45 minutes to figure out. The entire time, we were listening to the concierge desk staff offer arriving guests their choice of rooms. When our turn came, they did not give us a choice, and did not give us the type of room we had requested (and paid for a month previously) on Orbitz. To their credit, they did give us $25 in food/drink credit. When we arrived at the room, the accommodations were not suitable for habitation. The mold/mildew smell was so strong that I was concerned that I would have allergy problems, let alone my more allergy-prone boyfriend. There was also flood damage and stains on the carpet. I asked for a room change, and we were taken to a room in a more recently renovated area of the hotel. This room was much more acceptable, but there were a lot of little issues, such as the cheap towel racks continually falling off the walls, the shampoo/conditioner not matching, and the suspicious wet cleaner spot about a foot across right in front of the bathroom door. I really didn't want to know what might have been there. Once, when we asked for a change of sheets, the maid came to the room and merely made the bed, rather than change the sheets. We had to call again, and waited quite a while before anything was amended. The fitness center was not in great condition, although the pool and the hot tub were fine.

For instance we never had enough towels for 2 people. Upon arrival there were NO Bath towels, only hand towels and wash clothes. We also ordered a package that included Corona's with Chips and Guacamole. First we told the front desk to have it delivered on the 2nd day of our stay, but it was delivered on the 1st night, AFTER we'd already had dinner. So we decided to save it in the fridge for the next day. Well when we went out for breakfast,our room was cleaned, and they removed the un-opened chips that we'd saved IN the kitchen. We had to call the front desk and finally speak to a manager before we got more chips to have with our day old guacamole. The Kitchenette did NOT have a microwave which we though was odd. There is a full Stove w/ oven, but it's not easy to re-heat leftovers as we planned. We did also order passes to SeaWorld and the San Diego Zoo, and we received that upon check-in and it worked out great. The location is a good location if you plan to visit seaworld.

I was positive that I wasn't going to be able to reschedule without the having to spend more money. When I called the hotel, the representative was very polite and was able to switch my reservation to a different weekend with NO penalties and using the same promotional rate. When we checked in, the employees in the lobby were very welcoming. They told us about the discounts that were available for Bahia guests to different local attractions (Sea World, San Diego Zoo, etc). They also gave us complimentary tickets for a cruise around Mission Bay that we could use anytime before the end of the year. The room that we stayed in was not your typical hotel room. It stood on its own with no rooms above or below it. There was a parking space right in front of our room which was very convenient. The room was much bigger than what I expected. The bed was comfortable, the wireless internet was great, and there were plenty of towels and pillows! My favorite part of our room was the sliding glass door with the Mission Bay view. At night, we even got to watch the Sea World fireworks that were right across the bay. It was absolutely gorgeous. There were plenty of things to do near the hotel and lots of eating establishments nearby as well. We were able to go kayaking, walk around Balboa Park, shop at Fashion Valley Mall, and eat fresh sea food without doing a lot of driving. The location of the Bahia Resort was excellent! Unfortunately I did not have time to visit the many of the amenities the Bahia has to offer such as the pool, spa, tennis courts, and fitness center but all of the information about these bonuses were available in the pamphlet that was in our room. I was, however, able to dine at the Tangier Bar where the food was delicious and the service was top-notch.

The Bahia resort was only 15 minutes away; we got there at nightfall and checked into the four-story portion of the resort at the end of the peninsula, overlooking the bay. My wife had won the stay in a contest and we were truly amazed on how nice it was. We travel worldwide including Europe, Asia, South America, and all over the US. Using TripAdvisor, we were somewhat skeptical with the prior reviews (We had several hotels to choose from the contest). We checked in and the staff was professional and got us our room in short order. We did ask for directions to a local steak house but the person that evening had limited knowledge of restaurants. On our way to the room we noticed that the place seemed completely full on this Holiday weekend. We got to the room and it was gorgeous and spacious. We think they had recently redone the room with tile in the bathrooms, furniture drapes and all. The bathroom was neat and the shower was good (a value point for us!). That night we found the Embers Bar and Grill, just over the freeway, on Mission Bay road and we had a fine inexpensive dinner. Next morning, my wife and I walked in the rain while our daughter slept, to see the birds on the beach just outside of our room. It was very peaceful and picturesque. Sandpipers, gulls, and mud hens were everywhere. We checked out the pool and workout room. The pool was a bit chilly for November but the large spa was very inviting. We got our daughter up, went to a breakfast up the street and then went and spend the day at Sea World. That evening we had our Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel restaurant that had a great staff and very accommodating. After a full Thanksgiving Day of marine animals and walking, we got back to the hotel putting together our Christmas cards on the large nice table in the room. Next morning we spent time in the spa and workout room and prepared ourselves for another day of Legoland (We had two-for-one tickets).

Before I go further, it should absolutely be noted that the best asset for the facility is the staff working there. Polite, courteous, and helpful are understatements. Granted it was almost 6 months ago we stayed there, I still remember how helpful Patrick at the front desk was for any of our questions (where to eat, where to get surf lessons, etc.), the breakfast server who translated in french for us so we could send a post card out, and the older maintenance man who fixed our many personal things (bike spoke, backpack, and others nothing to do with the hotel). Location - Wonderful. Walking distance to the beach. So many activities within the immediate area. If you have a rental car, that's great but we could make due without one if need be. If you are a walker, this is a perfect spot. Dining - Again, wonderful. Never had a bad meal at the cafe. There are a ton of restaurants to try in the immediate area and around San Diego but the quality made it difficult to really venture out. Bar was great. Only wish was that there was more brands of beer on tap but we could make due. Rooms - Perfect, but again, we had the never renovated rooms. Based upon the other reviews, I would try to snag one of these if possible. Nice beds and flat screen tv's. Loved the fact that there were no bugs so we could leave the sliding door open and have fresh air at night. Pool and hot tub - Fantastic. I believe the water is heated but very clean. Lots of room, even if there are a lot of people there. Love the tiki bar there as well. The Bahia is an outstanding resort as long as you are educated about the place.

Our trip was primarily a family visit, but we were looking forward to enjoying the usual amenities that an establishment with similar prices would offer. Unfortunately, this was not the case at the Bahia. While the room itself was comfortable and provided lots of options for making one's own meals, the grounds are very outdated and need to be completely overhauled. It is virtually impossible to get anywhere without walking through a very crowded parking lot. I understand that the Bahia must do a lot of business, as my first night there I almost did not get a parking spot anywhere remotely close to my building, but they need to figure out something else (anything else, really) to do with the parking situation. I arrived late at night and realized the next day that some other lucky guest had likely checked into (and then immediately out of) my room. My mother, aunt, husband and I had requested adjacent rooms. Somehow my mom and aunt ended up in a king sized bed on the 4th floor, the room next to them had the two doubles they'd requested, and my husband and I ended up in a room that really should become an office - 1st floor, right by the entrance to the building. The room was like a fishbowl; if we kept the drapes open, anyone who wanted a Pepsi or some ice or had to work on the property saw completely into the room (not to mention that the Pepsi machine was actually broken for two days). I had to change in the bathroom area. If we closed the drapes... well, I'd rather not pay over $200 for a cave that could be on I-95 in any state. With a full itinerary of family visits, I ignored the first night's spectacle of one (understandably) very angry man parked directly outside of my room, headlights on, ranting about being screwed out of HIS room (the place was supposedly booked solid). I ignored the constant stream of cars pulling up to my window to drop off their luggage (since the parking spaces were potentially a 10 to 15 minute walk from the building). I ignored the really fun hammock right outside my window that every kid understandably had to scream and run to, then struggle with parents trying to pull them away from it. But once I had a second to breathe, I was pretty ticked off about my room. The Bahia's fix? Take $75 off my bill (which totaled over $800). On top of that, they \"forgot\" to take that pitiful deduction off of my bill, thereby delaying my early-morning rush to catch a plane for another family event. I just returned home today (almost two weeks later) and am hoping that the Bahia's management will make a better decision in terms of customer service now that I have time to deal with the issue. Perhaps the most disappointing thing of all was the pool area. On my last day, after getting nowhere with a reasonable fee adjustment, I figured, \"Hey, enjoy some California sunshine before getting on another plane.\" The tide was rather low and I wanted a swim so I went to the pool. The pool, which is pitifully small for a resort of that size, had a rug around much of it. The rug smelled like you'd expect it to, I suppose; at first, it smelled like sausage, then mildew, then feet, then I went back to my fishbowl, ordered a bottle of wine, and waited to get out of there. My waitresses were extremely gracious and helpful and the seals are really cute. My TV was broken and the repairman came immediately and was very pleasant and efficient. The bed was comfortable.

This is was our second trip to the Bahia in the past year. If you chose the Bahia you wont be disappointed, but don\u2019t expect a 5 star place. We would stay again. Plenty of activities, and clean fun environment for everyone, the rooms while tired were big and adequate. The pool was great and overall the place was good for the price. Price was competitive and reasonable during the summer months ($225 per night height of summer) given the average San Diego rates for all hotels (1-2-3 star) were $185. The resort is situated on the Bay with great views and access to the beach area and water. The grounds are well kept and groomed. Access to water sports, boating, and sailing are all right on the property and can be rented for a reasonable price. The pool was always at the perfect temperature, and clean. On the weekends they play live music. The front desk staff was always happy to help out and try to make your stay comfortable and address our needs. While it is true the lobby is smallish, it really depends on when you arrive as the amount of crowd you should expect, we arrived and were able to check in at 3:45pm and had no lines or waiting. Free rides on the Riverboat to their sister property is always fun. The kids loved Gracie and the seals on the property. Proximity to all the attractions (SeaWorld, Zoo, Legoland ect) can\u2019t be beat. Our room was a double bed garden which incidentally is the same size as the Bay View Suite. We had 2 beds, and the couch folded out into a queen-size bed, was perfect for us. The room also had a small kitchen and full sized fridge. This was perfect after a stocking your own food to cut costs. The negatives: It is true that the rooms are outdated for the most part, but we really only spent sleeping ours in the room. I would add that this should not be a distraction, but it should be noted. Our room just happened to be in the tower just near the front entrance and on the 1st floor. This did cause some concern as it is true that the bay side of the resort shares a public road for a public park. The park opens at 7:00am and closes at 9:00pm, so there are parking spaces and access issues if you choose to park out in this area. My advice, you can find parking inside the resort area if you don\u2019t mind walking at times, and don\u2019t use the beach area on this public side of the resort. Three quarters of beach access is located on the resort property so you should just walk over to the north side where the boats and main beach access is. Gardeners always fired up their leaf blowers at 8am so if you plan to sleep in forget it. The hotel maids seemed to never come, this disappointed us and had to seek out hotel maids/cleaning staff 3 times in the 6 days we stayed.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kellyrobin", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the money on the bay.\u201d", "Author": "Kellyrobin", "ReviewID": "UR18323997", "Content": "For the money, this was a really nice place to stay.

Expect a long wait when checking in. The lobby is very small and crowded. We booked a bayview studio thinking since they have their own private beach it should be wonderful. Guess again! The east side of the property is public beach. There were lots of people and screaming children enjoying the public beach all day and night. Every night there were people making bonfires on the beach, getting wasted and cranking up their music. Even with the balcony doors shut you could still hear the thump of the base. One night from our 2nd floor balcony, we even got to watch a drunk man stumble to his car and hear him puke several times by his car (which was parked right in front of our room). Oh yeah another bonus...there is a street in front of the balconies which is also public parking...good luck finding a spot to park there! Seems all the cleaning ladies get prime pick of those spots. The room had an old TV, I guess flatscreens haven't made it to that part of the bay yet. The bathroom floor had dirty corners. We ate breakfast at their restaurant. We asked the hostess for a table for 4..she took us to a table with 3 chairs and never offered to get another chair. I had to search one out myself. On top of that we got terrible service there. Exercise room was full of wet children who must have become bored with overrunning the pool. Free arcade had 10 games but 2 were not working and you have to wait forever to get a turn to play because of all the young children will play the same game and never give some else a chance to play. For the money, I expected a lot more. Their website sure makes it out to be such a beautiful resort. Try crammed...noisy...and too expensive. This place should not be rated so high. Locals used to rave about it but I can't see why.

The check in staff are lovely - especially Patrick who was v.helpful and gave us turn by turn directions to Seaworld and a list of places to eat. Our room was on the top floor and we were able to hear everything going on outside (there seemed to be some sort of party or wedding going on and it was full of teenagers whose main purpose was to et drunk!). The room was nice enough, with a lovely balcony you could sit out on. The bed was comfy and there was a fridge in the room too, which was great. The bathroom was ample and clean. The room just felt a bit dated. The pool at the hotel is lovely - it\u2019s heated and we used it both nights after being out all day.

We drove to downtown one evening but didn't stay long - the better place to go in the evening is to turn right out of the hotel and then right again and you come to a whole street full of bars, shops and eating places. TOP TIP - go to Tony Roma's - it was excellent food, service and value for money, and is just a short drive away. We went to Seaworld and the Zoo while we were here and if you've been to Florida you will find Seaworld in San Diego disappointing in comparison. Was a little disappointed by the Zoo also - the animals seemed cramped and it's quite hilly to walk round. We also went to see the USS Midway in the harbour, which my husband loved as you get to walk round the boat, sit in the planes and there's even a flight simulator.

As it turned out, the Bahia was that hotel. After checking out their website and the reviews here on tripadvisor, I developed a pretty good impression of the resort. The pictures are appealing, the location seemed ideal, and the fact that the resort features tennis courts was a nice bonus. Seeing as how there would be five of us on the trip, we decided to book another room through orbitz. Be advised that if you print out directions to the resort from google or mapquest, or what have you, it may still be a bit tricky reaching your destination. The signage in San Diego (and California, in general) leaves much to be desired. Once we finally made it to the resort, we learned that only one of our two rooms was ready. Which wasn't a big deal, considering we arrived before check-in time and could just as easily unload the car into the one room for now. The room, we discovered, was the one provided via the contest, the one with the kitchenette. This was the room in which I stayed. You could tell that there had been some improvements made but, yes, it was still a bit dated. Nothing that would break my trip. But I'd say it definitely had its own charm. My only real complaint about the room would be the layout. The TV was off to the side of the beds, positioned more for viewing from the couch and table. Not what you're accustomed to in a typical hotel room. When we returned from Sea World (which was only a few minute drive) that night, we picked up the key to our bay view room. I had requested that our rooms be close to one another, and they seemed to do their best to accommodate that request. Being that they were different types of rooms, though, they were located in adjacent buildings. This is the room with the cinder block walls. I did not sleep in this room, but the members of our party who did did say that they could clearly hear their neighbor's conversations through the wall. I guess cinder block isn't a good insulator. It didn't seem to be much of an issue, though. And, on the plus side, the patio off of this room did provide a nice view of Sea World's fireworks across the bay. While we did check out the pool one night during out stay, the chilly weather precluded us from actually making use of it. We did, however, take advantage of the tennis courts. Surprisingly, the equipment provided was in pretty good shape, as was the court. It was nice to be able to play at night, under the lights. During our stay, we ate at both the bar and hotel restaurant. No complaints about the food on either occasion. There were a few things we did not have time to take advantage of, including the cruise across the bay and, as previously stated, the pool. Maybe next time. All in all, I thought the grounds were well maintained, the rooms clean (if a bit dated), and the amenities more than you can ask for.

The room was clean and well maintained. The beds were quite comfortable and the balcony was very large. The front staff was very kind and friendly, as well as being attentive.

The room was small, dingy, no easy chair, wash-basin so cramped you couldn't put anything round it (shaver etc) and the bathroom was horrible; the door was half off its hinges (admittedly fixed quite quickly following a call to maintenance). The room was really nothing better than a motel 6, probably worse, and I was disgusted given we'd paid $180 a night. About to pack my bags and leave early, I complained to the front desk, and - to be fair - they admitted their room upgrades were way over due (!!) so I insisted on getting a better room - even a suite. They then upgraded us to a bayfront suite (2nd floor in a modern building to the west of the reception area). Well, it was night and day!! The suite was really excellent, modern, flat-screen Tv's, large sofas, adequate kitchen, fantastic view of the bay, no complaints. Not sure if I'd pay their normal rates for the suite - they told me it was normally $300 - but as a free upgrade it was great. This hotel sorely needs a major face-lift. It is owned by a guy who has 2 other properties - one a very prestigious one at Torrey Pines - and the Bahia is definitely way down his priority list by the looks of things.

We could not sleep comfortably so my husband slept on the other bed. What was more disappointing was the 'resort' itself.

Straight ahead we spotted the building we were looking for and soon realized that this 'apartment complex' were Bahia's standard rooms nestled between the front building and the building at the end. I didn't want to stay here anymore because I knew that the rooms were not going to be any better. And I was right. It smelled old. The carpet was old. The bathroom smelled bad so I left the bathroom fan on most of the time with the door closed. I couldn't take it so I called the front desk to have someone sanitize the bathroom and give it a good clean. Someone finally came late in the evening and he poured something down the drains to kill the odor and 'cleaned' the bathroom. It helped because now all you could smell are all the chemicals. But now I can really differentiate the bathroom smell and the old carpet. The carpet, especially outside the bathroom area, smelled nasty. The bathroom door sticks like it was too big for the opening, so every time someone would open it, it would wake the other person up. The newer furniture do not compensate for the old smelly room. 50 years old I was told. By the way, I reserved a room with a garden view. What a joke! All there was were a few tall palms and the lawn. Not a single flower. Our view was a vending machine and a ice machine. (What the heck is an ice machine doing in the lawn area?)

Be sure and rent a car though, as the motel offers no courtesy vans to the local attractions or to downtown San Diego; however, we saw that different cab companys were available (we were told it was $18 one way to use a cab and that can get expensive if you have a lot of places to visit).

If a person reads the word \"resort\" and expects an updated, granite counter tops, luxurious spa-like resort, they will be disappointed. The Bahia is an older motel, with cinder block walls in the two rooms we stayed that were both located on one of two bay sides (outside the doorwalls in our rooms was a public road with public access to that side of the bay's beach but we never heard any road or other noise - on the opposite side of the Bahia complex are rooms that exit directly onto the beach with no public access road to cross). Our two bayside rooms were clean. The bathroom had an older style, one basin sink and just outside the bathroom was an older style refrigerator. The second room we rented had a new refrigerator. The Bahia has a convenient on-site restaurant and separate bar that we thought had very good food and wasn't overpriced. In addition, finding close-by restaurant alternatives was a bit difficult (parking at such off-site restuarants can be challenging because finding parking space in that area is at a premium), so, the on-site restuarant availability was convenient and had better tasting food than a couple of more local, off-site restuarants that we tried.

But the location is great, the pool large with a little kiddie section (2'), a very deep section, and over all a perfect temperature, my kids (5.5 & 3.5) did two Mad Science camps for $3 each for about 45 min, which they loved, the beach was fine, just enough sand and water to keep the little ones happy, we did the Luau party at the Catamaran resort (their sister resort), and for $35 per adult and $15 for my 5 year old (the younger did not pay), we had a nice trip on a sternwheeler to the other resort, a decent polynesian buffet and a great show with warriors and dancers. We also enjoyed the movie at the pool (Narnya, not the latest movie but it was still fun) with free sodas and popcorn (pop corn was out of a bag though and a bit stale, but it was free). Plus the location is great for sea World and downtown San Diego, but you need a car. So overall I rated 3 because the rooms are so old and musty, which I think is unacceptable for a such a resort. Our $70 Comfort Inn in Anaheim was more luxiourious! But the resort is great, and if you travel with kids and want to alternate a day of parks and a day of resting, the resort has plenty to offer. My kids never got enough of the pool and beach, where you can also rent pedal boat and kayaks. We also tried the Bahia Cafe for breakfast and dinner and it was OK. You may want to try the Catamaran resort, which according to some guests we met at the Polynesian party, is much nicer.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral", "Title": "\u201cWell worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "TheWalkersWirral", "ReviewID": "UR8406503", "Content": "I often read the reviews on this website before travelling anywhere.My family and I have just visited the resort for 6 nights on our travels around California.I sometimes wonder what people look for in accommodation and am amazed at some of the moans and groans referred to.This resort, although not 5 star by any means , is an excellent base to explore San Diego.The staff were all very welcoming and helpful.We used the concierge several times for directions etc and they were only too glad to help.The grounds of the resort are very well looked after and are neat and tidy.The room we stayed in was on the ground floor and had a view over the bay.The bar staff in the Tangiers bar were great and very welcoming.The swimming pool area was excellent and in the Summer puts a film on at night so the children can swim and watch a film.My children thought this was brilliant and was something they had never experienced before.

I booked a Bay View Suite several months in advance. What a disappointment. One of the reasons for booking this location was that it was on the bay and offered rooms with bay views, as in the name of the room. What they fail to mention is that you have to look through two rows of parked cars and then the bay is beyond that. They need to call it a Parking Lot View suite with maybe a small glimpse of the bay. (When looking at the aerial view of the grounds, notice Gleason road. No cars in the picture. They must have photoshopped them out or closed the road down in order to take the picture.) We called to complain and were told that they would see what they could do. They said that some of their rooms were like this. I asked to have one of the ones not like this. They were nice enough to \"upgrade\" us to the Bay View Deluxe suite. The only thing better was that the trees outside of our \"Bay View\" room blocked some of the parked cars that blocked the view of the bay. We decided to stay in this room but we still made it known that we were not happy. Again they said they would see what they would do but we did not hear back and we decided to just deal with it and enjoy our vacation. The view was not the only problem. The room was very dated. The furniture was very old and uncomfortable and the room was sort of musty; nothing cheery about it. The bathroom was tiny. No place to set any of your toiletries on the pedistal sink. We had one bedroom with a queen bed. The sofa in the living area folded out to a bed which is where our kids slept. The better thing about the first room was that there were two queen beds in a separate room from the living area. We wanted a place with a kitchenette....fridge, microwave, etc. so that we could do breakfasts in the room. The kitchen was fine but nothing special. In our upgraded room we did also have a stove but it looked like it was from the 50's or 60's....sort of like the rest of the decor. The hotel itself was fine. The staff was very friendly. We did have dinner at the Bahia Cafe several nights after being too tired to go out after Sea World, the Zoo, etc. It had a good selection for kids (we have 3 year old twins) and they did fine with the meals. They were very friendly to my kids and always gave colors and coloring books. We also ate breakfast in the cafe 2 mornings. The buffet was good and reasonable and it was free for kids 3 and under. The pool was nice. We swam one afternoon after having gone to the beach. They did have a bar and served some foods but they were not there all the time. We asked about it and were told they only served food on the weekends however we swam on Thursday and they were serving food and drinks that day. On Friday we went to Legoland and were planning to come back and swim and just get a quick dinner at the pool but we got back a little late and thought it would be too cold to swim. And, when we got back, they did not have the pool bar/grill open (on Friday night). Glad we didn't set our sights on that too high. We did not swim on the private beach at Bahia. We drove down the street to the beach. That was more fun for the kids with the waves crashing, etc. The beach at Bahia had a slide, swings which my kids enjoyed. We also rode the Bahia Belle (boat) the first night we were there. My kids enjoyed that and it was a nice ride and something easy to do. The seal pond was neat to see but there was only one seal in it. I thought there would have been more but it was for rescued seals which was very nice to learn about. This was another thing my kids enjoyed. Our vacation started us off in bad moods with the disappointment in the hotel but we got over it and had a good time. Some of the other reviews I have read said something about being in recently refurbished rooms. Had we had one of these, maybe things would have been better. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone and would be a little embarrassed to do so. One nice \"surprise\" when we checked out was that they did knock off $100/night on our rate. That made things a little better. We thought it would have been nice for them to let us know about that at the beginning of our week. It would have put us in a better mood about the place for what we were spending.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPleasant and relaxing hotel\u201d", "Author": "kandi_land", "ReviewID": "UR7976187", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a business trip for 5 days.

The Bahis is an older resort (around 30 years old i believe), and it looks it, but thats part of the charm. The property is well maintained, and very clean. We stayed in the Bay View Suite, and it had plenty of room for 2 people. A nice little living room, a mini kitchen with a stove/oven, a refrigerator, and a microwave. They even had pots, pans, casserole bowls, etc. Not that we cooked, but for anyone staying a week or so, this is a nice touch. Another notable thing about the room, is that the TV's had a decent selection of movies and On Demand TV to watch, and it even had Internet, and Nintendo64 on the tv itself. Now, on to the property itself. As i said, its an older property, but this adds tot he charm. Although we didnt use the pool, we checked it out, and it was nice. Theres also a gazebo they use for weddings i believe, with a really cool looking rainforest type setting around it. Great place to relax. Also, as seen in the photos, the resort is surrounded by a beach on their own private little penninsula. The beach itself is a nice setting, but there ARE better beaches in San Diego. I dont think they have a lifeguard on duty there, at least not while we were there. But if the weather permits, its also a nice place to just relax. We also decided to go the the Bahia Cafe located on-property, and while a little pricey, the food was excellent, and the service was fast and friendly. After eating, and after checking out, we walked by the seal exhibit, and even though other reviews say they have 2 seals, there is currently only on there. It seems that they use this enclosure as a means to rescue seals, and eventually release them back into the ocean, which i thought to be very cool.

The idea was that I could leave the beach anytime to go change clothes or get more drinks from the room, or do my own thing while my boyfriend continued surfing. We called the front desk to confirm these features before booking and the staff said the surf beach was right across the street and that yes, all massage services were available at the spa. Calling back a month later to book a massage, having reserved the room, I was informed that there is no spa unless I want to go to their \"sister hotel\" a mile or more away. And it turned out that the ocean beach is actually down the street and around the corner...walkable, but we're glad we had rented a car because it would be an uncomfortable walk with wetsuits, etc. However, the hotel is directly on the water of the bay, with boats parked right there and a beach to sit on and relax. Very picturesque and serene. The hotel came off to me as somewhat of a business person's/family hotel...the one large hot tub is shared with other hotel guests. You must enjoy looking at other people's children, as there are a lot of them, or at least there were when we were there. We were in a room in the main building across the drive from the front desk...the decor/general feeling I thought was a bit on the cheesy, dated side but it is what made it unique, also. It could also be thought of as 'exotic', with kind of a wood/olive green/rainforest type motif or feel. It was all clean and the housekeeper did a great job. The hotel staff is fairly professional. The environment in general makes for a nice getaway, and cool things to do are walkable--the ocean beach, shopping, restaurants. But I would suggest having a car or utilizing the city bus system which is what we did once we had walked our way into \"town\" and needed to get back to the hotel. Sea World is just a convenient few minutes away by car--or, as I overheard another guest saying, a $5 taxi ride each way. Which is the same as the $10 parking fee.

Lots of air traffic too - having the San Diego International airport in the middle of the city is convenient but noisy. Helicoptor tours buzz the bay & beach several times a day. We didn't really use the kitchen since we were only there for 3 days but the fridge was nice to keep water bottles handy. The grounds were nicely manicured & well kept. The restaurant & lounge were nice as well. It was fun watching the little kids splash & play at the shallow end of the pool leaving the deep end for adults to swim. The hotel requires kids under 5 to wear a swim diaper available for free at the adjoining fitness center so kids in the huge hot tub were actually okay too. We rented a convertible & loved cruising the Mission & Pacific beach areas & La Jolla with the top down! Belmont Park & the boardwalk along the beach are just a couple blocks away. It's great for people watching & soaking up the sun & beach scene. All you Nor Cal people who love Santa Cruz will appreciate the same kind of vibe here - just a larger area with more people (my heart still belongs to Santa Cruz). Many beach shops & interesting restaurants along the boardwalk. Joe's Crabshack was great for dinner - loud in a fun, energetic way & a lot of totaly random things on the wall to look at. We had dinner at Croce's in the Gaslamp district - nice area but the beach & boardwalk area is more our speed. I used this site to research many of the hotels on the boardwalk but decided on the Bahia because I wanted a nicer hotel where we could relax rather than a hole in the wall with a view.

The front desk people were very helpful. The room was not ready yet, becuase it was only 12pm, as our flight arrived early in the day. They gave us a pool key and a place to change into our suits and told us to enjoy the pool until the room was ready. The pool, whirlpool and workout areas were nice. Nothing special, but very nice to have. Our son enjoyed the pool & we never had any problems finding a place to sit in the sun. The person that we spoke with while making reservations was very helpful also! I think he actually upgraded our room, because we had requested the lowest price room, which is a garden view (basically two beds and a bathroom) - we were upgraded to a newer Garden View Studio with a kitchenette and living room! It was nice to have our own fridge and stock up on some food/drinks for the week. This room should have cost us about $200 more for the week that we were there! Our room was great. It was facing the front desk area, on the third floor - room 642. It was high enough that we could see the bay & it overlooked the Harbor Seals! We would sit on our deck and watch them swim. This was a treat for our 6 year old son. The room was very clean and did not smell at all. Housekeeping did an excellent job keeping our rooms clean & towels well stocked! The only complaint that we did have was that the patio doors are single pane glass, so they did not keep out the sound very good. We never had any problem sleeping though, as we were pretty much on central time zone & went to bed early & up early every day. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was good. We didn't think it was that expensive, considering the menu items were limited & about the same price as the buffet. We ate the buffet almost every morning. We had the Easter Brunch on Sunday & this was excellent. Alot of food & very well done! The egg hunt for the kids was great, as well as the ride on the boat to the Catamaran (sister hotel). We had dinner only one night at the hotel & their evening menu was also very good. Be aware that this is a family hotel so there will be alot of kids in the dining area. I liked the location of the hotel because it is so close to alot of areas. We did not rent a car because my husband did not feel comfortable driving in San Diego. We didn't have any trouble finding taxis and it was probably less expensive for us to take taxis than renting a car for the week. We taxied to Sea World - $6 each way.... the Zoo - approx. $20 each way....Pacific Beach area (Mission Blvd/Grand Ave/Pacific Beach Drive) was about $5 each way. We found ourselves going to this area alot in the evening as there were many great restaurants on or by the beach! We never felt restricted by not having a car. We found a little market near Pacific Beach to buy our groceries too. This is definitely a great hotel for families. We are not too picky, but do like to have a nice hotel room. Our family loved this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is also a great place if you have teenagers, as it is only two blocks to Belmont Park!

We preferred to walk the four short blocks down the street to the boardwalk at Mission Beach to play in the Pacific Ocean. There is good food to be had on the boardwalk and for those with kids there is an whole area of a rollercoaster, kids rides and an arcade mixed in with shops and restaraunts.

They did offer to move us to another room at 10:15 pm which was out of the question because we had to begin our walk at 6:00 am! Also, housekeeping did not arrive at our room until Saturday at 4:00 pm at which time we had already cleaned up as much as we could and asked only for clean towels.

Below are some hints on what to expect and some advice in booking a room. Good Stuff: ************ **The location is the Bahia's greatest attribute, and that is why they can charge what they do. You are very close to Mission Beach and the Pacific. You are still only 10-15 minutes from downtown. **The rooms are ok if you get the right type of room. The best are the studios in the '400' building which are good size and have a kitchen. If you can afford the extra cost to view the bay, this is a plus. Try not to stay on the first floor. **The breakfast buffet is good value. **The pool is beautiful, but if it is crowded ... get there early. See my comment on the obnoxious music below though. **There are 2 tennis courts (with lighting) and the tennis pro is great. **The front desk staff are generally helpful and efficient. **Room service has good food and service. **Enjoy San Diego - it is one of the very best in the USA with so much to do and with a great climate ! **The Bahia Belle is a Steam Wheeler ship that is quite fun to take at night and to dance to the music and have a drink while cruising between Bahia and Catamaran hotels. **The grounds are well maintained. Bad Stuff - Warning ! *********************** **As mentioned in other reviews - most certainly avoid the rooms in the building across from the Lobby !!! In particular on weekends, there is loud music at night from the parties held on the top floor. This has been a problem for many years, that the hotel has not addressed. On some of my early trips here, this kept me up many nights. I do not stay in these rooms any more. **The plumbing and rooms are old and in great need of updating. A high percent of the rooms do have a moldy smell. Also, the A/C and heating can be quite loud at times. **Do not believe the sales pitch (pictures) on the Bahia web site. This is a sales job that makes the hotel appear to be a 4-5 star hotel. It is only a 3 star hotel due to the conditions of its rooms, at best. **For some reason, the hotel continues with music at the pool that really takes away from a quiet experience and a chance to relax. This has been routinely mentioned in other reviews, and it is true. I have sat in a lounge chair many times wishing the music would just go away !!! **Be careful in booking your room rates, as they very often go up on the weekends significantly. The hotel could be so much more, if the owners would invest further in some improvements. The location is great and I continue to stay there happily if I get the right deal and room.

It turns out I was worrying over nothing. We stayed at the bahia for 11 nights in August 2006 and found the hotel, location and the service excellent. The hotel grounds are immaculate with a gorgeous seal pool at the front. The ground staff we constantly keeping the grounds neat and tidy. The check in was easy with friendly staff and we recieved 4 complementry tickets for the lovely harbour cruise. When we got to our room I was very surprised. They was no smell WHATSOEVER. The bathroom was very clean - mainly white tiled with a powerful shower. The only problem was that the shower was positioned very low, and being 5ft 10 that turned out to be a bit of a nightmare when i tryed to wash my hair every morning. The room, to my surprise also had a small kitchen in the corner which we loved. It meant we didn't have to eat out every lunch and dinner time. There was a big fridge/freezer so we bought drinks and snacks in bulk and kept them for the duration of our stay. The room also had a table and chairs and a comfy settee so it was sorf of self catering (much cheeper). We found it really good when we were just lying round the beach and we just had to nip back to the room for food. The only problem I really had about the room was that we were on the ground floor and facing the car park. Being on the ground meant that we didn't really have a private space outside as anyone could walk on/off it. A balcony would have been nice but we were out and about the majority of the time so it wasn't really that much of an issue. Also by being on the ground floor we had to constantly leave our curtains closed so no-one could see in. They was no nets/blinds so anyone passing would be able to see your posessions. There are parking spaces right around the hotel and we always found it easy to get a space near to our room. At night they lock the back gates at the hotel so its totally private which was re-assuring as our room was near to this area. No-one could walk through that wasn't meant to. The private beach was lovely. We bathed on this a few times and really loved it. Its such a beautiful setting and very clean. It was never very busy either. I think the most people i ever saw on there was about 10. The sun loungers weren't the cleanest so you would need your towels to cover them. Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again (but maybe ask for a room with a balcony and a bit of a view).

I had known that my chances were iffy staying at the Bahia as the reviews are mixed, but I thought I would check it out myself as I am usually not as negatively opinionated as others. This is the 1st time I have left a review of any hotel I have stayed at, let alone wrote the very day arriving home. Let me tell you of my stay. My girlfriend and I had booked this room for her elderly mom and my teenage son. We requested a room that was wheelchair accessible. We called several times to confirm, each time getting a different story as to whether we would be able to get a wheelchair to our room or not. Upon entering bay view suite #196, the room smelled musty. The carpet is worn and looks dirty. The loveseat & sofa has torn upholstery. The sofabed is miserably uncomfortable with a very thin mattress. It was so old & worn that you could feel the bar poking you in the back. We actually rigged it by placing the sofa & loveseat cushions under the mattress so we could sleep on it. I open the patio door at night to let in some fresh air-no screen and ended up letting in bugs. That 1st night we want to order roomservice from the Bahia Cafe but the menu is missing from our hotel book. Call the desk around 8:00 pm and ask for a menu to be brought. Was told by employee it would be brought right over, it wasn't ,so we walked to the desk, got it ourselves, walked back to the room for everyone to see what they wanted & ordered only soup & 2 burgers around 8:45. We were told it would take 35-40 minutes. It arrived in 50 minutes and the food was terrible. But, hey, we had a great day at Sea World and spending some time together, so I'm overlooking those \"little\" things. I noticed that the ugly instituational looking brick walls do come in handy as it appears very quiet-can't hear the neighbors above or to the sides. Sleeping was difficult on the makeshift cushions on the sofabed and also the sheet that they use for the mattress doesn't fit so it kept coming off the mattress the entire night and bunching up. Not fun. Next day notice the mold on the shower cutain, the bathroom vent fan doesn't work, and when making the sofa bed notice some black flecks around the mattress. Things that make you go \"hhhmmmm\".... We spend the day at Balboa Park-have a great time, eat dinner in Old Town-wonderful Italian place. Back at the room we order room service again, thinking that the chocolate weekender & german chocolate cake sounded good. Didn't think it would take an hour to get dessert though, and again, the food is not very good. Tonight I don't get fresh air & let in the bugs, because even though the air conditioner is loud it's not as loud as the swarm of what appears to be underage drinkers & party goers that starts approximately 100 feet outside our ground level room at the PUBLIC beach around 9:30 pm. Unfortunately those previously mentioned soundproof brick walls don't come into play as this party is right behind our room. Called security directly about this around 10:30ish, was told that since it is a public beach, even though they are playing very loud music and disturbing resort patrons, they really can't do anything about it. When told I paid alot of money for this room, security then told me he \"could go out there and ask for them to turn down the music\" but that's all. That's pretty much all I wanted. Around 11:15 my girlfriend calls the front desk and complains again. Front desk says they will call the police. A police cruiser drives by on the public beach street behind my room . The underage drinkers scatter, but the car the loud music is coming from stays along with a few other cars . Minutes after the cruiser leaves, the party & loud thumping start again. It's around midnight I call the police myself. However, I can't find the number as the list of important phone numbers are missing from the resort book. I use my cell phone and get the non emergency SD police phone #. Then, attempt to use the hotel phone, following the directions. The hotel phone doesn't allow me to call the police directly-it states that number is \"unavailable\" from that phone. I have to use my cell phone to call the SD PD directly. KUDOS to the PD. The dispatcher was very helpful & also the officer who re-responded. And not a minute too soon...4 large ticked off men from the room next door were approaching the party-goers just as 3 police cruisers were literally chasing the crowd off. Hope this long review gave you a feel for this resort, specifically room #196. One more thing, upon checkout-the guy beside me was an \"unscheduled\" check out.

Also, each area is different. Some rooms have a bay overlook, others of the garden or the pool, depending on where you stay. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean, of course I have been to better looking rooms, but our room was spacious and clean. We also had a fridge and a microwave.

San Diego is really easy to get around, and with Mission beach just up the street, you can party, party up the beach, and then come back to the room with a nice peaceful rest. Also, the pool is heated and the jacuzzi is huge. The only bad thing about our room was that the room never really got that cool. But the tempertures we dealt with, it wasn't bad. Also, locals have weddings and graduations there, so that should tell you the place is not bad. Also, the hotel offers a cruise around the bay for free for residents, so take advantage.

Our family of four (children ages 3 and 6) spent five nights there during the busy spring break season at the end of March. We stayed in one of the much maligned (by other reviewers) ground floor \u201cmotel\u201d style rooms that open out to the beach on Mission Bay. It was pleasant and comfortable, but not fancy. We didn\u2019t find anything wrong with the room or the beds. The weather could have been warmer, but as it turns out, that is not controlled by the Bahia. SERVICE: Overall, the service in all aspects of this hotel, including the restaurant, was excellent \u2013 more professional and friendly than I\u2019ve experienced at the major chain hotels. The only drawbacks to this hotel stem from the fact that it was probably designed and built 40-50 years ago. OUR ROOM: We could watch our kids play on the beach from our room. After the kids went to bed, we enjoyed drinks while taking in the view of the bay from our back porch. Our room was old, but recently redecorated and equipped with a small fridge and microwaive. We did not notice any bad smell. The rooms are several yards from a natural, salt water bay. I suspect reviewers who complained about a smell were overly sensitive to the smell of the ocean during hot weather. We rented kayaks right outside our door and paddled around the placid Mission Bay. Sailboats and other small craft are also available for rent AMENITIES: The grounds of the hotel are beautifully landscaped, including a pool with two rescued harbor seals, which intrigued our children. The swimming pool is also terrific for families \u2013 an bar for grownups, occasional live music, and a large 2-foot deep wading area the little ones. It has a large hot tub, small exercise room, and small video game room. While we were there, the management kindly made all video games free in honor of spring break! RESTAURANT: The caf\u00e9-style restaurant had decent food, relatively reasonable prices, and good service. The outdoor seating is especially pleasant, but the weather didn\u2019t cooperate for us. We ended up starting our days with the breakfast buffet, which was a better alternative to driving to an IHOP or Denny\u2019s and probably just a few dollars more. The coffee was certainly better at the Bahia cafe. LOCATION: The hotel is conveniently located to most tourist activities at the southern end of Mission Beach, although somewhat isolated from other hotels and shopping. It\u2019s a short walk to ocean beaches, the paved ocean walk, and the Belmont Park amusement park. It\u2019s a long walk or a short drive to Seaworld and the eclectic Pacific Beach neighborhood. Try picking up snacks, wine or liquor at Trader Joe\u2019s on Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach. If you want to dispense with the rental car, a city bus across the street runs every 15 minutes to the Old Town transit center. From there, you can peruse the shops and restaurants of Old Town, or take the San Diego Trolley (lightrail) to Tijuana, Mexico. The zoo is also a short drive or bus hop. CONCLUSION: This hotel is quite nice but not a fancy hotel, mostly owing to its age and design. Don\u2019t go here looking for luxury on your honeymoon.

We were happy to be on the second floor, however we were above some kind of function room, so at 6:30 AM we were awakened by the \"set-up\" crew and the sound of doors slamming. We were able to move to another suite after a few nights and they did discount our room. This 2cnd floor unit was located at the far end of the property (more private, less activity) but was also just average. The room was smaller and the sleep sofa was broken, so we couldn't use it. We dined in the restaurant for dinner on our first night and I would recommend you go elsewhere. The service was mediocre, our meals took a very long time to come out and it was the most expensive meal for our 7 day stay in San Diego.

House keeping is slow to respond. The staff is young, and while seemingly pleasant, are somewhat typical when it comes to service from teenagers. Shady price dealings as well. The Ugly- The Bahia is a complex made up of various types of rooms. We looked at them all and came up with only one that was acceptable. Yes, believe all the reviewers, most of the rooms DO SMELL. The ground floor \"suites\" are akin to staying in a basement - cinder block walls, musty smell and outrageously hideous and abused furniture included. This theme is repeated throughout the complex, though getting slightly less offensive as the room style changes. If they spent an eighth of the money and time they do on the grounds tending to the rooms, the Bahia would benefit greatly. Conclusion- Our room was in the tower directly across from the lobby. We stayed here for the week. No smell. Updated decor. Typical \"hotel\" style. Good view. It is located under the ballroom however and we did experience very loud noise one evening when a private party was underway (we were not notified) and drums from the band shook our room for hours.

This is not the case, the better of the two beaches is a public beach and there is a large car park down one side of the peninsula serving this beach.

I had read mostly positive reviews on Expedia. It wasn't until after I had booked my trip, but before I departed, did I notice the 'less than stellar' reviews here. My experience was similar to many others posted here. The view was OK. Out our window was the marina - so basically a bunch of boats. It's obviously in the bay, so you are not directly on the ocean. There is a nice beach you can walk to on the other side of the hotel that is decent and clean. It's only about a foot deep for as far as I could see, and no waves, which made it nice for our two-year-old. The pool is decent and the jacuzzi looked nice (although we didn't use it). Although we booked a King bed/Suite, we were given a Queen. We could have had a King, but would have had to downgrade to a studio-style room. The room was spacious and clean, but didn't appear to have been updated for a good 20+ years. I don't know if was the ocean air entering the fabric of the decor, or the lack of proper cleaning, but the room did have a musty/moldy smell that was bothersome, and affected my wife, who has allergies. Our experience with the staff was average. I do notice a bit of a trend in unfavorable staff reviews. We did have two expereiences that are in line with the others here: 1) the maid came the first day around 8AM; a bit early I thought. We had to ask her to come back. 2) Our third and last day, the maid came before check-out time. She cleaned most of the room. We used the room significantly before checkout. Also, we had brought an old pillow we use for travel (quite nasty, I must admit) that the maid must have tucked under the sheets with the other hotel's pillows. Because we didn't see it when we collected our things, we left it. I feel sorry for the people that unmade their bed to find that stinky thing. I would assume that would generate another complaint to the front desk. Seems there is much room for improvement in the area of housekeeping. We paid $139/nt for our rooms, Tues-Wed nights.

One night we even got to enjoy fireworks as we sat on the balcony. The room had all the standard amenities-cable TV with HBO and a couple other premium free movie channels, balcony, etc... The bathroom was very clean too, I saw no mildew--and I looked!! The showerhead didn't seem to be too low like others have said. The maid service was excellent, they even washed our dirty dishes every day! My daughter had stuffed some little plastic lizards and other toys in the bed without us knowing and the maids piled them on the table in a nice little pile for her. The heated pool was gorgeous with painted murals and a 32 person hot tub!!! Very family friendly. The garden at the Bahia was beautiful too, definately worth taking a few minutes to stroll through. And don't miss the sea lions next to the restaurant. Pacific beach was within walking distance, with a couple small playgrounds on it. There is a street with a public parking lot between our building and the bay, but it is closed and locked down at night so that no one can enter after 10:00 pm., cutting down on noise. We actually parked there most of the time. Only a couple complaints: *There was a party in the convention room above us on Saturday night (which happened to be the day we chose to rest). The music was very loud with bass thumping, but the front desk did call to warn us that there was going to be an event and to call if there were any problems. It was all over by midnight. *We had booked the hotel and airfare through Travelocity and prepaid the trip. When we checked out, I asked if there was an incidental charge on the room for a phone call we had made (they do charge $0.75 per local call). She said no, there was just the charge for the room and taxes. She showed me the breakdown for 5 nights and that $450 was due. I told here we had prepaid everything throught Travelocity. She punched some buttons on the computer and said \"Oh, okay, you're good to go.\" So, probaby just a small mistake on their part, but it makes me wonder if my card would have been charged if I hadn't took the time to officially check out. So, overall the Bahia made our San Diego trip great! It wouldn't have been the same in a small, generic hotel room on the strip. I'll definately stay there next time I'm in the area.", "Date": "May 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vestal, New York", "Title": "\u201cPoor hotel, poor customer service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3369262", "Content": "Room smelled very strong of mold and mildew!

In stark contrast to a very slick and inviting website, the Bahia is an ugly, old motor court, unconvincingly spruced up and run on the cheap. Although the wind-sheltered pool and the Latino service staff were delightful, the accommodations were strictly motel and very pricey at that. We stayed in their top of the line Mission Bay Suite, ghastly, and horribly cramped for our family of 5 (double beds only were available). We would have been far, far better off to get two adjoining rooms, if for nothing else than two bathrooms. Our single kept plugging, sigh. And the use of ill fitting mattress covers and too-small flat sheets meant the bed unmade itself as soon as you got into it. We fought sliding sheets all night. If you do decide that the Bahia's pool and 3 block proximity to Mission Beach are for you, DO NOT STAY in the east side of the hotel, on which all the rooms in the low blocks and half the tower rooms face Gleason Road, a public road frequented by local park goers which is also used by the Bahia as a service road for all suppliers. A steady stream of traffic roared by our shabby patio all day (a nightmare if you have small kids), and motor homes parked illegally there all night (shame on the municipality AND the Bahia for not insisting on enforced parking regs there). For less noise stay on the side facing Santa Barbara Cove, and request distance from the tower rooms at the end. The hotel beaches are NOT good for swimming. Because the Bahia is a motor court style hotel, and because all the low rise units have their bedrooms facing the motor court, and all the beds are positioned under the windows, we found the noise began early (with the 5 am squeaky wheeled newspaper cart, sigh) and often ended late with Spring Break partyers returning loudly to their rooms. The fact that the cheap unit doors cannot be shut quietly meant door slamming 24 hours a day. In our opinion, this is not a hotel for you if you have toddlers. Rooms are either on a busy road, a beach (not suitable for swimming, BTW) or have small, climbable wrought iron balconies...all present significant safety hazards for small children.", "Date": "April 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "au175", "ReviewID": "UR3304536", "Content": "I stayed her last year and the pics on the website seemed very impressive.

To my horror we were staying in the last tower right at the back looking out on to the public car park. I was less than impressed with the security aspect of it, the doors to the tower are permently open! The room was pitch black when I opened the door so I found my way to the curtains and for a second was pleased with the veiw until the stench hit me. It was an overpowering smell of damp. I thought maybe it just needed to be aired so I didn't complain. We had arrived late after a long drive so we just had a quick look around before we went to the \" restuarant\" for dinner. The queue of people getting in to cabs should have been a warning to us. There were including us 10 people in the room and we were told that if we wanted to sit outside we would have to wait as there was a rush on!!!! So we said inside was fine, with a huge sigh the hostess pointed at a table. The service was some of the worst I have ever had. The menu was interesting to say the least, I chose the angel hair pasta because it was the least vile thing there. If you like your pasta in huge clumps with mouldy cheese added to it before it gets to you, then this is the place for you. The waitress came back for our bill which came to 40 odd dollars saw the hundred dollar note and had the cheek to ask if we wanted change!!! The walk back to our hell hole was when I really started to hate the place, there are no lights unless the people in the little houses leave their lights on so you have to walk on an uneven tarmac road in the pitch black. The smell got worse in our room with the result that we had to keep spraying perfume to mask it. We didn't bother complaining after having witnessed the check in staff and those in the cafe, we just stayed out as much as possible. I would never stay in that dump again as long a I live for any amount of money. The whole place needs to be knocked down and rebuilt. It is filthy, old, dingy and disgusting.

The bed in our room was a king sized bed with a huge sump in the middle where two people would fall naturally into it. No smell except for lingering cigarette smoke in our room.
