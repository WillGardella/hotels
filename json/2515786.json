The experience was definitely not up to the Mouse's standards. We stayed for 7 days, spending 2 days in the Universal parks, 2 days at Disney, 1 day at the pool, and a couple more days chilling out re-visiting the Universal attractions, the pool, and some other area attractions. The early park access/line cutting privileges were nice - the reason why we choose to stay at the Hard Rock -- though it turned out the crowd levels were light the week we were there so we didn't really need the line-cutting access. Check-in was easy and our room was ready early. While the lobby and lower (pool access/restaurant level) were elegant, the public areas in the guests wings were very tired with soiled carpeting, sad laundry room, etc. Our room was pretty basic/generic, but very clean. It seemed to be better maintained than the hallways. Housekeeping did a great job. The pool area was beautiful, but the pool was very shallow (about 4 feet at the deepest) so not very fun for our 12-year-old. Though the hotel seemed to be pretty empty the majority of the week, the pool was always bustling. I think it would have been wall-to-wall people on a busy day at the hotel. We had read a guide book review that called the Hard Rock Hotel family-friendly, but really disagree. The pool scene was similar to what we have seen at various all-inclusive Carribean resorts -- lots of adults drinking way too much and acting inappropriately. There are a lot of life guards and other staff at the pool, but they did nothing to curb the inappropriate behavior of other guests. We arrived on a Sunday - early afternoon - and headed straight for the pool. There were quite a few intoxicated guests. One woman in particular (with kids in tow) was so inebriated she could hardly walk, but was served yet another drink. She ended up vomiting in the hot tub/spa - sending the other guests fleeing and setting a nasty tone for the beginning of our vacation. Her husband had to physically drag her into the hotel (leaving the unattended kids behind). Every day we saw numerous drunk guests dribbling alcoholic drinks into the pool. Not very classy. We were there the last Thursday of the month when the hotel hosts a concert. It was very loud. That night someone either spilled a large alcoholic beverage or vomited alcohol in the elevator -- I didn't want to get close enough to figure out which. Again, not very classy. My husband took our daughter to the pool on Saturday night around 8:30 for the \"dive-in\" movie which was obstensibly for children as it was an animated movie. They returned before 9:00 as my husband reported a couple was making out so intently in the pool he thought they were actually having intercourse. Although he and several other guests complained, the pool staff did nothing to \"break it up.\" Yet again not a family-friendly evening. This hotel would be a good choice if you want the early park access and you are an adult-only group that likes the party scene. I don't think it is a good choice for families.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cLike a second home!\u201d", "Author": "Kathya100", "ReviewID": "UR129128523", "Content": "Have been staying here since it opened at least once of not twice a year ( two weeks at a time) This hotel is first class.

We normally rent a home but this year our older kids were at college and we only had one 13year old.We chose the Hard Rock because of great reviews. We booked a club level standard room two queen beds garden view, 4 day park passes with 2 park meal deals. I arrived at 2:00 and the room was already for us. The 7th floor is accessed by your room key only. The elevators always went straight up and never stopped.Nice touch. The room was standard and clean. We did use the room safe and would recommend it with such a busy hotel. We found the staff to be friendly and always helpful. We met a man who worked for room service and he sent a tray of cookies to our room later in the week. The club lounge lady gave my son pins and guitar picks. The club lounge was definetley worth the extra $. Sodas,snacks,breakfast,beer and wine saved alot of dollars. It was very convient. I didn't think it was as busy as some reviewers experienced and the bartenders worked quickly. I was suprised when a security guard told us we can use the other pools at the other hotels. Great idea for when it got busy but we never made it over there. The hard rock had a DJ who entertained the kids with boy vs. girls activities. Very amusing to watch.We also saw Hulk Hogan in the elevator. My favorite part was singing all day. I kept saying \"Good Tune\". My son and I explored the memorabalia one day. We spent at least 2 hours walking around. It was easy to tell him dreams are achievable with all these great artists to look up too. Quality time is priceless. I loved the hard rock music channel on the T.V. It was like having the old MTV back. The parks are great and of course that fast pass and early entry rocks.We didn't feel sunburned and discouraged at the end of the day. We always returned back for lunch and dinner with our meal deals. They saved us alot of cash. The fried chicken was soo good! The only thing was the claim of getting your packages delivered to your room. I bought a shirt at the hard rock cafe but they didn't deliver packages go figure neither did the fudge store. Whatever it was a short walk back. City walk was very fun. My son made a lot of friends so we ended up alone several nights. Quality adult time can be a blast. We sang 80's songs with other guest at the Lone Palm. After that back on that water taxi for a quick trip to the hotel. No driving for us!! Never did see the car till we left. I actually didn't want to leave but all good things come to an end.I would definently recomend this to all \"cool\"families. I never regretted our choice.

Because of this, I am very familiar with the hotel options in Orlando, but this hotel was booked as a backup hotel when we couldn\u2019t get our whole stay at our usual hotel. The Hard Rock was not what I expected it to be\u2026 and I was so very pleasantly surprised! The first 4 days of our trip were at the Hard Rock and last 4 were at our usual hotel, the Hyatt Grand Cypress. We wish we could have just stayed at the Hard Rock! Here is why\u2026 Hotel Itself: We decided to split this trip to Orlando into two halves. The first half would be at one of the Universal Hotels so we could get the free express pass (MAN, IS THIS WORTH IT!!) to skip the lines at both Universal parks and also get early entry to the Harry Potter area before the general public can enter the park. Having stayed at the Portofino several times before, this time we decided to change things up a bit and try the Hard Rock for the first 4 days while we go crazy at all the parks. While we did think the Hard Rock would appeal to our 9 year old son, I was a little afraid it would be too trendy and young for a conservative family like ours with a 9 and 5 year old son and daughter. As a result, we were not expecting much. Just rollin\u2019 the dice. We were so wrong\u2026 It is so much fun! So family oriented! Yes, it is young and trendy\u2026 but still simultaneously very tailored to families as well and very welcoming to all of us. I am 20 years older than many of the bikini clad beauties by the pool, but I realized that many of them were there with their moms and dads and little brothers and sisters, too\u2026 not there vacationing to pick up men at the casino\u2026 because there is no casino at this Hard Rock. This really makes the guests at this particular Hard Rock very different than other Hard Rocks and the feeling here is not a sleazy or slutty vibe, but rather one of an upscale resort. (Clearly what they are going for here.) I want to also mention that the fun poolside activities ranged from just fun to watch to absolutely hilarious. The entertainment was great, leaving people from 5 years old to 50 drawn to participate or even just take a seat and watch the fun. Everyone seemed to enjoy the pool activities and entertainment regardless of age or the individual guests \u2018cool factor\u2019. Now, it is loud. At times, VERY LOUD. Pool chairs (when the hotel is crowded) are almost impossible to come by and cabanas are quite expensive to reserve for a day ($290 or something like that???), but it was a great pool with a large, fun slide, a zero entry pool layout so little kids that can\u2019t swim yet really can enjoy the pool by just running in and out and standing where they feel comfortable. Food was good and service was mostly excellent. (We had one *nasty* female bartender at the little bar hut thing by the pool, but everyone else was beyond friendly and attentive.) Location: Location is the best if you plan to go to Universal. You can easily make the short walk to both of the parks from the hotel. At the end of the day at the park, you can take one of the rickshaws that go back and forth. (They are free, but tip the guys well\u2026 they earn money only off tips and this is hard work.) The boat is a pretty ride, but is longer than the walk and drops you off at a location that leaves you walking just about as far as if you had just walked straight from the hotel, so don\u2019t do the boat unless you want to go to City Walk. Also, if you want a quieter experience by the pool while staying here, you can take the boat to either Universal\u2019s Portofino Hotel which has 2 pools, one is a \u201cquiet\u201d adult pool or the Pacific Hotel, which I did not have an opportunity to visit. (Guests here have access to each of the Universal Hotel amenities.) Rooms: We stayed in a 2double bedroom in the club level at this hotel. Club level at this hotel is key access only to the club floor. The room was very nice, nothing too crazy great but very well decorated, very clean and very comfortable. No balcony. Our view was of a parking lot and part of Universal Studios park. The view was disappointing, but someone has to get the bad view and this was our turn, I suppose. (The kids did like seeing the rollercoasters from our room.) Our view was not the best but certainly not worth any complaints. Bathrooms were well situated for a family with a sink both inside and outside of the toilet and shower area, leaving one person able to shower or \u2018whatever\u2019 while another person brushes teeth or applies make up. (Not the case at the Hyatt Grand Cypress.) Club rooms came with robes for guests to use over their stay. (Not provided at the Hyatt Grand Cypress but I just love having robes in the room.) The \u201cclub\u201d itself was quite nice. They offered a much wider selection of breakfast foods, snacks drinks and cocktails than at the Hyatt. (Yummy deserts, too!) We were here 3 times a day, every day, but at the Hyatt we wound up just avoiding the club because the kids hated everything at the Hyatt Club. At the Hard Rock, I should say that while we loved the cub, the coffee was *awful* and they could have done a better job keeping the club cleaned up in the busy times, but other than that, we found that we did get a lot out of the extra fee\u2026 thanks to the variety of breakfast and snack foods and drinks offered through the day. Service: Other than our one bad female bartender at the hut thing, we found ourselves constantly saying how nice everyone is at the Hard Rock... How beyond friendly people were, constantly greeting us, opening doors for us, remembering our names, offering to do just about anything we asked. The valet guy (Michael) greeted us each day with a smile and took care of us as soon as he saw us approach, making us feel like, well\u2026 rock stars, which we very much are not. Overall: We left this hotel for what was our fav hotel in Orlando, the Hyatt Grand Cypress. But once we got there, we wished we could go back to the Hard Rock just to hang around the hotel some more and relax at the Hard Rock, instead. The kids had more fun at the Hard Rock, which made us have more fun and while the nightly rate was slightly higher at the Hard Rock, all the hidden charges at they Hyatt made the Hyatt cost WAY more for way less. As a result, I do not see us going back to the Hyatt again. It was a disappointing stay for us at the Hyatt after having such a wonderful experience at the Hard Rock. The Hard Rock wasn\u2019t perfect -- as mentioned, some of the views are not the best (just like any hotel) and if it is busy, it is very hard (almost impossible?) to get a pool chair and it can be very loud and very lively by the pool at certain times of the day, but the hotel is so well maintained, rooms are clean and very nicely planned and decorated, customer service (for the most part) is excellent, if not exceptional, location is out of this world if you plan on going to Universal parks, VERY family friendly (I was shocked how family friendly!), food is good, very few unexpected fees, if any (unlike the Hyatt with a SLEW of costly hidden daily fees!) so this is our new, \u201cgo to\u201d hotel for Orlando.

We had a garden view room at the end of the Hallway which was peaceful but a long walk to the elevators. Loved the sweetgrass amenities like soap, bodywash and shampoo! The food was expensive so we decided to eat only in the market, at CityWalk, or the US Theme Parks. Managed to go to a store off the resort to get cereal and snacks. At, the Market downstairs the ice cream was real good! We were so busy trying to get both theme parks at US & Disney that we were so tired during the evening to check out the pool. I did get to take a day off for myself and finally enjoyed the pool. Loved the music playing there. The Rock Shop was awesome. Got my 2012 guitars pins!! :) Got 10% off with my HR pass there. Also, used the card to get 10% off my meal at the Hard Rock Cafe at Citywalk. Loved the benefits. Our room key was our free EXPRESS Pass at Universal and was the best part of the stay. Even though it was March Break, you either got on the ride right away or the next ride which saved us alot of time. The lineup for picking up your tickets at US was long so if you are checking in the day you arrive it would be ideal to pick your tickets up a day before so you can start the park early.

As many reviews state, it's worth staying here for the perks alone! The fast pass saves so much time and the early entry to certain areas is great too. So close to both the parks and city walk! There is a water taxi available but this really isn't needed for most people. It takes less than ten minutes to walk to universal studios and about five minutes more to walk to islands of adventure. By the time you wait for the boat you could be half way there or further! The hotel itself is great though, even when you take away the perks. We loved the theme, even though we aren't huge rock fans. Impressive lobby Room was very spacious and the beds were large and comfortable. A little dust here and there and bins were a little dirty! Personally I can live with this, it was clean and well kept apart from those 2 imperfections. I feel that a hotel of this standard should provide a robe and slippers for guests, which we did not get. However, this was also the case at the disney resort we stayed in just before we came here, so maybe it's just the norm in the area? We ordered room service a couple of times which was prompt and the food was nice. MASSIVE portions though! One meal will feed a family of 4! We ate at the Kitchen restaurant once which is great if you fancy a hearty meal. We didn't bother going to the palm restaurant as I am a veggie and the options were very limited for me. We also did not bother spending any time by the pool... it's very loud and busy so if you want quiet and relaxing look elsewhere! Service is a hit or a miss. Most staff are friendly and very pleasant but some aren't as brilliant.

We were traveling with our kids and preferred not to split up into separate rooms, so the \"Deluxe Room with Two Queen Beds and a Pullout\" was great for us. The room itself was large with 500 sq ft of space and a view overlooking the pool. The Hard Rock is also the closest hotel within walking distance to the parks, so it worked out great during the times we didn't want to wait on the next ferry. The hotel's decor was meant to be the imagined home of an aging rock star with opulent tastes and a collection of rock memorabilia spanning a few decades. I found it edgy without being gaudy and the common areas were nicely done with marble floors and expansive spaces. Rock music is played throughout the hotel and is even pumped through underwater speakers in the pool. Some visitors took the rock star theme a little too far as I saw one young couple being escorted off the premises and I was told another guest had caused a fire in their room. Even with all the partying, our room was quiet and our sleep undisturbed. Onsite dining options were plentiful, ranging from the upscale Palms Restaurant to the grab-and-go Marketplace. Here are a few pointers for eating onsite: **Make reservations for the Palms as far in advance as possible since it is popular with locals. We had a nice dinner there and also had appetizers the night of our arrival in their bar area. For the value, I highly recommend doing gourmet appetizers and drinks at the bar (no kids allowed though). **The Kitchen has a wonderful breakfast buffet and is a great way to start your busy day in the parks. **Try room service when you have crowd fatigue. They serve the same great burgers as the Hard Rock Cafe as well as some other Cafe items and prices are comparable. **Emack and Bolio's Marketplace is a quick breakfast stop where you can grab a hot breakfast sandwich or cut fruit as you head to the parks. Eat on the ferry ride over and you won't be late for early admission. Because we were visiting as a family mainly for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, staying onsite gave us an hour early access to the park before it opened up to general admission. That extra hour allowed the kids to see and ride everything multiple times in HP World. (Of course, we were there in January!). It was a huge benefit for us to stay at a Universal hotel just for this early access. Although I didn't check it out, the Velvet Bar had live entertainment every night and seemed to be hopping. I also didn't have time to visit the spa or fitness center, but perhaps next time. :)", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice place for a short family stay\u201d", "Author": "JJudy", "ReviewID": "UR127703057", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for 2 nights as part of our vacation in Orlando over this year's March break.

We booked our stay in September '11. We were staying in one of their over-sized rooms (around 500 square feet) that contained a sleeper sofa. We needed this since we have 3 sons. We stayed at Portofina Bay Resort 3 years ago and wanted to try a different property. One of our primary reasons for staying here was to take advantage of the inclusion of express passes for the entire party and the early opening option at IOA. We arrived around 8:00AM on Sunday, parked our van and picked up our room keys. We did not receive a text when our room was ready but when we checked back around 3:30PM after touring the parks, our room (#4101 with a lovely courtyard view) was ready. Not going to belabor the points of how expensive everything is. It is a full-service hotel. These type of hotels charge pretty much for everything. Our room rate was $440 plus tax. Self-parking is $17 a day. We knew that there were extra charges for internet access in the rooms, no fridge, extra charge for work-out room and so on and so forth. We research all of this type of information before we choose a property. One can choose how much of these types of services that are needed and either choose them or not. Just like paying for a bellhop to carry your bags. That is one's choice. The valets were great about letting you park your car to unload yourself. They would show you where to park and just hold your key while you were up at your room. They offered this anytime you needed drop things groceries etc. and they did it with a smile. We chose the HRH for the express passes, great location to the parks, and the over-all theming of the property. We found the beds to be quite comfortable. We felt that the room did not cool as well as it should but it was adequate. The 2 sinks were great for 5 folks. We used an over-sized cooler to store our milk and orange juice. We had a smaller cooler to store soft drinks and bottled waters. We just used the available ice machines for this. We had breakfast items in our room-- cereal, muffins, donuts, yoguart, etc. Not a problem at all. There is a Super Walmart nearby where we picked up all of these items. Maid service was great. Amazing what a $10 tip on the first day will do. We had towels, shampoos, and body wash coming out of our ears. We loved how they were good about getting to the room early in the day. It was always serviced when we returned from the parks in the early afternoon. The pool area is nice and includes a decent slide for the kids. This is another area that can be expensive but we just took a drink with us to the pool. The servers give you a dirty look but that is nothing versus saving multiple dollars. Our kids drank bottled Gator Aides at the pool and it was no trouble to run up to the room and grab them. We learned at Portofino that Loew's frowns on folks bringing their small coolers into the pool area. We were always able to locate a couple of chairs. Occasionally that meant moving a towel that was obviously just laying on a chair for now reason. Not a biggie. We did not dine at any of the on-property restaurants at the HRC. The Kitchen was a possibility but the price just seemed a tad much for us. We ate @ JB's Margaritaville one night in City Walk. We also dined at Mythos in IOA and Confisco Grille in IOA. We ate lunch at Circus McGirkus in the park and @ Thunder River Falls, also in the park. On our last day, we dined at Cheesecake Factory at a nearby mall on our way to Melbourne and Kennedy Space Center. The issue we had during our stay occurred on Monday afternoon mid-day after touring the parks in the morning when we returned to our room to take naps and some were heading to the pool. There was a terrible drilling sound like concrete being broken-up directly above us. Just an amazing sound. We called the hotel operator and after she asked us what the terrible noise was, directed our call to the front desk. Without boring you with lots of details, (it is amazing how the geniuses at the front desk will try and spin a story) we got a manager on the line who at first offered 1 night \"free\" and then when she literally could not hear my wife on the phone because of the noise changed the offer to two \"free nights\". The short story was that this work was to be going on for the next 2 weeks from 9 to 5 during the day. They really had no room of our type to switch us to. We headed to the lobby to take naps that day and play on our computers (free wi-fi in the lobby) and the next day barely heard any noise. We did not hear anything on Wednesday or Thursday. The bottom-line don't put people who book rooms 6 months in advance into a room that has construction going on and not even bother mentioning it at check-in. Poor planning on the hotel's part but, again, they made it right in our opinions. The savings of $880 plus the tax that would have been charged amounted to around $1000. If not for the noise issue and how it was handled at first I would have rated our stay excellent. Yes, this hotel is expensive, especially during the busy times of the year (Spring Break) but it is so convenient to the parks (a 10 minute or so walk to IOA and even less to Universal property) and it is very lovely. All that and the before mentioned express pass inclusion was wonderful. We bypassed some lines that were over 100 minutes during our stay. The passes are our primary reason for staying \"on-property\". Those that try and compare the Disney fast passes to the express line are ill-informed in my opinion. We are Disney Vacation Members and love Disney for what it is but the express pass option for Universal hotel guests is awesome. We had a great time on this vacation.

The hotel is a good 4 star hotel which has it's pro's and con's. Con's Parking was $17 a day plus tax which is a rip off. We had paid extra for a club room so I think club room guests should get free parking. Reception was so noisy we couldn't here the receptionist speak! (there was a live band playing which is cool just not when you're checking in) The club lounge should may be have a separate check in area to avoid long waits. If you don't get to the pool before 8.30 then all the sun beds were gone. What was particually frustrating is that most beds were reserved by people who had gone to the parks for a few hours first and would return after lunch. There are plenty of pool guards and waitressing staff around the pool they should be more observant and if a bed has not been sat on for. 40 mins or longer then they should remove all towels etc that's reserving them to make it fair. There is a dj by the pool most days which is fun but just sort the sound out so it's clear and not just noise. Pool side rooms are noisy bring earplugs!! PRO'S The staff are very friendly especially around the pool service is very attentive. Rooms are pleasant enough with all your basic amenities and extras air conditioning is a bit on the warm side though. Good hairdryer, good shower, and great coffee machine. Plenty of channels on the tv. Club Lounge is different to club lounges I've visited before but then this is a \"hard rock\" hotel and has a different vibe so just go with it. Breakfast in the lounge is a selection of cereal, bagels, pastry's tea coffe and juice served from 7-10 Snacks 12-15.00 included crisps and chewy bars and a selection of soft drinks. 17.00-19.00 they serve complimentary beer and wine along with nibbles such as cheese & biscuits and lots of other canap\u00e9s . (this part of the day is very busy and resembles feeding time at the zoo). We didn't visit the parks this time but those who did enjoyed the fast pass that your room key provides as it was spring break the parks were packed.

The most recent was August 2011 for 7 nights in a garden view with club access. After getting upgraded the first time to club we found it hard not do anything else so its club for us any-more :) This is not your typical 5 star resort but its more layed back without being in your face kind of way. Rooms are clean , fresh and suits everyone's need love the coffee pod maker and always got extra hot choc of the cleaner. The only thing there is no set time for rooms to be cleaned and it can be late when they are cleaned but the was only twice out of the 7 days we were there. All staff we encountered were always smiling and seemed happy to be enjoying the job they were doing. From valet to lounge staff each would take time out to chat to ya. Lynn in the club lounge was great booking spa treatments for my mom in the portifino even given her a discount code. My mom and 2 treatments and would not recommend them for the prices they were charging. The hair dresser seemed less interested and was not great. Early entry to harry potter was a heaven given it was peak season though it amazed us at the crowds there at 7am. Club level snacks, drinks, breakfast and dessert got us through our day with very little money spent on food. Pool area is great, loads going through the day and night and there is something to keep everyone occupied. Drinks and snacks at the pool a little expensive but not that bad considering the service and location. Cabanas by the pool are a great way to spend the day by the pool and can highly recommend the Steve wonder one for location and theme. Security by the pool at weekends is strict and your room key has to be shown to gain entry. Express pass is the only way to do universal and its included with your room cost. 5min walk to parks or you can get a boat or rickshaw.

My family of five (11, 13 & 15 yr olds) loved everything about the resort. The music/entertainment that played in the pool area kept us all enjoying the experience despite the cool, cloudy weather. The Express Pass though was the best (free with hotel stay on site) - we never waited in any lines in the height of March Break on a Friday and Saturday. The equivalent cost of the Express Pass is the cost of the room for one night. We ate dinner at an italian restaurant at Portofino Bay which was recommended by the concierge. It was good although not great but what I would expect both price and food wise on a resort.

It's a little pricey, but for the convenience and amenities it's well worth it. Both theme parks are literally a short stroll from the property; if you're too tired to walk from all the sightseeing there's a complimentary shuttle boat which seats about 40-50 people making regular runs from the rear of the hotel to Citywalk, an area offering restaurants and nightlife adjacent to the theme parks. Your room key acts as a fast pass to avoid long lines in the theme parks and also gets you admission to the parks an hour earlier than people staying off property. Back at the Hard Rock, the pool area is a great place to hang for the day; it has a beautiful large pool (the only drawback being that it has no areas deeper than about four feet), several hot tubs, a sand volleyball court, ping pong tables, an outdoor bar/restaurant, cabanas, and tons of staff to bring you food and drink right to your beach chair. I traveled with my teens and they loved everything about the experience. The only drawbacks we experienced were some of the food prices; for example, a plain bagel is $3.00 in the convenience shop, the restaurant breakfast buffet is close to $20 per person, etc. Other than the extra money you'll have to fork over for some overpriced food and drink items you'll enjoy the experience.

That being said, I purchased the VIP Access Pass through Hard Rock in the hopes that I might get a room upgrade for my vacation. My husband and I traveled with another couple and arrived prior to check-in. When we registered, we inquired about the upgrade and were told that the hotel was fully committed. We understood but, when we came away from the front desk, the other couple told us they were asked if we'd like adjoining rooms. At that point, I was confused and, quite frankly, upset. If they couldn't offer an upgrade, how could they offer adjoining rooms? If they're booked, they're booked. So, when the rooms became ready, we again asked about an upgrade and again were told nothing was available. Being in the industry, I was expecting to be offered to be put on a list for a possible upgrade during our stay, but got nothing other than, \"We're fully booked, here are your room keys.\" When we looked at the keys, we saw the name of the other couple on the folio. No apology, no nothing; they simply crossed out the room number and wrote the correct one on it...or so we thought. When the other couple tried to call us and gave our name to the operator, she insisted she couldn't connect them because the front desk had them listed as us, and vice versa. When our friends tried to get into their room initially, they had been given 2 sets of keys...one that didn't work (which were actually to OUR room) and their set. Just poor, poor front desk service all the way around. When we got off the elevator, the hallway carpet was absolutely filthy, and I thought we were in for the stay from hell, what with the problems with the front desk already setting an extremely negative tone for the start of the vacation. However, when we opened the door to the room, I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were bright, clean, fresh, large, and appeared to have been recently renovated. Ours was the last room on the end, and I thought the stairway noise would be overwhelming, but we had absolutely no noise trouble whatsoever. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on, and I have a Sleep Number bed at home.

A lot of \"I don't care\" attitudes from employees - Rooms (see below) - Pool area too noisy if you're trying to just relax The Awful When we arrived we decided we might do better in a kid suite rather than trying to cram 5 into a standard room. We asked for an upgrade which cost us an $150 extra per night (this is on top of the $375 or so per night we had already paid). The furniture in the room was very worn and dirty. The sofa sleeper had questionable dried white stains on it on the cushions and dried booger looking stuff on the side. GROSS! Would not expect anyone to sit on this, let alone sleep on it. How does this type of thing get by housekeeping? Reported the problem and was put in a different suite. This one wasn't much better. No gross looking stains on the sofa, but still very dirty & dusty. Obviously hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. Worn out upholstery and sagging cushions. Mold in bathrooms, broken shower door, scratched up furniture. Problems are not just wear & tear, but cleanliness. Ended up putting sheets on the sofa & chair so we could at least sit on them. I felt like I should report the issues directly to management (Steve) to make sure they were aware of their housekeeping issues and at least voice my dissatisfaction with the condition of the accomodations. He offered to move us again, but after seeing 2 bad rooms, figured a 3rd wouldn't be any different. He compensated us by cutting upgrade fee in 1/2 for the 1st night, comping the rollaway (it would have been an extra $25 per night) and giving us $200 in hotel comps to use around the property. No compensation was on the bill the night before we checked out so had to go to front desk to get it worked out which involved pulling manager back in for verification. He didn't recall what he had told us two days earlier because he had forgotten to make a note on the account. Took awhile to get it squared away. Hard Rock needs some attention. When I pay $400/night for a hotel room, I expect it, first and foremost, to be clean, no matter what the room cost. That said, if cleanliness is important to you, you might want to consider one of the other two on-site hotels until Hard Rock bucks up and deals with their housekeeping issues and updates the rooms.

The staff at the Hard Rock are always accommodating and friendly. This was our second stay at the Hard Rock and we made sure to ask for a room at the FAR END of the hall away from the elevators and \"snack room.\" If you have teenagers, you understand the IMPORTANCE of being able to sleep in a little later! Now, I would like to make a few suggestions to the hotel . . . during Spring Break, it is imperative to staff housekeeping so that your guests don't return after a long day out, only to find that the room has not been serviced! This happened (4) out of (7) days during our stay. Secondly, who builds a hotel with MOTION ACTIVATED A/C? Yes, this is correct . . . so, when you wake up in a cold sweat . . . it wasn't a nightmare about that roller coaster . . . it is the A/C which has turned off since no one MOVES while they are sleeping. Our unit was actually broken, but was serviced immediately. The \"club level\" is a great idea when traveling with kids with big appetites . . . I would definitely recommend this floor. Again, the housekeeping should be prepared to remove the plates littering the hallway throughout the day. We had a tray sitting outside our door for (2) days! The POOL . . . nice, heated and not too deep. The seating can get competitive . . . so, be prepared. I was a little miffed by the idea that our family could not use a small, soft ball that we'd brought along . . . only \"toys\" PURCHASED poolside may be used! This seemed a little greedy. The food selections on the menu were all really tasty and there are plenty of options for fruit and other \"healthy\" items, but for the most part it's regular old junk food, but good junk food! The wait staff are all very friendly and helpful in choosing food and drinks. Now, the chairs are a totally different story . . . they were sticky and many even had \"USED\" band-aids stuck to them . . . come on guys . . . part of maintaining a pool area is cleaning the chairs and removing trash . . . this includes used bandages. The snack area just inside the hotel on the pool level has all sorts of items for breakfast and lunch. I was really hopeful that there would be a few more healthy selections, but it's mostly donuts, bagels, and giant flavored milks that no child can finish. Again, during the \"high season,\" the ONE check out person who seemed confused as to where all the people were coming from . . . clearly, needed some assistance. The valet has a new TEXT system for retrieving your car from the outskirts, however, this system only worked sporadically. I felt really badly for these guys . . . they are always very helpful and it definitely was not their fault that the TEXT method wasn't working. They simply were not receiving the messages. So, overall I would recommend this hotel to friends.

Also, it was so much fun, the music at the pool was great, the restaurant outside was very good, the movies at the pool at night were a big hit with the kids, the Emil restaurant where you could just run in and get quick food worked great when you were on your way to the park. That was just the time we spent at the hotel but it is a perfect location to visit the park. You can walk in 10 mins or take a water taxi or get a bike taxi. The hotel in on the park site so you can get in 1 hour before the park opens to the public which allowed us to get to the Harry Potter World before the crowds, we did not have to wait to get on the rides there at all.

The lounge itself is fairly basic but has the great advantage of being able to have a quick breakfast before heading to the parks. The soft drinks were a bonus bearing in mind that a bottle of water in the room was $7! We had interconnecting rooms and the beds were really comfy. Staying at the hotel gives you the advantage of early access to the park an hour before it opens which was fantastic for getting into Islands of Adventure to do Harry Potter. It also gives you Express pass on to the rides which is an absolute bonus. The hotel also provides complimentary water taxis to the parks. The hotel also has a library of guitars which are free to borrow with a substantial deposit held on your credit card - for our 16 year old son this was one of the highlights of the trip. If you have time to linger, breakfast at the Kitchen was great. The Velvet Lounge is great for some adult time and an evening nightcap. Bri gave us the best service. Of the three hotels at the resort the Hard Rock is closest to the parks. The Beach Club is a great place for lunch - the whole pool area has a buzz about it.

The rooms were nice, comfy beds & kept quite clean but not any different than any other hotel. There are no refrigerators in the rooms, unless you want to pay $15 extra to request one. There are public laundry facilities on the 2nd & 4th floors. There is a Keurig coffeemaker in the room with supplied coffee, tea & hot cocoa, which is replenished daily. The bathroom is very very compact. However, there is an additional sink/mirror outside the bathroom so that two people can be getting ready at the same time. My most major complaint during our stay was that there was a noise coming out of a large vent in the room which hindered our sleep, even for my 10 year old. We had to muffle it with pillows but you could still hear it. We purposely did not turn on the air-conditioning for this reason but still had the constant noise. The hotel was packed to capacity so we were unable to change our rooms. Another negative was that when I made my reservations, they would not honor an internet special of 15% off reservations because they said they had reached their maximum number of special rates (even though that was not mentioned in the email or website). I then asked to use my AAA card & they would not honor that either for the same reason, which is really unfair. I have never had my AAA card declined for hotel reservations before for a hotel that typically accepts it. The pool area is nice but not as big as it looks. There were two days in which we walked around for ten minutes and could not find loungers. The loungers are placed so close together that you are practically on top of the person next to you. There is a sandy area of the pool which to me was a negative because when you enter the pool, it feels gritty on your feet from all the sand. There is a Beachclub outdoor eatery & although we normally like to eat poolside, the music there was blaringly loud & prevented us from doing so. The music was a bit loud in general in the pool area. I know it is the Hard Rock but some of us actually would like to relax quietly after a day at the parks. Another negative was that they allow smoking at certain sections near the pool, which I did not like. Sometimes we only found loungers in a smoking area & were stuck breathing in other people's smoke. On the plus side, the location to Universal cannot be beat & was the sole reason we stayed here. It is about a 5 minute walk to both parks & Citiwalk. Water taxis ran approx. every 8 - 10 minutes & were very convenient after all the walking at the parks. The ride & walk there is very scenic & beautiful. They do allow you early access to the parks for staying onsite HOWEVER the only thing open is the Wizarding World of Harry Potter from 8 am to 9am, before the park opens. However, to our dismay, we got up early to go to Harry Potter & arrived at 8:40 only to find non-hotel guests already being allowed into the park at that time. It was not even clear which line hotel guests were to enter, so even though we got to Harry Potter at 8:45, there were already a ton of non-hotel guests there & we ended up waiting 45 minutes just for Harry Potter. Not cool. There is a place on the first floor were you can buy snacks, ice cream, bagels & cereal food, however, it was expensive. A bagel was $3.50, which is outrageous. They have large water bottles for $4.50 and $6, again too expensive. Water at the parks was $2.75. We brought our own mini thermos & filled it with water & ice from the sink & icemaker. They do sell mini pints & half-pints of milk. We ate at the Kitchen restaurant, which was very good. Our favorite meals during our stay were at the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant, NBA City restaurant & Mythos at IOA, which I highly recommend for it's awesome interior atmosphere & food to match. They are usually open for lunch & on some evenings for dinner. I preferred them more for dinner but call ahead to see if they will even be open for dinner. All the restaurants/shops throughout Universal, IOA & City Walk honor AAA so be sure to use it! Also, there is no supermarked/drugstore within short walking distance, so if you do not have a car, be sure to bring enough toiletries with you.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Property!\u201d", "Author": "miami33029", "ReviewID": "UR125651537", "Content": "Wow.

We had never been, and I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so my husband humored me for this trip :) We had a blast! We booked a room at the Hard Rock specifically because of the off season deal prices, and the fact that your room key doubles as a fast pass for all the rides. This alone is worth staying on property, it saved us so much time and it was great being able to ride things as many times as we wanted. There are a couple of rides it doesn't apply to but we didn't have a problem anyway (although it WAS off season, as I said). When we checked in, we mentioned to the desk staff we were there for our anniversary and they upgraded us to a club level suite at no charge. This was completely unexpected and so appreciated! It totally made our stay. Being able to enjoy free breakfast, free snacks/water/soda, free alcohol at happy hour, and free dessert/snack every night was such a nice perk. Even if we didn't get this free, I would say it was worth the price for next time. The day of check out, our flight didn't leave until later in the evening, so we checked our bags. One of the perks of staying here is that anything you buy in the parks, you can have sent back to your room so you don't have to carry it around all day. As we were leaving our room, they brought us some bags of things that weren't ours. It ended up being a mix up with another guess miswriting their room number as ours, but as an apology for the \"inconvenience\", the staff gave us 2 free buffet breakfast vouchers for the Kitchen restaurant downstairs. Since we were checking out we asked if we could use them for lunch instead, and they couldn't do that. Instead, they offered us drink coupons for the restaurant or Beach Club. This was more than enough for us since it was such a minor inconvenience, so we got to enjoy a delicious lunch at the Kitchen, and then some free drinks. I read someone else's review that the mixed drinks are poured lightly and I have to disagree - ours were quite strong (and very good). Overall this was a wonderful stay for us.

I was traveling with my two sons (10, 12). We arrived at noon and I appreciated that our room was ready.

This wasn't a problem at all but the front desk guy said NOTHING about how level 7 floors worked, how to use your key to get there or what was offered on how we make the most of the EXPENSIVE upgrade. Very poor. I have stayed concierge level before but it was very poor service to not review with the customer how to make the most of it. Was I asked if I wanted any meal reservations? No. Was I asked if I had any questions on how to make the most of my stay? No. I may as well have been checking into a Holiday Inn Express. The room? Just a normal hotel room. I wasn't blown away by it at all. Concierge level rooms are often bigger and cushier. This really wasn't. Bathroom was basic. Clean, though, which of course is important. It was similar to a Marriott type room. We headed to the Concierge room to get some water and snacks before heading out to Universal. This is my biggest complaint about the hotel. The concierge eating room was very small by most other hotel standards, and our \"snacks\" was trail mix. The bottles of water were convenient and helpful, but I was totally underwhelmed by the array of food/snacks. We had last stayed at the Animal Kingdom Concierge level and it was MUCH nicer. So as not to beat a dead horse, all in all, the concierge level at this hotel is NOT at all worth the expense. In the mornings, when breakfast is being served, it is Soooo crowded. Breakfast was the good meal but if you crunch the numbers, you'd have to stick AWFULLY close to this room during your stay to get your money's worth. The Happy Hour is quick and packed up quicker. Do I think this service at this particular hotel is worth it? No. That said, the women who worked in there were very friendly and welcoming, and that's always nice. The vibe of the hotel is cool. Lots of loud music playing which I loved. My kids thought the music was uncool, but for my age demographic? I loved it. The pool........ warm? yes. Clean? yes. Kids were so bummed out that there was no deep end. I can appreciate how this appeals to parents with younger children, but for a tween? They got bored quickly. The slide is just okay. I think they each went down twice and that was that. They bought a $6.75 beach ball and that bought me an hour. Service around the pool is excruciatingly slow. Spend your money on beer or wine. The mixed drinks were poured very lightly. The biggest perk (and for a guest in a regular room vs. concierge level) is the proximity to Universal and to City Walk but mostly the EXPRESS PASS associated with you being a guest at this hotel. It saved us literally hours. We kept repeatedly saying, \"Wow, this is great!! We are saving so much time\". Would I stay here again? Yes. Would I stay Concierge level?

I was expecting when we were given a room on the second floor that it would have a dull,boring view of a building/wall but instead it was quiet and had lovely view of the greens. The beds were the best, you'll feel really rested each time you wake up. The room has two lavatories, one in the bathroom and another one just outside the bathroom which was very convenient. Our rooms were equipped with a coffee making machine that came with a variety of coffee capsules all for free. You can even ask for more if you wish. Room service was courteous, fast and efficient. We asked for some plates and cutleries and immediately we were sent several sets (we're five) more than enough for what we asked for. The location can't be beat. You can either walk (10 minutes) to the park or take the ferry which comes every so often. They offer the best deal of having to use your room key as an express pass to most of the rides which could save you a LOT of time. Waiting was a thing of the past. Just for this privilege alone was worthy enough of staying inside the Universal Studio otherwise it would cost you something like more than $50 per person if you purchase the express pass when staying outside the park. We ate in one of their restaurants. It was of good value but some dishes were quite salty for our taste. The only lowdown in our stay was the billing. We were inappropriately and erroneously billed. It was very clear on our checkout how much our bill was. We were charged also for mini bar items we did not use. That we thought was already cleared out and reversed when we were checking out because the receptionist at that time made sure she did and we saw it on our billing statement. When we got home, we were surprised that we were being charged with so much more than what we should pay for (the mini bar and a room charges we could not understand. We called and emailed the hotel to clear things out and they too accepted the mistake. We were there last October 2011, and it's now almost the end of February 2012 and there was no refund until now. During our last conversation, the hotel representative wanted us to make the necessary arrangements with our bank (which was not supposed to be because they were the one who billed us wrongly) and wanted us to call them (the hotel), and have a three-way conversation with the bank, the hotel and myself. This was very unprofessional considering it was their mistake. If not for that, I would have given this hotel a 5.

It also gets you into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter-all of this section of the park - 1 hr before the park regularly opens. If you really want your wand to pick you or must enjoy a breakfast pumpkin juice, you will want to stay at this hotel.\u00a0 There are 2 other hotels on- site.Hard Rock is the best because it is so accessible.

The first, I book my room early- 6 months out or more. This way I have a room during peak times. Then I watch their website for specials. Hard Rock has always honored any discount if I booked with them on a regular room rate. I always ask for a room upgrade on check-in. It's a 50/50 thing but if they aren't too full, it can happen. The other way is frequent flier miles . More airlines are offering this perk . Use your miles or split cash/miles. I've been able to stay for \"free\" the past 2 trips using miles (miles DO have a cash value but not dishing out anything for the room is wonderful ). Just don't get carried away with that handy room key/credit card option! Finally, the hotel accommodations . The beds are comfortable and the rooms are jazzy .

We liked that not only did the bathroom have a sink, there was also a sink outside the bathroom which made getting ready in the morning more convenient.

There is also a boat that will take you to city walk, but we found it was more convenient to walk than to wait for the boat. My kids loved the pool area. The pool is very large, and has a 260 foot winding water slide that is built into the landscaping. I especially loved that the pool is 4ft deep at its deepest point so that I didn't have to worry about my youngest daughter having difficulties playing in the pool. There were always at least 3 lifeguards on duty at all times. My only complaint about our stay was the loudness of the hallways at night.

The first night I did not sleep well at all, the other nights were a bit better ( I think exhaustion had a part in that!) A few tips that I would love to share from our trip are: 1. Eat at Mythos in Islands of Adventure - the food is great and the prices are comparable to the restaurants in City Walk. Our favorite items were the panini and bacon cheeseburger. 2. Harry Potter's Forbidden Journey ride made my son and I nauseous. It is a fantastic ride - I loved it, but I could not walk straight after getting off and felt a little ill all day. If you are prone to motion sickness - beware! I have heard that wearing a motion sickness patch that you can get from your doctor helps. 3.

Upon arrival at Hard Rock, we were so impressed. The property is spotless, and the staff is terrific. The check in desk spent about 20 mins going over all the amenities and telling us about the parks, the restaurants, etc. Our rooms were clean, well decorated, and well equipped with free wifi, cable, etc. I am a nut about things being clean, and everything here was spotless. Housekeeping did a great job each day while we were out. We did notice room service left trays out longer than expected, but not a problem. There is an in room docking station for iPhone, which was a nice extra. Pool area was gorgeous and extremely well staffed and well maintained. Every staff person we dealt with during our stay was friendly, and went out of their way to bring us more towels, give advice, accommodate requests, and was generally extremely friendly. The Kitchen restaurant was great for breakfast (buffet was included in our package and was AWESOME). We had dinner twice at the pool bar restaurant-great place to unwind after a day at the parks, and they even had a \"dive in movie\" each night. Kids loved the huge water slide, and adults loved that the pool is never deeper than about 5 feet, so no stress watching children. Went to Universal one day, and Islands of Adventure the other, plus strolling on City Walk both days. Hotel is super accessible to parks, either on a beautiful walking trail (5 min) or by water taxi. Rock and pop music pumped into every nook and cranny (it is the Hard Rock, after all), and great rock and roll items throughout. Kids loved the guitar fountain, and the music themed rooms. Also had character dinners, magicians at dinner one night, and a nice play space off the restaurant for young children. Great store on ground level with Emack & Bolios ice cream, Starbucks coffee/lattes, and snacks. PROS: Express pass makes this a no-brainer. Made ALL the difference in enjoying the park. Clean rooms, good food, great pool area (open and lifeguards from 8am-10pm), super close to parks, included breakfast, great staff. CONS: $15/day to self park.

Nice hotel, and the Fixx (the real band) was even playing in the lobby when we checked in which was very cool. It seems like all of the highpoints are touched on in other reviews, but from our perspective: The Good: Fun atmosphere. Close walk to Universal and City Walk, although given that our room was in the wing closest to City Walk it would have been nice to have exit/entrance doors on that side of the hotel so that we didn't have to walk back to the middle of the hotel coming and going. If the doors were there we couldn't find them. The Kitchen restaurant is one of the best hotel restaurants I've eaten in, and very kid friendly. Great food. The fast passes worked great in the park. And the free internet worked well. The bad: It's not a quiet hotel. I was awakened several times by voices in the hallway, in adjoining rooms and by nearby showers turning on. There is also an anti-Disney bias, which makes sense to some extent given that they're competition, except that it hurt the overall experience. Kids after long theme park days want to watch a little tv, but of course there are none of the Disney channels on the tv lineup. There's not even NickJr. So really disappointing viewing options for kids. Also, even though the concierge said that she gets Disney questions all the time, she said that she knows nothing about the Disney parks. Really? And you can't buy Disney park tickets at the hotel - \"everything but Disney\" was how they put it. Because really, who comes to Orlando to go to a Disney park? Also, although the band was great, it made it very difficult to check in. We had to shout back and forth with the girl at the front desk. And I may have missed something because I thought that she said that there was a 10% discount at Hard Rock Cafe with our room keys/charges. So we went there late our first night and had a mediocre meal only to learn that there was no discount, and worse, it took almost 10 minutes to pay using the room key card because although it is supposed to be a seamless charging option throughout the parks and at the cafe, apparently it is a complicated process. It would have been far faster just to use a credit card. The sleazy: when I quickly glanced over my bill at checkout, I noticed a $60+ charge for long distance to some foreign country. I had receipts showing that we were shopping/dining at Downtown Disney at the time, and they said that they would remove it from the bill. It may have been some random mistake, but more likely is that a hotel employee came into the room while we were out and made a long phone call. Not cool. I'd definitely stay here again given the location, but I'll check my bill carefully, I won't try to use the room card to charge anything, and I may move to a Disney hotel the days that I'm planning to go to Disney parks.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIt's not just about the hotel, it's also about the parks\u201d", "Author": "crzzzr", "ReviewID": "UR123812652", "Content": "We decided to stay here because it was the mid-priced hotel within the park, because you got free fastpass access, and for convenience. We stayed for a week and got a great 7 night rate. We were hardly in our room there is so much to see and do. Riding rollercoasters at 7.30am was certainly a different way to wake up! If you are a Harry Potter fan, do yourself a favour and stay inside the park at the Hard Rock or one of the others, you will save yourself some serious queue time. Go straight to Harry Potter using your early park access - do the more popular rides then leave. Go back 1 hour before closing time and do a few more attractions there. Using the hotel supplied fastpass access - we waited only 10 mins for rides showing a 45 minute wait time - i can't imagine doing these busy parks any other way. We also bought a 6 park 14 day unlimited park ticket which was around $300 and well worth it as you can jump between parks whenever you want. This hotel has a Hertz rental car counter which was very handy - though their walk-up prices seemed quite high. So I recommend pre-booking if you need a car. Easy 7 min walk to the park from this hotel. No need to wait for the water taxi to the parks. Garden View rooms good enough in my view - you are hardly in your room anyhow :) Breakfast was around $20 plus service charge for a good buffet service. We ate at various other restaurants within the parks/universal city and had a great experience every time - the Hard Rock Cafe (restaurant, not hotel) meal was particularly good too. Another plus is that you can charge in-park purchases to your room and have them sent back there (the next day) so you don't have to carry them around with you. Guest laundry facilities were great and very useful to us as we were travelling for 6 weeks. Would definitely stay here again. Negatives: 1.

The foyer is lovely with free internet access there. There is a Hard Rock shop with reasonably priced goods. The room was a standard hotel room with 2 double/queen beds and adequate room for 2 adults and 2 children. The only drawback was the tea and coffee machine was one where there were individual containers that were put in containing tea, coffee or hot chocolate... all of which were disgusting. But we found these machines in other hotels including Disney so it seems to be a universal problem! The location of the Hotel was sensational. It was a quick walk to both parks, and to City Walk where there were plenty of restaurants to choose from (and much cheaper than the hotel). There was also a boat directly from the hotel to all these places and it was free! But the best part of all, was that when staying at the hotel (or the other 2 Loews hotels nearby) you got a free Express Pass for each person to use at both Islands of Adventure (containing HP World) and Universal Studios. These are worth $87 each and allowed you to enter rides from a special queue which had very little times (mind you, it was very quiet when we went and the lines were very short anyway, but they would be priceless in busy times!) The 4 passes we got for free were worth one nights accommodation in value!

The grass and other flora outside is kept really well, and just out the front of the hotel lobby there's an awesome water fountain with a guitar sculpture in the middle (it's seen in all the brochures e.t.c.) Inside there is a great lobby area and the place is extremely clean. The staff are all very courteous and a great many of them have quite unique looks (fans of 'hard rock' music I would guess), lots of spikey hair and cool jewellry (makes a change from the 'Disney-Look' you'll be seeing for a lot of your stay in Orlando no doubt). We stayed in a standard room but it felt like pure luxury. The rooms are spacious and have framed pictures of various rock legends on the walls which adds that cool touch. We didn't have much of a view because we had palm trees right outside the window, but who can complain about that? \"Ooh! This exotic plant of paradise is preventing me from seeing the pool!\" The bathrooms are also very spacious, very clean and to add to that extra bit of 'star treatment' you have some huge vanity mirrors over the sinks (the ones with all the lightbulbs around the glass). There's a few different restaurants (my favourite of which is called 'The Kitchen') and you can get a good variety of food. I can't remember though what the vegetarian selection was like, sorry. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all good here. There's a hot tub and swimming pool available to guests too. One of my favourite features included underwater speakers for the pool! It was quite a strange sensation to be floating along listening to a favourite tune and then dunking under the water and not having it interrupted at all, but it was awesome. Scattered around the hotel is various 'hard rock' memorabillia; if you're familiar with the Hard Rock franchise you'll know what I'm talking about. In cabinets all around the hotel you'll find famous outfits worn by rock legends, instruments and all sorts. I'm sure they probably rotate but while I was there I saw outfits and instruments that were previously owned by Elvis, Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss and many more. There is also a merchandise store if you'd like to take some cool, branded souveneirs home with you. The hotel is also situated right by 'City Walk', which is basically Universal's version of 'Downtown Disney', having lots of different shops and restaurants to spend your money at. It includes a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 if you're a big fan of the brand. At the end of City Walk is of course; the parks. Which means your hotel is roughly a five minute walk from the attractions. Nice! Lastly; staying at the hotel you get early access to the Universal theme parks which is awesome and your hotel key card also doubles as a fast pass for the rides which was just incredible. I almost felt guilty walking straight past all the general admission folk... almost. Because of this we got to do basically every ride at Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios. The hotel is on the pricey side but it did feel like luxury to me and is probably the nicest hotel I've stayed in.

The most attractive incentive for this hotel is that they offer a package that gives you an early admittance pass (1 hour earlier) to the parks and a \"skip to the front of the line\" card for the rides. The pool area is also amazing! The location makes having a car unnecessary, as you can walk or take a complimentary water taxi ride to the City Walk area, which is where the 2 parks have their main gates. Our room was rather spacious, though it had weird angles to it. For example, the wall on my side of the bed got increasingly wider as it went the length of the bed. (ie: think a triangular line) This made it difficult because the narrowest part was at the top and my head was faced right up against the wall. The bed was comfortable enough, however the pillow was the worst that I had ever used in my life. There were lumps throughout it and this made sleeping very uncomfortable. I did not find any replacement pillows in the closet. The sink area and the toilet/shower was separated. This was especially helpful because someone could be in the shower getting ready (it also had a small sink and mirror in it) while someone else could be preparing in front of the sink and mirror outside of the bathroom. (Great for family travel!) Two of my biggest complaints are as follows: 1. The walls were VERY thin. The second night we had neighbors that we could hear everything they were saying. Luckily they went out for a late night evening, so we were able to fall asleep. However, they returned after 2 AM and the noise started all over again. We were in a room that had an adjoining option. It was connected to that room, so maybe that was why the walls offered less sound proofing? 2. Although the room seemed clean, if you look close, you could see some neglected areas and that made me question how clean the rest of the room was. For example, when I looked around the mirror, there was dust all around it and behind it. It looked as if it hadn't been dusted in months. Nevertheless, the lobby area appeared spotless. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for family travel. (They also have a \"kids club\" option on site.) If you're looking to be right near the parks,are looking for a beautiful pool area, or want to be able to spend your time at City Walk, this is the place for you. A few years ago we stayed at the Portofino, which is close to the Hard Rock Hotel. The Hard Rock has a better location and is more family/kid friendly.

All the staff are wonderful especially the ones by the pool who loved discussing fashion and hair with my daughters!! When requesting a room i always ask for one on the same floor as the reception/shop. It is just our preference as it is easier to get to without having to use the lift. Position of the hotel is ideal for the parks and the FOTL is worth its weight in gold. Harry Potter World was out of this world...the detail in the shops was brilliant. Well worth lining up for Ollivanders. If you utilise the extra hour in the morning and go just before the park closes it is possible to ride Harry Potter Ride several times - i rode it one night, as a single rider, 7 times in a row!!", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel and Service\u201d", "Author": "BluenoseJosh", "ReviewID": "UR123057023", "Content": "When we first arrived at the hotel it looked great with a big drive up to the entrance and the fountain in the centre and that set the tone for everything else about the hotel. It was very clean, staff were always helpful and had great facilities such as restaurants, shops and a gym and very good swimming pool. Only downside is that it was about $12 a day for parking which is unusual for hotels in Orlando. Also the iconic memorabilia is all around the hotel. The room was big and had nice interior but the facilities could be improved as you had to pay for wifi unless you had a hard rock access card, also you had to pay to rent the use of the fridge to store you're own drink in. I don't think you could get a better location than this hotel if you want access to the Universal parks and City Walk, either a 10min walk or a free boat ride which arrives/departs every 20mins throughout the day from just outside the hotel and drops you off just outside the parks. There is also a service where people on bikes with a trailer for people to sit on will take you to the parks, it takes about 5mins and is good if the boat isn't there and you don't feel like walking. There is no charge but they earn off tips, I gave $6 each time. There are very good benefits staying here aswel as the location. With you're stay you get a free fast pass for the Universal parks. As we were there over christmas this was very helpful, both parks became full at one point and the queues for the major attractions were between 2-3 hours, with out fast pass we were only waiting 20mins max so they are definetely worth it. At the time they were charging $70 for a fast pass at the gates for people who didn't have one. You always get priority seating at the Hard Rock Restaurant. If you sign up to the 'all access' card you can get free internet access and 10% off at the hotel shop and Hard Rock Restaurant. Don't think you can get an overall better hotel in Orlando for the Universal parks and City Walk which has a good number of restaurants and nightlife. Disney parks are about 20mins drive away.

The hotel more closely resembles a one star motel. Filthy, run down, poor service. The concierge level does not have cold drinks but you can get cups of ice. Lunch was an offering of bags of pretzels and cheetos and warm sodas. We had to ask for warm bottles of water if we wanted water because it was not readily available. The dining area was filthy with no one cleaning the floors or tables. Mashed food in the carpet, on the tables and chairs was standard. No nightly turn down service. Our rooms were not cleaned until after 4pm every day. The second night there when we returned to our room the lock was not working properly and we couldn't enter our room. It took the engineer well over an hour to fix it. When we asked to be compensated for the inconvenience we were reluctantly given 4 drink cards for the Velvet Lounge then told that it didn't allow children. We had 3 kids with us under the age of 13 and had to wait in the lobby until after 10pm to get into our room. The same experience happened the 3rd night only we were not given drink cards. Locked out of our room until after 10pm again. When we asked the managers Eric Delvin and Al Patnik to compensate us in some way they refused then reluctantly took $17.00 off our room charge. We demanded a room change and were given a room across the hall but the hassle of moving because the door still wasn't fixed was a nightmare and we were tired after being at the AWESOME Universal parks all day. We are a family of 5. We have spoken to several people about our experience and appartently it is general knowledge that this hotel is known to be run down and provide poor service. Wish we would've known that before wasting our money. We have since been told that the Portifino hotel is a much better choice. Next time we will stay there.

But boy, were we happy with it! We booked a complete package through Universal Parks & Resorts Vacations (UPRV), electing to stay on site in order to save the cost and hassle of a car, parking fees, and so on. A huge bonus is that the hotel room key serves as a \"free\" (if you can call it that!) Universal Express pass. Even if the parks aren't crowded, which they weren't for most of our visit, Universal Express saves a lot of walking: without it, you find yourself \"furbling\" through long walkways and queuing areas; Express generally takes a shortcut to the rides themselves. Service was fantastic, right from the start. We arrived mid-morning after an early flight to Orlando, excited but hungry. Front desk staff was great at orienting us to the hotel and its features-- and to our surprise, our room was ready early! We opted to drop our stuff off at our room only to find that engineering was just finishing up a paint touch-up. The bell captain, who made the trip to the room with us, apologized for the miscommunication and then had us follow him back to the Kitchen restaurant where they treated us to a wonderful buffet brunch for our \"inconvenience!\" The hotel has a park tickets desk and automated kiosk for picking up tickets that you've bought in advance. Free tickets are available for transportation to Wet 'n' Wild and Sea World (these buses only run once per day in each direction). Other ticket-related transactions (adding days or features) have to be done at the parks' own Guest Services windows. Everyone at the hotel had this very-refreshing \"service first\" attitude. It's what made me want to visit Orlando again in the first place-- the people here really understand hospitality. The entire hotel has typical Hard Rock theming-- you'll find rock memorabilia everywhere (a tour booklet at the front desk describes the hotel's entire collection), a great classic rock \"soundtrack\" throughout the common areas that makes it hard not to smile and tap your feet; yet never loud or obnoxious, just fun. The hotel itself is 650 rooms on 7 floors, with the Kitchen Restaurant, Emack & Bolios / Starbucks, and a nice workout room on the first, the lobby, Velvet Lounge, and Rock Shop on the second, guest rooms on 3-7 (where 7 is the \"Club Level\"). It's spread out in a large semicircle with the pool and Beach Club in the center. The heated pool was gorgeous, and really does have a working underwater sound system (though, once experienced, that's more of a novelty than anything else). Most of it is quite shallow-- 3.5 feet, with a small section of 4.5 feet. It has a fun waterslide at one end and plenty of seating around, including a \"sandy beach\" area. At night, the hotel hosts \"Dive-In Movies\"; you can watch a recent DVD release while you lounge in the pool! Beyond the pool (and surrounding one side of the hotel) is a pathway that's a short walk to Universal Studios; a bridge connects that to CityWalk, and another bridge joins the far end of CityWalk with Islands of Adventure. If you spend all day at (particularly) IOA, your feet will appreciate the water taxi service that runs between CityWalk and the hotel every 15 minutes. It's a great scenic ride day or night. The rooms themselves are fairly typical in size and amenities. No fridge or microwave, but very clean, nice dressing area outside the bathroom, very clean and neat. And what a view! Our room faced both the pool and the parks-- a great sunset sight, with the parks all lit up and the colored lights on Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit reminding you of just where you are! The only real issue I found with the room itself was that the bathroom is sized, and the door located, such that you have to stand in about a 6\" diameter circle-- between the sink and toilet-- in order to open or close the door without hitting your toes. The Kitchen restaurant is fantastic-- best buffet breakfast we've ever had anywhere. Huge selection, friendly staff, great food. The real only downside is the price. When you visit a theme park, you expect to be treated like the captive audience you are: $9.00 hamburgers, $2.75 beverages, and so on. Staying in an on-site hotel extends that experience, depriving you of even a temporary escape back to the world of normal prices; That breakfast buffet at the Kitchen is $20/person, which is a lot even for a resort, and there's no real options other than feeding your family some kind of packaged food you brought with you. My only other pricing gripe: At Hard Rock's prices, Wi-Fi internet should be free. It's not-- it's $9.95 per day per device.

We stayed in a garden view room which was decent size with nice amenities including Keurig coffee, large tv and extremely comfortable beds. The room was fairly basic in decor with a sprinkling of rock-related photos but was clean and well-maintained. The biggest standout at this property was the service. We were greeted immediately for help with luggage upon arrival and at check in, were invited behind the desk to look at photos of the views from the various rooms left so we could pick our favorite. The bellman who delivered our luggage was so friendly and provided a full insider's strategy to tackling the parks over the course of our stay to ensure we saw and did everything with minimal wait times. Service was again very attentive, friendly and hip throughout the property, including in the restuarants and out at the pool. The pool is great for kids, with a really cool water slide, ping-pong, pool and a volleyball court. A couple of tips - the Kitchen restuarant has a huge buffet breakfast and if you're seated before 9am kids eat for $5. While this is somewhat dangerous, you can charge anything you buy in the parks to your room so you don't even need your wallet while in the parks and you can have merchadise delievered to your room so no need to carry bags. We also used the Emack and Bolio's ice cream shop to grab coffee in the morning before heading out. Also, we purchased the Hard Rock all access card prior to arrival which can gets you priority seating at the cafe in citywalk which we used cutting our wait time from 45 minutes to 5. The card can also give you a room upgrade if available. Of course the biggest perk was the free Express Pass to Universal and Islands of adventure for all guests (your room key is your express pass) which you can use even on the day you check out all day. Lastly, we didn't bother renting a car until the day we left and the Hertz on property was probably the best experience I've ever had renting a car. Valet pulled the car right up...no waiting in line and to return, we just dropped it off in the front of the hotel with the valet. so easy and much better rates than picking up at the airport. The hotel was only a 5 minute walk to the parks (the closest out of the 3 on property) but you could also take a free boat shuttle or these rickshaw bikes in which passengers dictate the fare (free ride with tips as you see fit). Great stay and despite the high price, tremendous value to staying right at Universal.

There was also a seating area, table and chairs, TV and coffee and tea making facilities The hotel and decor were lovely, the gardens well maintained and the added extras, such as the memorabilia were nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. When staying at the hotel, you can visit Harry Potter World an hour before the park opens (but this is not unique to the hotel, and we still waited an hour to get on the ride at 7am) you can also fastpass on most of the rides in Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. If you like the rides, it is definately worth staying here, we visited the parks most days to do a few rides and they were charging $70+ per day for fastpasses in the parks. The pool area was lovely, although unfortunately we did not have time to use it! There is a secure car park (which unfortunately, is chargeable- works out at about $16 a day, or $30 valet.) I have visited florida 12 times and never had to pay for car parking at the accomodation. You can use either a walkway to get to Citywalk/Islands of adventure/Universal- which takes about 5-10 mins, take the free water taxi (approx. every 20 mins.) There are also people on bikes (with trailors) that can be used, for a tip to the driver. The only bad points were the car park charges ($16 a day), internet charges ($10 a day) and we used the hotel phone for 9 mins which cost over $70 + tax. before visiting, it is worth signing up for the hard rock 'All Access' Card- which gives you 10% off in the shop, restaurant, and they will also upgrade your room when possible.

If you plan to visit Universal during a busy season, I'd highly recommend staying on-site. You get an express pass which allows you to enter a separate line for almost every ride at both parks. Even over a busy holiday, we never waited more than 10 minutes in any line using this great perk. The Harry Potter ride unfortunately does not utilize the express pass.... but the Harry Potter area and the ride opened at 7am just for on-site guests, so even for the most popular ride, without an express pass, we only waited for 30 minutes to ride. Staying on-site is expensive, but in return you get to skip lines and waits. The hotel was lovely-- delicious food, welcoming staff, great housekeeping, cool rock and roll memorabilia everywhere. I especially loved the pool and the poolside bar and food service. The hotel rooms were not the biggest or the grandest, but you're really not there to lounge in your room all day!

We ate at The Kictchen four times - each time, the staff was exceptionally nice and accomodating - they loved our son and made every effort ot making him comfortable. From cold milk refills to freshly made mac & cheese, they provided him with eveything he wanted. For one champagne brunch, they made sure Mommy & Daddy were equally fulfilled :) The pool was nice - I didnt go in and our son was too young to participate in the kid-oriented activities but the poolside bar was awesome! Agian, great food and even better drinks. Be sure to check out the \"Purple Drank\"...mmmmmm..... Proximity to the Universal theme parks was wonderful.

We chose to walk as it was a nice stroll through well-maintained paths and lanscape. Early park entrance and Express Pass was a huge plus! We spent two days at Universal theme parks and one day at Disney. Universal was fun and easy - Disney was long, boring, and consumed by travel.

My boys were 9 and 13 then, they're 17 and 20 now. Big difference! So, we stayed at the Hard Rock this visit during the week before Christmas and loved every minute of it. Spend the extra money and stay on the Club Level if you can. It was definitely worth it for us. Our room was at the end of the short hall which was an unexpected bonus. It was a brief walk down the hall to the Club where they have breakfast, lunch, dinner and nightly snacks. It's awesome because you really don't have to spend extra money on meals if you don't want to. We also liked the short walk to the theme parks. We never took the water taxi. There are also bicycle rickshaws who work for tips. The boys rode one from the parks to the hotel one time and each gave the bicycler $5. The Club level also has a private concierge which was fantastic for us. They take care of everything you need. I had a roll away bed and it was awful so I slept with my youngest son but we put this huge, long, round pillow in the center of the bed as a divider and it worked out great. The next day I talked to the concierge and she took care of having the roll away removed and crediting the charge of $25 per night for the bed. Also, we signed up for the Total Access card, it's free, and got free Wi-Fi in our room, which is normally $9.95 per night, and 10% off in the Hard Rock Store, which I used several times. The room also had a Keurig coffee maker and K-cups. If you don't know what that is, you are in for a real treat. If you do know what that is, you will be excited, am I right?! I took my own K-cups, but they had a nice selection of Newman's brand along with some teas, hot chocolate, plenty of sugar and creamers. The advantages of the express pass at the theme parks is worth staying on property. Of course, you can't use the express pass for Harry Potter but they do open the attraction to people staying on property one hour before they open to the general public. From the time we left our room, walked to Hogwarts : ), stood in line for the Forbidden Journey ride, and got off the ride, it was a total of one hour. The boys went back to get in line again and the wait to get on the ride was already up to 2 hours! So, if you stay at the Hard Rock or one of the other hotels, drag yourself out of bed early to see Harry Potter, it's worth it!!! We also had tickets to an Orlando Magic basketball game and I didn't want to drive to the Amway Center and deal with traffic, parking, walking and finding my way back to the hotel. The concierge told me they had \"on demand\" transportation services on property so we just went to the valet and told him we needed a ride to the Amway Center and a town car that was parked at the hotel pulled up, whisked us away, and dropped us off in front of the Amway Center! The driver gave me his card and I gave him my number and I called him when we were ready to be picked up. It was worth every penny and we felt so important! When we got back to the Hard Rock, we had missed the nightly snack and we were hungry so I decided to spend the money I'd saved on the roll away to enjoy \"Star Service\" room service. It was exceptional! We were definitely treated like rock stars. If you are planning a trip to Universal and want to stay on property, check out the Hard Rock, especially if you have older kids. The pool area is unbelievable and would be great during the summer, but we didn't spend any time at the pool this trip, even though it was warm enough!

I tried to set up a Seaworld experience with them, and they simply couldn't do it and really didn't care. I arranged everything myself. Including something special for my husband and I for our anniversary. I didn't bother to ask them. The straw that broke the camels back was our last day there two of the luggage employees got in a screaming match that had everyone in the lobby on edge. So much so we were standing in front of our children and trying to leave the lobby for fear something worse would happen.

Although I tend to stay at more budget minded hotels, I do like to splurge now and then. The hotel is not cheap by any means, but includes some nice perks which make up for the cost. As soon as you enter, you feel like a rockstar. The hotel is jam packed with Rock and Roll memoriabelia everywhere you look. Just wandering around the hotel can be an exerience in itself. If you can find some time to relax, they have a rather large pool with slide and underwater speakers which is quite unique. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. For those of you that are \"green\" make sure to look in the display rack on the table (at least that was where mine was) for a plastic bag to recycle your newspaper, cans or bottles. This is something that I have never seen in a hotel before. And now onto the perks. On-site hotel guests get early admission to Islands of Adventure and the Wizzarding World of Harry Potter! Be sure to take full advantage of this as the area is quite popular and can be crowded at times. Once inside Potter be sure to experience Olivanders Wand Shop first. This is a brief 4-5 minute show, but only 25-30 people are allowed in at a time so the wait times can be brutal. In addition to early admission to IOA, your hotel key serves as a fast pass on most of the attractions at BOTH parks. Unfortunately The Forbidden Journey Ride is not included as one of those rides, so be sure and do it before the parks open to all other visitors. Depending on the day, a fast pass can be quite expensive at Universal. Of the three hotels, Hard Rock is the closest to both parks. You can take a leisurely walk, complimentary water taxi, or even a pedicab (for the price of a tip) to the parks. If the Hard Rock is not available, all of the resorts are nice and similarly priced. The rooms at Hard Rock are similar in size to that of the Royal Pacific, and a bit smaller than those at the Portofino, but still quite comfortable. As with most high end hotel there is a $15 per night charge for parking and a charge for internet access. It would be nice to include at least the internet at these rates. The Fitness Center looked quite extensive and there is a charge for it unless you are a \"Club Level\" guest. If you happen to be at the resort on the last Thursday of the month, be sure to check out \"Velvet Sessions\" which is a rock and roll cocktail party held in an intamate setting. There is a cost for this, however it is cheaper to book in advance. According to their website past performers have included Bret Michaels, Eddie Money, Joan Jett, Journey and many others.

Check in was great the front desk person was warm and helpful; however once they have swiped your credit card it is downhill from there. Here are some things you should be aware of; Hard Rock Orlando will book a standard room for a party of five no problem, when you arrive and check in you realize you only have sleeping arrangements for 4 two queen size beds. When you speak to the front desk they will tell you no problem and provide you a roll away bed for an additional $25.00 a day, this could be me however I feel cheated if they book a standard room for 5 people then they should tell you up front that it will only sleep 4 and a $25.00 a day roll away bed charge will be added to your bill. The standard rooms are small and when you add the roll away bed you are packaged like sardines. When you find prehistoric size cock roaches in your room they will send someone to your room to investigate, however the young lady they sent to ours was so frighten that my son had to end up smashing the bug, while she washed the wall down to remove the evidence. You will then have to wait another day to be moved to what you can only hope is a clean(er) room which takes will into late afternoon so your night is spent looking around the room in horror your day is spent shaking out and packing your belongings and your afternoon is spent waiting to be moved to a different room. During the move my grandson left his Nintendo DXL in the dirty room when I realized this I call the front desk, which transferred me to security who check lost and found then told me nothing had been turned in. I went down to the concierge to explain what had happen this women listen carefully showing no emotion and told me there was nothing they could do. The fact is the security person was more helpful and took it upon herself to walk through housekeeping and check each cleaning cart for my grandsons Nintendo, she arrived at our door late in the evening to return the item, two thumbs up for security perhaps Hard Rock you could have them train your Concierge Staff? The one good thing I can state is look for a Vibe Manager; if you are lucky enough to find one then you will be treated with respect and feel as if someone at Hard Rock really cares about your time spent on their property. My angel of mercy was a Vibe Manager named Steven King; he listen expressed outrage made phone calls and apologized for everyone less the caring attitude. He stated that my Nov 23, stay (one day) amount would be removed from my bill as an act of good faith provided me his care and told me to contact him if I had any further problem. Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus. Unfortunately when I checked out the charge for Nov 23 was still on my bill and when I told them it was to be removed nothing happen the bill remained the same, just like the song. There are lots of nice things at Hard Rock the Beach area, the Velvet Lounge, Restaurants and grounds for exercising and having fun, however if Hard Rock want to maintain a standard of being a Deluxe Hotel and charge upwards of $287.00 a night to stay on their property they have a long way to go in the customer satisfaction area.

Okay, maybe if your were inspecting the property alone, it would be 4 stars plus, however when you factor in the location and fun factor, there is no question that it deserves a 5. Would you really want to come back in your amusement park clothes to sit in a stuffy hotel? No, you'd want to go to a fun and cool hotel, that is right around the corner and adds to the excitement of the theme parks. We traveled with my 15 and 12 year old kids, and just took a cab from the airport, as it was quick, easy and less expensive than paying for a shuttle for the 4 of us, not to mention that we didn't have to pay for parking. After checking out, we picked up our Hertz Rental car right at the front counter of the hotel to continue our trip to visit Florida relatives for Thanksgiving (very convenient) When the cab pulled into the hotel when we arrived , there was a team of friendly bellmen welcoming and assisting us. We had an efficient and upbeat checkin, and were fortunate that our room was ready at 10:00 a.m. when we arrived. Be sure to stop in the restroom next to the checkin desk, gorgeous! We stayed in a club level room and had a breathtaking view of the pool and the parks (yes, we could see Hogwarts Castle,wow!) Since there was 4 of us, the club level was definitely worth the extra money. Continental breakfast each morning, snacks and beverages throughout the day, a happy hour buffet, and desserts and milk at night! The breakfast was great as you could get in, have a quick quick bite, and still make it to the early opening of Harry Potter. On our checkout day we at at \"The Kitchen\" since we weren't picking up our rental car until 10:00. We opted for the buffet and it was awesome! You can order Omelettes or Eggs Benedict to order, and they had every breakfast item you could want. The price was very reasonable for what you received. The pool area was a lot of fun, and since you have the early entry, and front of the line access to the rides with your room key, you have plenty of time to get back to the hotel in the afternoon to enjoy it. My kids participated in some of the activities, and my daughter even won a hula hoop contest. They have water with lemon in a big glass decanter by the pool for you to help yourself which was a nice touch. It's so nice to build relaxation time into amusement park time. As others have mentioned, the walk to the parks was very short. We would take the water taxi back to the hotel at night for a relaxing end of the day.

Booked 4 nights at hotel and was really looking forward to it, however before fully commenting see the following: Plus points: Fast Pass at Universal and Islands of Adventure - a godsend on some days Fantastic location with easy access to parks and City Walk Nice layout and good facilities Staff are very polite and helpful Bad Points: Pool and general cleanliness - They have no cleaning regime for any of the external areas from what I could see and the pool area was filthy considering this hotel is classed as a 4 star hotel. There is a charge of $15 a day to park at the hotel, this is hidden in the small print There is free Internet but only in lobby - To get access in room costs $10 a day, again hidden in small print A service charge of 18% is added to all your bills whether you had good or bad service, you have no choice other than to pay this They reduced the price of my stay period and I asked to cancel and rebook at the lower rate. This never happened and as such cost me $200 extra. Overall this is a good hotel with excellent facilities, location and staff. However this was totally overshadowed by the filthy poo, sun loungers, tables and surrounding area's. They seem to really on the rain to clean this as I saw no one in all my stay clean anything. The pool was littered with leaves and at one point the pool system blocked and the whole area flooded as the pool overflowed. Also I for one hate hidden charges and this hotel is great at them. They are also very puchy with drinks and food around the pool area and constantly pester if you want any. I felt like at all times I was there just as a way to increase their bank balance and nver once felt like the hotel was going out of its way to look after me unless I paid for it.

We got off to a good start -- valet staff and Claudia at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The lobby is just beautiful too! We loved our deluxe room, it was huge and full of nice amenities. We decided to upgrade to a Club Room and it was definitely worth it. Breakfast was great, and my kids loved the afternoon snack time. For \"happy hour\" there were a couple nights there was so much good food we didn't even need dinner afterwards -- and we're vegetarians, so this was a surprise to us that they would offer so much. Staff in Club Lounge was also great. One nite my son wasn't feeling weel and concierge here brought crackers and ginger ale up to our room -- her idea, not mine. Only complaint: If you are a guest and come in to gorge yourself on desserts then pile a plate as high as Mt. Everst to take more back to your room, please at least put on a shirt. Seriously, there was one particularly fat man who ignored the \"shirts required\" sign AND turned the already loud music in the lounge up so high you couldn't talk. Grow up \"dude,\" you look like a 60 yr old idiot. This was particularly annoying at breakfast when you are just waking up. The hotel should consider making volume controls inaccessible to guests and enforcing the shirts required rule. Moving on, pool area was beautiful, fun and great place to hang out. We had dinner at The Kitchen, staff was great and the night we went they had magicians who were quite entertaining. One note -- service at poolside cafe was horrendous for food, but Ok for drinks. The night we ate there we waited so long for the bill, my husband and daughter had time to go up to the room, change into bathing suits and start swimming while I sat in a sea of dirty plates waiting for the check.

Past three years we've gone club level and would recommend the upgrade to anyone with kids, especially if jet lag is an issue. Handy to let them nibble rather than fall asleep when out for a meal. Drinks all day (softs) is also great and the staff always help us out with milk whenever we asks for it. Could do with changing the options at the evening session and include more veg friendly things. That said, I'm content with the beer! I felt this year the rooms could benefit from some sprucing up and I did find toenail clippings near the window, so vacuuming on that occasion could have been better. Our fridge was also gross with mould on the products and in the trays. Someone had burst a liqueur and it had never been cleaned properly. After about 4-5 attempts at complaining they replaced the fridge. We got a free breakfast for the trouble and $100 off the bill. Site and pool are fantastic and clean, restaurants are amazing (my hair and appearance are a bit to wild to have me venture to the Palm but I love the Kitchen - try the seared ahi tuna!!!!). Drink is expensive for sure but usually includes the tip, you're on holiday!! Our oldest is 11 now and we have no problem sending him to the pool on his own. It's well staffed and we're very confident in the pool staff to let him go on his own. Other reviewers speak of the room keys and fast pass. Invaluable with kids, without a doubt. We don't even bother with Disney anymore because of the perk. The main thing that let this trip down was they swiped our credit card at check in for the entire stay amount which cleaned us out. We didn't realise til we tried to hire a car and the card kept bouncing. We were furious with that. Car aside, had there been a medical matter, as we have had previously, we'd have been screwed. We never got our car (but testement to the staff, 2 we've become friends with over the years actually took us out fishing and nature spotting on their day off - that's the special part about the hotel), but we did get a refund of a few days (on top of the fridge issue) as an apology and assurance that we will be extra special taken care of next visit. Few complaints in here, but they do address them and given the years we've been going thats our first grumbles. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as its sorted quickly and to our satisfaction we're happy campers. We love it period. We're FL tourist vets since '96.

This is NOT the place for a couple who is looking to relax poolside and enjoy the parks also. Start off with the fact that on the weekends, they BLAST music by the pool from 1PM - 6PM with various entertainers and games for kids and maybe even teens. Its not relaxing at all -- you cannot find anywhere to go if you just wanted to have a drink poolside and chill out to your own headset music choice. Also, we had the misfortune of staying here during the Halloween horrors and the hotel was overrun, I mean overrun with about 100 teenagers roaming the halls, banging on doors, and just hanging out in the lobby until all hours of the night causing trouble. The hotel security and staff were completely unprepared and didn't seem to know what to do about all the disturbances. They have no customer service skills at the front desk and instead just gave me attitude.

We had been to Disney several times but Universal only once when my son was 2 (he didn't remember it). 3. We picked a Universal Hotel because of the early access to Harry Potter. They let hotel guests into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter 1 hour early, which is key to getting in and out quickly. Another beneifts was the front of the line pass which can be used multiple times. 4. We picked the Hard Rock Hotel over Portofino Bay and the Pacific Resort because it was the closest park to the Universal theme parks. My son age 11 and daughter age 8 wanted to stay in the hotel which was cool. 5. The pool looked awesome - had a 250+ foot circulat water slide. Also underwater music piped in. On arrival these is a beautiful circular driveway with a dropoff. Checkin was quick. They give you room cards for each member of the room. These cards also serve as your early entry ticket if you want to go 1 hour before the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opens. The lobby is impressive and truly rock star. We brought our suitcases up to our room. The room had 2 large queen beds. There was a parking lot at the side of the hotel which cost 12 dollars per day which you accessed with your room card. The room itself had 2 queen beds, a tub, toilet and small sink in the bathroom, and a large sink/vanity outside the bathroom. There is a Keurig coffee maker and my daughter ended up making multiple drinks every day - coffee, tea and hot cocoa. She loved that machine. They don't have a refrigerator or microwave in the room - I think there is a 10 or fifteen dollar extra charge, but it wasn't worth it for us as we didn't really need these features. The walking path to the theme parks comes out right next to the Universal Studios Entrance. The hotel is closer than the parking garage is to the theme parks. There is an official walking path from the pool area (which is only open when the pool is open, 8 AM to 11 PM, so that's not helpful if you want to get the Harry Potter before 8). It is beautifully landscaped but winding and less direct than the route we took. (see below) We didn't bother taking the boat becuase I had read it took longer than walking. There is an unofficial route that I read about on line - just exit the hotel through the main entrance, take a left past the palm restaurant, down the stairs and walk in the parking lot along the side of the hotel. This took about 5 minutes. The pool itself was a lot of fun. The kids went down the slide multiple times. We went in the first day of our trip but then the weather cooled down. We ate at the Palm restaurant for dinner one night - good food but overpriced. The kids and their dad had the breakfast buffet in the kitchen which was excellent (my husband said it was better than the Palm). The kids meals were only 5 dollars each though the adult was 20 dollars. I saw Homer Simpson in the elevator - they have character dining on Saturday night. Service is top notch. We usually stay in reasonably priced hotels and I was blown away by the service. 1. One of the light bulbs had blow out in a lamp. I called guest services and within 5 minutes they had brought up another. 2. We requested more pillows and another comforter. They brought this up within 30 minutes. 3. The theme park will deliver your purchases to your guest room by the next day. The first day we bought 2 bags of souvenirs which made it our room by the next day. Another day we bouth 2 bags of souvenirs - but only one make it to our room. We called guest services, we had a copy of the receipt, they checked their records and showed that it had been delivered to our room. It was a superhero t shirt for my son which was 20 dollars. We couldn't find it. It was a small bag and I suspect it had been delivered to another room by accident. It was 5:30 when we got back to the room and found just one souvenir bag instead of two. We were leaving the next day. We called the front desk, and The Universal staff sent someone over to get a new shirt and delivered it to our room later that evening. My husband and I were blown away. They could have handled it sevearl different ways. It truly is STAR service. The only mar about our hotel experience, which was not under the control of the hotel at all, was that on sat night at 12:30 AM we were awakened by an unruly man who was cursing and yelling in the hallways. After what seemed like an eternity because he kept yelling (but was probably more like 15 minutes), first hotel security surrounded him and then the Orlando police came and took him away.

So let's see if we can clear things up a bit. My wife and I stayed at the Hard Rock at Universal Orlando from the 13th - 20th October, 2011. It wasn't our first choice -- the Royal Pacific was, but they were all booked up. We didn't know what to expect so we read some of the online reviews (which were so varied that we started feeling some anxiety about staying there). As it turns out, the Hard Rock exceeded our expectations. The staff was friendly and very helpful -- not at all pushy or overbearing as we had read. The food was simply divine (we ate at the Kitchen, Emack & Bolio and the Beach Club) and their prices were within reason. The grounds were well kept (we could see groundskeepers at work from as early as 3:00am from our window) and the paths around the hotel were excellent for leisurely walks. The hotel is a five to seven minute walk from Universal Studios and the water taxi was very convenient. There are also guys with rickshaws who would give you a ride over to Universal for a small tip ($5 is fair for a couple). The rooms were clean and the folks who cleaned them were thorough. The pool was also quite enjoyable...with complimentary movies showing almost every night. All in all a great place to stay. People who complain about this place would probably find something to complain about no matter where they stay. The hotel does have a nice young vibe to it -- but hey, it's the Hard Rock -- what do you expect?! Our stay couldn't be better -- take it from somebody who stayed at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge for eight days last year -- this was just as good.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "nb1975", "ReviewID": "UR119584960", "Content": "This is our second visit.

What a great experience. I was overdue for a vacation, so I'm sure that made it better. Was traveling with myself, 40+, my daughter, later twenties and my 12 year old nephew for his birthday trip. This property completely made every one of us happy. I have never stayed at a Hard Rock Hotel prior to this and was pleasantly surprised. I am used to nice hotels, but the vibe and atmosphere here was great. It has made me want to seek out other Hard Rock Hotels to stay at. My nephew is just learning to play guitar, so he was thrilled to run around and look at all of the memorabilia. We used the early entry into Universal, so that was so worth staying at the Hard Rock. We got to do Harry Potter a few times quickly before the crowds set in. After long days at the parks, my very hyper nephew was still ready to go. We all went down to the pool area. He instantly made friends. So, I was able to relax in the lawn chair at the beach area, while he hung out with his new friends in the pool. We had snacks and drinks delivered from the lovely and friendly pool area staff. Felt very safe about the hotel and area. So, we were able to let him run downstairs to Emack and Bolio's to get a snack, etc. and feel totally comfortable. Rooms were large and comfortable. It rained hard for almost a whole day when we were there, so came back from SeaWorld early and rented movies in the room and still enjoyed ourselves. Our only negative at all was that we got pizza at Emack and Bolios on the rainy day and it took a really long time and was just not good. We had lots left over and that's not the norm for us.

I know Florida has bugs but there were bugs in our bathroom constantly. The hotel seemed to be overwhelmed with teenagers and young adults. The problem with this was that every night between 10 and 4 am it was impossible to sleep. There was yelling and laughing in the halls. Slamming of doors and knocking on doors was a constant. We spoke to the front desk on three occasions but they seemed to be dismissive. Other places we've traveled have had employees monitoring hallways to help keep the noise down. I didn't witness any changes attempted to address this problem. After speaking with others at the pool I came to find out I wasn't the only person who complained about the noise.

There are so many reasons but let's start with convenience and safety. The beautiful green paths that connect the Hard Rock with Universal are safe, gorgeous and fun and we let our kids (13 & 14 yrs old) go by themselves from the hotel to the park without worry. The early admission (one hour before the park opens to everyone else) is incredible and we stayed in bed as our kids ventured to the park at the crack of dawn. (You do need to go with them the first day to register their ticket and fingerprint - a very quick process.....under a minute). The Speed Pass that you get from the hotel also is a great feature that saves about 30 to 40 minutes for each ride. The combination of Hard Rock Hotel and Harry Potter Village was just perfect. Now for the hotel: Clean, fun and relaxing. The lobby is huge and is perfect for meeting up with other families or just people-watching. The pool is the hub of activity with a great bar and family friendly restaurant (not to mention the wonderful \"Kitchen Restaurant\" that is just steps away). We had actually started this vacation a bit disappointed when we were told that our room was not ready for regular 4 p.m. check in but I have to mention that the front desk attendant, Claudia, was incredibly nice about it and she turned the issue into a positive. Claudia gave us drink passes and suggested that we try the bar by the pool - my wife and I had Margarittas while the kids enjoyed Pink Lemonaides. Within a few minutes Claudia called my cell phone and told us the room was ready, We then loved having a \"friend\" at the front desk that we would stop and say hello to each time we passed - it was as if our happiness had become her personal mission (if you have ever heard the term \"Nordstrom Sevice\", that is how we felt). There were more great people working at the Hard Rock: Robert a lightly bearded waiter at the pool would make us laugh with his good natured comments, and Sara at the Pool Restaurant was incrddibly attentive. That's why this hotel and vacation were so great.... beautiful grounds, friendly staff, immaculate rooms - and a brand new multimillion dollar Harry Potter Village next door at Universal Studios (complete with Butter Beer and Pumpkin Juice).

This was my fifth trip to this hotel. I traveled with a group of eight. 3 Adults, and 5 kids. We had two rooms on the club level. First of all, the hotel is great. Friendly staff. Rooms are nice. Beds are soooo comfortable. Room sleeps 5. However, 5 is a little tight. This time I had three in my room. It was very comfortable. We stayed on club level, which I highly recommend. You get continental breakfast. We went in at 7, finished breakfast. Then headed to the parks. Continental breakfast was bagels, danish, cereal, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt. Very nice. They had the club room open all day for drinks, and chips(etc). Great for the kids. From 5 - 7 was beer, wine, and great snacks like chicken wings, nachos, cheese/crackers, etc. Then again at night, cookies and milk. Definately worth the extra $. Sometimes we didnt even go out for dinner. The pool is beautiful. Staff is friendly. Loved Ginger, a server at the pool . Kids loved the water slide, and movies by the pool. The best part is the Express passes. Everyone gets one included in your room. So that means no wait for the rides. Get to the park early, and go on all the rides, no lines. Then you still get to enjoy the pool. You can buy the express passes at the park, and they cost you a fortune. They are included in your room cost, how great is that. I have also stayed a Royal Pacific, its nice. But its not the Hard Rock. Hard Rock is a smaller hotel, which I like. Its also a closer walk to the parks. You can also take the watertaxi.

The action is at the enormous pool, but the rest of the place is quiet, even elegant. The rooms have first-class appointments. We ogled the original photos on the wall of early Beatles and Dave Clark Five. If you are a rock/pop music buff, your will be blown away by all the memorabilia on display throughout the building. Great cocktails at The Velvet Lounge (the Smokin' Martini is a new favorite of mine) and dinner at The Palm Steakhouse was one of the best anywhere this year. Free water taxis take you to both theme parks, Univeral City Walk and the other two hotels. You glide along in great comfort, and you can get anythere you want to go at the Universal resort in 10-20 minutes. It's even walkable through beautiful tropical gardens.

Water taxis to and from CityWalk are fantastic after a long day of walking around and the usage of room keys as express passes was really handy, even in early October when the regular lines weren't nearly as long as they are in the summer. Early entrance into the Harry Potter area was nice as well though we only took advantage of that once. If we'd had impatient kids I definitely would have gone in early again :) The room itself was decent. Two fairly comfortable queen beds with feather pillows and a nice view of the water taxi canal. The first room they put us in was still dirty, with crumbs on the floor and an unidentified sticky substance on the table, but the front desk was more than happy to switch rooms and made sure we got a better view. The bathroom was weirdly shaped, it was a bit of a challenge to get in and shut the door before using the toilet due to the angle of the door. Shower had a non-slip surface and a nice showerhead. There's a sink in the bathroom, and a nice vanity with makeup mirror outside the bathroom. The pool was really nice, but only 4 feet at its deepest. There is an adults-only hot tub hidden in the back which is actually larger than the one in which kids are allowed. There are constantly servers from the Beach Club wandering around if you want something to drink. There are speakers underwater so you can hear the music while swimming. Neither of us used the waterslide but judging by the number of kids we saw making repeat trips, it must be fun. We made use of the self service laundry room - there is one on the second floor and one on the fourth. Be aware that it is $2.75 per load (that is, $2.75 to wash, another $2.75 to dry), and we had to run our clothing through the dry cycle twice to get it dry. There is a change machine in each laundry room if you run out of quarters. The theming of the hotel was nice. There is a lot of random music memorabilia around, everything from Elvis's jumpsuit to stuff worn by N'Sync and Tears for Fears. There are photos of famous musicians in all the rooms and a TV channel devoted to playing music videos all day. Our one complaint is that the door locks seem to have issues - our keys would randomly stop working (not just for the room - also the self-parking card slot, and the one at the pool entrance, and by the water taxis). One day the door lock on our room ceased to function, meaning that our room was unlocked all day. We returned late that night and the front desk sent maintenance up to fix it, but no compensation was offered - I felt that they could have at least offered us free breakfast or something, especially since it took the guy 30 minutes to fix the door. Luckily we had made use of the in-room safe to store valuables but it was still really disconcerting.

We were on our first family holiday to the US covering 4 cities in two weeks with eleven year old triplets. We wanted to cover as much as we could with as little stress as possible. We chose Hard Rock Hotel for it's proximity to the Universal Parks, it's facilities and express pass. The kids are mad Harry Potter fans and the opportunity to avoid queuing with early entry was too good to refuse. Location If you are visiting Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure you cannot get any better than this. It is a five minute walk down a garden path to the front of Islands of Adventure and a few minutes more to Universal Studios. There is also the option of jumping on the courtesy transfer boat which stops at the bottom of the garden, great when the kids are tired, hot and cranky after a day at park. The boat takes the same time as walking. If the kids get tired you can go back to your room then head back later in the day or evening. Universal walk also has plenty of restaurants and is a short walk from your room. Park access The best thing about the hotel is the privilege of early entry to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the room key is an express pass for most rides. The early entry got us into Islands of Adventure at 7am (on my birthday ! aargh!) and there were still plenty of people but we got on all the key rides quickly. The queue later in the day was something you would not want to be stuck in! The Express pass is a true express pass. It takes you right to the loading point for most rides, unlike Disney fast pass system which only takes you half way. Rooms We booked a standard garden view room with 2 Queens beds and a rollaway. This room comfortably slept five. I was worried that we would need the extra space of the Deluxe room but it was fine and my kids are almost as big as us. They were able to put the rollaway under the window, three in a row. The hotel is expensive compared to other options in the area we we did not want the hassle of hiring a car and driving and battling traffic with kids. Our room cost US380 plus tax per night without breakfast around Easter/Spring break. However, we think the time saved with the express pass and early entry justifies the additional cost. It means you can visit things early in the day, move through queues quickly and either ride everything again or head back to the pool and relax for the afternoon. The bathroom is small so an if you can afford interconnecting rooms it might be worth it for the extra bathroom. What else did we like! Great pool - free wi-fi by the pool and in public areas, great kids slide, table tennis in a marquee, find the rubber duck competitions around the pool, music, playing guitar hero for free poolside with new friends (not sure if this was good with 2 boys ...hard to lure them away), ice water with lemon. Mum liked the two self serve laundrys on level 2 and 4 (around $2-3 a load). The Kitchen makes the best key lime cheesecake I have every had. They kindly helped my husband organise a last minute surprise by decorating my desert plate with chocolate birthday greetings. The hotel recognised my birthday with a Hard Rock pin on check in and a piece of cake on the day. The service was great all round and the staff were genuinely friendly. None of the the pretentious \"have a magical day\" that we experienced at Disney. Porters at the front door were great with luggage, cabs and shopping advice! Concierge printed our boarding passes for us (there might have been a small charge?) Kids favourite park rides Harry Potter looks great but some of the rides are not worth queuing for. Skip the wand experience (line is too long and one child selected for a 2 min experience) and the Hippogriff roller coaster (huge line that moves slowly and a very short uneventful ride).

When you check in early, your Express Access is available from check in until the end of the day of the check out, so therefore if you just stay for 1 night, you have Express Access for 2 days. We found that with Express Access 6 hours per day for Universal Studios and Island of Adventure is enough to get through nearly all the rides. Express Access is really the reason why the rooms at Hard Rock are so much more expensive than nearby off resort hotel, but for just one night, I think it is worth the cost. The room is basic with some rock memorabilia. The furniture is a bit old, but the bed is comfortable. We tried both room service and The Kitchen. I really recommend The Kitchen for lunch as the food is nicely prepared and light on the stomach for a reasonable price.

However, when i expressed my disappointment, this was quickly dealt with and we were moved to a pool view room, from where you could also see Universal studios. As other reviews have mentioned, there is a bit of music noise from the pool, so ask for one at the back if that matters to you. Rooms are a nice size and very clean, with a pod coffee machine. Bathroom is usual set-up, with an additional sink / vanity area outside. Theme parks are a short walk away or you can take the boat for a pleasant start to the day. Both only take a few minutes. Room keys double as queue jump passes which means you don't spend a lot of time hanging around in the heat - bliss. They also get you early (8am) entry to Harry Potter which is where the crowds head at 9am so well worth it.

You will know that at the Hard Rock nothing is free. A fridge is $15 a day and you pay for wifi (except in the lobby) and the gym (i got a 4 day pass for $26). Breakfast in the Kitchen is also pretty steep, $20 per person for a buffet style or you can order individual things off the menu. This is however false economy as a portion of scrambled eggs and bacon will run you $10-15 and even portions of fruit are $5-10! You could go to the on site shop which sells ice cream as well as cereal and croissants. two croissants and a bottle of orange juice ran me $10. Also if you need a taxi may I recommend going to city walk and getting a mears taxi. If you go to the front door of the hotel there are cabs from a company called ODC (on demand chauffeur). Be warned, these guys will rip you off. I wanted to go to the premium outlet (about a mile and a half away), the driver drove up one side of I Drive and down the other and charged me $25 for the pleasure. A mears taxi a week later, $10. One day whilst in a hurry I reluctantly got a cab from the front door to go a mile up the road to get a bus to the space centre. Again the driver went every which way and charged me $20 for a journey that should have been a mile but he made into several! The hotel itself is very nice, my room on the 2nd floor had a pool view. Nice room but unfortunately at 8am every morning the rock music starts up in the pool area so if you want a lie in invest in ear plugs! The room also had two double beds, a small bathroom area, a coffe maker and a tv with about 50 channels. On my floor there was also an ice machine and laundry facilities. The hotel is also very handy to the Universal parks which are about a 5-10 minute walk away or if it's too hot take the free water taxi. There are also guys from the rickshaw company who linger near the water taxi stop. As other posters have said, the walls seem to be paper thin, if you're a light sleeper I recommend ear plugs not only for the 8am rock fest but for party goers marching up and down the halls until all hours.

It also entitled us to \u201cUniversal Express\u201d front of the line privileges for most rides at both parks. For these reasons alone, I highly recommend this hotel for families visiting these parks. Nonetheless, we very much enjoyed the hotel even setting aside these perks. Our room was large, light and comfortable with two queen beds and plenty of amenities (though no free Wifi). The atmosphere at the hotel is cool and friendly. We enjoyed hearing the music everywhere we went, as my son is a budding classic rock fan. The pool is fantastic! We spent long afternoons there every day after we wore ourselves out in the parks. One afternoon we even heard live music. One complaint I had was that you could hear a lot of noise from the hallways in the room. Given the hotel\u2019s theme, it attracts lots of teens and young adults, so they could hardly be blamed for rolling back to their rooms in the late hours of the night, but it would have been nice to have more soundproofing for the younger and older rockers trying to get some sleep. You have several options for transportation to the parks. You can take a water taxi to the City Walk area, you can walk on a lovely path (about a quarter mile, I\u2019m guessing) or you can take a bicycle taxi. All three options are relaxing and efficient. If you are accustomed to Disney, the Universal resorts and parks are much more compact and easy to navigate. We ate one meal at the Kitchen. While it was good, the portions were much too huge, and because the hotel rooms don\u2019t have refrigerators, we had to let that go to waste. You also have many excellent dining choices at City Walk, which we frequented at least daily. In sum, it was a great stay and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again.

Beyond that, we had a great time. The hotel has a young, cool vibe, and while there's constant music in the lobby and at the pool, the floors where the guest rooms are located are perfectly quiet. Short, easy walk to the parks. Good restaurants on the premises. I've stayed here before, and I will stay here again. Thank you, Hard Rock!

We booked it for three reasons - we love rock music, we wanted to be on the doorstep of Universal Studios/IOA and we wanted to have unlimited express rides with our room key as waiting in lines in the August heat with two young girls is not ideal!!!!!! We were not disappointed. This hotel was expensive to go to and expensive to stay in, but for the three reasons I just mentioned it was worth every penny and I would not hesitate to stay here again. It was so easy to hop on a water taxi and be in the parks within five minutes or so, and it was such a relaxing way to start the day in the parks. You also get the benefit of being able to enter the parks an hour earlier than the rest of the crowds, very helpful for enjoying Harry Potter World!!!!! Your room key allows you the privelege of express riding all the rides/shows. This in itself was priceless. I cant tell you how awesome it feels walking by the people waiting in line and getting straight onto the ride!!! It saves a lot of time and you are able to do everything at your pace. We would often go out in the morning to the parks, come back to the hotel around lunch time, chill out by the pool, then go back to the parks later on when the sun had gone down. This worked well with the ease of the water taxi (although it is almost as quick to walk!!!) and refreshed the children! The swimming pool area is amazing. We all loved it. It is a massive pool!!! It is fairly shallow alll across, so it remains quite safe for little ones. There is a water slide too, which the kids loved!!!! There is lots and lots of sunbeds and loungers, chairs and tables by the side of the pool, these are on the sand. There is a clearer area of beach too, lovely white sand, but to be honest it was too hot to actually sit on and play in!! There is an excellent pool bar area, it sells amazing cocktails and pretty much any drink you can think of!! The food they serve at the pool bar is also amazing, and not particularly overpriced I didnt think. The service is top quality. The waiters/waitresses by the pool are there the second you need them, their service was faultless!! They were extremely friendly too. However, they do make it all too easy for you and before you know it you have clocked up a large room bill!! However, if you are there to unwind and totally chillout, as we were, then dont even think about the room bill, enjoy!!!!! There was excellent poolside entertainment too! All day there is loud rock music playing out by the pool, under the water and throughout the hotel. Then late afternoon into the evening they had a poolside DJ/entertainer. He was amazing. Really good fun. Got all the kids and adults alike joining in and having fun!!! Prizes for the best hula-hooper etc etc! It was a really good atmosphere, and before you know it you have lost all track of time and realise it has suddently gone dark!!!! The hotel reception staff were all lovely, they welcomed us and checking in was no problem. It was both my children's birthdays the week we were there, and they clocked this. There names were put up in reception (with other birthdays that week, and famous rock star birthdays too). They sent them both a lovely card, with a pin badge and they sent them birthday cake to the room. This was a lovely touch! The girls were made up! All around the hotel is rock memorabilia which is fantastic. The Rock Shop for Hard Rock Merchandise is well worth a visit, but be warned you will be spoilt for choice. We ate in The Kitchen restaurant a few times. We had dinner one night, Wednesday night, which is character dining. Shrek and Scooby came round and signed autographs and had their photos taken with us all which was great. The food was really lovely and big portions too. Could not fault the service here. We had breakfast a few times here, although a little on the pricey side for the adults the buffet was massive and so much choice, and all very lovely, you really did not need to eat again the whole day!!!! What I loved as that at 8am in the morning, eating breakfast, they were still playing Rock Music, which in my books is ace!!! The atmosphere was constantly fantastic. We had take out smoothies and coffees from Emack and Bolios on a few occasions. I have to say this was pricey. Not particularly worth it, but in a rush to get the early doors to Harry Potter World a quick breakfast smoothie on route cut it quite well. I have to say the service was not always great in Emack's, which was a shame. Not as friendly as I felt they should have been compared to most other servers in Orlando!!!! Our room, very standard. I tried not to think about this one too much. We had a standard garden view room, well garden view it was!!! You could not see anything for the overgrown trees and bushes outside our window!!! The room was as standard as standard could be! I guess in this hotel you are just paying for the location!!! Annoyingly were were down a corridor in which dogs were allowed to stay in the rooms, our room did smell quite doggy at times and you could hear dogs barking in the rooms close by. For how much money we paid for this hotel, I wasnt particularly happy about this standard. However, I was on holiday to have a happy time and tried not to let it bother me too much. The three reasons we booked this hotel still remained and they were working out just fine!!!!! And we really only slept in our room, we were out all day long so it didnt matter really!!!! Beds were comfy - thats the main thing!!!!!!! Plenty of storage space for luggage! Coffee maker, but no fridge. All things considered, we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "GlobetrottersBelgium", "ReviewID": "UR118048161", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 9 nights and it was our 2nd stay.

The housekeeping staff sprayed the room, too, which still didn't fix the problem.

I'll try my best: The staff is phenomenal! From the customer service reps who check you in, down to the pool attendants. Everyone makes you feel so much at home, and that they are really there to serve you. We mentioned several times \"these people must REALLY love their jobs\". When we arrived to the hotel via Mear's shuttle from the airport, we were AMAZED. We felt like we were in a posh uptown resort, there were Porche's, Land Rover's, and lots of other luxury cars parked right out front. They have a famous guitar fountain that is beautiful, and a great place for pictures. We were extremely early (10AM) and check-in wasn't until 4. We had actually booked a Queen room, but meant for a King, so they checked and got us a King available instantly, didn't have to wait at all. They do offer luggage check services so if you get there early and your room isn't ready, you can enjoy the resort. The decor of this place is amazing, from Mick Jagger's shoes, to KC and the Sunshine Band portraits. They also have a large clock that is projected on the floor of the lobby that you can walk through, very nice touch!! Don't forget to take pictures, lots of them because this resort in itself is worth the trip to Orlando besides going to the Universal Parks. The room is very spacious, and has alot of amenities other hotels just don't even think to offer. The TV has a \"Music\" station that plays music videos non-stop from top artists among the decades, we loved this when we were getting ready in the morning. They also have a Kuerig Single Cup Coffee maker, with lots of assorted coffees and teas. I've never been to a hotel that offers this! The mini-bar is STOCKED!! I've never seen as much liquor, drinks, and snacks. I've attached pictures of the prices, beware they are a bit high. But in my opinion, you don't stay at a posh hotel like the hard rock to be cheap. Average price for a mini-liquor was $10, which you can make 2 drinks out of. Most name-brand drinks at the bars on-site will charge 13+ for drinks, so $10 really isn't bad. Most hotels of course offer the regular shampoo/conditioner, etc. But the hard rock goes above and beyond with a show polisher, a lint brush, cotton balls and Q-Tips, a hair dryer that is NOT attached to the wall, and a sewing kit complete with buttons. All of these items are complimentary and are re-stocked each and every day. Something else fabulous about the room is that there is a whole vanity sink/mirror inside of the bathroom, and also outside as well for a total of 2. This makes it EXTREMELY quick and easy to get ready in the mornings. The Room Service was the BEST we have had so far in all the places we have been. The operator was very courteous, and repeated our orders to make sure they got them right, they were definitely on the ball! Other places make room service a hassle, but Hard Rock has it down pat. Our server Johnny was absolutely excellent! He brought in a whole extra table, and situated it so I didn't even have to get out of bed! He said \"here, let me bring this table to you so you can relax, put your feet up!\" It was very unique that they bring in a whole table, and not just a tray that you have to carry to your table. I sat in bed still in my PJs and had an amazing breakfast! He also called back about an hour later to see how things were, and if we needed anything else! Who does that? The Hard Rock! We were so spoiled, we will always compare this service to every place we go to now. The restaurants/bars on-site are top-notch. They are pretty pricey, and I don't recommend this resort for kids - stay at the Portifino or Pacifica if you want something more affordable. We did not get a chance to eat at the Kitchen, but we did however eat at the The Palm. AMAZING!! There is a Surf and Turf Dinner for Two special between now and the end of November for only $85. This is an 18 oz NY Strip Steak (that will melt in your mouth!), two lobster tails, and two enormous side dishes of your choice. This is a great deal! They also had a three course dinner for $49.95 each - also not bad at all. We made reservations, but they are not required and they didn't seem too busy when we got there. The Beach Club is a must when you go to the hard rock! The food is very good as well, and the portion sizes are great value for the money. You can order by the pool, or sit at a table. The resort pool area is the perfect size - not too small, but small enough to make you feel like VIPs. They have a water-slide that reminded me of a water park. They also have a shallow side of the pool with beach sand that was very unique. Other's complained about the sand in the pool, but it was nice because it kind of made you feel like you were at the beach! We really enjoyed the live music during the day, and they show a movie at night. Some resorts in the Caribbean show movies at their pools and charge you LOTS of money, but this is included for FREE! This resort really is an expert at guest amenities and the activities they offer. We had a few drinks at the Velvet lounge, a nice pre-gaming stop if you plan to enjoy the nitelife of City Walk. Grab a chocolate martini and sit out on the terrace over looking the entire resort, you won't be disappointed! If all of this wasn't enough, the perks of staying at a hotel on the Universal Orlando Resort just blew us out of the water. The Express Pass room keys at the Parks truly make you VIPs at Universal. We never waited in line, and actually felt like movie stars when we walked past all of the others standing in line. Each vendor also offers to have your souvenirs delivered to your room so you don't have to carry them around all day, who thinks of this? The free water taxi and bike service to/from the parks is just the icing on the cake. All of these perks made our vacation truly unforgettable. Not once did we feel rushed, or tired from standing in line and walking around all day. Makes it for a much more enjoyable experience. The only negative thing I have to say about this resort is that they charge a fee for the use of the fitness equipment - but with all of the other interesting and entertaining things to do, you won't even have time to work out. And if you really need to exercise, the resort offers beautiful paths and walkways that make for a great morning run! One last tip, even if you already have tickets to the parks, go to the Universal Ticket Counter at the front desk of the Hard Rock Resort. I asked some questions about the Express Pass and Maps, and he gave me 2 for 1 drink coupons, free appetizers and merchandise at City Walk.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cFast Passes worth weight in gold; otherwise met expectations\u201d", "Author": "milkyway01", "ReviewID": "UR117858104", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for 8 nights in August. The hotel met, but did not exceed expectations, and on the whole it is fair to say that the reviews on trip advisor (if the most extreme ones are ignored) are very accurate. I\u2019ll comment first, on the positives. If you want to visit either Islands of Adventure or Universal Studios, these are seriously good positives... The main reason we chose the hotel was the proximity to these parks and the fast passes. As expected these proved to be completely invaluable, saving literally hours of queuing time, allowing multiple turns on the major attractions. It was brilliant being able to walk to the parks (and be able to come back for a change of clothes after having been totally soaked on a water ride). Hard Rock is the closest of the three hotels and a really easy stroll, mainly in the shade. The hotel's Starbucks opened at 6.15am so it was possible to take advantage of the early access to Harry Potter with some food/coffee inside. The early HP access is also a serious benefit given the popularity of the attraction but don\u2019t underestimate the early start required for the 7am entry given your days in Orlando tend to be very busy. However, perfect for British travellers for a couple of days whilst bodies adjust to the time difference. If you stay at the hotel please take the time to look around at all the memorabilia; it\u2019s everywhere and really fascinating. We only ate twice at the hotel (breakfast mentioned later in the review) and an evening meal on our last night at the Kitchen \u2013 we received superb service, great food choice and excellent food. The not so good stuff: Check In: Despite a four hour delay on our flight from the UK and arriving at the hotel at 11pm it still took nearly 30 minutes to check in which was crazy. In the end the delay appeared to have been around upgrading us to a pool view room (which, in reality, we didn't really want as these rooms were definitely noisier). However, frankly I was too tired to make a fuss and the receptionist threw in a complimentary breakfast at the Kitchen for the wait (and this breakfast turned out to be exceptionally good). Room: Our room was clean, the beds big and comfy but the bathroom was very small for a family of four and the shower water power very ordinary. We never had an issue with the timing of the housekeeping; perhaps that was because we tended to be out most of the day but we did take the time to be friendly to the housekeeping staff. Pool: I\u2019d say the pool area was ok but very busy, too many (uncomfortable) sunbeds and the water really isn't very deep (therefore not very cool and refreshing). Parking: I\u2019d got my head round the additional $15 a day for parking, annoying but went with eyes wide open. The self parking car park is really close to the hotel so I struggle to see the need to pay for valet. In fact my husband was the perfect valet parker....dropped us off by the lobby and then went and parked the car! Gym: Again I knew there was a daily cost of c. $10 to visit the gym. To be honest I\u2019d have struggled to find time to get to the gym but given the cost of the hotel I certainly wasn\u2019t going to pay extra for the privilege! So all in all I\u2019d say the Hard Rock hotel was exactly the experience I\u2019d expected it to be and worth its weight in gold if your kids want to spend much of their day upside down on rollarcoasters!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "galway", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Going Back\u201d", "Author": "ktfloss", "ReviewID": "UR117804954", "Content": "We only picked this hotel so we could have the express passes for the attractions at Universal and Islands of Adventure.

We ended booking a pool view room because we booked later than we wanted to because of Hurricane Irene and definitely concur with earlier reviews that the extra charge ($40 or so) for a pool view room is NOT worth it if you are deciding whether or not to splurge for it. The palm trees and foliage around the pool, although lovely, have obscured the view to the pool they should not even being to charge extra for that at this point. I thought the hotel did an excellent job making it feel like both an adult resort and a family resort. They had lots of activities at the pool, while the speakers were blaring (and I do mean blaring, at times it was hard to have a conversation, although maybe I am just getting old) nine inch nails. My only other compliant and albeit minor was that we had those splash balls (you know foamy, pool balls) which we play catch with which you aren't allowed to use, in fact no balls are permitted but beach balls and our room was directly across from the custodial supply closet. We slept in late (for our family) and starying around 8am the closet was banging and there was loud conversation, it had progressed so loud by 8:30 am that everyone was up.

The line to see them in the park was too long so that worked out. The pool food was very good, loved the fish taco. Ate at Margarittaville, good food, good service and the staff make balloons from 6-9.

The staff was attentive and friendly. Check in was easy and although our room was not ready when we arrived (we were early), our bags were held, we were allowed to go to the pool, relax and have lunch while they readied our room. They called us once our room was ready and had arranged to have our bags brought up so we didn't have to pick them up from the baggage check area in the lobby. The walk to Universal Studios from the hotel was about 5 minutes through lushly landscaped grounds. I believe of the 3 hotels within Universal's grounds, this was closest to the park. The room keys allow you to bump to the from of most lines (except the Harry Potter ride in the castle), and being a hotel guest, you were allowed into the parks 1 hour before opening each day (very handy for the aforementioned HP ride, becuase the lines for that are huge once the park opens). Another bonus was anything purchased in the park gift shops can be sent to your room so you don't have to carry extra things around with you. If you go to Universal Studios for a vacation, I highly recommend staying at the Hard Rock for the convenience and the atmosphere.

I'd spent a lot of time checking reviews before I booked it over 9 months ago and took absolutely no notice of the ones that said 'this isn't somewhere you'd take your grandparents', which is just as well. Everything was easy when we checked in and the room was just fine. Loads of space and the air con hardly noticeable unlike some English hotels where it sounds like a jet engine's being tested for 8 hours at a time. Music everywhere so be prepared if you go. We were quite happy with it. The pool's really nice with one slight drawback and that is the pool depth. It needs to be a bit deeper than the maximum 4ft but it didn't spoil anything. It was great to see people being able to sit in the pool with glasses of drinks served by the many servers. You need to be warned that although the prices for food aren't bad, there's always going to be extra for the tips. We had breakfast at The Kitchen each day and for the two of us, including the tip, it was $50. that sounds extortionate but it was a buffet breakfast and neither of us needed to eat again til late afternoon so it was good value and the food was excellant. There's masses to choose from. Fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, packs of cereal, pastries, scrambled eggs, hash browns, corn beef hash, bacon and sausages. You can have hot chocolate or coffee and orange juice. It was all delicious. Best scrambled eggs I've had anywhere other than my house. We also ate at the Poolside restaurant which was also good. Bit of a wait for the food but not a problem as you can watch the evening film or the storm, whichever has priority at the time. Don't worry about the storms, they're spectacular but brilliant. All the hotel staff are helpful and respectful and seem to enjoy what they're doing. I've always thought the Americans have customer service off to a T and the Hard Rock is a good example of this. Housekeeping start really early so don't forget to put the 'leave me alone' card on your door if you don't want waking up before 9am. Good news about the shampoo. It's good quality and you don't need to wash your hair again with the one you've brought with you. Just a small thing but bottles of shampoo can be left at home. There's a shuttle bus to Wet n Wild, Sea World and Acquatica. It doesn't run that frequently and you have to make sure you book it at reception the day before you want to go or you won't be able to get on the bus. The shuttle boat is brilliant but keep in mind that if there's a hint of a storm, it doesn't run. This isn't the end of the world as it's only a 10 minute walk back to the hotel. An alternative to the boat is the small army of cyclists who will take you from the boat landing at the hotel to the entrance to Universal Studios. It'll take you beyond that if needs be. It's not far to walk but having a small limitation on my mobility, it was brilliant to be able to hop on one of these and get cycled the couple of minutes it takes to get there. There's no specific charge but they ask that you give a fair amount to cover the charge of the bike they're hiring etc. Emacks and Bolios ice cream parlour. What can I say!!! This is brilliant. When you ask for one scoop be aware it's like a spadefull compared to what we get in England. Not cheap but not an arm and a leg either. We loved it. I'd definitely do Hard Rock again but would keep it to just a few days only because we would want to stay in Florida for more than a week and I'd want to be a bit more central for the other theme parks.

A big (huge) plus of staying on property is the express line pass (your room key) we always buy one for our 1st day when visiting Universal they make it so easy to get on the rides but works out expensive for a family so getting this benifit all day everyday is fantastic, but as you no doubt already know no use for Harry potter or hollywood rip ride rockit. Another perk is early park entry at the time of our stay 7.00 am - 8.00 am but has now changed to 8.00 - 9.00 , worth a mention if you dont know, the early entry is only for islands of adventure not universal studios & the only ride open is Harry Potter but as the Wizarding world is the biggest pull at this time it does mean you get the chance every morning to get a ride with much smaller lines some of the lines later in the day were horrific all the way back to jurrasic park ! The Hard Rock is a great hotel , I really loved it , we all did & I hope to return, but if you are on a budget it could be a bad choice unless you are careful , I think it was worth what we paid but if you went wild & charged everything to your room you could have a very large bill waiting for you, with the 18% service charge on drinks , $20 for a pay to view movie , $15 a night to self park & if you hit the mini bar not to mention room service prices , well you get the picture, all that said I guess you get what you pay for & it was a great place to stay.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic perks\u201d", "Author": "PrincessJaney", "ReviewID": "UR116963807", "Content": "Loved the fact that you did not have to queue for the rides, as unlike disney (free fastpasses) you have to pay extra for a 'fastpass' unless you stay at one of the onsite hotels.

The slide is great and a lot of fun, even for adults. There is always something going on, especially later in the afternoon, so it is a good idea to go to the parks early and then come back to the pool when the fun starts. There is either a dj or live band and games to participate it. The pool is a lot of fun for all ages. At the pool there is waiter service and the Beach Club. The drinks and food are good, but expensive. One of the best parts about staying here is the convenience. The parks and City Walk are a short walk away. It feels like you are kept away from the crowds. Your room key serves as a fast pass on the rides and this is awesome. We walked on rides that had an hour wait. The only ride you can't use it on is Harry Potter. For that ride go on as single riders and it will cut the wait time significantly. I wish that Universal offered a food plan similiar to Disney's. For breakfast the only options you had were the buffet at The Kitchen, which was great, but expensive or quick food at the ice cream shop which was awful and relatively expensive for cereal and bagels. The Latin Quarter on City Walk was great. The food and atmosphere were wonderful. The HArd Rock Cafe was very cool. When you go to Islands of Adventure be prepared to get wet.

We arrived early on the day of our arrival and went to the pool for lunch. We sat down ordered drinks and they were served and enjoyed by all. The food was ordered and we waited two hours before we were finally served our food. The waitress kept saying the kitchen was backed up and we accepted since we knew we had a large party and it would take some time BUT when the waitress came back to \"verify what we ordered again\" we knew the real problem was that the waitress either failed to turn our order in or the order was somehow lost by either the waitress or kitchen staff. The food was ok (not great) especially when you consider the outrageous price we had to pay when we FINALLY got our bill. That wasn't even the worst of it, the area smelled of old alcohol and garbage. Needless to say not a great start to the getaway. We finally got our rooms and they were a standard hotel room very overpriced. You had to pay for internet service and anything else that you may want to do when at a hotel. The bathroom was just a regular bathroom with a small sink and then an outside area with a sink. Both sinks would back up with water anytime you washed your hands, brushed your teeth, etc. I would think they could afford a much better plumbing system for the amount of money they charge for EVERYTHING. Don't get me wrong, I knew the prices were above average and I did sign up for that BUT I did not expect the poor service, horrible smells, backup of water in the sinks, or poor experience. I would not recommend this to anyone. The hotel was not even fun to explore since the only thing they had were some shops with expensive items.

One major complaint this trip however; We made our reservation direct with the hotel back in February, for a 2-bedded room for 3 nights. They duly took one night's worth of deposit and confirmed by e-mail. When we checked in we were told that they didn't have a room with 2 beds available! Not great, when you have 2 teenage kids travelling with you. I requested an upgrade to a suite, but surprise, none available. We eventually ended up in a one queen bed room with rollaway beds for the kids. Not nice after a 9 hour flight! OK, we were moved next day to a 2-bed room and the check-in manager gave us complimentary breakfasts (worth about $90) by way of apology. To cap it all they then tried to bill us for 3 nights hire of rollaways ($150), which we quickly got removed.

We talked to the front desk and they resolved it by refunding the difference between our room and a garden view room (which was very nice of them to do). If you see postcard pictures of the backside of the hotel those pictures were taken a while ago when the palm trees were a lot smaller. Those trees have grown folks, and many of the \"pool view\" rooms are now partially to fully obstructed pool view rooms. So TIP #1: you probabally should not pay extra for a \"pool view\" room.

This easily made up for the exorbitant cost of the room itself, if only for the time it saved during two very hot days. You also got into Harry Potter an hour earlier than the general public. If I got a great deal on a room here, I would return, but if you are not getting the park benefits, it is way too expensive for a hotel.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cChecking in was a nightmare!\u201d", "Author": "SoBeGirlNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR116059883", "Content": "We recently stayed here for 2 nights and had a horrible time checking in.

He said that he didn't remember telling us that he would give us a 6th floor room, but a pool view. Not good enough! We had reservations at 5:45 at Margaritaville with family and had to get ready. After much complaining, he gave us 4 drink tickets and moved us up to the 7th floor which was the Concierge Level. The room itself was okay. Very small for a family of 4 but clean. Of course the hotel was very busy and crowded but that is expected for the month of July. You can't beat the \"fast pass\" you get to use on the rides and shows at Universal and Islands of Adventure and going to the park 1 hour before the public is allowed in. That was helpful in seeing \"Harry Potter\" which was terrific!

We stayed in the King deluxe room. It is all one room, but there is a sitting area on one side of the room, and a nice size table for eating or using the computer on the other side. Bring a cooler to use in the room since there is no microwave or refrigerator. The minibar requires a key that is issued to you and can keep kids from using it without your knowledge. That can cut down on unintentional charges to your room. The bathroom area is two areas. The vanity area, separated from the sleeping area by a wall for privacy, and a shower / toilet area that is behind a bathroom door for privacy from the vanity area. There is a room safe in the closet. There's plenty of dresser drawers for clothing, but not much surface area since the TV sits on top of the dresser. The kingsize bed was comfortable, and our daughter slept in a rollaway bed that was decent. I did get a little annoyed at the $10 charge each day for intenet access. The airconditioning was adequate and quiet, but I would have preferred a more powerful unit. We brought along night lights to guide us to the bathroom at night and were glad we did since the black out curtains did a wonderful job, but left no ambient light to navigate around the room at night. The hotel pool is great, the location is great, and the rock memorabilia are great. The early entry to Universal studios is the overall factor for choosing Universal property hotels because the room rate and the food at the hotel are expensive.The pool is not deep and isn't intended for diving. It more for lounging. There is a pool slide, a stage for pool parties and a nice hot tub. There's afternoon entertainment like hula hoop contests and the pool employees make sure only hotel guest have access to the grounds. It's about a 10 to 15 minute walk to Islands of Adventure from the hotel if you stroll instead of rush.One of the high points of staying at a Universal hotel was having breakfast at the Three Broomsticks at Hogsmeade in Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You can only do this if you book a hotel package that included park tickets. We got a reservation for 8am, were at the main gates at 7:45 am, allowed in by showing our tickets for breakfast, walked to Hogsmeade with nobody in our way, and were admitted into the Three Broomsticks at exactly 8am. That alone was worth the price of the hotel room. No crowds and a chance to eat in peace in Hogsmeade and to imagine the students of Hogwarts showing up to eat and chat. Just remember to bring a cooler for the hotel room, leave time to enjoy the pool, and if you hate the prices of the hotel food, head over to the eating places just 4 blocks away on the main drag.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cABSOLUTELY BRILLIAN\u201d", "Author": "proudmary_11", "ReviewID": "UR115935013", "Content": "My family and I have stayed in this hotel many times.

Check in was easy, it was easy to pick up our tickets to Islands of Adventure and Studios, and service at all times was great. Keep in mind it is a resort, and so it can be expensive to eat at the hotel, at nearby City Walk and in Islands of Adventure and Studios (in some ways, it is cheaper to eat in Islands of Adventure and Studios than at the hotel or City Walk). The shop on level 1 of the hotel does sell doughnuts, coffee and other items for breakfast or a small snack. There are also a few fast food options at City Walk. The hotel is about a short 5 minute walk (or water taxi) to Islands of Adventure and Studios. The room slept well and was very quiet. Be sure to take an afternoon from the parks to spend some time at the hotel pool, which had wonderful entertainment in the afternoons (and a movie in the evenings). The pool is open until midnight, which I really enjoyed after each day in the park. I did have an issue with booking on-line. I checked the price, and went back to book the room later in the evening, and the price jumped up by about $175, but I went ahead and booked the higher rate as the week we selected was our best week to travel to Universal.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort\u201d", "Author": "hammertimehi", "ReviewID": "UR115916119", "Content": "My family and I went here on a trip I won.

This hotel is stunning. It is the closest hotel out of the 3 in Universal and the parks and City walk are just a 5 minute walk away along a beautifully landscaped path or you can easily get on the water taxi or rickshaws (Rickshaws are free but they do like their tips as they dont get paid a salary, \u00a35 is sufficient). We stayed in a queen deluxe room with a pool view 5134 (2 adults and 2 teenagers 17 and 15) the room was large and comfortable except for the sofa bed, this could have done with a thicker mattress as it was a little lumpy so we took it in turns to sleep on that ! The hotel is lively from 8am to midnight with rock music wherever you go you cant even escape it in the lift so if youre not keen on rock music dont go. This is not a cheap Florida holiday either expect to pay $32 for a large beer and a cocktail and a family of four cant really eat in the restaraunts there for under $100. The mini bar is extortionatley priced so we didnt use it at all. I suppose im trying to say that if you want to go here you really need some serious money in your pocket. It is defintiely best to eat out on Citywalk or elsewhere if you have a car. Its about $16 a day to park your car at the hotel and a lot more if you use valet parking. Car hire is also expensive. We hired a Ford Escape for just 2 days and it cost us $300. The use of the 'F' word is not permitted because this to the hard rock means FREE and nothing is FREE except for the towels you use at the pool !!!! This may sound very negative but its not meant to be, the hotel is truly an amazing place in an amazing location. Emack and Bolios is the cheapest option to buy cereals or pastrys, doughnuts, bagels and milk etc and is open from around 6am to 10pm. The pool waitresses work very hard and deserve their tips although these are added to your bill at 18% whether you want to tip or not. All the staff are friendly and helpful, if you are taking travellers cheques this can be a pain as the reception staff are only allowed to change a specific amount each each day so can be an issue if you go late in the evening to change any money. You can use your room card to pay for anything in the hotel on citywalk or the universal theme parks and whilst this is excellent you really need to keep an eye on it. Using your room key card in the theme parks to access the express lines is simply brilliant but every rider must have their own card. You cant use express on the main Harry Potter ride or the new Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket at Universal Studios so get there early especially for HP World, as a guest in the Universal Hotels you can go there at 7am, an hour before the park opens and it is well worth getting up early for. Theres no 'real' evenning entertainment at the hotel, some stuff happens by the pool in the afternoons but this is mainly aimed at the children with contests such as hula hooping or searching for golden eggs around the pool area. 'Scooter and Anthony' are funny, think they are there twice a week and there are also singers in reception and poolside a couple of times a week. The pool area is beautiful but its not really deep enough to 'swim' in. Lifeguards are present at all times, at least 4 of them. The pool is open til midnight and they have movies showing poolside every night from about 8.30pm, these are usually shrek, harry potter, avatar etc type films. Shuttle buses are available and free for transportation to sealworld, acquatica, busch gardens and other places but not kennedy space centre. You need to book your placeon these buses though as you need a ticket and this is easy to do from the reception attraction ticket desk. Overall this is a fabulous hotel and location just expect to spend a lot of money. We would stay here again and again if our salaries could support it !!!!

We all had a blast! We wanted to stay onsite so we could visit Harry Potter world (we are real fanatics), and this was the best place to do it. Early park access to HP world and fastpasses throughout other rides. Seriously, the only way to go. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, think of it as your only chance to live like a rock star! We booked a Kids suite on the Club level. The suite was very roomy and although there was only one bathroom, it was brilliantly laid out. The \"master\" side of it is a double sink with a shower while the other side of it includes a toilet and a tub/shower. Both sides are set off with a locking door. I found it to be surprisingly convenient for us. We also rented the cabana and used the fitness center and pool area. The fitness area was smallish, but it had a good variety of machines and some free weights. The floor was a bit dirty (and the yoga mats a bit smelly), but I was too, so I overlooked that. But I can see others having issue with the fitness area floor being dirty. The Palm restaurant was fantastic and well worth the money. I was surprised how comfortable the bed was--Frankly, I expected less. But some of the patrons on the floor were quite noisy walking by at late hours (yes, kids run around at 11pm!!). Bring earplugs if you are sensitive (I did and I was fine). It wasn't noisy the entire time, just on occasion (and in our case it seemed to be the same noisy family every time). I have to say that club level is really the best way to go. Lots of included amenities and the food holds you over so you don't have to spend even more $$ for the overpriced food there. That being said, the overpriced food is pretty good and you can split plates (they are large portions). Happy hour at the Club lounge was very nice and the concierge there were so friendly. Big plus-- if you are planning to rent a cabana, you get a discount if you are on Club level. The pool cabanas are fun-- you get a ceiling fan and a TV (I know, why watch TV when you are outside at the pool but for some reason, it was actually relaxing for a short while). You also get a fridge with sodas, water, plus a fruit basket and ice cold chilled towels (for cooling off in the heat). You also get very attentive servers who are so very nice!! When we rented one, it was my daughter's 17th birthday and we purchased a balloon bouquet from the hotel service itself. Yes, it was $25 (ugh) but considering all the other high expenses, I felt lucky it really wasn't more. And, it meant alot to her to see the cabana decorated! As far as the pool, if you can stay there while the pool DJ show is going on, you should. They have lots of activities out there and some fun contests. (Husband won the hula hoop contest and got a free drink not to mention bragging rights to being able to hula hoop for a good 7-8 seconds!). The pool vibe was just fun-- and after the show, they had a movie right there. We didn't want to leave for dinner so we had food delivered out at the pool. Very cool!! Our last day, we lunched in the Kitchen- they have a giant $18 burger that you must try. I believe it was 18 oz patty or something crazy like that! But so so so good!! All in all- we had a tremendous time there-- the staff really worked hard to make you feel welcome.

The queue hopping and extra hour at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure make the extra money you pay for staying here worthwhile and i would recommend it to anyone who is planning to visit those theme parks. During peak times you are likely to queue for ages, but not with your Hard Rock Room key! Also, if you arrive early and make the most of your extra hour in the morning, you can avoid waiting for up to 2 hours to get on the Harry Potter ride! We waited just 20 minutes to get on the ride by arriving early in the morning - and it is a fantastic ride! The hotel itself is excellent - The pool is awesome - as long as you don't want a quiet and relaxing pool area - it's quite lively with loud music, lots of kids, films on the big screen and live music and entertainment. I liked the pool, but i can see why it wouldn't be for some people. The pool side service is great, they definitely know how to look after you and earn the 17.5% service charge they automatically add to your bill!! The food was great, aways ended up eating way too much - but i didn't have a bad meal while i was there. You also have free transportation to Sea World, Wet and Wild and Aquatica. If you're feeling lazy or you like boats, there is also a free shuttle boat to universal. although its just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel room was nice, spacious, clean and tidy which is what i would have expected for the price. All the staff i spoke to were friendly and helpful - especially at the beach club and in the market place. The only downsides of this hotel, were that you had to pay to use the gym - not that i ever had the energy to go in there having walked round theme parks and eaten too much! And also our room had the ice machine just outside which constantly woke us up in the night!!

In terms of location to Universal Studio's you can't get closer and the perks of skip the queue and early entry are huge benefits.

We were given a garden view room on the ground floor, I would have asked for a higher floor room but as we had waited a while I just wanted to get to the room to get changed. We were close to the pool, walkways to the parks and city walk and also to the restaurants etc. The room was lovely but the housekeeping was a tad laid back and as we had stayed in a moderate disney resort the previous week where the housekeeping was brilliant, this hotel wasn't as good. We do give tips to the housekeepers for the first few days of our stay and then at the end but this still shouldn't add/take away from the service as it should be to a good standard always, but we did not experience this. We came back one day and an \"employee in room\" sign was on our door so we went to get some snacks and came back but it was still there, so we went to sort some stuff at concierge we had been meaning to do but it was still there when we got back so we just went in but there was no-one there! The housekeeper had also left a bottle of cleaning fluid and a dirty cloth on the sink. My pyjamas and clothes left on the bed were also just thrown on the floor which was a surprise to me. Everything else during our stay was great though! We ate at the Kitchen and the beach club and both were brilliant, although the beach club is the only one which add gratuity to your bill automatically which I am not entirely sure why, but the servers were all great anyway! We attended the velvet sessions while we were there which was a great experience! It was around $28 per ticket which included free cocktails, beer and small appetizers so it was worth the money! The pool area was fab, and we always managed to find a sun lounger, but we usually went for a few hours in the morning before the parks so it was quieter. This hotel is worth staying at just for the easy access to parks and the express passes to rides. We never waited longer than 10 minutes in an express pass queue. We went into Islands of Adventure at 7am (an hour earlier than regular guests) once and found this beneficial for the main Harry Potter ride but the wait was still 45mins!

The best thing about the hotel is the proximity to the entrance of both Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and City Walk. There is a walking path right located behind the pool area that takes you to all three in less than 10 minutes. If you don't want to walk there is a great water taxi or bicycle taxis. We stayed on the Club level and it was a zoo in there. The line for food was so long each day at 5 oclock we couldn't believe it. I would recommend it for families with more than two kids as the breakfasts were wonderful. The Kitchen Restaurant is fantastic for dinner, you can go casual right from the pool. Also, the pool is one of the best features of the hotel. My 10 year old couldn't get enough of the water slide and fun pool games going on all the time. Plus, there are movies going on at the pool each night. One of the things that I couldn't get past was the fee to use the gym ($10/day)! I have never heard of that, but if you stay on Club level, it is waived. The rooms are fine, nothing spectacular...the maid service was not so hot. Each day we went over to Islands of Adventure to get a Butterbeer ($10.45) and both of our Collectors' mugs were taken on the last day by the maids! No one seemed to know anything when we brought it up that we left them in our room. Other than that the service and hotel were great and we would definitely return. Tips - stay at one of the three hotels on Universal Property and use your room key to fast pass rides - it is worth every penny because it saves hours waiting in line. Go to the Harry Potter experience at 5pm when everyone clears out for dinner. It hardly has a wait time and you cannot fast pass the ride in the castle. If you can afford club level, it is pretty good for breakfast, sodas and snacks all day. 5pm is happy hour with cheese, crackers and kabobs.

We checked our bags with the valet and checked in at the front desk around 10:30. Although our room was not ready, we got our room keys and went to the parks. We got a call about 1/2 hour later that our room was ready, but we stayed at the park until late afternoon. Our room was on the first floor (as requested) and our bellman pointed out that although we were very far from the lobby and main part of the hotel, we were just steps from the side door to the pool and the walkway to Universal. It was super convenient. The room was clean and comfortable, but aside from 2 rock photos, nondescript. We had a view through the bushes of the pool area. The pool area is very loud and when we went to bed around 11:30 Saturday night, we could still hear music, etc. The pool area itself is great, with a huge pool. It never felt crowded. They have a sand \"beach\" for some reason, which i found more annoying than fun, because my feet kept getting sandy and there was a lot of sand in the pool. The hot tubs were crowded but nice, and my kids liked the waterslide. We ate dinner at The Kitchen. Food was good, service was slow. While we ate Bart and Homer Simpson stopped by for photo ops. They have a good ice cream shop that also sells breakfast food, which saves time on the way to the parks. Overall, I would stay there again. It is a lovely hotel.

We shared the 5 pound lobster. Enough for both of us, but most of the weight I would attribute to the shell. The wine list was large, although very pricey. Hard to find a reasonably priced red under $75. But I did manage. Service was attentive, but not intrusive. One issue was the brussel sprouts came out almost raw and hard. Had to send them back, and took over 20 minutes before I asked where they were. The manager comped them for us which was nice. Best of all is the short walk to the two parks.

We stayed at club level which I would recommend we had a brilliant view of Universal Studio's from our room window, our room was clean and the hotel was immaculate and provides all the facilities you need. Food in the restaurants was excellent especially, 'The Kitchen'. The walk to Universal Studio's was about 5 mins and the express tickets and early (1 hour) prior access to the parks is priceless (especially as the queue for Harry Potter can get quite long). With only 1 week we were able to do City Walk, Universal Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios in 3.5 days which left us 2.5 days to go to Seaworld, Aquatica and shopping. This was because our express tickets meant our queuing time for the rides and shows was never more than 5 minutes (this may differ in peak period). Hotel staff were always friendly and extremely helpful - always willing to go that extra bit to provide more help than you need and always on hand to make recommendations for the best places to go and how to get there.

We had a 6:00 am flight and we arrived in Orlando at 9:00 am. We got to the Hard Rock Hotel around 10:30 am. We checked in and received our Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and City Walk passes. We were told that we would receive a phone call/text when our room was ready. Typical check in time is 4:00 pm -however, we read in the hotel policies that if a room is available prior to 4:00 they will assign it to you. We gave our luggage to the hotel to hold until the room was ready then we walked over to Universal Studios. 4:00 came and we still hadn't receved a call or text telling us that our room was ready. By now we had been up since 3:00 am -we were tired and hot (it was 48 degrees when we left home so, we weren't exactly dressed for 90 degree Florida weather) and just wanted to get into our room to freshen up -change clothes and relax a little. We went back to the front desk and pretty much pleaded for a room. We were finally assigned a room on the 1st floor. We went to retrieve our luggage and were told that the hotel staff would deliver it in about an hour. We didn't want to wait another minute to freshen up and change into \"Florida\" clothes so, we said that we'd take our own luggage to our room.... they didn't seem pleased with that -but we weren't really pleased either so, we insisted that we'd take it ourselves. If we'd waited for them that would've been at least another hour that we had to wait to change and what good was getting into the room without any of our stuff?? Getting into the room was our biggest complaint -there had to be a room somewhere in that hotel that was available before 4:00. This is one reason why I gave them 3 stars. Other than the room issue -the staff was pleasant -actually everyone in the hotel seemed nice. We ate at 'The Kitchen' a few times -everyone seemed nice and friendly and the food was pretty good. The pool was always crowded but there was plenty of poolside chairs available and room for more people without seeming over crowded. If you exited through a gate near the back of the pool and followed a path City Walk and the 2 theme parks were a short 10-15 minute walk away -this is a big bonus... no waiting for buses! Bicycle taxies were available at both ends of the path -these people work for tips only so, tip good if you ever use them. It was nice to get a ride back from the parks at the end of the day. There isn't a fridge available in the room (big thumbs down -another reason for the 3 stars) they do have a locked (the key is available at the front desk) mini bar with unreal prices -like $7.00 for a bottle of water. We ended buying water at the hotel store and filling up our ice bucket every night and using it like a cooler to keep the water cold in case we were thirsty in the middle of the night. A regular empty fridge for our use at no charge (like they have in the Disney hotels) would have been great. We read that they will switch the mini bar out for a regular fridge for a fee of $25 then charge $15 p/day on top of that to keep the fridge. There is also a small safe available for a p/day fee -again Disney gives you use of the same exact safe at no charge. The hotel and our room were neat and clean. Even though we were out of the room for most of every day no one showed up to clean our room or give us fresh towels. By the 3rd day we had to call down to the front desk and ask for fresh towels and to have our trash emptied. They were apologetic and sent someone right up. Would we stay here again...??? Maybe -but, we think that we like the way Disney runs their hotels better. We also liked how Disney gives you one card for your room key, park passes, etc -1 card covers everything. At Universal we had a room key/park express combo pass card, City Walk pass card and Universal/Islands of Adventure pass card. Having 1 card for everything is a lot better all around. If you want to stay here (or any other Universal Studios hotel) just make sure you know what's included and what's not included ahead of time so there are no surprises -otherwise just expect to pay extra for everything and you'll be good.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel. The positive service began when I was making the reservations. The reservation agents (I called twice) were very courteous and expressed appreciation for our business. Once we arrived, the hotel exceeded our expectations. The theming throughout the hotel is great. As one example, you can hear rock music playing if you go underwater in the pool. The pool area and grounds are gorgeous. The lobby, shops, etc. are all very attractive as well. It is a short walk or boat ride to the theme parks and you get great perks like early entry and express access to most rides by staying at a Universal resort. We had a basic garden view room. I thought the decor was beautiful. The colors were creams and browns and blues. There are brushed steel/chrome accents, i.e. the lamps, bath hardware and accessories. The beds were very comfortable. The toiletries were some of the best I have encountered. Also the hair dryer had good power and the water pressure was very good. These are little things that I appreciate, I did wish there was more room to stow our bags. I like to be able to put them under the bed or in a closet and there wasn't room. But all in all I loved the room. We ate at the casual restaurant, the Kitchen. We just ordered basic food, like a turkey club and flatbread, but it was delicious with top quality ingredients. They also have other dining options including an upscale restaurant, 24 hour room service and servers walking around the pool area taking drink orders (maybe food too...not sure). There was a lot of clutter in the hallways throughout most of the day between cleaning carts and maintenance work that was going on. We also had a maintenance worker ask to change the air filter in the room. It only took a minute, so it was okay with us. Interestingly, at night there was an aroma in the hallway like people were smoking marijuana....could it be part of the theming? Service at the resort was average. Everyone was friendly, but things were a bit slow at times. For example, we had our bags unloaded from the car before anyone approached us to help with unloading. We were out of our room all morning at the theme park, but cleaning service didn't come to the room until the afternoon, when we were back to rest. The person didn't speak English so it was difficlt to communicate that we just wanted her to replace the towels. She left new towels, but didn't pick up the ones on the floor.

We bought Park Tickets at the Concierge Desk, for the same price as tickets bought online thru Universal's website. The Front Desk staff was very friendly. One night when leaving the hotel to dinner, I required a hairdryer at the front desk; my husband who was leaving the room to join me received it......... It took only 30 seconds\u2026! The Level Club, as other reviewers said, worth the money. Limitless drinks as sodas, apple juice, water and coffee during almost all the day, plus other items already mentioned.

It varied every evening: something of vegetables, something of meat or chicken, sushi sometimes, etc\u2026) Never felt that guests were observed/censured by the Lounge staff due to the consumed amounts of food or drinks.....It was usual that people took several sodas, juice or coffees to the room or when leaving towards the parks\u2026.

Even we didn\u2019t requested drinks they send a complete silverware service, in a rolling table with 4 glasses, covered with plastic foil\u2026.and it was only a pizza! Due to the parks and the heat of the day, the breakfast, snacks, the Hors D'Ouvre and the dessert were sufficient food for us. Previous to the trip I doubted if we would take advantage of all the club amenities due to the schedules but I shouldn\u2019t. Sometimes we returned to the hotel to refresh us, to drink something eat some snacks, a little swimming and then return to the parks.

Bedding was elegant, and provided a magical night's sleep. The pillows were numerous, room temperature-easily adjusted, sheets- soft and perfectly made and the new carpeting soft and plush. The flat screen tv still provide great reception and a variety (although not large) amount of channels. The furniture in the room is perfect for a family's stay with large drawers, closets, a safe (small, not large enough for a laptop), table and plush chair.

My girlfriend and I recently drove up to Orlando to visit Universal and Islands of Adventure. I decided to get us 3 nights at Hard Rock Hotel Orlando. The majority of the hotel employees were rude and didn't take a moment out of their \"precious\" time to go out of their way to help. When we first arrived I got the valet to tend to my car (he was disrespectful and made me very uncomfortable to be handing over my keys). They wouldn't let me carry the bags and got a bell-hop to take our things. After checking in, we went up to our room and waited for nearly an hour. It was about 10:30 PM when we got to the room...my girlfriend had fallen asleep as I sat up to wait for our things. We woke up the next day ready to hit the parks, but wanted to eat breakfast first. We went to \"The Kitchen\" on the 1st floor of the hotel. We were greeted by a sour-faced hostess and served by an unkempt waiter who didn't seem to care about us being his guests. As I ate my breakfast I went to take a bite of my toast only to find a disgusting pubic-looking hair wrapped around it. They charge $10/day for wireless internet in the room which is just unacceptable when you're paying $200+/night for a hotel room. Even still I tried to pay and use the wireless as I had important items to take care of for work (I'm an online marketer), the wireless internet didn't even work when I tried to pay for it. I called the front desk and they were totally uninterested in helping, I didn't have time to wait on hold any longer for the \"tech support\" people. The following day I woke up early (I was told they had 'free internet' in the lobby). I went down with my laptop and was unable to connect. I approached the employees at the front desk and they simply laughed and said \"must be your firewall\" or something. At that moment another gentleman walked up behind me and said \"I can't get on the internet down here.\" They simply said, \"well, we could like call the tech guys or something but it should be working.\" Valet Parking: we went out to eat one night in downtown Orlando, when I had the valet pull my car up there was a giant splash of bird crap on the roof.

You can check in as early as 6am (if your room is not ready, they will store your luggage - we were lucky, our room was ready when we arrived at 7 30am). We were given our room key which allowed us to pass most of the queues on the day we checked in and the day we checked out. We were also able to enter the park 1 hour before general entry which allowed us to do the rides not covered by the Express Pass (Harry Potter Adventure) If we had bought the cards (3 people) in the park they would have cost $70pp/day for the dates we were there, which is more than we paid for the room - great deal as we did EVERYTHING in universal in 2 days by bypassing the lines. We stayed in a decent Holiday Inn Express at the Universal end of International Drive the prevous night (this had a fridge which enabled us to take a few supplies in a cooler to Hard Rock where we topped up the ice from the hotel ice machine). We had a five minute journey to the Hard Rock from the Holiday Inn. For a quick start in the morning once at the Hard Rock and to keep cost down, taking a few muffins, fruit, cans of pepsi and yogurt to the room worked well for us. We had a short day in Universal on our first day and returned to the hotel to enjoy the pool area. After Dinner at night (the Latin Quarter on the Board Walk - very good) we returned to enjoy the 'Dive In' movie - they put up a screen at the pool bar and you can watch while in the pool or lounging at the side - the film quality wasn't great but it was a nice experience and we could also see the Universal fire work display from the pool side.

Unfortunately, after checking out we ventured over to Disney for a few days and the parks were absolutely mobbed. I am beginning to think Disney doesn't have any slow periods anymore. Very frustrating. Anyway, I can see where people may not like the pop/rock theme of the hotel. Its definitely not like any place I have ever stayed but thats what I loved about it.

It was lovely seeing it all lit up at night and seeing the park in the distance. As well, we also had a bathroom where the vanity and sink were outside of the bath/toilet area, which was great for us with two women in the party needing the mirror in the mornings! The grounds are gorgeous and we enjoyed a drink and snacks at the poolside bar on arrival. Sadly the weather was just too cool to swim, but turned out to be a bit of a bonus as the cooler temps made the long days in the parks very easy. We stayed at the Hard Rock primarily for the early entrance to the Islands of Adventure (and in particular the Wizarding World of HP). This was well worth the money paid - that extra hour gave us several goes on the rides before the crowds got too bad.

This year we splurged and booked a club room on the 7th floor. This floor has special amenities like food, drink, appetizers, desserts and a staff member available to help you and make dining reservations. This level is located on the 7th floor and when you check in they add a \"7th floor\" sticker to your key card. During my stay I noticed that the door always remained open and that families/individuals not staying on the floor were coming in to get food, drinks etc. I complained 3 different times. The final time I rode up on the elevator which stopped on the 6th floor and a family of 5 got on with me. I asked them if they were staying on the 7th floor and the told me \"no, we just came up to eat breakfast.\" I told them nicely that if they weren't staying on the floor and paying for it they couldn't eat up there. I went down to the front desk to complain in person and the lady at the desk immediately picked up the phone to call upstairs to tell them. When I went back up, there sat the family of 5 eating and there ID was never checked and they weren't asked to leave. This happened on many occasions and others were commenting about it as well. When I registered my first complaint via phone they told me it was an ongoing problem. You do need to swipe you key in a special slot on the elevator to even have access to the 7th floor but people ride up with you that don't belong up there. I have done the club level at Disney and have never had a problem. They're pretty strict about checking ID's etc so you can't go it if you aren't paying for the service. At over $500 there wasn't anything exclusive about being on that floor and I was disappointed that nothing was ever done about it or enforced after 3 complaints. I will say the hotel is conveniently located and the express passes are great. Overall, the hotel is beautiful and very clean and nice.

My kids this trip were 14 and 16. I give them the choice of Disney or Universal and they now always choose Universal (that is not a knock on Disney - we used to go there and did go there during our stay and it is much cleaner - but for their age they prefer City Walk and Universal for the rides). The best part of this hotel is the fact that it is close to City Walk and the 2 parks. It is an easy 5 minute walk to each but while at the hotel you really don't know the parks are there. The rock theme of this place keeps good music piped in the lobbies, elevators and pool most of the time. Someone previous posted that the staff is young, and they actually are, but very friendly and seem to know what they are doing. Clearly there are experienced people in charge somewhere. The pool is also one of the highlights for us. It has to be the most happening pool in the area. Very large, with a beach area, very good water slide and activities for kids of all ages to adult throughout the day. Eddie, one of the pool food and drink waiters is great. Up sells a little but knows what he is talking about where he works. Keeps you occupied all day. Great guy. The DJ Scooter who is there a couple of days per week keeps everyone laughing. The pool food that we had was very good every visit - although a little pricy - it is a resort. The Cuban sandwich is wonderful - best I have had. We have been to the other hotels on property and although nice - for teens and adults this place is more fun. Old people will prefer the Portifino. I really did not find much about the Royal Pacific to like. The other great part of staying here is the fact that you can use your hotel room key card as the express pass for rides. It works in a way that you can use it as many times as you wish on any ride and bypass most of the lines. Way better than Disney fast pass or the one you buy for day trips to Universal. You can literally go on the same ride over and over all day and bypass the main lines. If I had any complaint it would be that the hotel seems the same every year. Not that it is bad in any way, but it looks like it is time to upgrade the place. They were painting the hall while there but same tired color. The carpet in the halls, which is designed to hide dirt needs to be replaced. A freshening would help in the rooms and halls. Even the pool area could use a make over. Maybe some insulation between rooms and especially in the room doors as you hear every conversation from hall to room would help. Some new paint colors wold help to freshen up the place. Every place has it's time and this is the time to re-do. Watch for the taxes and the parking fees $15 I think and figure about $40 taxes for the room additional.

The convenience cant be beat -- a very short walk to Universal and just a bit more to Islands of Adventure. Very easy to come back and forth -- much easier than Disney. Your room key is your express pass to just about every attraction except the one main Harry Pottey ride (which is fantastic but the wait can get long). The pool is also great -- big, with plenty of loungers, plenty of towels, drinks / food, games, etc. Be warned, if you are looking for peace and quiet for your pool time, this is not the place for you. But it is lively and fun, and the music is great. I also found the pool and other common areas to be exceptionally clean and well appointed and very rock-appropriate. The staff is all very friendly -- they are mostly young and so it may be a less formal type of friendly that you'll find at other resorts -- but after all this is the Hard Rock and it does live up to its name! The rooms are a bit of a different story. The standard rooms are small and very basic. The hallways and rooms have more of a lower-end chain motel feel and they do not live up to the price. This is one of the reasons I dont think it deserves a 5. The other reason is cost / value-- you pay more here than other similar (although not as fun!) high end chains in the Orlando area, but some of that is convenience and the express pass at the parks. However, on top of the higher room rates, everything is extremely expensive -- more so than other resorts in the area. $15 a day plus tax to self park. Food and drink at the pool and other casual venues at the Hotel is really really high plus an 18% automatic tip. No free wi-fi in the rooms. All to be expected at a resort I guess, but with the daily parking charge, a few drinks/snacks at the pool and some partries, coffees and ice cream at the snack bar you'll nearly double your daily room rate each day.

Portofino is beautiful and romantic but since I had 2 teenagers with me I decided we needed a diffferent atmosphere. This hotel is \"fun\". It is also beautiful, clean and perfectly located to the universal parks. I chose Orlando trnasportation and tours to take us from the airport to universal, It was the best quote and I was not disappointed. Nice private SUV, nice driver, on time. Excellent! We stayed IN 2 queen deluxe room. 2 Queen beds with a pull out couch. Nice size room. Pool area is beautiful and there was entertainment-hula hoop contest etc. The guy on stage providing the entertainment was very funny and we enjoyed it. There was an issue everyday trying to find chairs to sit in(forget about saving them, people just take your towels off the chairs and sit down) but I would let the pool staff know and they would search out chairs and put them where we could find a spot. The short walk to the parks was a pleasure. The landscaping is beautiful. You can also take the boat which was great. I loved the music that was playing overhead, I had read other reviews that stated the \"loud music blaring\". It was not loud and by the way you are staying at the \"Hard Rock Hotel\". I had also read reviews that complained about the rowdy guests. I never noticed any of that.I slept great, not noisy, it was wonderful. Food-The kitchen was overpriced and I spent 1 hour 45 minutes from the time I was seated until leaving. That was too long for the simple menu items we ordered. The breakfast buffet is expensive at 20.00 per person but was very good. The rest of the time we grabbed some cereal or a breakfast sandwich from the ice cream shop on our way to the parks.(There is nothing open before 8 am on citywalk for breakfast). At universal it was not crowed. The only time I witnessed crowds was early when you could enter early to go to Harry Potter. I am so glad I am not a Harry Potter fan because it was crazy! People were running! I was afraid of the stampede. Out of control! If your a HP fan...good luck! The express pass is sooo much better than the disney fast pass(if you are going to disney read my review of animal kingdom lodge). Universal sudios needs an update. Rides or attractions are outdated. City walk needs some other resturant/entertainment other than clubs so you can take your kids or teenagers. If your not 21 there is little to do there in the evening. I bought a Hard Rock all acess card and it payed for itself. I got 20 dollars in the gift shop and all resturants at hard rock except form the pool gave you 10 percent discount. I cannot say enough about the staff at Hard Rock. They were so nice and helpful. Really went out of their way to to assist you in any way. From the pool to the bell stand each staff person I enocuntered was great. My advice-Go to the parks early-come back to the pool by 1 pm, get rested, go back to the parks in the evening.

I was a bit worried about traveling to Orlando during a busy time. Even though the hotel was fully booked (as were the other 2 US hotels), we did not find the crowds to be unbearable at all. The early hour at Harry Potter and the Express Passes made the trip! A few tips to see Harry Potter: try to get there a few minutes before the park opens and just follow the crowd. Don't take any bags with you. The line for lockers is really really long. We got there right around 8am one morning and only had time to ride the Forbidden Journey once before the line got really long. The second morning we made sure to get there before the park opened (about 10 minutes) and were able to ride FJ twice with a minimal wait. Back to the hotel, yes the rooms were pretty small. But totally manageable. Everything was clean. I liked the split sink design for the bathroom. Pretty good bathroom amenities too--hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, shower cap, q-tips, cotton balls and a sewing kit. I thought the beds and pillows were pretty comfortable as far as hotels go. Let's face it, a hotel is never going to be as comfy as your own bed. We had a pool view room, so it was a pleasant view even though we couldn't really see the pool through the trees. Not sure that I would pay extra for that next time. They do play loud music at the pool during the day. So if you want to take a nap, that could be a problem. We loved the pool. I found it the perfect size and depth so that I was comfortable letting my two kids go free without having to keep an eye on them constantly. Just a note that the main hot tub was usually filled with kids (though all were behaving). There is an adults only hot tub towards the back. It's kind of hidden, so if you didn't walk passed it you may not know it's there. There's also a sand volleyball court near the slide. The pool service food was very good. OMG, you must try the nachos! Enough for the whole family! The cocktails were very good too and didn't seem too weak. You could order and extra shot of alcohol to go in them too. There were many servers walking around the pool area, but it was sometimes hard to flag one down to get your order. And then the service was pretty slow. I imagine due to the logistics of being at the pool and away from the restaurant. So just keep that in mind when ordering. And yeah, it's pricey. The nachos, one cocktail, and two non-alcoholic pina coladas cost about $50. But I'm on vacation and I was enjoying myself. I don't mind paying for the service of being waited on, pooliside. And note that an 18% gratuity is included on the pool tabs. I had 3 servers over the course of the stay and I know 2 of them made a point of telling me about it. It's possible the 3rd one did, but I wasn't paying attention. I know my husband was surprised to see it on the tab. There's also a cabana at the pool that sells pool toys, floats, sunglasses, sunscreen etc. That's kind of nice. I bought my kids a $6 beach ball and they inflated it for me. Careful though because a lot of kids have them and it's easy to lose track of them. We lost ours on our last night. No big deal though. We ate at the Kitchen a few times. Once for dinner. Again, great service. This was a late night at the parks for us so we got there around 9:30. They still had the full menu and they have a kids buffet that closes at 10. Our server made sure to tell us that the buffet would be closing, so to make sure that we get everything that we wanted. They had typical kid fare: sliders, chicken tenders, fries, mac and cheese, fresh fruit, I think some raw veggies and cookies. Our server noticed that the cookies were gone and offered to go to the kitchen to make sure that my kids got one. We ate there for breakfast twice too. They have a very nice breakfast buffet. I believe it was $20 per adult and $10 per child. They also have a regular menu. Everything again was very very good and great service. We were so lucky to have great weather so we got to enjoy sitting on the patio each morning. There's also a quick service snack area that has a starbucks, ice cream, various snacks and cereals. So that's nice if you want something quickly. They have the fancier Palm restaurant which we did not eat at. The location just can not be beat. Even with kids, I think it took about 7 minutes to walk to Universal. About 12 to get to IOA. There's a water taxi that will drop you off at CityWalk, but unless you are able to get right on it and go, it's faster to walk. There's still a bit of a walk to get to either park from the water taxi dock. On the path to the parks there will be several pedicabs offering rides. They don't make a salary and work only for tips. We took one only once so that we could get to harry potter a bit quicker. The lowest bill I had was $10, so that's what he got. I didn't want to ask him for change. I would have been comfortable givng him $5 since it was just me and my young son. If it was the 4 of us, I would have no problems giving him $10. Yes, self park was $15 a night. Hey it beats the $40 a night that most hotels in Chicago charge. It's an expensive hotel because it's very nice and has a great location. I found that this hotel completely blew Disney's Contemporary out of the water. And while expensive, it was still quite less than at Disney. This hotel is closer than the parking lot for the parks. You get free unlimited express passes for the parks. You get in an hour early to see Harry Potter. Keep all of that in mind when you think the hotel is too expensive. We had such a great time that we may be coming back next year for spring break. If we do, I will definitely be staying at the Hard Rock Hotel again.

Also on the trip were my in-laws.(2 parents, 3 kids 18, 16, and 11). The hotel is the closest LOEWS branded hotel to the two theme parks. Portofino is about a 10 minute further walk and Royal Pacific is across the highway, near Citywalk (there must be a walkway under to get to the theme parks). Hard Rock is a fun hotel, with rock music playing in all the common areas of the hotel and has a beautiful sandy beach pool, with full bar and food service at the pool area. If you are into rock and roll memorabilia, you won't be dissapointed. Preformers from all genre's, fromTwisted Sister to Elvis, have memorabilia hanging up everywhere in the hotel. We arrived early due to our flight and the hotel accomadated us right away, holding our luggage and letting us use the pool. The front desk took our cell phone number and got our room ready early for us and notified us right away when our room was ready. Our family stayed in the deluxe double queen with pull out couch. My son, age 14, slept on the pull out and he said it was comfortable.The mattress was memory foam, not the cheap, springy, thin fold up mattresses you normally find on a pull out sofa. The double queens were sufficient and the room was serviced everyday, with fresh towels and bed linens changed every third day, or on request. The room also had a nice flat screen TV and clean carpets. No wifi, which the hotel should consider adding since so many people travel with laptops now. Our only complaint about the room was the lack of hot water in the early morning (6-8am). After taking a cold shower 2 days in a row, I called the front desk and they sent someone right away to fix the problem. The maintenance man adjusted the handle on the shower. It didn't help much. We discovered if we let the water run for 5 minutes, it got hot and then we did not shut it off until everyone had showered. If you got it to get hot, it would stay hot indefinitely, we just felt bad wasting the water. The hotel did give us a free breakfast buffet to compensate us for our cold showers. This hotel is a great value if you add in the cost of the Express Pass. Without a doubt, no question, I would never visit Universal/Islands without the Express Pass. We could go on rides 3 or 4 times before people waiting in the general admission lines got on 1 time. If you purchase the Express Pass at the park and add it to your ticket (it costs around 60 dollars), you can only use it 1 time per ride. The hotel guests have UNLIMITED access to using the Express Pass. You show your room key to the attendant outside the ride, and presto, you go into a different line entirely, walking right past all the general admission ticket holders. At first, we actually felt guilty walking past the general admission people, (we got a lot of nasty looks) but we got over that quick, lol. A couple of tips if you are staying there. When you get there, take a cab or drive to the local Walmart (cab fare was 15 dollars with tip). I bought a disposable type styrofoam cooler, ( used ice from the hotel ice machine) a case of Dasani water and some beer, snacks for the kids and a loaf of bread and pb&j. We saved hundreds of dollars (I'm not kidding). The beer at the pool was 20 dollars for a 24 oz cup and waters in the room were 7 bucks a piece. OMG. That is my only complaint. Food and beverages are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced. Example, Emack and Bolios in the downstairs lobby serves a take away type breakfast. 2 bagels, 1 bottle of OJ and an egg sandwich was 28 dollars. Breakfast buffet (which is awesome) 4 adults, 6 kids, 178 dollars. Average lunch was 150 bucks. So packing a Universal Studios plastic bag with snacks, and ice and putting some beers and water in the bag when we were going to the pool really saved us $$, we were just careful not to get caught. The hotel seemed not to care of you brought any of that stuff to your rooms. All in all, our two families had an awesome time at the Hard Rock and we would stay there again. The hotel was fun for the kids, a party type atmosphere at the pool everyday, with games and a great water slide, and kids movies at night for night swimming.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Workers made the difference\u201d", "Author": "Deannev", "ReviewID": "UR98669468", "Content": "I stay at a lot of nice hotels and the Hard Rock had all of the amenities but the employees that worked there that made may stay, SUPER GREAT!

Priority seating at restaurants never was useful. Being able to charge to your room key is handy - especially when teens are on their own and need to purchase food. But watch out for limits as your cards get cut off if you exceed them. You need to work out limits with the front desk. Many restaurants in Citywalk give AAA discount so always ask.

It has a serious rock and roll feel and caters to the young adult crowd. While there were families here, I wouldn't bring my own children. Mostly because the hotel blares music in most of the hallways. The staff was attentive, quick and very nice. We checked in quickly, were given all the details needed and our rooms were clean on arrival. Any question we had was easily answered by the front desk. They took very good care of us. The on-site restaurants were great! My favorite was the Palm. It had incredible specials and great food. Our waiter was hilarious. I also enoyed the Kitchen, which was often bustling. Each time we ate there the foodwas great and the waiters were very attentive. The hotel's pool bar was fun as well. They had bar style food available and some serious drinks. Order a double and you'll be set for hours--but you'll see it leave your pocket, too. If I had to choose a down side to anything, I'd say most of the food and drinks were pricey. But, we were on vacation and had saved up extra cash so we didn't really mind. Though, I'd rather not spend $20 for a simple ceral breakfast again! Universal Studios was the main event for us, and it was FAB! Harry Potter World was AMAZING--make sure you get a butter beer. Staying \"on-site\" was even better because we got fast-passes for most rides. The longest we ever waited for a ride was probably 15 mins, something I'm so glad we paid for!

The hotel has its own arcade, the pool has a slide, and there is an adults only bar that is dimly lit and very nice. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived because we were very early but they called us with our room number within a half hour. Everyone behind the front desk is very friendly and knowledgeable and check-in was a breeze. If you are looking for a quiet getaway this is not the hotel for you. They are blasting music in the lobby and pool areas 24/7. It is definitely more of a party hotel. The hotel is conveniently located with just a short walk or water taxi ride over to Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios, and City Walk. I believe it is closer to the parks than both of the other hotels. Also it was completely worth it to stay there JUST for the hour early entry you get into Harry Potter World. It was a completely different experience being there without the crowd and walking right onto the ride in the castle as opposed to later in the day when it was packed full of rude pushy crowds. (Side note: The Forbidden Journey is AMAZING even though you will probably feel woozy by the end of it. Harry Potter World is the best part of the parks. Child like sense of wonder restored. Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice are DELICIOUS!) Also great was having the ability to go back to our room to rest for a few hours after getting worn out at the park and being able to return a little while later. Loved staying on site! The food at the hotel restaurants was absolutely delicious. We ate at the Palms which was pricey but they give you copious amounts of food for it, and The Kitchen which was our favorite. City Walk was fun and they have some Harry Potter goodies in the Universal store if you don't feel like waiting in line at the park, but the selection is a lot more limited. We also had the chance to see Patton Oswalt perform live on stage at the Hard Rock which was great. My only critique is that everything is really overpriced, so steer clear of the awesomely stocked but ridiculously expensive mini-bar. Our friends spent $50 for2 pool side drinks (though they were doubles). The first morning I had a yogurt and tea and my bf had an egg and cheese sandwich from the little marketplace downstairs and it was $20. We also ordered room service on our last morning and it was $50 for a belgian waffle, the american breakfast(eggs, bacon, potatoes, english muffin) and a pot of tea (with 22% gratuity automatically included) but the guy who delivered it was really sweet, as were all of the staff.

The hotel is large, well appointed, and full of rock and roll memorabilia. We especially enjoyed the close proximatey to both Universal Studio theme parks. We walked each morning to the parks and appreciated the early admittance that staying on property allowed us. We were able to ride the rides and see the attractions we wanted to before the park was open to the general public. The close proximatey to Universal and City Walk allowed us to do the parks in the morning and early afternoon, come back to the room for a rest, and then head back out for an evening trip to the parks and City Walk. It allowed us more time in the parks and a more pleasant, fun experience. We did not use the fitness center, there is a $12.00 per day/per person charge. This seemed excessive to us. I realize this probably keeps unattended children out of the workout area, but we refused to pay more for a workout. We also were surprised that the internet is still be charged for, still? really? Enough, people expect access to the internet and I don't think it should still be an extra charge. We enjoyed the Kerurig coffee maker - we have one at home and enjoyed having it on our vacation. We loved the great water pressure in the shower and the lemongrass scented toiletry items.

We loved the ambiance; however, if you don't want to be woken up by rock music at 9:00 AM, do not get a pool view room. The rooms were nicely decorated and the beds very comfortable. The lounge area has free WIFI and board games for the kids if you get bored (which is impossible considering you are at Universal Studios). The pool had a DJ everyday with a lot of really fun games. The pool was heated so swimming was part of the fun, even with the cooler temperatures outside. Overall, we would stay at the Hard Rock again - no doubt!

Islands of Adventure is about a 3 minute further walk. Also, the atmosphere is really \"cool\". There is rock 'n roll memoribilia everywhere. The rooms were laid out weirdly, with no overhead lights and no bedside tables (there was a big headboard that had a clock and 2 lamps on it). We had a \"kid's suite\", which was great for the kids, but they could have added a half bath for their room--4 people in a \"suite\", and only 1 bathroom? 1st night, there was music blaring from the room next door at 11 pm. I called the front desk, and security came up, and it turned out to be an alarm clock that went off improperly! (The loudness was due to the excellent sound system--usually a plus). 2nd night there was a live concert downstairs that filled the room until it ended at 11 pm or so--not a problem if you are a night owl. The shops and restaurants were excellent. Maid service was superb. Grounds were gorgeous. Oh, a warning for joggers. They handed me a 3.8 mile jogging route at the concierge desk. Although none of the following was mentioned in the description, it involved crossing a major road 4 times, going through several other road intersections, down an almost hidden staircase, and (I'm telling the truth) actually running IN THE ROAD for about 200 yards. I would put a \"recommend\" for this hotel because it was really beautiful, but there were just too many little problems, especially considering it's high price.

The weather, the location and the parks are just to much fun. VALUE: OK----you can rate this two ways: 1---Actual cost of the hotel room. YES, you can get cheaper rooms within walking distance of Universal. BUT, #2 is the value of the Universal Express Pass-----$179.99 at the gate, per person for Express Pass for 2-parks, per day. So, multiply that by EIGHT, and the VALUE of the Express Pass pays-for-the-room!!---now, that is Value in my eyes (WARNING---once you get the Express Pass option---you will NEVER stay off-property again----we can get thru Universal in 3 hours...all rides except Rock Rocket, and about 3 hours for I-O-A (excluding the Harry Potter mayhem). ROOMS: Due to our group of 8, I have to get two rooms. I had two Deluxe Queen Rooms, next to each other, on the 3rd floor. No door between, but next door. Rooms were HUGE, and for all the traffic thru these hotel rooms, the rooms are in fairly good shape. Nice bathrooms, Nice beds, sitting area/living room. Plenty of space. STAFF: Very accomodating and very friendly. WI-FI & Internet: OK----they nickel-and-dime you to death here....but, so do all resort type hotels in Orlando. WI-FI IS NOT FREE in the rooms....but, get over it. You don't come here to sit in your room and surf the internet. I am sitting on a big couch, right now, in the Velvet Lounge, with an adult beverage, fast internet. The huge lobby has all the teenagers Facebooking.....but, the internet is free in the Bar/Lounge...so, no kids here. BELL HOPS: Ob-nox-ious if you don't use them----they will guilt you into using them--and, then expect a huge tip. I mentioned it to the check-in staff and they agreed that other guests had complained in the past. RICKSHAW BIKES: More obnoxious than the bell hops. These vultures hang out at every pedestrian exit of the property, and \"guilt\" you into a ride (big/huge signs on bikes state that they receive no income and work for tips only)....so, they will hound you for cash. And, no matter what amount you provide....they will make you feel like you short-changed them. DO NOT use the rickshaws---Hard Rock is easy walking distance to the Theme Parks (really short distance). POOL: Outstanding!!! Just a fun place for everyone. Yes, kids everywhere----but, it is a Theme Park resort.....not an adults only resort. If you don't want kids everywhere, visit a Senior Citizen Center in Orlando. You can easily loose track of time in the pool area...with a bar, movies and water slide. Plus ping-pong and other games/events. FITNESS CENTER: I did not spend the money to utilize....instead, I jogged each day along the walking paths between Hard Rock, Portifino Hotel and City Walk. Well lit, and a fun run (and free). DOOR KEYs: Not only are the door keys used as express pass access, but you can put \"amounts\" on each card for your family members to spend. Kids love that option--makes them feel like a big-deal signing for food, beverages and other items. PARKING: NOT free. $15/day with in-n-out privileges. DINING: Breakfast is NOT included. But, Wendy's and McDonalds are withing 1 mile of the hotel. I made it from McDs and Wendys back to the hotel with hot food in under 15min and saved a-ton-of-money. Ate at \"The Kitchen\".....expensive ($175 for 8) and horrible service (just terrible......server could care less about our group....kept messing up the beverage orders EACH TIME he came to the table. Abandoned us for 15+min at a time.....just brutally horrible service).....but, great food. Ate at \"The Palm\"....very well known steakhouse......expensive ($150 for 2, with no bottle wine....just glass of wine each).....but exquisite steak and service. Overall, we will come back each year---forever---and stay here for our Annual Family Christmas Retreat. You cannot beat the value of the passes and the proximity of the property to the parks. It is just to convienent and fun. Be forewarned....the hotel was COMPLETELY BOOKED for the 3 days we were here.....I booked my room back in April for a December visit......and that was before the Potter mayhem.

This is our third time here in the last 4 years. Although the weather was brisk to say the least this was one of our best stays. We finally booked a club room for this trip. Our previous trip we included our two boys ages 12 and 10 and stayed in the regular rooms. The club rooms are nice but no different then the rooms on the floors below. The club amenities are great. It was nice to get a coffee or hot chocolate before heading to the parks. Also, coming back and grabbing a snack throughout the day. We may stay in a club room again with the boys however, it would need to be a package deal. Our boys may enjoy it more and it may seem like a better deal since they could fill up on some of the food and snacks there too. The hotel itself was of course great. They seem to be making the effort to increase customer service. I have never has so many conversations with staff while at any hotel. Everybody was kind and fun to talk too. I could really see a difference from the last time we stayed there and it did not come off like it was forced either. The beds were great and the rooms where are very well cleaned. My wife is a stickler for clean rooms and it passed her test each day. We ate at the Kitchen for breakfast when we first arrived and even though the buffet is expensive it still is cheaper then ordering individual meals. The pools were clean and we used them despite the weather. Especially the hot tub. My one concern is that there is a adult only hot tub but yet parents still allow kids into this area. What is up with that? There is a sign. Can you read it? It just bothers me when other ASSUME it will be OK for 6 younger kids to enter this area. The parks where great although dated. The grinch breakfast is a must. Great time, OK food, but the characters make up for it. The Macy's parade was nice and the Grinch show was very entertaining. Got to get on all the rides and the lines were minimal for all areas including Harry Potter. Cannot see waiting in line for any store or a wand for that matter. Did not waste our time. Frozen Butterbeer was great even though the temps in the morning was in the upper 30's. Getting into the parks an hour early was a plus since we were able to do that entire area in that hour. For the most part the parks were dead this time of year as they usually are. I was told that after the first weekend in December to a few days before Christmas the parks are quiet. The holiday village is a dissappointment. The parks were all decorated nicely but the dated rides and the unused space at Universal allows you to completely do both parks in one day. We had 4 days in the parks and started looking for things to do but that could have been since we had been there so many times prior and knew what we wanted to do and not do. Twister? really? That movie is older then my kids and not a very good one too. The parks need updating and quickly. Workers in Harry Potter did not enjoy me asking for Team Edward or Team Jacob apparel. I am not a big Harry Potter person. Bottom line is that the hotel is great, location is great and the parks are dated. If you get a chance to go to the City Walk, hit the Rising Star, karokee bar.

After a few nights at Disney World, we were happy to see that walking did not involve great distances or running for monorails or buses. The Hard Rock is perhaps the most concenient location of all the on-site hotels, as it literally sits next to the Universal Parks and City Walk. We booked a club level room, and while it was convenient to have drinks and snacks available to us, I wouldn't do it again. The whole set up was very basic with a limited collection of plastic chairs and tables, basic snacks and not a whole lot else. The staff, though cheerful and willing were not very good at actually assisting or particulalry knowledgeable about Univeral in general. Except for one request for a restaurant booking, the Club 7 staff referred us to the Front Desk, which sort of defeated the purpose. The rooms are lovely and good sized. Two double beds in our room with ample room for walking around, as well as an armchair and a large oval table and two chairs made for a comfortable stay. The room was clean and well-maintained. The bathroom, though nicely set up with a sink and vanity outside, and another sink, toilet, and tub/shower on the inside, it was awkward to close the door to the toliet area without stepping to one corner and performing a little dance to get to the tub without climbing over the toilet. Housekeeping was wonderful. They somehow knew when we were out of the room, cleaned and were long gone by the time we got back. One day we just relaxed in the room after a late night, and housekeeping was kind enough to look in on us before going home to see if we wanted more towels or anything else. The lovely large windows do not open in the room, which would have been nice for some freah air. Though the A/C did its job well, albeit a bit noisily at times. The internet was horrible. Bad enough you have to pay for it, but when it becomes intermittant and very slow, it is a problem. It is $10/day and really not worth the aggravation. There is a single computer available for guest use in the Club room, and it was always easy to take a few minutes to check email and reservations, etc. And even it was slow at times. The hotel itself was nicely maintained and lively with rock music playing in the public areas. It was always fun trying to \"name that song\" whenever in the elevators. Some have claimed the music is too loud and pervasive, though we did not find this to be so at all. The staff were ever-helpful and present, which made getting information and advice easy. We went to The Palms restaurant on site, and after hearing so much about it, thought that it was a bit over-hyped. We had dinner there one evening, and though the service was attentive and the menu diverse, the steaks themselves were quite mundane and nothing special at all. My filet mignon was nicely seasoned and well cooked, but a poor piece of meat. Period. And this was largely the case for the rest of our party. Sides are okay and plentiful, but nothing special (and we at additionaly cost) We went swimming at the pool and were not pleased. Too many people, not enough chairs and the pool area seemed a bit unkempt and sad. It did not help that the pool was overun by screaming and inconsiderate children. The pool is largely 3 feet deep in most places, with only one small area being around 5 feet -- which, you guessed it, was where they were holding kids games and donut eating contests. We went once and did not go back again. I cannot emphasize enough how good a location this hotel is. It is literally steps from the Universal parks via a nice walkway, or by boat. We were able to walk between both parks and Citywalk within just a few minutes. Do go and see the Blue Man show if you can -- it is fun for kids and adults alike. We also took advantage of the many movies showing at the Multiplex theatre, with a great $5 morning special for even new releases. There are plenty of restaurants to try also, including some fast food uptions. We walked over to the Portotino resort and walked around. It is nicely done, but quite spread out. We also went over to the Royal Pacific and enjoyed a lovely sushi dinner there. It's a nice hotel, but also with a shallow pool. (they don't encourage guests from one hotel to swim in the other hotel pools, but we had to go and have a look to see if there were other options) All in all, a good stay. and we were able to see and do just about all Univeral had to offer. The parks are not as extensive as Disney, and that was fine for us. If there were not other things to do in the immediate area, after 3 days of parks we would have been bored. And we also wondered why a large percentage of Universal's rides include having water thrown at you. There was hardly a ride or show that water was not a factor.

The king-size bed was extremely comfortable, and the roll-aways were the best I've ever seen - as comfortable as real beds. When we arrived, the shower stall door stuck a little and had to be pulled hard to open - it was fixed the next day without our even asking. We ate our breakfasts and two dinners at The Kitchen. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied - a good value. Dinner entrees ranged from okay to very good. The large pool with sand border (I wouldn't quite call it a beach) is beautiful, and the kids absolutely loved the water slide, which is as good as one you might find in a water park. We didn't find the rock soundtrack in the hotel's common areas to be overly loud or annoying, and the decor was surprisingly not cheesy. The convenience of being so near the Universal parks and City Walk was wonderful, as were the water taxis, which we took if one happened to be loading when we walked out. But the walk was so nice, and the landscaping of the grounds was so pretty, that we enjoyed walking even more. The main purpose of our visit was to see The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and that's where staying on site really helped the most - we got into the park one hour before it opened to the general public. This was end of Oct/beginning of Nov, so crowds were much lighter than during the summer, but even so, by midday the lines were long.

The hotel was beautiful, the staff was always courteous and very helpful with any questions I had, and all of the rock memorabilia was fun to look over. One of the reasons we choose the Hard Rock over the other two Universal hotels was the pool and it was everything I had hoped for -- warm water, sand \"beach\", and prompt poolside service (the onion rings are amazing!). The rooms were plenty big for a family of four and the bathroom had two sinks (one inside with the tub and toilet and a larger one between the bedroom and the bathroom) which was a big bonus. The park was a very short walk and we never had to wait more than five minutes to ride the boat over to CityWalk. Granted, parking is not cheap (around $15 per day), but I am used to that with all the business travel that I do. The only thing I would say could use improvement was the wireless service. You do have to pay for wireless in the rooms (free in public areas), but the signal usually was too weak to be useful. You can confirm your flight and print your plane tickets for free in the business center so who really needs a computer anyway?

As everyone mentions, the Express Pass for the park (your room key) is such a huge benefit. We went in October when the park was less crowed and really did just walk up to the rides without waiting. Unfortunately, for some of the rides I wanted a little bit more time to change my mind, but I was shown to my seat before I could chicken out! We did not take advantage of the early entry to the park, but I could see that being quite valuable in the busy seasons. Our main reason for going to Orlando was to visit the Wizarding World and it was fantastic! I would have loved to have more than the 2 1/2 days we spent in the park to explore and really take in all the little details that are everywhere to discover. Ollivanders was well worth the wait and make sure you take time to really appreciate Hogwarts and all the details that I noticed most people were racing past to get on the ride. One other thing that we really enjoyed about the Hard Rock was being able to go to the other Universal hotels and tying out their pools! The Hard Rock pool was open until 11 PM every night we were there so we had plenty of time to relax and enjoy it after walking around the park for so long. Overall, we were very pleased with the Hard Rock and have recommended it to our friends. We are looking forward to our return visit!", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suwanee,GA", "Title": "\u201cWe love this place!\u201d", "Author": "familytraveler38", "ReviewID": "UR86217018", "Content": "Our family of 4 have stayed at the HRH the past two summers, 2009 and 2010. The first time in 2009, was our first visit to Universal Studios Orlando, after having always been exclusively, devoted Disney followers. Although we find the hotel pricey, we thoroughly enjoy our stays here. The pool is our kids' favorite pool I think anywhere we've ever stayed, and there have been several amazing ones for them to pick from. I think what we love about the pool is it is appealing to both the kids and the adults. There is always daily pool games for the kids, and often bands that play in the evenings. The pool has a sand beach on one side and concrete on the other for those that don't want to deal with the sand. There is a great water slide, and volleyball court adjacent to the pool. The hotel is beautiful! It is big, but easy to navigate. We've ironically never eaten in the restaurants inside the hotel, but always use the poolside restaurant and Emack and Bolio's Ice Cream Parlor. Rooms are great- big, well decorated, nice bathroom, nice shampoos, and great individual packet capsule coffee maker. Beds really comfortable. We love all the rock memorabilia throughout the lobby and public spaces- there are tons of celebrity costumes and clothing- Kiss, Elton John, Elvis. Best part of the hotel? Hands down is the short walk to the two Universal Theme parks. That is why we originally stayed here and also why we came back and will be revisiting again this coming summer. Negatives- charge per day if you want a mini frig. The first time we stayed in 2009, it was complimentary- they sent one to our room free of charge when we requested it. This past year, there was a charge, and I want to say it was $25 for the stay. Instead I made room in the minibar and added a few things, even though the sign said not to disturb the items or you would be charged. Daily parking charges, which always get me angry at any hotel, though my husband says I need to just pipe down about that! :LOL! Positives- FOTL pass at the parks, the close walk, and the pool!

We got two adjoining pool view rooms for our family of five. Normally I wouldn't pay for the view of the pool but that is all they had left. We got The Hard Rock All access card and promptly forgot to use it, but could have saved at least 100 during the length of our stay (3 days). We did show it at check in and they tried to upgrade us to a King Suite but they were unable to find another room within close proximity for my kids so we didn't take it. There were laundry facilities on our floor ($2.75 for each) which we could have used to dry our clothes after getting soaked on some of the wetter rides. There is a clothesline in the bathroom, as well as small sinks within each WC and a vanity and sink area outside of each bathroom. This worked well for our family, but having two bathrooms was worth paying for two rooms. The lobby and pool are LOUD! My family enjoyed it but if you don't like loud music you may want to stay elsewhere. You cannot escape it within the hotel or at the pool. The kid activities at the pool were great for my 10 and 13 year old girls but my 14 year old son did not participate. He had a great time swimming and going down the slide. We ate at the Kitchen once for dinner. The food was good and the waiter was fabulous. He made my kids feel like celebrities. Homer and Bart Simpson were wandering around and went to each table and posed for pictures. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. The Universal rep at the Hard Rock (next to the concierge) made us reservations for the breakfast at the Three Broomsticks . You can't make these reservations before you arrive and you must pay for them when you make them, Apparently there are only a few available because they are supposed to be part of a special Harry Potter package, but we didn't have any problem.. We had an 8:30 reservation and were able to ride several rides before we ate (wich was probably just as well for our stomachs!). The other days we ate cereal that I brought and supplemented with fruit and muffins from the small convenience area inside Emack and Bolios in the hotel. There was complimentary coffee in the rooms. The park was practically empty except for the WWOHP. We had no waits for any rides at IOA except the Harry ones and getting there at 8 am before the park officially opened meant that we encountered no waits there as well (except for Olivanders). Waits for the rides at US were longer but the express pass meant that we simply walked on. No waiting! It allowed us to go on whatever we wanted then allowed us to have several hours at the pool each day. Something we could not have done if we had to wait for each ride. The proximity of the hotel to the parks is great. We never waited for the boat. We took a rickshaw once (the kids loved this). We scheduled Mears transportation to take us from the airport to the hotel and back again. They offer a shuttle or a private SUV. The private was cheaper for 5 ($111.11). It was well worth it. We had a 4 hour delay in our arrival and they were there waiting for us when we arrived. The car was new and spotless.

The hotel is fab, it was a real treat from beginning to end. Here are a few tips: If you are planning to eat in the \"Kitchen\" then buy a Hard Rock all access card from the shop in reception. It costs $25 but they add $10 to it right away and it also gives you 10% of your bill in the restaurant, so it pays for itself within one family meal. The card will give you priority seating at any restaurant in Universal, room upgrades and late check out, if available, well worth it. Also if you are planning to drink at the pool, then get a souvenir glass and you save $4 on further drinks. The room card is a fast pass for most rides in Universal, which was a fantastic bonus, we never had to queue for a ride the whole week.

We booked a pool view room, and while it was very nice, I don't think it was necessarily worth the extra money. If you manage to get a special deal, then go for it, but the view wasn't great - in fact the window took up less than half the wall - even though the curtain covered the length of the entire wall (giving the impression when you first arrive that the window is huge). The room was a good size, with plenty of room, and 2 queen size beds. The bathroom was quite old and dated, but that's something we've found with a lot of US hotels... The service at check in was great and the concierge helped out with tickets to Universal Studios (bear in mind though, that you can't purchase tickets to any of the Disney parks there). Universal Studios was amazing, and the location of the Hard Rock to these parks is unbeatable. The shuttle boat was great, but it's only a 5 minute walk, if you don't time your arrival at the dock with the boat. The best thing about staying at the Hard Rock is the Fast/Express pass you have on 90% of the rides at the two parks. This saves so much time, it's difficult to calculate just how much. There were rides that had 100s of people in line, with a listed wait of 50 minutes, yet we were able to literally walk straight on without waiting at all - simply by showing our room cards. If you go with a family, it is definitely worth the extra money of staying at the Hard Rock, just for the feature of not having to wait. Although this fast access doesn't apply to the Harry Potter attractions, guests are allowed into the park at 8am, before the general public, so there's not much of a wait anyway - and even though we're not Harry Potter fans, it's worth the wait! The facilities at the Hard Rock are of an extremely high standard - the restaurants are fabulous, the pool was lovely and the service was great. Because we didn't waste time waiting in queues at the parks, we were able to spend a lot of time in the afternoons lazing by the pool, with a few drinks from the bar (you don't have to leave your lounge - the staff are constantly wandering around, asking if you want/need anything). The pool was great - music playing underwater, waterslide and movies played every night. Although there have been other comments about the lack of a 7/11 or convenience stores nearby, you can purchase small items from either the Hard Rock shop or the ice cream parlour downstairs - and the prices really aren't bad. The proximity to the restaurants and bars at the Universal area was also fantastic - so many choices and great options. And the atmosphere there was great - safe and fun for families of all ages. Also, be aware that if you don't have a hire car, it costs over $50 one way to the Disney parks, and you may have a loooong wait at the airport to get a taxi to the hotel. We arrived on a flight from Miami, which was only 35 minutes in duration, yet we waited for a taxi for an hour. We travel a lot, for both business and personal trips, and we've NEVER arrived at an airport where there isn't a mass of taxis waiting to collect passengers. There were only 10 people in the line in front of us, yet it took an hour for us to get a taxi - not good enough for a city that relies so heavily on tourism. The shuttle bus wasn't much better - 15 min wait to buy a ticket, with at least a 40 minute wait for an available bus.

We never had to eat anywhere else. Royal Pacific had a great breakfeast, but the nighttime food was questionable. Had creative looking asian \"casseroles\" that our kids wouldn't touch. Cookies and milk at night. Hard Rock had lower quality breakfeast, and nighttime food was little more than chicken wings, egg rolls, or chicken dumplings. Cookies and milk at night. Hard Rock was way overcrowded, and we always had to wait in line. CLUB LEVEL ROOM: Our favorite was the Royal Pacific. Was never crowded or loud, and we used it much like a living room. Wej ust hung out in there reading..internet surfing, or watching the big screen tvs. It was really an extention of your hotel room. Portifino's club room was large, but a litte sterile. Hard Rock's club room was way too small, always crowded, and music was too loud to do anything but eat..

A good variety of restuarants but nothing is cheap. A great meal can be had at The Palm, but this is very very expensive (compared with other Orlando restuarants), so great for a special occasion.

The room was great. Clean, pretty big, and it had a sofa for our son to sleep on. It was also my first exposure to Keurig coffee makers, and led me to buy one a few months later. The best in-room coffee I've ever had. We shoved a few things into the mini-bar, which was against the rules, but oh well. the beds were very comfy, and the theme was great in general. We would laugh everytime we passed the N-Sync outfits in the Hard Rock Hotel. The pool is very large, with a great, long slide. Walk to the Studios park is only about 5 minutes. It would be about 1 if you could walk out the back of the pool area. There isn't much of an arcade, food options, or convenience store like the Disney resorts have with their food courts.

The hotel\u2019s excellent position for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure cannot be overstated, nor the value of room keys doubling as fast passes (the two boys managed to ride Hulk \u2013 twice - whilst we waited 25 minutes for a table at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9!). There were however two rides that could not be fast passed (Harry Potter and Rip Ride Rocket) and I would like to think that this significant benefit will not be diluted further as new rides open. Daily car park charge of almost $20 also borders on larceny for hotel residents!

(3 children, 2 adults) who decided to spend 4 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel Universal Orlando in order to go to Wizarding World of Harry Potter Universal Islands of Adventure. I knew that we needed a suite and that theme park hotels in Orlando are CRAZY expensive ... so i was prepared to pay top dollar. We chose Hard Rock because of its location. It is a 10 minute walk down a beautiful, garden path behind the hotel to the front gate at Universal Studios OR there are constantly running boat taxis (5 minute drive) to Universal Studios/Universal City Walk area). I have been to a few other Hard Rock Hotels before and they are slightly worn & tacky. This one is BEAUTIFUL! A true 4 to 5 star hotel from the exterior facade to the interior lobby to the restaurants, pool area, etc..... Check in was a breeze .... less than 10 minutes. We took the elevator up to the 5th floor and opened the door to our lovely room. We had a Kid's Suite. This consisted of a foyer, then a very large bathroom with separate tub & shower with double sink, then a very large (probabably 18 x 22 ft) living area with a king size bed, fold out couch, dresser & large flat screen TV. Connected to this room was another large bedroom with 2 twin beds, dresser with a flat screen TV & a small kid's dining table with 4 chairs. I think my only 'beef' would be that there is no room for a dining table in the main living room area .... and that presents a bit of a problem when you get room service as you have to sit on the bed or couch to eat. They do kind of nickel and dime you to death a bit ... My youngest (7 years) wanted to stay in the bedroom with her two siblings and so we asked for a roll away bed to be brought up (instead of her sleeping on the pull out couch in our sleeping area) .... We were told that the roll away bed would be $25/a day to rent .... I WAS FLABBERGASTED to say the least. For the amount of money being paid at this hotel per night .... that was ridiculous to me.

The Hotel is prestine, and beautifully designed as are the grounds which are very well maintained. The rooms are larger than the average room and decorated with memoribila of rock legeds ie The Beatles.The Pool is stunning and has everything from underwater music, a water slide, a fully serviced outside bar/ reastaurant with waiter service to your lounger so you never have to leave.

This is one of three hotels at Universal they are owned by Leows all of them themed and in my opinion prob some of the very best in Orlando believe me I have stayed in many. For those who think its in the pricier bracket but would love to stay heres a tip on a 2 week family vacation with the family it could cost a small fortune as my family has grown its become less affordable, but if you happen to find a more reasonable place to stay you could treat yourself and stay 1 or 2 nights here ie at the end of your stay and get full use out of the parks with the room key acting as your fast pass on those days. My only negative would be car parking charges or valet as you can have either but there is no free parking remember to factor that in when planning. But you don't always need to use your car as the hotel has a boat dock where you can travel free to and from city walk and The Universal Parks.

Originally we booked a rental car for the whole week, but later decided we would just use the water taxis at the resort. Overall, this felt like a resort. Our trip was for one full week, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The positive thing about this hotel is that everyone was really friendly. We got there at noon, but the rooms were not going to be ready until 3, which I knew from the website. No biggie, they immediately printed out our room keys which are also used as express passes for the theme parks, and they stored our bags until our room was ready. Once in our room, it was really clean, the maids were nice, and the other families at the hotel were all friendly and personable. I went to the pool on two separate occasions and found it to be really full (of course, it's the first week of July), but not overrun with too many unsupervised kids, or rowdy drunk adults. The pool had music playing, there is a cool waterslide, and ping pong tables. For an additional fee you can rent a cabana that has a flat screen TV, but it was just me, so I didn't need that. I read on another review that they thought the pool was dirty, but keep in mind that it did rain briefly every day I was there, so of course, there were some leaves and branches down, but not for long. At night they were showing Harry Potter movies at the pool, which was really cool. Also, the beds were so comfortable. They have down pillows and blanket, which was heavenly, especially after all the walking at the parks. Also, there is a clothes line in the shower that allows you to pull out and put back on your own. After swimming, I was able to rinse the chlorine off my suite and hand dry it before packing it away. Here are the negative things I do have to say. First off, the store on the pool level has coffee, drinks, ice cream and other goodies, but believes me, they are expensive. I bought 2 16 oz diet cokes, 3 snack size bags of chips, and a16 oz. bottled water and it was $16.50. This would cost you no more than $5.00 at any other store. There are mini fridges in the room with snacks, but if you eat from that, they will charge you. Fiji water in the room will cost you $7.00. The other negative thing is that we decided against the rental car because the website says that it is a $15.00 per night charge to park. When we got there, they have a sign posted that it is $22.00 a night. That is ridiculous. They also charged a little over $20.00 for a 3 day pass to use the gym. Overall, I do think that these things should be included in the price of paying for your hotel stay. I really feel like they are squeezing every dime they can out of their guests. My advice if you are going to use the gym, bring your sports bottle from the theme park and fill it up as many times as you would like. The gym offers free (imagine that) ice water with lemon, and also has fresh fruit. Also, take a few pieces of fruit back to your room for later. A few days at a theme park makes you crave a nice banana and apple. I did decide to rent a car for one day, which was very easy to do. The Hertz car rental has a station set up right at the front desk. We rented the car and got away for the day, but we also stopped by Wal-Mart up the street and stocked up on Gatorades, water, and other snacks for the room. We just couldn't afford to stay hydrated at these hotels prices. Bottom line, I saved for this trip, and I knew what we were in for. If you are coming to the resort for a family vacation, just be prepared, and know that you are going to be paying more than you would at your average place, but then again, it is also a lot more fun than staying at home.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cE coli food poisoning\u201d", "Author": "jcook3", "ReviewID": "UR70539318", "Content": "As if paying $11 for a mixed drink, $13/day for parking, and having to listen to horrible bands at the pool wasn't terrible enough, add food poisoning.

Got a great deal on rooms by booking early (last November for this June & updated in Feb when prices of rooms went down). Value can't be surpassed. Room price includes fast passes for rides which saves so much time. This hotel is the closest to the park of the 3 Loews Universal hotels & the parks are easily reached by walking, water shuttle, bus shuttle, or even Rickshaws. No refrig in room but had driver stop at 7-11 on way to hotel & bought a case of water & snacks. Filled our ice bucket w/ice every night & loaded waters to have them cold for am. Food can be pricey in hotel but brought our own individual cereals for a couple mornings. Got them at 10 for $10 before traveling there. In the hotel they were like $3 or $4 each. So we just had to get milk from downstairs which wasn't cheap. A small (for 1) 2% milk + an even smaller skim individual was $4.50 - so that gives you some idea. But coffee maker in room is one of the pod ones that makes great coffee & is compliementary so make that rather than paying $3 for a cup downstairs. Staff couldn't have been nicer. Once when maid service didn't replace shampoos, they brought some up within 15 mins after we called. Have the newspaper delivered to your room complimentary too - just ask at desk. They will also print your boarding passes for you the day before complimentary which is great. Bought my park tickets online with the \"will call kiosk\" and found they had it right in the lobby so was able to swipe my credit card and get my tix right there. Day we left, they let you use their workout room for lockers, showers, etc. and keep your luggage at desk. This was great as we had a 6:00pm flight home so were able to spend the whole day at their great pool.

Staff were very polite and accomodating. Pool is nice, a bit on the \"shallow side\" no deeper than 4 feet which is good for the kids. Water slide at the pool is fun too. There was a DJ there who also got the crowd to play games and have contests. The room was a bit smaller than I had hoped. We had just a standard garden view, but it was clean and adequate. Maid service was excellent as room was always made up by the time we got back from the parks in the evening. Carpet in the hallways(at least on the 5th floor) seemed a bit worn and the laundry room was a bit unkept, but I guess that is being nit-picky. The express pass to bypass the lines at the parks was great! I felt like I was getting away with something just walking onto the rides or maybe waiting 10 minutes at most. Unfortunately they can't be used for Harry Potter's Forbidden Journey (Islands of Adventure) and the newest roller coaster (Universal Studios). We did take advantage of going to the park 1 hour early for hotel guests before the public is admitted. We waited for the Harry Potter ride maybe 5 to 10 minutes at most and rode it 3 times before 8:20am. That alone was worth the price of the hotel as I had heard horror stories of people waiting hours for the ride. One side note about the Harry Potter section of Islands of Adventure. If you are looking to get your kids into Ollivander's Wand shop, think twice. My kids really wanted wands and to have the \"experience\" of the wand choosing them. When we found the wand shop the line was 1 hour and 40 minutes long. The employee at the end of the line told us that only 20 people are admitted at a time and only 1 of the 20 get chosen for the \"wand experience\". Needless to say, we didn't do it. My kids were a bit disappointed but they moved on. I think maybe Universal could have come up with a better way to do that so that everyone gets a chance. Anyway, back on subject of the hotel. It was very cool with alot of rock and roll memorabelia, clean, great staff etc .....a bit pricey but as I said, that was worth it to bypass the lines and ride the Harry Potter ride so quickly. My only complaint is the $15 a day plus tax to park your car.

The fact that your room key acts as a front of line pass is also fantastic, we didn't queue for anything except Rip Ride Rocket which you can't use the Express Pass on. Word or warning though, don't buy your water in the the shop on the ground floor. We picked up 2 bottles of water and the total was over $9. We got a 24 pack in Walgreens for $3.

Chose to visit only the Universal Parks as well as Seaworld and Aquatica, which meant no transportation/taxis required as there is a free shuttle bus to Seaworld/Wet n' Wild/Aquatica daily. Note - book this the day before at the Attraction Tickets desk, we saw several people turned away, and be careful as it leaves very promptly. Easy check in, given a free Backstage Pass that was used for free gym access. Room on the 6th floor at the very end of the corridor as requested for maximum quietness. Room fresh and spotlessly clean with lovely view out over the garden, and very quiet, we heard no noise from other rooms or the corridor the entire stay (6135). Spent the first evening at Islands of Adventure on all our favourite rides again - can't miss Hulk, Spiderman, Dudley Do Right, JP, Bilge-Rat Barges, Fire & Ice. Next two days spent at Un. Studios, then at Islands again. Thoroughly recommend Rip Ride Rockit, the Mummy, Simpsons for the more adventurous, as well as the Horror Make Up show for a real laugh and breather from the heat. Breakfasts either in the kitchen - go for the buffet if you are having juice and coffee anyway, or a muffin and banana from the coffee shop. Room coffee machines very nice too. I also recommend the Kitchen for evening meals, but don't fill up on the delicious cheesy bread because the portions are enormous. Incredibly friendly wait staff, especially Emily. Never ate at the beach club, although one lazy afternoon lying by the pool I watched a parade of enormous looking dishes and frozen drinks going past. Pool wait service is also really friendly. Watch out for the Hurricane cocktails, they are lethal. Evenings spent with cocktails, wrapped up in warm towels watching a dive in movie always fun. Didn't go in the pool or hot tubs this time, but remember them being great. Free boat service to City Walk prompt and friendly as ever, but no longer between hotels, only direct to City Walk and back so any trips over to the Portofino (recommend eating at Mama Della's) or the Royal Pacific require a bike taxi or a City Walk stop off. If you get a chance ask the concierge for a guide to all the rock/pop memorabilia in the hotel, they can provide you with a print out that shows the location and histoy of everything. Would absolutely recommend this hotel for anybody wanting to visit Universal Studios or Seaworld, the front of line access is invaluable, and means you can ride several times in a row quickly. The only main rides not currently accepting this are the Rip Ride Rocket and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and I recommend using the single riders queue for both of these to get on 10 times faster. There is no better feeling than racing past the normal queue.

We did get connecting rooms but I called several months in advance to request them when I made the reservation. I was told that the best bet for connecting rooms is to ask for both rooms with 2 queens. For breakfast it was pretty standard continental breakfast- bagels, rolls, fruit, etc. The evening cocktail time was GREAT with hot appetizers and beer and wine. One night we had Mexican theme with nachos and southwest egg rolls as well as veggies, salad and cheese plates. The next night was American night with really good chicken wings (add your own sauce so they were kid friendly) and mini corn dogs. They have a sign that says 2 drinks per person but we found out that meant for each time you visit the bar - you can drink all that you like. Honestly we ate our dinner in the lounge each night. The hotel has a great pool and is so close to walk to the parks. Also, if you stay here you get Express passes with your room charge to bypass the ride lines. The week we stayed, the new Harry Potter was not open to the general public- but as guests at Hard Rock we got to experience the area (and it was awesome!!)

We did have a few little grumbles during our stay but these were sorted out to our satisfaction although perhaps they could have been avoided. We arrived at the Hotel by coach and as a result, we were dropped off at the side by the valet car parking area which is some distance from the main reception. It was a bit of a struggle and we were disappointed that when we reached the entrance, none of the bell staff appeared to have the slightest interest in offering us any assistance! Check-in itself however was an absolute breeze. We were dealt with extremely efficiently by a very professional agent who supplied us with all the relevant information about the Hotel and genuinely appeared only too happy to answer the many questions I posed. Usually check in staff at Hotels are like robots and see customers as an inconvenience so his approach was really refreshing and very much appreciated. We made the way to our room which was on the 5th floor and sadly we had been allocated a room which was at the furthest point from the elevator which was annoying so in retrospect, I wish I had approached the disinterested bell staff!! The room itself was nice- being clean and comfortable with nice furnishings and fittings. It contained a flatscreen tv (with a wide choice of channels and pay movies), a cd player, a clock radio with i-phone dock, mini bar, safe (which was very small!), iron and board, and a nice bath with shower and separate sinks with a wide range of toiletries. As is the norm, we were supplied with the usual 5 hangers for 2 people for a weeks stay so we took the opportunity of asking a nearby housekeeper for more hangers. Unfortunately she spoke very limited english and summoned a friend who spoke even less english than she did. Another housekeeper was then called and after appearing to understand our request, knocked on our door 5 minutes later and told us to ring Housekeeping for the extra hangers which really was annoying and frustrating. We made the call and were brought an extra 6 hangers about 20 minutes later by the same person we had asked initially!!! We then had a look round the Hotel and were really impressed with all the services on offer. The pool area was really elegant with a wide range of areas to sit and relax which were spotlessly clean and inviting. It is sad that we spent such little time at the Hotel so did not use any of these excellent facilities. Whilst at the Hotel, we utilised the concierge on numerous occasions which on the whole was excellent although a couple of the staff appeared a little disinterested. A special mention to John however who was a consumate professional - an expert in his field who gave us loads of help and assistance and was dedicated to ensuring we got the most out of our stay in Orlando. We really liked Universal and the fast pass entrance with our room key to most of the rides was great although the parks were not really that busy. The river taxi from the Hotel was enjoyable as was the walk through the gardens to the parks. Again, with our busy schedule, we only spent one day at Universal/Islands of Adventure so in future we may opt to choose a Disney Resort Hotel purely because we spent the remaining time at the Disney attractions. On one particular day, we left the Hotel at 7am and returned at 11.30pm to find that our room had not been serviced at all which was very annoying and just not good enough. We rang Housekeeping and were advised that someone would service the room. In the interim, we waited in the reception area as we were both really tired after such a long day! I approached reception to make a formal complaint and whilst my concerns were dealt with, the guy who was dealing with it seemed very \"un-phased\" about it - almost like it was a regular thing. I told him I was still not satisfied and he gave me 2 vouchers for a free breakfast buffet which was appreciated but I felt they were only given as a last resort. When we returned to the room it had been \"serviced\" but to a very poor standard. The bins had not been emptied and the room was untidy and dusty but on reflection, speed was probably the key to addressing the problem. Whilst on the subject of housekeeping, I left notes regarding the broken lock on the minibar, the bulb on the bedside light needing replacement and the water being lukewarm most of the time but they were just ignored which again was disappointing. We were also frustrated that the mini-bar was only serviced once throughout our entire stay despite us requesting it! I suppose this is a good thing really as the price of all mini-bar items is rather excessive! The following morning was another early start so I took the opportunity of asking at reception for someone to check the room was serviced. The lady was very professional being sincerely apologetic for the inconvenience and genuinely concerned that the event had even occurred. It is worth mentioning that most of the staff are relatively young and one wonders how equipped they are in terms of experience/maturity to deal with any serious compalints! We ate dinner at the Hotel's restaurant \"The Kitchen\" which was good although nothing outstanding. The food itself was good and the service was reasonable although sometimes we feel that staff think the Brits do not know how to tip and as a result give a second rate service. This however was not true at \"The Palm\" restaurant were the service was absolutely outstanding and totally first class. Although the service was superb, we were not overly impressed with the food on this occasion which we thought was over-priced and nothing special. The complimentary breakfast we received (at \"The Kitchen\") was really nice and the service too was excellent - it is sad that we only chose to take breakfast on our last day as we may have considered taking breakfast every day had we known how good it was. On leaving the Hotel, the checkout process was very efficient and highly professional. On balance the Hotel was very good although there were a few frustrations along the way that with a little more attention to detail could be rectified with great ease. I would definitely recommend this Hotel although if you intend to do all the Disney parks, it is quite a distance away and in my opinion Downtown Disney has much more to offer than Universal's City Walk.

However, there was a layer of dust on the furniture in our room on arrival and I can't say we were over impressed with room service throughout our stay. A caricature picture my daughter had specially drawn somehow managed to get all screwed up by maid service. The other feature of this hotel is its great proximity to the Universal theme parks and the fact that you get fast track access at Universal which is a great perk and a real must if you go in the school holidays. This will spoil you though when you venture to Disney and beware Universal is some way from Disney - if you don't hire a car (we didn't) then it's a $40 cab ride each way. There is a boat that takes you to Universal from the hotel grounds although you can also walk it in around 5 minutes as well. The only negative aspects of this hotel in our opinion are breakfast is quite pricey for a family of 5 (great selection mind you) and our 15 year old was granted adult status here (always amazes me that kids can't vote, drink etc but they are classed as adults by travel companies//hotels from around the age of 11!) and the concierge obviously has an agreement with the cab firms as when we asked how to get somewhere via the Lynx bus we were given the most awkward route possible, probably in the hope that we wouldn't use the bus again. The hotel also operates a shuttle service bus (once daily and you need to get in quickly as it only holds 70 people) to Seaworld, Aquatica and Wet N Wild which we used regularly. The last thing to mention is that Americans do frequent the hotel at weekends and most come for special occasions like birthdays, hen and stag parties and we were all kept awake one Saturday night by a particularly raucous bunch.

I didn't find the staff as helpful, attentive or friendly this time around.

The breakfast buffet in the Kitchen seems to have dramatically increased in price, yet the quality of the food wasn't as good, tasted like it was reheated. Dinner in the Kitchen was average at best. Room service food same. Things are ridiculously expensive. Bottle of water in your room $7 + tax!! Parking fees ridiculous! Beside all that - the location is perfect, the pool scene is superb.

One day the room was cleaned around 5 PM and the next day it was cleaned at noon., This sort of thing does not bother us though and we ended up having to ask for towels on the day they cleaned it late. To me it was no big deal. The hotel is a short walk to Universal Studios 2 theme parks and City Walk. The pool and sandy beach area are great. We ate the breakfast buffet at the Kitchen only once, as it was very expensive. We enjoyed Emack and Bolio's ice cream a couple of the days. I liked that the gift shop opened early and remained open until late at night so we could purchase water and snacks. The food is very expensive at the hotel as it is in the parks. We ended up spending over the budgeted vacation amount due to this expense. The hotel lobby played rock music all day and night. Our room was very close to the lobby and we couldn't hear the music.

Breakfast was expensive and not brilliant so maybe try it out one day and go elsewhere for the rest of your stay.

The Velvet bar in the hotel was also a great place to chill, must say that on first night the hotel was holding it's monthly rock concert (velvet sessions) and we weren't allowed to enter the bar, had a bit of a moan to the manager and was lead straight in. We were really grateful and must say thank you to the desk manager (didn't get her name) for sorting this out for us. The hotel is part of the Universal complex and you can simply walk to the parks in 5 minutes and also to the City Walk nightlife area. The parks were surprisingly dated, particularly the original park. They were quite empty so didn't have to queue for the rides which was a massive bonus. I also think it's about time to change the Jaws boat ride, it is rubbish! Went to Emerils one evening, a supposed decent restaurant in City Walk, we had the tasting menu, it was overpriced and not very good. Go to Hard Rock Cafe instead, much better value for money. The hotel's fantastic location to Universal means its location to Disney isn't great and as we weren't driving didn't bother going this time, hopefully will get back soon. We did go to Sea World, again quite empty so didn't have to queue for the two fantastic roller coasters, two of my favourite in Orlando. Obviously went to see Shamu, so hearing the shocking news of the death of Dawn Brancheau was awful. We saw her in the show just two weeks ago. I'm sure the show will go on though. Whether you agree with holding these truly magnificent animals in captivity, or not, it is very special to just get the chance to see them. Also went to Busch gardens. An organised coach picked us up at Unversal and it took about 1.5 hours to get there. Once again, it was quiet so no queues. The tigers were a highlight as was the ride called Sheikra. If you like shopping there's a fantastic outlet called Orlando Premium Outlets, the last stop on the I-Drive trolley bus, got loads of stuff from Diesel, Levi, Armani and DKNY with a 75% reduction.

It's not very deep, but deep enough to cool off. When my kids were younger they loved the slide and playing in the sand. ( My kids are 12 and 16 now, but we started going to Hard Rock when they were little.) Our favorite part about this hotel is it's location to Universal Studios and Island's of Adventure. It is about a five minute walk to Universal Studios and Island's of Adventure is about another three minutes away. If you don't feel like walking, you can take the ferry to City Walk. The dock at City Walk is about a two minute walk to each park. We also LOVE the \"Express Pass\" to rides and shows using your room key. We would not go to Universal Studios or Island's of Adventure if we weren't staying at one of the three Universal hotels. We have stayed at all three but we like Hard Rock the best. (But all three of them are nice!) We don't like waiting in lines, so the Express Pass with your room key is great!!

When we arrived, our check in was smooth and easy as well as friendly. We booked a room on the 7th floor which was well worth the extra money. I do admit the room was not a huge room and the bathrooms are small but the private lounge had all the extras we were looking for. The morning breakfast had your basic wants. Fresh fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, toast, bagels, yogurt, muffins and cinnamon rolls. There was a nice varity of all, and coffee, milk, apple juice, and OJ for your morning meal! In the afternoon they have bottled water, coke products, granola bars, chips, and fruit to satisfy your afternoon snack. During the evening 5-7 pm they have the above beverages plus wine and many different varietys of beer for your pleasure. The appetizers were also very good (1st time around) we figured they had a rotation of 3-4 different menus. Texas theme, mexican theme, chinese theme, and american theme. They always had fresh vegtable tray and some kind of salad. The Service was outstanding! Very helfpful and made you always feel welcome and that you were truley the guest! The one thing I didn't like was that we didn't get free wi-fi in our room or the 7th floor lounge. There was a computer in the lounge you could use, but had to fight for time on it. (The only place to get free wi-fi was pool area or downstairs lobby) But the benifit of being only 5 minutes from the theme park easly took away my complaint of the wi-fi issue! It was an easy walk along a beautiful path or you can take the water taxi which runs about every 15 minutes on the hour. We didn't need the front of the line tickets that we got with our room because the park was pretty empty but if you are going during the peak season I highly reccommend staying at the hotel and getting that benifit.

Having Citywalk nearby was pretty cool to the teenagers, as they had something to do after the parks closed. Citywalk also has a movie theater.

We picked the hotel because or friends were staying there and the fact it has exclusive access to the Universal parks. The hotel was extremely nice, the food was great, and the drinks were a bit pricey (but you get that with theme hotels). However, we were extremely disappointed with the house keeping. We are not high maintenance travelers, but we do expect good service when we pay for it. At $300 a night, we would have expected our room cleaned everyday and supplies for coffee and tea refilled. Nearly every day we had to \"raid\" the house keeping carts for supplies (carts that never seemed to leave the hallway). Every day we saw leftover room service trays in the hallway that stayed in the hallway for 12 hours at a time (one we saw sit there for two days). After four days of this sub-par service, we expressed concerns to hotel management. We were given a free breakfast coupon and were told the problem would be resolve. While we enjoyed our free breakfast, nothing on the house keeping side was fixed. We continued two more days with the bad service (we thought we would give them a two day grace period). Unfortunately, we had to complain again (and we hate complaining on vacation). We again received coupons for free breakfast and a bottle of wine (although they took the wine glasses from our room before we got to drink the wine). Again, we thanked them for their generosity (I'm not sure why because we paid $300 a night). To no avail! We check out the next day and were disappointed. But, with all that said, I want to say that the hotel was nice, the pool was beautiful (even though it was nearly freezing when we were there), and the access to Universal was worth it.

The sweeping driveway, with palm trees and cool guitar fountain made us feel like we had definately chosen the right hotel, right from the start! Yes it is a little on the expensive side but its certainly true that you get what you pay for and this was money well spent! Check-in was quick and smooth, we were a little concerned about the reviews on here that the rooms near to the lift lobby meant a lot of noise at night .In our experience this was only really a concern at weekends when the hotel is busy; which is true of any hotel. Our room was on the 4th floor with views onto the garden at the rear of the hotel; the room was spacious and well equipped, the coffee machine and fridge were useful. The beds and pillows were comfy an the bathroom and towels of good quality. The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze in between the door and the w/c.The shower over the tub was good, plenty of hot water. There is a small hand basin in the bathroom and a larger vanity/sink area outside the bathroom which was handy when getting ready in the mornings. The mini bar is of course expensive and they add a 20% gratuity as well! I would suggest stocking up at a local store or at The Hard Rock Gift store or Emack & Bolios they have a range of snacks and drinks at a more reasonable price. Housekeeping was good, there were some days when our room wasnt made up till later in the day but it was always to a good standard. Had a slight issue with the hairdryer but this was sorted immediately by the friendly and attentive housekeeping manager who delivered a brand new one. He regularly checked with us that all was well when he saw us in the corridor and all requests were promptly dealt with. All public areas were tidy, smart and bright, the memorbilia and features are great and the music in the elevators was fun! There are several dining options, The Kitchen where we ate breakfast on a few mornings, this was of a good standard and varied buffet style dining, the breakfast pizza was a hit with my boyfriend! We also ate dinner there a few times and on some evenings they had Characters coming to the tables which was great for children and a fun touch for adults. Prices are of course what you would expect for a 5* hotel. The Palm, a popular American steak house will cost more, we had dinner on the evening of my birthday and had starter, steaks and a nice bottle of wine for $200, pricey but the food was delicous. My boyfriend loved the steak and it was literally melt in the mouth. They also serve food at the Beach Club bar; Burger and fries were a little expensive and the only downside is the automatically add 20% gratuity to all drinks and food. But the setting is lovely and staff friendly. The pool area/gardens are well maintained, beautifully landscaped and very relaxing, the pool isnt very deep but was okay just to take a quick dip and movies by the pool were fun. You can hire a Cabana but this was a little expensive and there were plenty of pool loungers and secluded spots even at busy times. We enjoyed drinks and cocktails at the Velvet Bar just off the lobby; they did special cocktails most evenings and they had an outside balcony area which was lovely to relax on after a busy day at the parks. The staff were friendly and fun, we fund ourselves popping in for drinks before heading our most evenings. The water taxi to CityWalk was great, the Captains were always friendly and there were a couple who would often do a funny little dance or share some local knowledge which added to the fun! It was great the snuggle up on the Water Taxi on the way back from an evening at Citywalk. They ran until 2am and you never had to wait too long at the dock at Citywalk. The garden walk to Universal Studios were lovely with ducks on the lake, took about 8 minutes to walk to Citywalk/Universal Studios, the area still felt safe and security was good even when walking back in the early hours of the morning. The Express Pass was also great when the parks were busy, we never had to wait in line for any of the attractions.The ability to charge all purchases to your room in the Universal resort and have them delivered to your room was great and saved having to carry purchases around. The only issue we had was the parking charge; $14 a day it seems to be a common thing in Orlando Hotels, we only had the car for 10 days and spent the remaining 4 days using the resort. Location is great in walking distance to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure/Citywalk, 20 minutes to Disney, 10 minutes to Seaworld.

Saw both parks----including several rides x2, x3, in about 7.5 hours.....and, the parks were packed. Now, onto the hotel. Typical Lowe's property.....stafff very friendly. Services for both guests with families, and guests without. Food is pricy (lunch for the 6 of us was $90...but, the best burger I have ever had). Velvet is a must, after a long day in the park.

Luckily this was offseason, but if it had been busier it would have been difficult to use the hotubs since they only hold about 6 people each. The free water taxi at the back of the hotel takes you directly to Universal City Walk which was convenient. The pool grounds are beautiful with plenty of spots with both shade and sun. We ate at the restaraunt called the kitchen which was over priced with a very limited lunch menu. Lunch ordered from the pool beach club was good. Also food/drink service at the pool was excellent with friendly staff. I had a standard room with 2 beds facing the pool which was acceptable but not at the 4 star level ( I would say 3 star). The room and hallways appeared a worn out and are in need of some updates. Also the bathroom was very small and it was difficult to open and close the bathroom door since it was very close to the toilet and tub. Also the sink was outside of the bathroom which I do not like and it was only a single. The beds were firm and we were able to sleep well.

Although going to Disney is a must at least once in your life, once you've done Disney, Universal is in many ways better. If you stay at one of the onsite hotels, your room key is a fast pass on all of the ride lines. You get to skip the crowds on every ride. Also, unlike Disney, there are no buses to catch. At Universal, you only have a short water taxi ride to the parks or a short walk through beautiful gardens. All of the hotels at Universal also have sand beaches at the pools -- so we do not miss going to the beach. Furthermore, all of the onsite hotels have kids areas in their restaurants where the kids can eat and be entertained and the adults can have a quiet dinner alone. This is free except for paying for the kid's meals. The Kitchen restaurant at the Hard Rock has a kid's area with tvs, video games, toys, and they usually have an entertainer on the weekend for the kids. They also put up, on certain nights, \"dive-in\" movies for the kids at the pool. At the pool, they put up a large movie screen with a kid's movie playing at night. The kids love to swim and watch the movie. We have stayed at all three hotels at Universal and they all are great. We have also stayed at Wilderness Lodge and Saratoga Springs at Disney. I enjoyed my hotel experience at Univseral a lot better than at those hotels at Disney. You can also use any of the pools/restaurants at any of the onsite Universal hotels if you stay onsite at Universal.

Your room card is coded to only allow you to this floor. Seems special but not really. This level provides free beer and wine at 7 and contintental breakfast in the morning. Thats the extent of the special service level. These items are provided in a small stark room off the elevators. When everyone on the floor arrives for there free food and beverages it becomes a mob scene. The room becomes very crowded, bumping into each other, confusing, no where to sit and messy. Not the comfortable relaxing place you would envision for what you are paying for that level. Better off bringing the food or drink back to your room. I found the guest rooms to be bland. Flat metal doors. White walls. One or two pictures of a rock star. The bathroom was very small and without alot of lighting. The sink was so small you can not help getting water all over the floor. King bed was comfortable and the large flat screen tv was great. Next day spent the day at the park only to return to the room at 6 and the room was still not made up. Unbelievable. Called to complain to housekeeping and told they did not have enough help. For the rates they charge this is unacceptable. Again paid a lot of money for this level of service. Also, we were woken up at 2 in the morning by someone trying to enter our room. They had a door card. Lucky I had the inside door lock on. Speaking through the door the person said they were from houekeeping and delivering towels. Who need towels at 2 and who enters a room without permission. Scary and disturbing. I wonder about security at this hotel. Informed Star Service the next day.They did offer to credit my bill 100.00 for these problems. Do not eat at the hotel restaurant Signatures. The food was awful and service very slow even though know one was there. My wife had a pizza which had no cheese and looked like it fell on the floor. Here again they offered to take money off the bill because they even knew the service and food was bad. The last problem was they charged my credit card twice for the same stay. They did not inform me and I found out when I got home. I called to ask why and was told they have an old computer system which does that. The system is to be fixed and they will reverse the charge in a day or two. Again who does that. Charge you double and think it is ok, even if they do correct it later. They do have a few rock costumes and guitars on the walls but not as much as you would expect. The grounds are nice to walk thru and the pool with a sand beach was great.

Yeah, there's a few things that could have been better, but all in all, a great experience. Our biggest positive experience was staying on the 7th floor and having access to the Club. We traveled with three children, two of whom are teenagers, and found it totally worth our money. We all had breakfast each morning (a huge selection of a continental breakfast). Every day, all day the club was open for sodas and waters (a huge savings for us). We grabbed a few waters each morning before going out to the parks. From noontime on there were granola bars and small bags of salty snacks. The evening hors douvres were the best...very heary appetizers and a nice seleciton of beer and wine for two hours. Late night dessert was good too. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the wonderrful staff in the Club Level lounge....they go out of their way to please. Totally a money saver if you have kids who like to eat!! Our biggest complaint was housekeeping. We had to get demanding an yell a little bit to get them to come at a decent time. The first two nights housekeeping didn't get there til 7pm. We were waiting for towels to take a second shower, and had to go get them ourselves...very frustrating. The other complaint was the price of the drinks. Mixed drinks at the pool START AT $11...just crazy. I do have to say that management was fantastic when approched with a problem, though. We had the unfortuate situation of being next door to a group of young men in a band, and when they came in at 2:30 am, and decided to talk and play music until 4:45 security was great, and acted immediately the two times I called them.

There's also a nice little gift shop selling Hard Rock clothing and gifts as well as some other clothing brands (at suprisingly reasonable prices). The shop also sells essential items such as soft drinks, bottle openers and painkillers. Our room was fine, nothing much to write home about but it was a decent size and immaculate. The flat screen tv was a nice touch (having HBO was even better!) and the Keurig coffee was very nice. Some reviews have mentioned a noise problem at the hotel, we had no problems at all with this; we stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the pool and 95% of the time, while we were in the room, we could have been the only people in the hotel it was so quiet. The pool area was fabulous. On week days it was quiet with no queues for the slide but it was packed on Saturday afternoon. As some other reviews have pointed out, you can't really swim in the pool as it's only 4ft 6ins at it's deepest point, but then it's a 'fun' area, not a fitness one. There is an adults only spa pool (as well as one for all ages) unfortunately, we found the water just a little too hot to stay in for more than a couple of minutes! Loved the slide, the volleyball court and the 'beach'. The underwater sound system worked brilliantly - sometimes you could actually hear the music better underwater than over. We missed the dive-in movies but did manage to catch some live music around the pool, which was very pleasant and not too loud or overbearing. Drinks from the beach club were fairly pricey when compared with UK prices, at $21.95 for two beers, but this seemed to be fairly average around Orlando and included an 18% gratuity. The service from the bar staff was excellent - there's nothing quite like lying in the pool on a baking hot day and having a friendly face delivering you ice cold drinks at regular intervals! We travelled as a group of adults - I know that some 'adults only' parties have complained about loud and out of control children at the hotel; maybe we were just lucky but we didn't notice this at all. There were lots of children around the pool at the weekend and they made normal levels of 'kid noise' but I really don't see children playing as a problem. The hotel grounds were my favourite aspect of the whole place. Lush, perfectly maintained and teeming with wildlife (lizards, squirrels, butterflies and birds) the five minute walk to the parks was an absolute pleasure. When wandering the gardens, it's so peaceful that it's very easy to forget that you're so close to thousands of tourists. There is a free water taxi from the hotel to City Walk. These run about every 20 minutes and are a very pleasant way to travel athough it's probably quicker for most people to walk instead. All hotel guests can use their room keys to pay for food, drink and shopping in the parks and at City Walk - this is great as it means you don't have to carry cash or credit cards around with you. More importantly, your room key also acts as a free, unlimited fast pass into all the rides and shows throughout your stay - this undoubtedly saved us hours of queueing in sizzling hot temperatures and meant we were able to pack so much more into our days. It's almost worth staying at a resort hotel just for this! I can't comment on the hotel restaurants as we didn't use them (too much choice elsewhere!). The only real downside was that we didn't have a car. When we'd been to Orlando previously, we had only had a car for part of our stay but didn't have any problems as we were at an I-Drive hotel with easy access to the I-Ride trolley and free hotel shuttles to all the parks. As Universal is a fair distance away from I-Drive, we ended up paying quite a lot for taxis (the heat made it almost unbearable to walk most of the time). Although we didn't go to Disney, if we'd wanted to we obvoiusly wouldn't have had the advantage of the free Disney shuttles operated by many of the non-Universal hotels. Although Hard Rock charges $16 a day for parking, I'd say it's worth paying for the convenience of being able to travel where and when you please.

I personally didnt like it, we spend $80 for the 2 of us!. it allowed you to leave and enter the building for that day. my boyfriend is 23 he loved it ,i guess its because he's a kid at heart :). i personally think they over price it way too much!!, but there are many games!!! but not what i expected. ... hope this helps!!! :)", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable 15 night stay\u201d", "Author": "HappyVisitor", "ReviewID": "UR32867736", "Content": "My wife and I just stayed at the Hard rock for 15 nights in June 2009.

The following are the good and the bad points we encountered GOOD Location - This hotel is a few hundred yards from the original Universal studios attraction which can be easily walked to, has a complimentary boat to every 20 minutes and has some guys on bikes who will drive you around for a tip Very nice hotel, very well equipped, no real complaints about facilities, a large pretty (shallow) pool very suitable for children. Believe it or not this hotel is very suitable for children! Staff are very helpful, friendly and professional If you stay at a universal hotel your room card gets you to the front of the line at all the theme park rides. This is invaluable. Please note entry to the parks is not normally inclulded in the room price BAD Many of the rooms are adjoining by a flimsy door that does little to keep the sounds out from your neighbours rooms. One night I could hear a woman having a very pleasant stay. Another night a lot of children appeared to be having a squaling party. Another night I actually had to phone security and complain when a guest decided to practice his guitar playing very loudly at 2am waking up both my wife and I. I complained the next day to the management who somehow ensured it did not happen again. The pool - Very pretty but is not much more than 3 feet deep anywhere, great for young children but virtually useless for anyone above 5 feet tall. We normally stay at the royal pacific, and very slightly prefer the RP, but I was really impressed with the Hard Rock and would recommend it. I have also stayed in many other local hotels, including Disney's Port Orleans and motel 6's Quality Inn plaza etc. You should expect the likes of RP and Hard Rock to be better than these cheaper hotels, and you would not be dissapointed.

The manager who goes by the name of AJ has humiliated my family of 4 children and 2 adults to an all new low standard of customer service.

After staying at the Royal Pacific last year, I was expecting to be blown away by staying in the \"next step up\" of Loews Hotels. Arrived and paid the annual pass rate plus was given a free upgrade to garden view room for 177.00 night. That is the annual pass rate, not the 325.00 for nonpass holders. The room was smaller than the standard room at the Royal Pacific. The furniture and the linens were not near as nice either. The room has an angeled wall that jets out into room from the bathroom. It makes it hard to get into one side of the bed. The garden view was the back of the hotel. Nothing but sidewalks and 1 patch of grass where some kids were playing soccer. Not impressed. I booked this room because of the pool. I thought my kids would love the \"underwater music and the water slide\". The underwater music is VERY misleading. I could NEVER hear it. I finally went and asked where it was. I was told that it only in the area of the watervolleyball court. Went towards area and could make out the songs, but it was nothing like the website leads you to believe. The water slide was fun, but you do have to deal with preteens and teenagers, who love to cut in line and encourage their freinds to do the same. You can't go down the slide with younger children either. Single riders only. For what I paid for the room, I wasn't impressed. The royal pacific is much nicer and though there is not a water slide, I thought the pool was more enjoyable. A caution- laundry here is 2.50/wash and 2.50/dry. The washer wants you to put powder soap on top of your clothes then shut the door and the washer will fill and wash. It seemed as if everyone had brought liquid det. with them. The washers were filled with liquid soap in the opening for fabric softener. No soap would go in, therefore clothes were not cleaned.

It's in a beautiful location which, due to the landscaping, makes it feel secluded. Upon arrival, the bell hops are hopping and friendly. Valet is $22 per night and self-parking is $15. The hotel sits on a hill, and the parking lots are at the bottom on either side of the hotel. This means self-parking will require you to take a huge flight of stairs. So unload baggage before parking or have the bell hops drive down in an extended golf cart to assist if you want to tip. There is no elevator to the parking lot. Check in on a Monday afternoon was quick and friendly. We arrived around 2 and check in was not until 4. The girl said she would put a \"rush\" on our room and call us if we wanted to go to the pool. We did that and recieved a call at 3. Our room was very nice. LG flat screen TV, CD player, and iPod dock. Modern look with framed black and whites of musicians. We had poolview on the 6th floor which was great. The beds were very comfy with good pillows and down comforters. There was a table with two chairs and a comfortable chair and ottoman. There was also a coffee bar and mini fridge, but I believe it was locked. The coffee maker was the one cup Keurig. Internet service was $9.95 per day. The bathroom was nice because it had a sink and counter top outside the bathroom as well as a regular wall mount sink inside the bathroom. Both sinks had mirrors. And the one in the bathroom also had a small glass shelf mounted above it. The shower had great pressure. The tile floors were big, green tiles, not your normal hotel tile. There were spa type bath products. I couldn't find shampoo and conditioner anywhere, so called housekeeping. They came immediately with a small bag full. Once I entered the shower, I found it on a small corner shelf. We ordered room service one morning, which was fast and good. The breakfast buffet is $16.95 per adult and $10.95 for children. We did not try it. There were several restuarants in the hotel, and one was out by the pool. The pool was large with a water slide. There was a kiddie pool, a hot tub, an adult only hot tub, and several areas with water spraying for small children to play. The towel hut was on the way down to the pool, so grab one as you go. There were plenty of lounge chairs, some in shady areas and many in full sun. Some were even in white sand. Music was playing, but not too loud to make a cell phone call. The music was also piped underwater. There was poolside entertainment throughout the day for the kids. The first night they put out an inflatable screen and showed The Karate Kid. The second night there was a DJ who did fun games and interactions with the kids. He gave them mini inflatable guitars and did a girls vs boys rock out. Then he pulled out large inflatable guitars and called up moms and dads. There was also a hair wrap/gift shop cabana in the pool area as well. One great feature was that the pool stayed open until midnight. And although we had poolview, we could not hear the pool noise from our room. In the pool area there was a gate which leads to trails, beautifully landscaped wide sidewalks, taking you directly to Universal's main gate, City Walk, and Islands of Adventure. There was also a water taxi and pedicab available. The water taxi was free and the pedicab drivers worked strictly by tips. There were benches along the canal throughout the trails. And there was a butterfly garden near the water taxi area. Being able to walk/ride to the parks and come back and forth to the room and pool during the day was so much better than staying off-property. Definitely worth the extra money. And with teenage boys, it was great for them to be able to come and go all day on their own. Having a Fast Pass (room key) for the parks was probably the best part of all. The room key also allows you to charge to your room and send packages from the parks back to the hotel. Check out was 11, but the granted us 12:30 when I called to inquire about late check out. The room key continues to work as a Fast Pass and continues to grant access to the pool and self-parking lot throughout the day after check out.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cSo-So....

One of the biggest problems I had with the hotel was that the wireless in the room was so slow that I could not send large documents over the internet, and the hard-wired ethernet in my room did not work at all.

Now the bad things I found: Arrival/Check-in Upon my arrival, it was rainy and I saw a sign to self-park. I followed the sign and parked the car expecting that I would enter the lobby level or at least a level with elevators or a covered walkway to the lobby. To my surprise, there is no elevators and I had to drag my 2 pieces of luggage across the parking lot in the rain and up 3 levels of wet stairs. When I checked in, they gave me 2 keys and 1 of the keys didn't work and checked me in a double-queen room when I asked for a King bed room. I went back to the front desk and told them that I requested for a King bed and the lady at the counter told me that my request was noted but it would not be guaranteed that I would get a King bed. They didn't tell me that when I booked the room. Some hotels charge a higher rate for a King bed than a Queen or Double Queen. It was a good thing that I traveled by myself and it was not a big deal. When we travel as a family, my 2 young kids like to sleep in with us (which may or may not be the best idea) but that what they like to do especially on a trip. I would have been really upset if I were to travel with my family. I later found out from another supervisor that they only have 4 King bed rooms in the entire hotel (that what he told me when he came to my rooms to discuss some other issues which I will share shortly below). Cleanliness (or should I say \"DIRTINESS?\") / Services/Conveniences DIRTINESS: After checking in, the first thing I noticed was a small bathtub with a filthy shower-head (the chrome shower-head is now in black color). I lifted up the sheets and there were some small black particles and even hairs! INCONVENIENCE - POOR DESIGN FOR BASIC THINGS This was a business trip and I had my work cell, personal cell and a laptop. I tried to look for place to charge all of these and another surprise, there is no outlet/place to plug in any thing around the nightstand between the 2 queen beds. Even their own alarm clock and lamp are plugged into the wall outlets behind the headboards that are not accessible. There is one duplex outlet on one wall of one bed and there is none for the other bed. I had to unplug the lamp to plug in one of my cell phones and the laptop and had to plug in the other cellphone on another wall that is not reachable from the bed (which means that if I either get a call from my personal phone or a work phone early in the morning, I would have to get out of bed to get to the phone or if you travel as a family and have other gadgets that you need to charge, you have to unplug some items to get other items charged). I have stayed at other much cheaper hotels where the electrical outlets are either on the lamps themselves or at a very convenience location. THEY TOOK SOME OF MY ITEMS THAT I COLLECTED FROM MY ROOM After going back from a trade show and stood in some long lines to get some freebies for my kids, I took them back to the hotel and left on the table. The next day I came back, I noticed that some items were missing. I picked up the phone to call their 'Star Service' number and there was no dial tone on the wireless handset. I walked to the wired desk phone and some of the buttons were sticky and worn out. I reported that some of my stuffs have been taken from my room and I gave them the benefit of the doubts that they might have mistakenly removed them and didn't report to security when the supervisor offered for me to do so. The house keeping manager called and left me a message a few hours later. The next day one of the front line manager called back and tried to address the issue. After all the issues that I reported, the only thing she offered to me was to find some replacement for the missing items (that would not be the same as what I collected). At least any other hotel or any service oriented managers would at least offer some incentives (such as discounted rate, complementary meal or some thing to keep the customers happy without the customers asking for it). They have no idea how to provide customer service. BACK TO DIRTINESS: On Thursday night, I took a shower and was about to use one of their bathrobes for the first time during my stay, I took the bathrobe out of the closet and there are few piece of rices on the bathrobe!!!! That means that never wash the bathrobes and put in the closet for new guests. How disgusting is that? I started to wonder whether they wash the towers or not. It's probably not a good idea to use bathrobes at any hotel from now on. I was too tired to deal with it and called the front desk the next morning and spoke to another manager. I asked him to come to my room to show him the DIRTY bathrobes and the chrome shower-head that had turned into a black shower-head. He found them to be disgusting himself but didn't really offer much until I asked for some incentives or discount. He offered future discount if I would bring my family back there in the future! I was thinking to myself, 'are you kidding me, you think I am going to come back after this experience?' I pushed the issue and he finally discounted the last day. Overall Overpriced, DIRTY and poor service. This is my worse hotel experience and I will never stay there again. Expect to pay $15/day for self-parking and ~ $25/day for valet (that is without tips).

We were both looking forward to our stay and so wanted the hotel to be something special. The good things about the hotel are very good indeed. Firstly the location. Second to none. The room keys doubled as express passes in both Universal and Islands. This saved so much time in the ques. But what not a lot of people are aware of is they also get priority seating at most of the restraunts in City walk during the evenings. This again gives you more time to enjoy the place. We only found Bubba Gumps did not take part in this.The Gardens and the walk down to the city walk was wonderful. Just one thing, it is next to water and the noises you can hear being made by the creatures in the undergrowth after dark are not the squirrels. So no flip floops at night, or better yet take the water taxi. We also had no problems with the cleaniness of the room. Also the beds were supremly comfortable. That said it leds me on to my first area of criticism. 2 double beds is not what i would call 5 star treatment. We did enquire if rooms were available with bigger sizes only to be told that this was standard and we would have to pay for any upgrade.The room itself while being very stylish was let down by a number of things. No dvd player in the room, the electrical cables behind the appliances were a mess. Not Sure if I would let small children roam the floor. Any other 5 star we stayed at these would nrmally be wired in ( the cables, not the children.) The plumbing was terrible and very noisy. Every shower taken, toilet flushed or sinked filled, not only the rooms either side of us, but also above us, we would hear it. I am a light sleeper, however my wife is not and she was woken several time each and every night by this noise. My wife also informed me that one morning the sink filed with a dark brown liquid from the plug hole only to drain away again almost instantly. I never witnessed this, so I wonder if it happened regularly. The layout of the bathrooms is not to clever also. For some reason a dividing wall is at an odd angle. This just complicates the ergonomics of the available space. Trust me it sounds petty but every time i turned to reach for the toilet roll just reminded of the short comings. Also no walk in shower instead an over the bath type? Other things that just drop this place is having to rent the in-room fridge $15 a day. No complimentary car parking, again $15 daily. Plastic cups for the coffee in the room, not very polished. And the hotel claims to be trying to be green and the still use disposable cups? No bathrobes or slippers in the rooms, again what should be a given for a 5 star. The worst and possibly the smallest hotel room safe ever. But the clincer for me was the staff. Most just appeared to not bother. At the pool in 97 degree heat we waited for some service. The girl walk past our spot 3 times before I had to go the bar. We even tried calling her over, no joy. Most seemed to be having to good a time with each other to worry about the guests. I know thats not fair on all the staff, some were very good and were very attentive to or needs, but the bad one more than compensated for the good ones. I know it sounds bad, but this hotel just let itself down. It has great potential if only the managment and staff would allow it to meet it, it truly would be something special. That said I think you will have to go very far indeed to find a better 3 star hotel anywhere in the world.

They just loved the parks. I was also hoping I'd like it because the location of this place is perfect, just a short walk to the entrance of CityWalk and Universal Studios. Then another quick walk down CityWalk to get to Islands of Adventure. This was definitely a BIG plus. The Portifino Hotel was behind the Hard Rock and you had to walk farther to get to the entrance of Universal and CityWalk. The Royal Pacific is on the other side of the parks and is closer to Islands of Adventure. Neither of these hotels looked as good or had the \"coolness factor\" of the Hard Rock. The GOOD: Location: Can't be beat Express Pass: This is included when you stay on property. Worth it's weight in gold. You get to bypass every line when you show them your card (each member of the family gets one). It feels a little elitist but it saves you SO much time. We breezed through rides and went on everything we wanted to by the end of the second day! You even get VIP seating for all the shows. It's a no brainer to stay on property when each Express Pass costs about $50/day per person! Coolness of hotel: Can't beat the curb appeal. Grounds were gorgeous and I loved the mission style of the hotel. Decor was unique, the faucet handles were all musical note shaped and there were cool body pillows on the bed. Our family is into all kinds of music and it was neat to see the memorabilia and the music themed stuff. You get a free CD when you check in and there are cute lyrics from songs imprinted everywhere from the pillows to the ice machine! Lost and Found: The day after we left I realized I had left a whole drawerful of clothes in the room. When I called they said they had all the clothes and would ship it to my home address. I was shocked when he said it was complimentary. When I arrived home I saw that the package was mailed 2 day express! The guy who shipped it even called my cell phone and left a message to call back if I wanted a tracking number. That went above and beyond in my opinion. The BAD: LOUD! Even though I love music (the live bands at night at CityWalk were awesome!!) the constant blaring of songs in the lobby got on your nerves. It was just too loud and you couldn't tune it out because of the volume. Everyone had to raise their voices to be heard when checking in. There also was a live band by the pool who played even louder and it really drove away many who wanted to relax. It was truly deafening. No one enjoyed it, even the teens. Everyone was just enduring it, hoping they would end soon. My word of advice, if you don't want your ears ringing all day request a room as far from the lobby as possible. I got the last room at the end of the hall and it was quiet. I also lucked out and didn't get a room overlooking the pool. You would definitely hear the noise. Parking Fee: $15/day to self park is outrageous Housekeeping: We came back from the parks the first day around 7PM and the room was not cleaned! Called desk and they apologized and said they would send someone up right away. I asked if they could send someone up in about an hour and that I would just like some fresh towels now so we can all take showers and get cleaned up for dinner. She said that would be fine and that she would send up the towels. After about 20 minutes we got the towels but she got the room wrong, we heard the knocking across the hall. OK, so when we were all ready about an hour later I called the front desk again to tell them we were leaving and now would be a good time to clean our room. She said someone would be sent up. Well, when we returned about 3 hrs later the room was still not made up!!! I was too tired to complain, it was a long day and we all just wanted to sleep. Then we hear a knocking at the door and it's housekeeping!! Unbelievable. My kids were asleep by then! I asked her what happened and she gave me some excuse that it was a busy day! I told her I would speak to the manager in the morning. When I spoke to the manager she didn't sound surprised and all she could do was apologize and offer a free breakfast in their restaurant. I was disgusted and wouldn't eat there even if it was free. So like I said, I'm torn about whether to recommend. I would have to say no. I'm hoping I'll like one of the two new hotels that are being built soon so I'll have more options.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "phila", "Title": "\u201cnice, clean, pricy\u201d", "Author": "2446", "ReviewID": "UR27781350", "Content": "my wife and i went to the hard hard rock for four nights. we went just to get away for a few days from phila. i am not a music fan, but my wife knows every number sung or played by anybody. anyway, the hotel is very nice and the music was not as bad as i thought it would be. on arrival we were upgraded to club level after having booked a pool view room. the total room cost was $363.00 including tax, per night. the room was extra clean with a king bed, pull out sofa and two chairs, as well as a large bathroom, room safe, and all the extras that go with the club level booking. these extras are very nice and while not necessary, do make your stay much more enjoyable. while we did not pay the club level rate, it is probably worth what it would cost. the staff at this hotel is outstanding. housekeeping did a great job. any questions were answered by everyone and everybody was super friendly. the pool area is large, plenty of towels are available, and the area is clean. the pool is shallow and the days we were there it was jambed with kids.

This kept things relatively quiet. There a lot of teenagers running around, so be prepared for noisy hallways after 9pm. This place is expensive, so be prepared. The first morning, we went to the Kitchen for breakfast and got the breakfast buffet. It was great, but I did think it was expensive to pay $8 for each of the kids to essentially eat cereal and have a glass of orange juice. After that, we did the Continental breakfast upstairs for free. The service was beyond excellent. Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful. The pool area is very large and it was never a problem to find 2-3 lounge chairs. There is a wide section where the pool meets the sand at zero depth. Great if you have young kids. Lots of activities for the kids. They loved the place and want to go back. If you plan on going to Universal Studios, this is the place to stay. You can walk the short distance or take a water taxi, which is free. You also get to go to the head of any lines in the parks, with your room key. The only negative I had was the beds.

The hard rock hotel was great although we did experience the thin walls folks talked about in here previously. I am not sure if they were just drunk and talking loud late into the night, or it was after hours and everyone else was just quiet. Luckily that group checked out the next a.m. so the next 4 days were fairly good, although you can hear everything out in the hall. Luckily we were towards the end of one of the wings so did not have too much traffic outside our door. We were not given a pool view room even though requested at early booking (probably due to our package price). We we were not in the room that much so not a big deal, but would have been nice. Room was average for a supposed 4 or 5 star hotel as advertised. It was ok for the 4 of us, but nothing elaborate, or anything that makes you go WOW. Pool was beautiful though and with the parks behind it was a great view from the elevator bay on club level, so those high rooms (floors 6&7) with hotel and park views should be great. Next time I will not book the club level ( this did not seem up to the same standards at Disney), as my kids did not take advantage and we ended up eating out more than planned. The breakfast was basically a Hampton inn style with no hot food. The evening appetizers were just a couple of basic things (chicken wings, egg rolls, etc) that was not all that appetizing to be honest. Free wine and beer were ok, but kids did not want to go in there to eat, so was a waste of $$$. We never used the fitness center and internet service is not included on the club level, other than one pc that is in use most of the time in the lounge. Book a high floor swimming pool view room instead and take a cooler. Use the package savings on meals and drinks at the pool. Hotel food and drinks were fairly expensive and every restaurant and bar added an 18% tip automatically, but the atmosphere was great and my kids had a blast at the pool. They had live bands and DJ's and showed Movies or Concerts (Springsteen) on DVD at night which the kids could watch from the heated pool, beachside chairs, or from the pool bar restaurant. We ended up spending most of our time at the pool when not at the parks or Citiwalk. Overall I would probably not pay that much to stay there again, but as everyone else says, the express lines you get access to with your room key makes it worth it. Over a Spring break or holiday I would say it's the only way to go. The express passes they sell in the park are only good for 1 express ride per attraction where the room keys are as many times as you want. My boys rode the log ride and roller coasters all day at Islands of Adventure and that would not have been possible any other way with the crowds. We waited less than 5 minutes at the rides at Islands of Adventure and maybe 10 minutes at the most at Universal Studio's park. Most of the time you just walk right on. I would say the Hard Rock is a great safe place for the teenage family to stay and go to the theme parks, but once was enough for us. I doubt we go back as we just didn't feel it was quite as good as Disney. The staff at the hotel were nice, but there is a difference in the attitude and value at the parks. My wife thought it was much more noticeable than my boys and I, but after being at both places we all liked Disney better from a theme park perspective, maybe they can put in a Hard Rock Hotel over there Two last notes-- I did not think the music was overwhelming as some have written. The lobby and pool bar are rocking all day, but it was not as bad as some have made it out to be. I enjoyed the music at the pool, it kept your toes tapping ;) The other thing was the theme park hours and restaurants at the parks. They seemed to cut the hours back and several restaurants were not opened which was a bit of a bummer. I guess they did that to cut costs with this economy, but the spring break crowd looked pretty good to me with waiting lines at the restaurants that were open. Would have been nice if they would have reduced the cost of the tickets in proportion to the hours and restaurant availability. They also did not have early park entry available as advertised for hotel guests, although with the express pass was not a big deal. Just additional reasons to head back to Disney i guess.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo", "Title": "\u201cPretty good stay\u201d", "Author": "amyn1438", "ReviewID": "UR26133441", "Content": "Me and my boyfriend stayed here for three nights prior to a cruise and to spend some time in the parks. We enjoyed our stay here. All three of Universals hotels are very overpriced in my opinion, but for the convience and the fact that if you are a hotel guest you get express access to the rides, I personally think it is worth the extra money to stay on site. The pool at the hotel in it's best feature. Huge, very clean, and nice. Music plays underneath the water which is cool. The waterslide is also really nice. Bigger and better then you would think for a hotel. We also enjoyed the adults only hot tub and used it a lot especially because it was freezing when we were there. That is the last time I go to Florida in January. The other thing that was really great about this hotel was the walk to the parks and citywalk. 5 minutes! So convient. Lobby is nice. We had one small problem with the hotel. After coming back to our room from dinner the first night, we saw a cockroach in our room. I was not too happy because I had paid a lot of money to stay at a nice hotel. This is the first time I've ever seen a cockroach in a hotel I''ve stayed in. We went down to the front desk, the lady was nice and moved us to a different room, but no one even offered to help us with our luggage and it was a huge incovience to move all out stuff we had just set up. It would have been nice for them to do something, even a free drink, to make up for this. Although I was very unhappy with this, the hotel and both rooms were really clean, and I do not think this is something that happens often. It is Florida afterall. I would definitly not base my whole opinion on the hotel on this because I do think the hotel was nice and clean. I have also stayed at the Royal Pacific hotel before, and prefered that over the Hard Rock. But you can't walk to the parks from the Royal Pacific so if that is important to you choose the Hard Rock. We also venttured over to the Portofino Bay hotel for dinner at Mama Della's which was great and highly reccommended. This is where I wanted to stay but was about $75 more a night. It looked amazing, and if I go back I will stay there. Universal is fun, but the freezing weather really but a damper on our trip. We are from Buffalo and were trying to escape the cold so freezing everyday was not fun. The parks and Citywalk are really fun. We loved the Hulk, don't miss that, and Pat O'Brians and Margaritaville at City Walk were awesome.

We arrived around lunchtime on the first day, were promptly checked in and our suitcases taken off our hands and later delivered to our rooms. We had upgraded to \"Club 7\" I think it was called. I am still not 100% sure what this got us but think it upgraded the room and included breakfast at the end of the corridor in the club room on level 7. I don't know how much this cost as my bfs mum upgraded all of us but it did not seem that worth it really. The rooms were nice, nothing special, and although it was good to be able to have breakfast and snacks throughout the day in the club room, it wasn't very cosy in there. Plastic seating, white walls with coloured chairs.... Plus there was one member of staff who worked in there later in the afternoon who was very rude to my boyfriends brother and gf. They were pretty much 'told off' when not using the prongs to pick up a cookie (even though they were going to eat it - they weren\u2019t touching them all!!!) and then told they were only allowed 2 cookies each when they went back up!! Anyway, minor complaint. The hotel on the whole was very very nice. I could not imagine after having been to Hard Rock Cafes how they could make a hotel. It was very modern inside with lots of cool pictures of rock stars everywhere (as you would expect). The lobby area was spacious and airy, and reception staff always polite. The pool was gorgeous-very big and quite warm too. I have to say that the staff who would serve you drinks etc around the pool were also very friendly and polite all the time. The hotel rooms as I mentioned earlier were completely adequate. Not really anything special but nice enough. Clean, nicely furnished, very shallow bath, powerful shower, large TV (although it wasn't very well tuned), bathrobes, an I-Pod docking station and a great view of Universal. We ate one night in the Palms Restaurant located in the hotel. I have to say it was my best meal (although not cheap!!!) of the whole holiday. 2 courses each, a bottle of wine and tips came to about $110 each. The food was fantastic. Another guest in the hotel earlier that day had told us the food was average, and I am glad we did not listen to him. I had the most amazing seared tuna for starters, and a perfectly cooked steak for main. Our waiter (who was also the sommelier) was also very very friendly, very knowledgeable and very helpful. I would definitely recommend eating there if you get the chance, We also went to \"The Kitchen\" one morning for breakfast (rather than the breakfast which was included in the club room) and there was a very very good choice in there so if breakfast is not included in your package I would recommend eating there. The fitness room and spa facilities at the Hard Rock were good, but if you really want to be pampered use the Portofino's hotel facilities just across the road (it is part of the same group so you can use the spa etc). We went over one day just to use the steam room etc and it is lovely. Very relaxing, gorgeous lounge areas, cool flannels and cucumber (for the eyes)for when you come out of the sauna, health nuts and seed dispensers to snack on... Very nice. The best part about staying at the Hard Rock has to be the Fast track passes you get.

However, for the price it's not the best 5 star hotel I've ever stayed. The rooms were fairly large (which was great since we had our 2 kids with us), but I was disappointed that the shower/tub area was not separate from the toilet area. I know this is being picky but I am a bathroom fanatic!! The food at the hotel is really pricey, but I guess this is what you'd expect from the \"Hard Rock.\" This by no means in anyway would deter me from staying here again. It's absolutely in a FABULOUS location, and the fast pass to the Universal Parks is worth the stay alone. I think they've done a great job with the pool area and water slide. This is perfect after a long day at the park and the kids are still running on high octane. Another good thing about the pool area is that it doesn't close until late. Our kids absolutely loved it!! Again, not the best hotel for the money; but it is nice, and we'd stay again. If you like getting off the property, I'd recommend the IHOP right around the corner from the hotel. The entire bill for a family of 4 is what one breakfast cost you at the Hard Rock. Of course if you don't mind spending the money; the breakfast is good at the Hard Rock. And lastly, my biggest annoyance.... after paying SO-O-O-O much money to stay there, we had to pay $18/day for parking as well as wireless internet to the room. NOT TO COOL!!

We arrived on Monday afternoon and stayed until Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. We had a wonderful time here. Last year at the same time, we stayed at the Royal Pacific Hotel, another Universal Loew's Property, which we also enjoyed. My husband wanted to try the Hard Rock and my friend had stayed here in the spring and had a great time with her hubby and six-year old daughter. The room was very comfortable; we stayed on the 5th floor in a Garden View room with two double beds for myself and hubby and our 12-year old son. We booked our stay through Southwest Air. We were pleased with our fast passes; it is a bit of a challenge though to have to go to the park to collect our \"Stay four/Play Four\" free passes to Universal and Islands of Adventure for the week with Guest Services. The agent we got insisted that we owed a balance and even called our credit card company; after continuously reminding him that we paid everything in full already, he finally apologized (after a 15 minute wait) and said he had been \"confused' - eesh - hardly the VIP experience! At Royal Pacific last year, we received nice pouches that we could carry our park passes and Fast Passes in; when I inquired at the desk at Hard Rock, the agent recomended we purchase the same at the gift store...NOT! The above is the only bad complaints I can come up with after staying there for four nights and five days. We ate at The Kitchen the first night and loved it; I had awesome potato and leek soup and crab cakes. We loved the pool and grounds and the convenience of walking to the parks and the Fast Passes and two free park passes. Last year while staying at Royal Pacific, we rented a car, but after being charged $15/day to park at the hotel, we decided to book round trip shuttle service from Orlando Int'l Airport to the Hard Rock through Mears Transportation Service instead. For a mere $28/person roundtrip, this was the way to go. They picked us up immediately upon arrival and delivered us to our hotel after one stop at Royal Pacific. It was a bit more crowded on the return trip to the airport the day after Thanksgiving, but the driver was five minutes early and we arrived in plenty of time for our flight back to CT! We also made use of the free shuttle service from Hard Rock to Sea World on Thanksgiving Day! Book this service 24 hours in advance through the hotel and it is easy and FREE! All in all, a great service. We had a full size travel/coach bus, and it was more than over 1/2 empty. Wonderful and convenient and free! Loved the Hard Rock's pool and water slide as well as the garden walkway; on the last day we went lizard hunting before leaving for our flight and discovered a gorgeous butterfly garden complete with orange trees behind our hotel - beautiful! The staff was very friendly. Tip: if you fly Southwest Airlines and want to get your boarding pass, just let the Concierge know at least one day ahead of time and provide your travel confirmation number, flight number and times, number of people traveling, and the Hard Rock Staff will make sure that you are in the front of the line for boarding! We didn't think of this last year at Royal Pacific Hotel and wound up being scattered all over the plane (party of 3!); this year we all wound up in Boarding Group A with our pick of where to sit (all together!)

They keep the grounds in and around the hotel property in perfect condition. The pool bar/restaurant has a diverse menu for all, service was extremely friendly and prices reasonable. Always pool games going on for all, and they try to get all involved. Great place to hang out after a long day out at the parks, as the pool stays open till late in the evening.

Each day we visited a park, by early afternoon we headed to the pool to relax and we either ate by the pool or took a walk over to City Walk to find a place.

Both my Girlfriend and I are rock fan's and we can safely say that this is one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed at! Firstly as soon as we arrived a valet opened the bus door and helped us out of there with our cases. Then we were given a ticket and told that our luggage would meet us in our room once we were checked in. We stayed in Club 7 and took full advantage of the free snacks/drinks /alcohol and breakfast, which was all top notch. They also provided free DVD rental to 7th Floor guests which was an added bonus when you just wanted to unwind in the room and chill out! After swimming around in the pool for a while listening to a poolside battle of the bands we decided we wanted to go and grab some food. We decided to walk up to CityWalk and see what the distance was like and wether it was worthwhile getting the free Water Taxi or not. Turns out it's about a 3 minute walk from the pool to the Universal Globe and Gates. We dined at the worlds largest Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 which was incredible food and incredible Memorabilia, then made our way back to our room for our first nights sleep. When we got to our room we had a little present on the bedside table in the shape of Bouncy Balls with Smiley Faces on them! And every night from then on we got different little gifts (i.e. Hard Rock Fridge Magnets, Yoyo's, Luggage ID Tags etc.) :-D Coffee machine in the room was fantastic and the coffee/tea choices were quite varied. We didn't use the mini bar (as we've been caught out by that a few times before) but did have a look at the price list and it was fairly reasonable by mini bar standards! The only downer on this holiday was that we went in the 2 quietest weeks of the season (4th Sept - 19th Sept) and the pool was closed for 6/7 days as they had to drain it and do some work on the filtering as they weren't busy! Not that this really mattered as they offered up the use of any of the other Universal Resort pools which was a nice experience to go and see what the other hotels were like...Personally i think we chose the right one! But anyway in a 2 week break we were pretty filled up with things to do, places to see and Mice to meet. So the pool wasn't that important in the grand scheme of things. Another fact that i loved about staying in a universal resort was discounted entry to Universal and the fact that your roomkey lets you bypass all of the lines in the parks! The longest we waited in a Universal queue was a few minutes for 1 of the shows to start!...Not counting when we were barracaded into the Duelling Dragons castle whilst a huge 20/30 minute thunderstorm (Courtesy of Hurricaine Ike) passed over us! Needless to say the ride staff were most accomodating and friendly whilst we were all stuck in the queue line waiting for the ride to re-open. 1 WORD OF WARNING FOR JACUZZI FANS - The Jacuzzi's in the Lowe's hotels are maintained at 104 degrees Faranheit and the first time you get in one it's quite a shock to the system!!! All in all I would rate the holiday as a 10/10 and the Hotel and a 9.75/10 they lose 0.25 only because the pool had to close!

We had booked a garden view room. As we were travelling from Europe we had 4 suitases with us. The woman at the reception desk didn't call a bell boy or offer us any help whatsoever upon check in, ignoring the luggage and showing us with her finger the way to the elevators. We struggled to get to our room. First thing I noticed was the musty smell. Wanted to open the windows to let some fresh air in and ....the window wouldn't open, because it isn't really a window. More like a glass panel. I considered calling reception and ask if they could switch us to another room, but it was pretty late and we were tired from our drive from Miami. Besides, we were only staying there 2 nights and our main purpose was to visit the parks, not staying in. The room was ok, but the whole decor was a little tired. The bathroom was quite small for US standars. We booked the room with breakfast buffet included for practical reasons, and it was pretty good if you don't take into consideration the dirty water they call coffee, or the fact that there was no cheese platter. Actually, the only thing with cheese they had on the buffet turned out to be a kind of pastry, another sweet treat. 2 days before leaving home, I received an e-mail informing me the pool would be unavailable for the duration of our stay since they'd be doing work on it and the surrounding bar. One of the main attractions for me to book at the Hard Rock was the sound system in the pool.... They did offer free shuttle to the other two hotels in the park to visit their pools, but if you are tired from your day in the parks and want to just chill for 30 min, you don't feel like taking a bus and drive to another hotel. Same story upon check out, we had to carry our own suitcases (I had gone to check out 15 minutes earlier having left the luggage in the room). Neither somebody helped us when my husband was loading the suitcases and bags into the trunk of our car, even though there were 3 bell boys standing there, chatting.

Unlike the Royal Pacific, where at least you can have a quick service breakfast in peaceful comfortable surroundings, at the Hard Rock there is nowhere to go except the noisy ice cream parlour. We all hated this. If this wasnt bad enough, when we got to our pool view room, all we had a view of were the trees, a drainpipe and a spot of blue in the distance.

Tropical Storm Fay had just passed by so the weather wasn't great although the day we arrived there was a large screen in the lobby showing Red Hot Chilli Peppers in concert and also an area with soem poolside games to keep people entertained. We arrived at lunchtime, checked in and then went to the park while we waited for our room. We were able to use our room keycard as a fast pass and got to walk on and off most of the rides. Last trip we didn't even get close to the big rides due to the length of the queues. The walk to the parks is very pleasant, not too far and there are rickshaw rides for the way back if required. The room was spotless, and had lots of extras like an mp3 system, widescreen TV and my favourite a fancy coffee maker. There were some strange hazlenut coffee capsules on the tray when we arrived which were quickly swapped for regular coffee when I spoke to housekeeping. Apparently they had recently changed to the hazlenut ones but most guests preferred the regular ones(???) The beds were very comfortable and the air con almost silent. Towels and toiletries were luxurious and plentiful. I would have preferred not to have the tubular cushions on the bed as my youngest found them to be great jousting tools! They had to be hidden in the wardrobe most of the time. Unfortunately we had quite a lot of rain in the evenings so didn't get to experience the poolside entertainment. We ate twice in The Kitchen which was extremely good. I had spicy chicken salad one night which came in a collander! It was delicious. My husband who was carrying out a study in steak - he ate so many during the trip said his Rib Eye was one of the best he had had. The waitor was the same both times and was fantastic. He was funny, polite and a great ambassador for the hotel. We also took advantage of the kids Club (L'il Camp Rock) so our 5 year old could play with other kids. It was very quiet and there were only four kids there but he had a great time. The staff were very pleasant and made sure he got to try out a variation of activities. At $15 an hour it wasn't cheap but by then we needed some time to enjoy a meal on our own. One evening we sat and listened to a local band in the lobby as it was too wet outdoors. They were very good and our 15 year old bought their CD, getting it signed by the band. We love rock music and I particularly loved having what I would call decent music everywhere I went. I spent a long time just wandering around the hotel looking at all the photos and memorabilia. I loved having Starbucks coffee available so I could enjoy a dolce latte on an evening. The Velvet Sessions bar was very luxurious. We didn't actually sit in there but went in for drinks and then sat out in the lobby. It was easy to imagine being some big rock star in there. The pool - what we saw of it, was perfect for young families. Both my sons enjoyed it. My youngest was able to play in the whole pool without a life vest as he could touch the bottom at all times. On the last day they had poolside games and everyone joined in. The music playing throughout is not too loud but at a pleasant level ( not loud enough for my 15 year old though!) Every member of staff we encountered was polite and very helpful. One morning I had problems connecting my i pod touch to the free wireless in the lobby.

The rest of our stay was fine. The lobby is actually on the 3rd floor so it is a bit confusing. There are movies by the pool in the evening. There's ping pong outside and shuffle board. The breakfast buffet is wonderful. The best part of the hotel is the location. It is a 5 minute walk to the theme parks and all the fine restaurants. The rickshaw home is a nice plus, too.

We had again upgraded our room to 'Club' so we were in a position to compare! On two previous occasions we have stayed at the Royal Pacific (not Club Room) but fancied a change this visit. On entering the hotel lobby there was definitely a 'wow' factor. Great area, with amazing memorabila on show. Our room on the Club floor was nice, very modern and contemporary. We did ask for a room furthest away from the lift area as I had read reports of the hotel sometime being noisy. Although the view wasn't great - the room was quiet! First impressions of the hotel were all good. Great access to City Walk and the Parks (which is the reason we choose Universal Hotels - and the fast pass is a MUST!). Club Room: Very different experience from that we had at the Hyatt! We did not feel 'exclusive' in anyway. The breakfast was pastries (and more pastries), cereal, toast, tea/coffee etc. You could pop in during the afternoon and grab a soft drink (if there was any available) and the evening beer/wine/snacks was only on offer from 5pm-7pm. Needless to say, come 5pm the place was heaving. We don't actually eat until around 9 pm - so we felt we had to go out earlier just to grab a couple of glasses of wine to ensure we had out monies worth! Personally, wished we had saved the money. It was amusing to watch some folk come in during the morning grabbing large numbers of bottled water, food and soft drinks and disappearing back to their rooms (or packing the stuff in their ruck sacks!). Similar things happened during the evening too - how sad! We ate in the Kitchen restaurant twice and the pool bar just the once - very reasonable priced food and good. With there being no lobby bar we had to physically go into the Velvet bar which was for over aged 21's only. Our daughter (who is 16) could obviously not come in so this really limited us going in there together before going out to dinner. I fully appreciate the legal age of 21 being required - but offering no differentiation between aged 0 and 20 seems ludicrous to me and I think this probably stops a lot of folk from actually using the bar - shame - its really nice! Even allowing teenagers in until 9pm would have been more acceptable. Pool Area: Nice area, but got very busy early but the pool was really shallow (3ft) The Hard Rock was definitely more expensive than the Hyatt, and the upgraded Club Room was defintely not worth the extra money. Next time we return to Orlando we will go to the Club room at the Royal Pacific (we physically went and checked it out!).

As with other Universal (and Disney for that matter) hotels and restaurants, as we were a party of 6, a gratuity of 18% was automatically added to our bill/check when we ate in the hotel.

I even had Eggs Benedict made for me and the waiter bought hot chocolate for the children. For the other 2 mornings, we went to the Marketplace (also in the hotel) and bought smoothies and bagels. Excellent smoothies - they take a while to prepare but are freshly made. It only takes 15 minutes max to walk to the parks and the Front of the Line passes for being hotel guests are a huge plus. You can bill purchases to your hotel account but not if you are checking out in the next 24 hours. The only downside was the noise at nighttime.

You need to accept all the highs with the lows though, and sometimes I continue to be amazed that this hotel has a supposed 4.5* rating. The highs: it is such a short walk to the parks. The pool and the Beach Club are great. The rooms are big enough and well-appointed. We love the theming and the music. For my birthday, they sent a lovely gift to the room which was thoughtful and unexpected. The lows: we have stayed at the HRH Orlando 4x now in one year for 23 nights total. Housekeeping is terribly inconsistent. We've had housekeeping try to enter the room at least twice with the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign clearly hanging on the door knob. Sometimes we get turn-down service; most of the time we don't and have to make repeated phone calls for the service. (Turn-down service is in our profile and is supposed to be automatic when staying in a suite, which we always do since we're Loews First Platinum). I have had terrible experiences with room service food quality as well. But, this takes the cake: we checked out of the HRH Orlando one morning, and maybe 3 hours afterwards, my husband realized that he left 3 brand new shirts in the room. Brand new as in never even been worn. Yes, we should've checked the drawers more carefully. Upon realizing this, we immediately called the hotel and were put through to security. Security didn't care. I had explained who we were, that we had checked out approx 3 hours ago, exactly what we left behind, what room they were in, and which drawer they were in. Security didn't care, and told me to call back after 6 pm because \"that's when things get turned in.\" This was between noon and 1 pm, and security wouldn't even bother to check if someone else had checked into the room yet. If someone had, I could see calling back after 6pm. But, security would not even make a call to housekeeping on our behalf. We called back after 6pm to follow up. It was just a tired, \"Nope. Nothing turned in yet. Call back in an hour.\" Another call an hour later yielded nothing; only that the HRH would take our information \"in case something turned up.\" Thanks for all the help. I've left a shirt behind at the Hampton Inn, and when I called, they immediately retrieved the shirt from the room and mailed it back to me at no charge. The Hampton Inn follows up with guests, but apparently this type of service is lacking from the HRH. I was annoyed at the complete lack of response from the HRH, and e-mailed their management. I did receive a friendly little note that they would do their best to find the shirts and get back to me. That was a full month ago. Needless to say that was last I heard from them. I am over the shirts. We absolutely should've checked the drawers (and this is the last time I believe my husband when he tells me he's done so ;) ). However, the lack of caring and utter unresponsiveness from this so called 4* property leaves me just shaking my head. So, take this word of warning from me: check and recheck the room for left behind items, because you will not get them back. Security and/or Housekeeping plays Finder's Keepers.

The common areas of the hotel are very well appointed with a friendly staff. Our room was a double queen and quite small compared to many other hotel chains that cater to business travelers. While clean and comfortable, the lighting in the room especially the changing area outside the bathroom was dim. Otherwise the beds are comfortable and the room suits its purpose if you are going to spend most of your time at Universal. We did request an additional rollaway bed which the hotel gladly provided for $25 each night. My biggest complaint was the lack any sort of controllable fan in the room HVAC. It is either on of off and is very quiet while running. While some may find this desirable, this is a busy hotel with guest coming and going at all hours. Especially in the early am hours, there are many guests returning from the bars at the City Walk. Unfortunately, many of them liquored up and loud. Because there is no sort of white noise to mask sounds outside the room, we were woken up frequently by loud guests. Also, this hotel caters to families, many with younger children i.e lots of hallway sprinting at 7am. While the hotel is hardly to blame for this, they could easily help mask the noise by installing or making available some sort of white noise generator in the rooms i.e the sound of a fan. The pool area is quite nice and relaxing. The palm trees and music give a real caribbean feel to this! As can happen anywhere, the only turnoff was the behavior of a few idiots. We did see one guest get in the hot tub with his shoes on and another who put his cigarette out in the water. As expected, this is not the place to go if you are on a tight budget. A cup of coffee was $4 in the cafe downstairs. A two shot bourban on the rocks at poolside was $13. A 16oz draft beer is about $6. We ate off site both days so I cant comment on the restaurant prices. Fortunately, we traveled with some friends who are Florida residents and were able to take advantage of a Florida resident discount room rate We mainly chose this hotel for the Universal Express pass priviledges as well as its close proximity. Although there are water taxi's to shuttle you back to the hotel, in most cases, its quicker to simply walk back. About 10 minutes and the walking path is very well landscaped and shaded. The days of our visit, both parks were crowded and the express pass most certainly paid off. We were able to get through most lines in 5-10 minutes. Some even shorter. Your room key also gives you priority seating at the City Walk restaurants. Some had waits of 2+ hours. By showing our room key, we were able to be seated in about 30 minutes. Overall, I would recommend this hotel mainly for the convenience factor as well as the perks offered to its guests.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lee, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAlways a great choice in Orlando!\u201d", "Author": "nickoula", "ReviewID": "UR17130756", "Content": "When my husband and I have to travel to Orlando for a convention, we always make it a point to stay at the Hard Rock for a few days before going back home!

Our visit last year was better. The staff were all wonderful and quite gracious this year, but our room was dark with cigarette burns in the furniture. There also seemed to be a lot less staff. No one greeted us immediately to help us with our baggage. The desk person had to call a bellperson to come and help us. I didn't feel catered to like in the past. We're not smokers, but we took a room that allowed smoking and was located on the first floor. It was available for our checkin, and we were early. (about 2:15pm)The first floor is not nearly as nice as the third floor, but it was very quiet. The bathroom was a little worn, and the beds weren't as soft and wonderful as the ones on the third floor. There were definitely less staff members, and room service was very unimpressive. The woman dropped off our meal on a fully expanded table. We had to literally take the food off the table, put the leaves down, and then reset up the table and place the food back on it after pushing it further into the room past the bar so that we could eat off of it. The lady dropped off the table and pretty much ran. I tipped her, but I almost had to chase her. It was only after she left that we realized the table wouldn't fit in the room without being taken apart. On the bright side, the room was right near the ice cream shop and on the same level as the pool and the Kitchen restaurant. The Kitchen is a little pricey, but the food is very good. I recommend the filet minon. YUM. The staff there are wonderful as well. They were very attentive, especially the young man with the blonde hair and the young man with the rosary bead tattoo. The ice cream is very reasonably priced, so we ate lots of it. The parks are a very short walk from the hotel. They are wonderful for kids of all ages. The pool is nice, but it gets crowded quickly. The man that supervises the kids' pool activities is wonderful! My 12 year old daughter had a blast. It was also very nice to have food and drinks delivered to us at the pool, but beware that there is an automatic 18% gratuity tacked onto the food and drinks. I felt that it was worth it. They gave ample amounts of food, and the servers were VERY attentive. (especially Tiffany and a young man that was African American with an underlip piercing) But I fear that like the economy, the hotel has seen better days. It's still nice, but it's not lavish and pampering like it used to be. For the price, I expected the same experience as I had last year. I did complete a review for the hotel, and I have been contacted by a hotel representative. I didn't expect an apology like I received, and the person did say that they will work to improve the hotel. And judging from my first experience, they just might.

We have two daughters ages 13 and 16. I certainly don't understand the negative reviews since our stay was perfect and the hotel was top notch. Check-in was quick and the staff were friendly and helpful. I asked for a room not on the third floor since that is level of the lobby and I assumed it would be loud (there was a concert while we were there in the lobby). We were put on the 6th floor in a garden view. We never heard any loud noises after about 11:00 at night and were never awakened in the mornings so maybe staying in a room away from the pool is a better idea. We spent one full day at the pool and really enjoyed it. Although the drinks and food at the pool were really expensive, it was a nice splurge to get them delivered to you in your beach chair (my younger daughter felt like a rock star). We had dinner and breakfast at the Kitchen and it was very good. Other mornings we just grabbed coffee and cereal at the ice cream shop. Our room was standard but much larger than other hotels we have stayed at. It was clean and the beds were comfortable. I didn't notice any wear and tear as others have indicated, the carpet probably could have used a cleaning but even that was not bad. We had no problems with check out, they held our bags for us since our flight did not leave until late that night. We were able to enjoy the parks all day. The best part as many have said is the express pass. We never waited more than 5 minutes for any ride. It was amazing and really made going to the parks a joy. If you ask my kids what the best part of the trip was, they will tell you it was the express pass. The walk to the parks was beautiful and only took a few minutes. We took the water shuttle once. My only complaint would be the free shuttle to Sea World. It departed the hotel at about 10:00 a.m. and left Sea World at about 5:00 p.m. We planned to spend the entire evening there watching the evening shows and having dinner so we ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel. Would be nice if they had a later shuttle as well. If you go to the parks, don't miss eating at Mythos. We had a delicious lunch there and the price we paid was amazingly inexpensive for what we received. I would not hesitate to recommend the Hard Rock Hotel.

It made sense to us because of the 7day tickets to parks, the tee shirts, and because we loved the hotel the last time. But we got upgraded to a KingSuite and stayed on the club floor the last time; and this time we did 2 adjoining rooms and were put on the 2nd floor. The rock and roll music at the pool begins at 9 a.m. and you can hear it clearly through the walls. Many people walk down the halls with their children and when they speak their voices echo; the acoustics down there are terrible. Sometimes we didn't get fresh shampoo/conditioner and they seemed stingy with the other toiletries as well. There were errors on our bill (we were charged 2 Valet parkings because we had 2 rooms, even though we only had one car) per day; which they gladly fixed but we had to bring it to their attention. So my advice would be: Stay on a Club floor, at least on Floor 5 6 or 7, it's quieter! I think the hotel is worth the experience at least ONCE for the cool decor, relaxed atmosphere, rock-n-roll vibe, etc. The second time, when all that wears off, you may not be as impressed.

We bit the bullet this year and decided to take our now 4 year old daughter to Orlando for her first long haul holiday. We hedged our bets a little and split the two week break between two hotels - the hard rock and the Hyatt Grand Cypress - the theory being that we would do a week at Universal attractions and then a week at Disney attractions and if one hotel was a bit poor then it wouldn't ruin the whole holiday Our previous experiences at the Hard Rock have always been positive but we approached this visit with a certain amount of fear not only wondering how a 4 year old would get on with a hotel that we had always percieved as being a 'young trendies' hotel but also about the hotel itself given some of the reviews that have been posted on here that suggested a hotel that was now worn around the edges and staff that were sometimes poor. Well our fears were unfounded. Our daughter loved the hotel and the room and staff were fine. We stayed on the club level and noticed a few things have changed since our last visit: The rooms now have flat tvs, Ipod docking bedside radio alarms and a DVD player (none of these devices were exaclty top of the range models but perfectly fine) The happy hour in the club lounge now doesn't serve spirits. There is wired and wirelss internet access in the room (i got a wirelss signal thoughout the hotel). it costs $10 per day or $25 for three days. The hotel gift shop is now almost exclusively clothing. It used to have a much wider range of branded gifts (teddy bears, wallets, alarm clocks etc). The pool bar adds an automatic 18% tip to any order whether you order it at the bar itself or if a server brings it takes your order at poolside and brings it to you. If i'm honest the service isn't perfect all the time. During the week the hotel was probably at less than 50% occupancy and therefore they seemed to have less staff on at the pool (never seemed to be able to flag down a server) but as the hotel filled up for the weekend then the number of staff increased and getting served became less of a problem. The turn down service was also a bit hit and miss - for the frist two days we forgot it existed as no one showed up ! However overall the hotel stil rates as our favourite - the atmosphere is relaxed and casual, the pool is just right for us (not too deep for a little one, has a lifeguard on duty etc.), the express past at universal is just a must have as it allows you to just try things that you otherwise wouldn't risk queuing 45 mintues for. If they could match the level of personal service we later recieved at the Hyatt I think they would have it cracked.

We were a short walk from both Universal, City Walk, and IOA or we could aways take the water taxi. Their memorabilia collection is extensive. We stayed on an upper floor both times and will definitely be back. If you have a Universal Preferred Pass you also qualify for discounts on the rooms.

We are a family of 4 with kids aged 12 and 14, so this was a nice change from the Disney trips we've taken in the past. We view spring break as our family trip, and we don't mind spending for a quality experience. Last year we were in Maui, the year before Atlantis in the Bahamas, and in between Cozumel and several Disney trips, including the short and longer cruises - we make spring break a priority family time and I spend time researching where we're going so we are sure to maximize the time for family fun. We had heard great things about this property and opted for the club level, which meant extra concierge services and food and beverage presentations throughout the day - something we took advantage of especially in the morning and late afternoon. That level also includes free admission to the fitness center, and I took advantage of that and enjoyed the fact that I could breeze in and out. The hotel key cards serve as your express pass for all Universal and Islands of Adventure rides, which was fabulous and well worth it to us. We ate at Kitchens two nights and found it to be very good - the kids thought the character visits were fun, too. The pool is large and well maintained, and they had a dj there who kept the kiddos involved and active. There's plenty of waitstaff who are quick to attend to your every need - in fact we were impressed with all the staff at the hotel. Anything we asked for they were only too happy to help us with. The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the parks and to City Walk, which provided lots of dinner options and extra entertainment. Truly a fun time. We paid a higher rate given the time of year ($499 a night) but given all that we got in return felt it was well worth it. The rooms are ready for refurbishing, true, but I heard that the club level is set for a renovation this year, which it needs. The last day of our trip there was a near drowning incident in the pool -- a mom turned her back for a moment and her very young daughter (who clearly couldn't swim) went under - we were very impressed with how quickly the lifeguards sprang to action. My husband is a heart surgeon and was one of two docs and an EMT who also ran right over - the guard administered CPR and she began breathing and was quickly taken to a hospital. This kind of thing happens anywhere -- it was clear that the hotel took it very seriously as they cleared the pool and quite a few staff were present and working to quickly stabilize the situation. There are lots of lifeguards present - but parents should always be alert for their children, especially when there are lots of active people in the pool. Speaking of the pool, the night movies were neat - you could swim while watching the latest feature and that was a neat extra, too. We would definitely return and highly recommend the property to anyone looking for a fun time.

The water slide was a big hit for my son. The location is also fabulous! Short walk to either Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure and the water taxi's come pretty frequently if your feet get tired. The only down side was the prices of the food. For the 3 of us, the buffet breakfast was over $50. Drinks by the pool were also expensive. I think it was $10 for a purple people eater drink. (If you can drive from the hotel, there is a Golden Corral about 2 miles away. Only $30 for breakfast for a party of 4, worth going off site). And the $14 per day to park your vehicle was a little exessive considering they do not watch your car. Someone put a large dent in the door of our vehicle. So watch where you park! Had dinner at Emeril's Orlando. Save your money!!! Ordered the filet mignon medium well, slightly pink in the middle and it came back like a charcoal briquette!!! Our party was pretty much done with their meal by the time the manager came over and offered me another steak. I told him no thanks, but they did take if off our bill. If you get the chance, go to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. The food was pretty good and reasonably priced. The best part was our waiter.

There was also a life guard on duty to ease any nerves. My daughter was able to paddle around the baby pool happily and the larger pool has a gently sloping side to it, making it easy for her to get in and out of. My only negative about the pool, was the pool service for drinks for food took far too long. They seemed to have plenty of staff, it just took forever for them to bring you your order and then bring you your check. We stayed on club level 7, which has a lounge for breakfast, which is well worth the extra cost as it saved us having to go out and find food so early in the morning. In the evening they had happy hour from 5-7, but it was a bit of a scrum to be honest, with lots of people jostling for food - snacks, appetizers etc and free wine and beer.

I would recommend this hotel to anybody who is visiting Orlando as even if you want to visit Disney, you could do so by car from here - which we did on one of our days. Great hotel, great location, nice staff and wonderful places to eat. One tip - don't bother eating at the Hard Rock Cafe - food and service was awful.

We stayed here strictly because they wanted to go to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure/Wet & Wild. This hotel is a great choice if you have teenage kids and want to go to the parks. Universal is within walking distance and the hotel will provide free shuttle service to the 2 other hotels on the Universal property. The Pros: The location is great and the kids really loved the cool \"rock and roll\" feel of the hotel. I was impressed that eery single employee was super friendly and went out of their way to be so. The service was top notch so they must be doing something right as far as training their employees. While the kids went to the park my husband and I stayed by the pool most days, and the pool is outstanding. They have a sandy beach pool which was heaven, and there were plenty of friendly servers who provided efficient service with drinks and food. The Palm restaurant is on premises and we dined there 2 nights. The food is outstanding by New York standards (we eat at The Palm in NYC all the time). In fact, the food throughout the hotel is excellent. We had breakfast every morning at The Kitchen and lunch by the pool every day and it never disappointed. We also got a ride one night to the Bice Restaurant at the Portofino Hotel on night and the food and service there was excellent as well. Yes, we all gained a few pounds on this vacation but it was worth it! The kids used their room keys for \"express\" access at the park to get to the front of the lines and they loved it. The Cons: I am Loews First Gold member and I have stayed at many Loews properties and although there are many positives about this hotel, I was disappointed with the quality, and the feel of the room furnishings. The bed felt cheap and hard, and the linens were rough and felt like sheets from a Days Inn. There were obvious stains on the carpet and they politely advise you that the sheets will only be changed every 3 days. I felt that the housekeeper did a less than adequate job cleaning the bathroom and room. In summary, if you are visting Universal and want a place to stay with the kids I would definitely recommend this hotel. The kids will love it.

I sent two days laying on the \"beach\" reading my book. Staff make sure your drinks are topped and your stomach's are full. The hotel is very private and in a great location. Walking distance to Universal Studio's. The only thing that I could say was a disappointment was the fact that nothing is included in your hotel cost. Everything is extra, from parking to using their fitness centre. The in room internet is terrible and runs at a cost of 10$ a day!

At first, I saw the Hotel and was amazed. As we pulled up in the taxi I was so excited by the huge, amazing looking hotel, with all the flashy cars outside and the extravagant reception. The staff were friendly, opening the taxi doors and taking our bags to check in for us. We went to check out the hotel and the swimming pool area looked absolutely amazing and I couldn't wait to hop in! When I eventually got in the pool I didn't like the fact that it was mainly full of posers, who would stand around in the pool up to their waists, sipping on cocktails and bottles of beer. I also didn't like the fact that the pool floor was covered in sand from the man made beach. The room's weren't that impressive either. It was nice to have a 32\" LCD TV, but that's about it. The bathroom was quite small and non de-script, the bedding was plain and boring, the view was a white wall of the hotel and a tree top and none of the rooms have balconies. coming from England and staying somewhere as hot as this, you want to enjoy your holiday and stand on your balcony looking at the nice view - but you won't find this at the Hard Rock. On our first night at the Hard Rock we couldn't sleep. The room next door was playing really loud music and they were all drinking in their rooms and running up and down the corridors until the early hours. My Dad went outside to complain, where there was already a member of staff so obviously someone else had complained first. The hotel definitely needs some sound-proofing work done to it. We got up early the next morning and headed off to Universal studios. It's a lovely short walk with nice scenery and the queues weren't too bad for getting our tickets. One good thing about staying at a Universal Hotel is the free transport and the fact you can queue jump the rides with your hotel passes. In previous years we had stayed at Disney for the full 2 weeks and found traveling to the Universal parks expensive and time consuming. I would like to say that the hotel staff were friendly, but most of them weren't, in fact I found some of them to be quite rude and stuck up. Overall I wasn't impressed with this hotel at all; the rooms were nothing special, the pool wasn't relaxing, the food was quite bland (except for the expensive restaurants - their food was delicious!) and the rooms don't even have balconies!! I much referred my stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge (in fact I much preferred my stay in previous years at Disney's All star Resorts). At the Animal Kingdom, the gym was free to use and internet connection was fairly cheap. At this hotel the gym and internet was expensive. Beware: you even have to pay 18% service charge for a bottle of coke at the bar. You pay the barman an extra 18% to open a bottle of coke!

Pool was great with the water slide and it being shallow all round was a bonus for us just to keep dipping in for a cool off. The memorabilia around the place is amazing youll take loads of pics if your like us.The location is spot on for IOA an USF we even took the free boat transport just for the hell of it even though it is only a 5 - 10 min walk right to front of the parks.

We're in our early 30's and were looking for a great place to stay close to Universal and downtown. We researched several options and decided to splurge on the Hard Rock and were not disappointed. We stayed Dec. 3-8 in a king club level room. Yes, it was pricey, but worth every penny. The room was modern and classy, and having access to the club room all day was great. We like to eat several small meals a day, so the continental breakfast, evening appetizers & drinks and bedtime sweets were all just what we needed to make our stay nice and relaxed as opposed to a constant search for something low priced and good to eat. We also usually spend a small fortune paying for sodas and waters in vending machines when in hotels, so access to unlmited sodas and water all day was a big bonus for us. The hotel staff was FANTASTIC. Everyone was friendly, accomodating and helpful, from the club room concierge right down to the valets. Room service was prompt, and the food wonderful. The proximity to the Universal Parks and Citywalk really made the Hard Rock a total fit for us. We could walk out of our room and be through the front gates in 5-10 minutes depending on just how fast we were walking. We could pop back over to the hotel at anytime without feeling like we were giving up a lot of time in the parks. Water taxis run until 2am as well, so if your feet are aching by the end of the day like mine, you needn't walk home. We can't really tell you much about the restaurants in the hotel. We dined out quite a bit. We did have appetizers in Velvet which were great. The portions are huge, so watch out! What really surprised me was that the drink prices we're ridiculous. I've paid a lot more for drinks at bars in major cities. One restaurant to check out is Bice at the Portofino. The have a mushroom ravioli that is to die for! Basically, we had a great stay.

Unfortunately, the room was smaller than expected and the bathroom TINY!! I was not impressed with the furnishings or decor of the room. Looked shabby and the furniture looked worn. Definitely over priced! We obtained the room using points but will never pay the price to stay there. When it came time to crawl under the covers, you can imagine my surprise when I turned back the sheets, only to find black shoe prints on the sheets!! I really don't think they had changed the sheets from the last person b/c fresh sheets should not have these markings. Called the front desk, requesting housekeeping to come up and change the sheets. ONE HOUR later, and four requests later, someone showed up. I thought it was terrible that I had to call 4 times to get someone to address the problem. Not good service Hard Rock! We lost one piece of luggage en route and was told that our bag would be dropped off at the baggage hold area of the Hard Rock, once it arrived, Fine; informed the guys in the baggage dept and they made note of this. I did a daily check with them and, no baggage. On the third day, I checked once again and they told me, to my face, that no bags had arrived. Imagine my confusion when I checked the phone messages in the room and was told that my bag was dropped off earlier that day!! Called the desk again and told them that my bag was suppose to be there. Fortunately, I spoke with someone who was alert enough to remember that the bag was dropped off and waiting for me. I told him that the guys who are responsible for watching over our bags told me that it didn't arrive?? So, moral of the story: don't totally trust that your bags are really being watched b/c my bag was sitting there for hours and they had no clue that it was there. Thank God no one got to it before me! Now, to the positives: the grounds... amazing! The pool... to die for! The Kitchen.... THE best food i've ever had in my life and the staff, wonderful!!! Out of everyone at the hotel, the food and beverage staff are the best! You have to eat at the Kitchen b/c you might never experience the likes of it again.

My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel from 23rd to 30th Oct and we both loved our stay there. The staff were all so pleasant and attentive. The Halloween Horror night at Universal was fantastic and we would then come back to the Velvet Bar for a few drinks. The cocktails were superb. A grey goose and lemonade was $10 as were most of the cocktails. Some guys arrived in from the park with their faces painted and big hats with flashing lights on and the bar staff didn't look at them twice, just got on with getting them a beer. So cool to have staff like that who don't judge at all. This was the same night Vince Neill (Motley Crue) was sitting at the bar and being really nice to anyone who approached him. Not for me, I like my rock a bit heavier...Rammstein anyone ? Our room was bigger than most hotel rooms and spotlessly clean, nice widescreen TV, CD player with a disc made up for us of mixed rock tunes which was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable and nice toiletries replenished every day. We didnt eat in the hotel at all but ate several times in City Walk restaurants. A bus driver told us the best ribs were in the Nascar Cafe and he wasn't wrong. They were gorgeous and we were able to people watch as we ate. The hotel air-con was set too cold for me in the lobby, bar and corridors, baltic would be the word..but I was able to keep the room air con off. The week-end brought big numbers of american teenagers with hormone overload ensuing and no sign of any parents. The pool was a pain with all this flirting, ie playfighting, screaming, splashing etc but thankfully they all left on Sunday and the hotel was nice and quiet again...

I've spent the past hour reading reviews of the Hard Rock, and it's nice to know I'm not entirely crazy. The place IS great.. Yep, it's expensive. I'm surprised that so many people would even think of spending two weeks in Orlando, period (there's other stuff in the rest of the country, and it's less expensive, less sweaty and more educational). Orlando is a diversion and little more. But if you're going to Orlando, by all means stay at the Hard Rock for at least a couple of nights and enjoy all it has to offer. Don't plan to actually \"swim\" in the shallow pool; do plan to hear lots of tasty \"classic rock\" and even the occasional Ramones or Hives song (bless you, anonymous Hard Rock programmers). The slide is fun; get wet and laugh about your back hair, and then order a cocktail. Don't waste your money on the underwhelming Palm Steak House, which is an extension of an overrated and overpriced franchise here in New York. \"Kitchen\" is the better option, but it's also expensive. BUT WAIT: You are at a really nice hotel that's a world away from your real life. The incredible 3D Spiderman ride is a 10-minute walk away, and you won't have to wait in line to ride it yet again (me: 19 times so far). So pay the money and have fun. Just don't waste it at Palm, and think about bringing bagels and cereal to save some breakfast cash. My husband and I have enjoyed two 3-night stays at the HR, and we're looking forward to going back there two days from now. First stay (we were an extended-family party of 15), it was merely excellent and trouble-free. The second time there was a bit of confusion since we came a couple of days later than the rest of the family, and they sort of gave our room away. That sucked for about 2 minutes, then they offered us an entire hospitality suite -- the place where the richer and more famous throw their parties -- for no extra money. So we had a full (non-stocked, until we went to the liquor store) bar and kitchen, surround-sound stereo with actual speakers, a few couches and a poker table that sat twelve people. It was much bigger, and nicer, than our apartment. Our nephews still think we're special because of that room; a minor hotel mistake turned into a major family triumph. Those folks really know what they're doing. This time around we are surprising my sister and her family, who are there upon our recommendation. I spoke to the front desk tonight, asking them not to spoil the suprise, and they were more than accomodating. That's what made me start reading, and now writing, this blog. SO, here's the deal: Rooms are somewhat shockingly nice. Staff really is beyond reproach (at least so far). One can walk easily to a bunch of fun rides, pick his favorites, and ride them over and over again without waiting in line. They're gay friendly, hillbilly friendly and pet friendly, and they're very good at diverting the attentions of the children who made you show up there in the first place. For the childless with some extra cash and an affinity for amusement parks, this is THE place to go. Your beloved will love you even more after a short escape here. If you hate children, or puppies, or rock and roll, or fun in general, this is probably not the place for you. For the rest of us it's top-notch. PS i can't recommend the Spiderman ride enough.

Drinks, food, etc are not cheap but the quality is good so we didn't mind. 18% tip is automatically added. Some people have complained about that, we found it convenient. Only thing that really ticked us off was the charge to park your car! - Staff. Whoever called them rude or unfriendly must have really caused a stir and wound them up because during the 2 times we've stayed in the past, all of the staff have been wonderful, especially the lovely guys at the Beach Club. - Noise/Music - It's Hard Rock. Get a grip! Surely when you book to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel you expect an atmosphere and some noise. We loved it! - Room Quality - No issues. Nice and clean, great ipod docking station and flat screen TV. Really modern feel. We had great views of the gardens. Only complaint was the trek to the room. It's a bit like a maze.

Check-in was fine ( stated I had joined as a leows member a fortnight previous and was given a choice of gift, but no upgrade) Room was fine but carpets/ furniture a little marked bed comfy and bathroom good size with vanity area.Housekeeping also was sometimes a little touch and go IE had to request coffee/ sugar but no real problems. The room also had a mini bar which we did use a couple of times but decided paying 3 dollars for a can of coke was not on so we went on to I DRIVE and bought them there. The hotel has music playing throught the hotel ( except the corridors) and this was fine. Had a couple of Cocktails at The Velvet Bar. Pool was great with good slide , beach area and Pool towels and if you wish Cabanas to hire. We ate ot the Kitchen a couple of times once for Breakfast and once for Dinner. Both excellent. Staff were very friendly and atttentive. Also ate at the Palm Restaurant( special occasion) but can not say this was one of our best meals on holiday as we had ordered quite an expensive bottle of wine(130.00 dollars) which the server had difficulty opening. She then got her duty manager to take over who in turn came back with the bottle open ( we did not see this happening) Refused this bottle as cork could have entered but this should not have been presented back to us . Meal also was mediocre. As in previous reviews the hotel is expensive but you prepare for this. Front of line access at the 2 parks is without a doubt a Major Plus. Paying to self park is a major gripe and rightly so. Leows should address this especially if like us you are there for a fortnight. Only one other complaint HRH is pet friendly and I knew this before I booked.During my research into the HRH I was under the impression all pets and their owners were allocated rooms on the 1ST floor ( we were on the 3RD) On returning one afternoon dog barking was heard coming from the next room. I suffer from Asthma/ Allergy to Dogs , cats, and other animals and was horrified as I had informed my Travel Agent of this condition and they were to request Non Smoking/ Pet Free Room.I proceded to inform reception but first of all I spoke to conciarge who states this is correct it should only be 1st floor for pets. and possibly this person had smuggled them into the hotel. NOT SO.This couple and their TWO DOGS had been allocated a room next to ours. Reception said we could move rooms -US THAT HAD BOOKED A FORTNIGHTS STAY AT A PRICE!!! .Couple with dogs were there for 2 nights. Declined offer but informed reception that many people could have severe reaction to Dogs as I have if in close proximity.

It is exceptional for Orlando in that it can provide a great holiday for singles and families alike.- I know that the disney hotels are all about the kids! We met loads of parents who were chilling out at the bar while their kids were within sight, watching the evening movie in the pool. The hotel offers a very high calabre of service and the general experience warrants its 5 star reputation. However, this standard is coupled with a chilled out and casual environment, resulting in guests being entirely relaxed. I think this hotel encompasses everything Orlando is about and delivers it with on a 5 star plate- it is fun, lively and chilled out yet luxurious.

I just don't think you could be in a bad mood at this hotel as its so fun (without being cheesy)!!! We wondered across to Portofino- it also looked wonderful but I believe Portofino caters for an entirely different spec.

We are also Scottish and wanted to feel like we were in America. Hard Rock is a represenation of the US culture unlike Portofino, which has the Italian novlety. Only bad point is that after 2 weeks in the hotel and an extras tab of $4000, we were charged $200 for a 2 hour late check-out. I thought that was bad customer service given the circumstances and length of our stay. That unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth but without this individual situation, our expericence would have been entirely positive.

Not to worry, however, there was all the difference in the world.

At $409. per night the price is definitely steep but when you factor in a real four star property, the free Park tickets, access to Club 7, and a three minute walk to immediate entry to all the Park attractions, it doesn't seem so bad. With temps near 100 every day the room key express entry feature was worth it's weight in gold. We took one day and rented a poolside cabana to cool off from the heat and decided it was a great buy. The cabana we chose was a new one with no TV (we chose this to keep the grandchildren in the pool) and a price of $50. for the day. With a large ceiling fan, a dining table and four chairs, and two chaise lounges it made for a very comfortable break, especially with poolside lunch and drinks service.

I have to say it really was a lovely place and the best hotel for us (me and my 15 year old brother). Although the interior in the lobby is a little dark, it didn't really bother us that much. As it was 8pm when we checked in there was no queue so it took like 5 mins. We were in room 6080 with a view of the garden which I was happy with. Originally I had wanted a pool view but sometimes the parties go on late there so garden view turned out best. I thought the room overall was perfect. The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was decent size. I loved the bigger sink outside the bathroom. Was perfect for me getting ready to go out while my brother was in the shower or vice versa. Plus the housekeeping were excellent - we were very messy! The watertaxis were an added bonus after a long day at the park but it really was only a 5 min walk if you wanted to. My brother loved looking at all the gecko's along the way - he really wanted to catch one but he couldn't manage it. We ate in the kitchen most mornings for breakfast and it was good but a little overpriced I felt but with no car we had no other option! We took the bus to seaworld which was good and a taxi back and we also took the bus to busch gardens which was good. The only real disappointment was the pool. Granted its great for little ones but they really could have made it a little deeper. Its great that you can lie there and have the water lap over you but with a hotel that has a lot of teenagers they really could have made some of it deep enough to swim in! Also I didn't like that the only bottled water you could buy in the hotel shop was some figi bottle that for like 500mls was $6.00. I don't know why they did that.

This hotel is the closest on-site property to Universal Studios. You can either use the complimentary boat to get to the parks or you can walk to Universal. The boat ride is cool for the kids but it is closer to Universal if you walk. There is a sidewalk that takes you literally to the front gates. When you take the boat it drops you off near CityWalk. As far as the room goes it was nice. I would compare it to a Nice Hilton property. The room alone is not worth the $200 plus dollars a night that it will cost you but what is worth its weight in gold is the Express Pass that lets you skip the regular lines. The pool area is awesome as it has a fantastic slide for the kids. We opted for the valet parking as it is 18 dollars a night compared to 12 dollars for self parking. It was nice to pull up to the hotel and have the bell service guys take your luggage and park your car. This is first class service. If you are like me and were debating whether to stay at the Hard Rock vs Royal Pacific because of some reviews that I read about the Royal Pacific being an older hotel, I would not worry about that. I did not visit the Royal Pacific hotel, but we did not spend much time in our rooms at all. I could have saved about 50 dollars a night had I stayed at the Royal Pacific. All in all I was very impressed with the Hard Rock. The only complaint that I have is that the beds in the room were very hard and uncomfortable.

Positive: Check in- very quick & efficient. Rooms- We stayed in a standard room (not club level). The rooms were of decent size with new updated furnishings. Very clean and turn down service was a nice touch. Pool- Absolutely beautiful, 2 thumbs up for drink/food service at the pool area was nice. It is wonderful that they do not allow guests to \"reserve\" chairs. Which made getting a chair available during the day a great surprise. Service- was wonderful, very friendly and accomodating staff. Management seemed strong (I say this in a good way) Location- perfect location. Easy walking distance to Universal Parks & Portofino Bay. Transportion- via boat ran very frequently. Although if you wish to go from resort to resort you must take the boat to City Walk then the boat from City Walk to the other resort. Express pass- an absolute must! If you want to experience the parks and are spending 2 days in the parks you should probably consider staying on Universal Property so that you can get the express pass to bypass the lines. (time is $) Negative: -paying $12/night to self park. While most would expect it in cities such as N.Y., D.C., Boston, etc. I do not think it is necessary to charge that fee in Orlando. -refrigerators cost additional per night. They do have a small fridge in the room stocked with drinks, snacks, etc for a fee. -VERY loud! Doesn't seem to be much insulation. We were awakened almost hourly with loud guests up and down the hall until 2-3am. While it is not the fault of the hotel for their guests behavior a little more insulation would work wonders. -Found the drinks down by the pool very expensive. A basic \"pink lemonade\" (with a little vodka) in a throw away plastic cup was $10 plus tax & tip.

We spent our first night at a LaQuinta and then after seeing people at the parks entering with express passes (and the lines for some rides on a Saturday were heinous) we looked into the express passes. Forget it - $40 per person per day. (That's on top of the park admission) Then we learned that if you stay at one of the 3 Universal Resorts you get express access as your room key is also an express pass! The nicest part of the perk was that the first thing we did when we got up on Sunday was went to the Hard Rock for \"Pre Check In\" where, even though you don't get into the room right away you get the coveted express pass! We didn't expect them to have our room ready right away but they called my cell phone within an hour to tell me that our room was ready for us. The staff were terrific. We were there for the parks so we were not in a hurry to return to the room.

The pool area is great (although there are tons of little kids) and there are activities all day long. We got a very decent rate as we are FL residents - but the express passes alone, which would have been $240 for the three of us, made it worth every penny. You do have to pay to park at the resort but you would have to pay anyway at the parks. The walk to the parks from the Hard Rock is a beautiful landscaped path that in 5 minutes has you at the Universal Studios entrance or Citywalk.

We had a great time. We stayed at the Hard Rock the whole time. It can't be beat for location. Its 5 minutes from the entrance to universal, and 7 minutes from either the farthest corner of City walk, or the other theme Park, Islands of Adventure. Rock Music permeates the facility. We liked this (although there was not enough Led Zeppelin... but thats our taste). Nevertheless, the rooms are quiet. We stayed on the 7th floor (the concierge level). We arrived at the Orlando Airport at 10:15 AM. The pick up service was great (Quick Transportation is the name of the company). They met us at the airport, had a sign with our name... it was very convenient. They were also very reliable in taking us back to the airport at the end of the week. This service kills Disney's Mears transportation. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 11:30 AM and our room was not ready. We spent the next 4 hours in the Parks, we got a voice message that our room was ready and we went back to the hotel to unwind. Our entourage included me (Dad) and my 15 year old and 11 year old sons. We had originally ordered a deluxe room with 2 queen size beds and a pullout couch. We got upgraded to the concierge level (I'm not sure why) with the same bed configuration. The room is big, clean, and comfortable. There is a high grade stereo table top radio that has a very good sound and has an attachment for an IPOD, something my 15 year old immediately took advantage of. The sound is almost as good as a Bose table radio. The large LCD TV was great. The 2 queen beds are very very comfortable, but the pullout couch (regular size bed), was uncomfortable even with a second mattress and comforter under the sleeper (both requested when we realized how uncomfortable this pullout was). Unfortunately, even my 11 year old could not sleep on it. We took turns. The hotel said they did not have a regular mattress to put on the pullout couch. The pool looks picturesque (see the brochure) but it is a novelty pool. You really can't swim in it... at least not very much. The deepest portion is a little over 4 feet, but most of the pool is about 3 ft deep or less. Yes there are underwater speakers, but it ended up not being that big a deal after the 8th time we dunked our head under the water to listen. The long slide (also advertised) is very long, but not steep. Adults have trouble getting started unless they lie down in the begining of the run. Pool side entertainment during the late afternoon is geared towards the under 10 crowd (i.e hula hoop contests and adults are excluded). There is a few nights of poolside movies after 8 PM and a few nights of live poolside rock music. The live music is okay, my son recognized the names of the groups, I didn't. When I booked the hotel (through Universal vacation package), I was told that there is a shuttle service between Sea World and \"Wet and Wild\" (the associated water park), so I bought the 4 park 14 day tickets. Well I guess there is a shuttle (I was thinking Disney), but I was mislead. The shuttle leaves the hotel at 9:55 AM to go to the water park and sea world and subsequently leaves Sea World at 7:00 PM and Wet and Wild at 5:00 PM. Thats right one pickup and one return (not every 20 or 30 minutes as I incorrectly envisioned). The bus (also unlike disney) has a sign encouraging the riders to tip the bus driver when they arrive at their destination. The taxi ride one way to Sea World is $15,50, and $5.50 to Wet and Wild (without a tip). We took the bus once to sea world, but after that we took taxi's. The hotels restaurants are excellent. The \"Kitchen's\" (name of one of the restaurants) breakfast buffet is as good as any upmarket breakfast and fits the quality of the hotel, The Steak at the \"Palm\" restaurant was remarkable for its taste and tenderness... and it was cooked \"medium well\" as requested. Service was excellent. The concierge breakfast buffet was okay, bagels, fruit, cereal, pastries (mostly cheap donuts)... but is nothing special. The late afternoon buffet was a mixed bag, some days it was great, and some days it was mediocre. It was convenient to be able to run over to the concierge lounge at any point in the day and get a good cup of coffee. We would stay at this hotel again (and plan to), but not for 8 days. We will skip the concierge level unless given to us again. Although not part of this hotel review, what we did discover is that there is not enough to do at Universal properties to last 8 days, but the details of this are for another review. Our room key allowed us to go to the head of the line for almost every ride... NO WAITS. This perk alone is worth staying on property. Think about this, there are about 9 real rides per park, 10 minutes per ride, and no wait. How long do you think it takes to go on every ride in both parks. Try 6 hours including walking (8 hours on a busy day and 5 hours on Monday).", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cA Rocking Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JWilson213", "ReviewID": "UR7549748", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel from April 26 - 30 2007.

We were given our room keys (the all important requisite for the Express line in the parks!) and told we would be phoned once the room was ready. 5 minutes later we were walking through the wonderful grounds to the parks. 15 minutes later my husband and daughter were riding the Hulk coaster! Hotel called while we were riding Jurassic Park so I called them back and they immediately confirmed our room number and said they looked forward to seeing us upon our return from the park. Room was great. We'd booked a deluxe room (2 queen beds and a sofa bed) and there was PLENTY of room for the four of us (two adults, daughter 13 and son 6).

Tasteful colours, ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cd player/radio (we got a complimentary cd at check in), cordless phone, coffee maker.

Every time we walked through reception throughout our stay if Rachel was there she greeted us by name and stopped for a chat. Dinner in The Kitchen (complete with Scooby Doo!) was great - they mixed a special virgin cocktail/smoothie for my daughter - and the memorabilia around the place is great fun to investigate.

Family of 4 (girls 11 and 13). Mixed feelings about the Hard Rock. It is a first class hotel in most respects. Check in, check out, concierge, bell hop, etc. all up to standards. Requested a high floor, quiet and this was superbly granted with a room on the 6th floor at the far end of 2 hallways from the single elevator bank (don't worry, these are the fastest elevators I have ever seen in a hotel of any size). The room had windows on 2 sides because of the end unit whch gave it nice views and extra quiet sharing only one wall. It was very clean and nicely appointed. Nothing to complain about. 2 queen size beds, not fulls like the Marriott does in the same price/class hotel. It was a longer walk back and forth from the elevators but worth it. Grounds are well kept; however, the general pool area gets a bit ratty looking by day's end, especially since many people apparently don't feel any need t o pick up after themselves. You see this everywhere today but more so here. I believe it is a product of the rock n' roll atmosphere here. The hotel can get somewhat \"rowdy\" in terms of noise in the hallways but perhaps to be expected at a Hard Rock. Pros: short walk or boat ride to the parks and City Walk, express pass for the attractions cannot be beat, nice fitness room, many activities for kids and live entertainment at the pool on Sat. night as well. You can also use the facilities at the Portofina Hotel if you wish, Cons: $3 for a grande Starbucks in the Marketplace and self-serve to boot. Breaks a record for me by far.

Dined at all the restaurants in Universal - Nascar was good, Hard Rock had good food, NBA City was terrible, Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville ok, nothing special; The Palm was as good as always, but the best part of trip was Mama Della's - at the Portifino. My husband and I really aren't into italian food, but EVERYONE said if you can afford it, that's the place to go. So we went on our last night there (you need rservations). It was AWESOME! The service was great, the appetizers, house / complimentary salad were AMAZING (one of the best I've ever had and I eat out a lot), the dinner was even better (large portions), and the dessert was so tasty (made fresh daily in-house) we almost ordered seconds. If I knew it was going to be that good, we would have dined there more than once. The only problem with the Hard Rock is the pool - we couldn't swim because the water is only 3 feet deep. There is no \"adult\" section, it's all for kids. We layed in the chairs at night (and there were still 50 people there swimming!) and listened to the music - they have nightly DJ's and there was a movie night (Spiderman).

We were in a Club level room on the 7th floor with a view of Universal Studios. The room was very clean and nicely appointed. Prior reviews have complained about noise but we didn't experience a problem. We were far away from the elevators, just a couple rooms from the end of the hallway. On the Club floor you have access to the \"Club 7\" lounge which had complimentary continental breakfast (bagels, donuts, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee, juice), evening drinks and hors d'ouevres from 5pm to 7pm and an evening sweet snack (cookies, brownies, and ice cream were selections while we were there.) Additionally, sodas, bottled water and coffee were available all day. The pool area was lovely but when arriving in the afternoons we were never able to get a lounge chair. They were all occupied or 'reserved' with towels. We were there over spring break so perhaps it's better at slower times of the year. The pool itself is very shallow with a zero-entry edge and a great waterslide for adults and kids alike. The water was very warm, almost like bathwater. As others have mentioned, the location of the hotel can't be beat if you are planning to visit the Universal parks. It's about a 10-minute stroll (through gorgeous landscaping) to Universal Studios and another 5 minutes more to Islands of Adventure. There is also a free water taxi and pedicycles. Having access to the express lanes at the parks was wonderful....we rarely waited more than 10 minutes (during Spring Break!) We enjoyed meals at The Kitchen restaurant. Thy had a \"kids buffet\" and a play/TV area off to the side for kids to hang out while their parents finish their meals. They had character dinners two nights. Our favorite meal was at Mama Della's at the Portofino Bay hotel (also a short stroll from Hard Rock.) We had wonderful food and service. Dinner at Tchoup Chop was fine but not as good as Mama Della's. We used the \"Camp Lil' Rock\" kids club one night. They had a great room for the kids with art supplies, computers, a large TV, video games, etc. My kids were the only ones there that night. They would have enjoyed it more if there were other kids to play with. It's very pricey at $12/hour per kid plus $12/dinner so we probably wouldn't use them again.

When I called to be moved, 7 hours later they sent someone to \"clean\" the carpet. Anyone knows you can't clean cat pee out of a carpet.

We ended up eating there 4 times for the convenience and only once was a waiter pleasant as opposed to condescending. The skinny, tatooed and pierced girls serving drinks at the pool also had a such a sunny attitude that they had to add a tip to our $17 tab! We purchased the meal plan for the kids which was horrendous. We were supposed to feed our 3 kids chicken fingers and french fries for 5 days? The park food at Universal is bad enough. Not only is the Hard Rock very expensive, I suppose paying for all the cool paraphenalia on the walls, but the food and drinks were outrageous, even for vacation prices. Our friend paid $14 after a tip for one \"rail\" margarita. Frozen drinks by the pool are upwards of $10. All 3 families that we were with felt gouged. The one nice thing we all remember is the poolside entertainment for the kids. The comedian was great. Also the proximity to Universal cannot be beat.

My self, hubby and 10 year old son stayed for two nights. We had a waterview room on the sixth floor. The room was plenty big with two queen beds, new carpet, a table with two chairs, a flat screen TV, Honorbar and coffee maker. Two sinks (one in bathroom and one outside) was a nice to touch to get everyone ready on time. Had drinks at the Velvet Bar and was very satisfied with the service. Pool area was very clean. Now for the not so good. Ladies bring your own shampoo and conditioner. The hotel toiletries were awful. They do supply a hairdryer (not the crappy kind attached to the wall) We dined at \"The Kitchen\" for dinner and it was not very good. Pizza was not cooked all the way and steak was way over cooked. Service at the restaurant was not good either. After being at the park and going on many rides we decided to take a break and go to the room for a little while. We arrived at the room at 3pm and it still was not clean and no fresh towels. Called for service and they said someone would be right up. Left and came back at 5pm and still no service. Called again and they said the same thing as last time. Finally at 5:50pm someone came to clean the room and bring fresh towels, this was however too late for us to take showers due to dinner reservations. The biggest reason to stay here is to get in front of all the lines at the both theme parks. All the rides were a 45 minute wait for the regular line and for hotel guests with the express pass we always waited less that 5 minutes.

When we returned back that night, no new room, and manager didn\u2019t know anything about it. Took approximately one hour to get our new room. They supplied us with 4 complementary breakfast buffet tickets to the restaurant The Kitchen on the lower level of the hotel which I must say was well worth the inconvenience..

We went at a great time of year, the parks were busy but not packed. We had no waiting because your hotel key gets you in the express qeue and the weather was like an Irish summer. We went to the Magic Kingdom for one night for Mickeys not so scary spooktacular and it was the best night we had there, amazing fireworks. IOA is really not that big but it has some excellent rides. We're lucky that our 6 year old is a thrill seeker and had no fear so got on everything she was allowed on. Busch Gardens is well worth a visit also.

The room was exceptionally clean, and was serviced every day with fresh towels, and Hard Rock Hotel soap (which we 'stole' a few of). No complaints with the room whatsoever. The staff were extremely friendly - much friendlier than UK staff - always smiling, and wishing you a nice day, and very knowledgable of the area when we asked where the nearest shops, restaurants and Walmart were. I didn't use the pool, so I can't really comment on that, though I did see ducks swimming in it in the morning - apparantly not a rare site. They came right up to us too - how sweet! The room keys were like Willy Wonka's golden tickets - show them in the parks and you're whisked to the front of the line - on the Hulk ride, we literally walked straight into the seat of the rollercoaster - literally didn't stop walking until we were sat. The longest we waited in across both parks was 10 minutes on Men in Black - but this was only because it had broken down! These cards are worth the price of the room alone. Perfect in every way - almost. There was only one slight hiccup which could have been a lot more problematic than it actually was...basically you can use your keycard to buy products in the park (and have them sent straight to your room so you don't have to carry them round the park) - to do this, they charge your card $300 to do this (just in case you do a runner I guess). We declined this service, but they still charged us. If we didn't have the money we would have gone overdrawn and could have been pretty nasty. We noticed this on our bill and questionned it.

This feature is not offered at Disney hotels, and it really makes the Hard Rock, Portofino, and Royal Pacific Resort stand head and shoulders above the Disney hotels. We've stayed at both the Hard Rock and Portofino, and we liked both a lot, for different reasons. Portofino is more picturesque and charming, as it seeks to re-create the village of the same name on the Italian Riviera.

Anytime we are traveling to a new destination I will check the reviews. I have found that you need to read the reviews carefully and filter out the ridiculous complaints. Unfortunately, most people like to complain about everything. If the vast majority of the reviews are negative, we will avoid that particular hotel. The Hard Rock was excellent. Some of the prior reviews talked of dated carpet and bedding, which could be true in some cases here but it wasn't like the place was a dump. The carpet in our room had some wear and tear showing, but it wasn't awful. While we were there, they were beginning to shut down wings of the hotel for new carpet, painting, etc., so this shouldn't be an issue once the renovations are complete. Prior reviews also talked about the hotel being so expensive. We chose to book a club level room which came with 4 park tickets for 5 nights. The cost was $330 per night but that also included the breakfast and evening appetizers, beer and wine. The upgrade cost about $90 per day, so the true cost of the room was around $240 per night. One of the other reviews mentioned that they would stay at the DoubleTree instead. I checked out the cost and it was around $200 per night with 2 free tickets. You would then have to take a shuttle to the parks and lose the front of the line access you get staying on site. Other reviews have mentioned it, but this feature alone is the greatest reason to stay on site. Unbelievable! We rode the Mummy 5 times in a row, sitting in the front row, and never had to wait more than 3 minutes. So I'm not sure what people are thinking when they say it is expensive to stay. I guess if you can find a motel for $70 per night, buy 4 unlimited 2 park passes averaging $25 per day, pay $12 for parking, a family of 4 would pay around $180 per day and save $60 over the Hard Rock or $30 or so over the Royal Pacific. It doesn't make sense to me. We stayed on site and walked to all the parks, came back in the middle of the day and went to the pool, then walked back to the parks later in the day. More Positives: Check In: I asked for an upgrade and got one. Check in took a little while, but I can't believe some of the reviews when they said it took 45 minutes. The people at the desk were great and I was more than willing to stand there for 15 minutes to be upgraded to the family suite, for free. Music: other reviews complained about the music in the lobby and elevators as too loud. We loved it, when you got on the elevator at 8:00 in the morning and had rock songs on your ride down, you were pumped up for the day. Proximity to Parks: easy 5 minute walk to the front gate of Universal, 10 minutes to Islands of Adventure. Here's the negatives: Club room- not bad, but not worth the $90 per day to upgrade. The breakfast was really the only deal to be had. We may have covered our $90 extra with breakfast, appetizers, and drinks on some of the days, but not all. Pool Cabanas- the club room allowed us to get poolside cabanas for 1/2 price. I found that we only used them a couple hours a day and many days we would get there and a storm would roll through and close the pool. Take your chances and try to grab a chair instead of spending the $60-$120 to get a cabana. Pool- It was a little shallow but my 11 and 9 year olds thought the underwater music was great. The adults have to go towards one corner where the water was around 4 feet deep to actually swim, otherwise you could just sit on the bottom with your head out of the water. Food/Drinks- expensive but expected at resorts. It's not like the Hard Rock charges any more than any other resort in the country. We checked out the 2 other hotels while we were there as well. The Portofino was beautiful, but it is pretty far away from the parks. You would have to use the shuttle boats to get to the parks if you have kids or if you have been in the parks all day and don't feel like walking another mile to get back. The Royal Pacific is closer to the Island of Adventure, about the same distance as the walk from the Hard Rock to the Universal gate. We are going back in January and are staying at the Royal Pacific. We are going for the least expensive room and it includes 2 adult passes for $209 per night, (not sure why some people will still say this is expensive). We found that the view from the room means very little to us. We were out of the room by 8:30 in the morning, came back to change for the pool, then returned to change and go out to dinner. We didn't spend much time in the room so the view meant very little to us, not worth the extra $30 per day to get a water view. Being veterans of Disney, we really enjoyed the experience here. Our kids loved the Hard Rock and Universal. We don't go into vacations looking to find something wrong with the places we stay. These are upscale hotels with all the amenities you would want, great restaurants, and front of the line acces which can't be undervalued. I hoped this helped most of you, read the other reviews carefully and decide if the people complaining about waiting at check in, a stain on the carpet, noise from kids in the hall, music too loud, pool to shallow, drinks too expensive, etc, need to lighten up and enjoy their vacations.

The property's location to Islands of Adventure, Universal, and Citywalk made for plenty of entertainment options for the kids and adults at night.

We travel every year for Halloween Horror Nights. My boyfriend has two young children and we play like teenages. However, I travel on business and I am used to the perks of staying on a concierge level floor. Upon arrival we upgraded to the club level expecting concierge floor sophistication. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, THINK AGAIN. The club lounge is constantly over run by children and families looking for free food and drinks. It is consistently out of supplies and does not provide the relaxing atmosphere one might expect when they pay over $100 a night to upgrade to a concierge level floor. I agree with the 8/28/06 review I read upon my return. If you are traveling with children and like the idea of taking advantage of the hotel's club level offerings and raping the other hotel guests of an opportunity to enjoy a nice atmosphere, then you should most definitely book the club level room. If you are looking for a place to have an adult, sophisticated environment, save your money. You will not find it here. The club level rooms should be described more accurately to the hotel guests by management as associated with a play lounge for the kids. That being said, we loved the hotel and had a wonderful stay. We just won't waste our money on the club level next time, unless we bring our kids.!", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City,Okla", "Title": "\u201cImportant!!Read the true Hard Rock Hotel Review\u201d", "Author": "travelpro22", "ReviewID": "UR5904419", "Content": "Before I start, I want everyone to know I have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel 4 different times and go to Universal several times a year. I have stayed at many properties around Universal and Disney, some very good and some that were horrible. Always remember a vacation or trip is what YOU make it, as a business traveler I experience \"bumps\" along the way almost every trip I make (30-40 trips a year). Having said this I will proceed, The Hard rock is a wonderful hotel full of energy and music. If you have teenagers, they will love the place, if you are bringing grandma and granpa, they will probably hate it. If you are looking to save money, stay somewhere else, IT IS Pricey. I hate when people complain at the price of cokes, food, parking, etc., when they book a room at $260 dollars a night. HELLO??? If you pay that much for a room, do you really think everything at the hotel is going to be cheap?? Also, people complain about the noise??? It is the Hard Rock Hotel, at a Theme Park with kids, kids, kids, did I mention kids?? This is not the Best Western on some deserted highway in Arizona. The Hard Rock is downtown at Party Central, this place does not go to bed until late, if you can't handle it, it is probably best you stay somewhere else. I will now address other issues that always seem to come up about the Hard Rock. 1-Checkin in-Do not expect to get into your room before 4:00 pm, it is probably NOT going to happen. Drop the bags and go to Citywalk or the parks. Everyone gets wound up when the room is not ready when they show up-Here is your warning, it is going to happen, now get over it. 2-Price-It is expensive to stay at the Hard Rock, the food and drinks are high and you will be charged for parking. There is bottled water in the room, if you drink it, they will charge you. Funny, no one ever mentions the tag on the bottle saying the price of the water and that they will charge you. Those tags that are on every bottle of water from all the hotels around the USA must just Magically disappear at the Hard Rock. 3-Noise-I once read a review where a woman complained about all the noise and that they were having a concert in the LOBBY of the Hard Rock Hotel....Hmmmm... ever heard of \"Velvet Sessions\" that happens every month at the hotel. That is part of the draw at the Hard Rock to see famous musicians around the hotel and in the restaurants. 4-Rooms-Yes the reviews are right, the rooms are getting a little shabby due to high traffic at the hotel. But, the hotel's rooms are currently being renovated and each new renovated room features flat screen TV's and docks for the IPODS.Nice.. 5-Pool-Very large pool with great slide and underwater speakers. Pool bar is great, drinks are high. To summarize----After reading this review, I'm guessing most are asking why stay at the Hard Rock??? The rooms are expensive, food and drinks are expensive, you have to pay to park, the rooms are showing age, it can be loud and there are kids running everywhere. Express Passes..........:)...:)...:)....:)LOL...LOL...LOL This is the key, the magic pass, the big Kahuna...the whip topping..OH Baby...OH Baby... Take a hour wait at a ride and do it in less than 2 minutes, walk right by all the poor suckers waiting in line to ride Spiderman, Hulk, Jurassic Park, Mummy, etc.,in 100 degree heat, all sweaty and grouchy with whiny kids complaining about waiting all day to ride a ride. You know,,, sometimes I almost feel guilty about jumping to the front of the line....NOT!!!!! Let's do the math, the express passes you buy in the park are around $35-$40 dollars a day per person and you get to ride each ride ONCE. So we have 5 people,, 5X$35.00=$175.00 plus the cost of the Holiday Inn across the street at $129.00 plus tax. Basically you are better off to stay at Universal's properties because the Room Key is you UNLIMITED express pass. This alone makes all 3 Universal Hotels worth their weight in GOLD.. I hope the review will shed some light on the Hard Rock Hotel..Remember, all Hotels have problems and most will try to make your stay as comfortable as they can, have a open mind and don't let little blunders ruin your trip. I hope you and your family enjoy Universal and Islands of Adventure as much as we do, if you liked this review, I also submitted a review on Universal Studios and tips around the park a month or so ago.

In July, my daughter and I arrived at 3pm anxious to get to \"Islands of Adventure\" on the first day of our vacation. It took 35 minutes of waiting in line to check in, we went through a maze of halls, elevators , stairs (and left a trail of bread crumbs to find our way out) to our room (which was no different than Motel 6 except the price was 260 dollars AND it was filthy ) ...as I change my clothes I notice dried food stuck to the table and more dried food and cereal crumbs on the floor. The base of the lamp had dried banana peels on it. My daughter gets chocolate squished between her toes from the garbage on the carpet. I check the bedding to see if it had been changed and I got lipstick all over my hand when I pulled back the bedspread. There dust all over the credenza and TV and I was petrified to look in the bathroom. I was LIVID... So now we spend 35 minutes waiting for houskeeping to come. an hour waitng around while they RE- CLEANED the room, then another hour waiting for management to come which, after three phone calls to the front desk inquiring to thier where-abouts, NEVER SHOWED UP!!!! Thats when we decided to leave for the park let it roll off our shoulders and have some fun. After all it was the first few hours of our vacation. When we returned late that PM management left a VOICE mail indicating they would discount the room 60 WHOLE dollars for us. We go to bed. 12:30 PM .......drip drip dripdripdrip, drip drip I try to ignore it. This is now Chinese water torture. I go looking for the source...water is dripping down a water shaft INSIDE the WALL behind a metal grate. 1AM and I call the front desk who sends down \"maintenance\" the guy gets to our room a half hour later and says he cant do anything about it , and I quote, \"because all the water from the rooms upstairs drain down here from behind this grate\" Now I am ready to KILL management...they give me a filthy room and then they knowingly sell a room for 260 dollars a night that no one could sleep in because of the constant dripping. 2:30 AM we are moved to a different room with ONE bed for both of us to sleep in and we are both so overtired and angry we barely slept ...we left at 8 am NEVER to return again. Management never did come speak to us or apologize in any way. Our following day at Universal was cancelled and ruined because we were both zombies. The following month there was a 6.00$ charge on my credit card for consuming a bottle of water at 2 AM while waitng to change rooms.

I went down and talked to the supervisor who was on shift, He was stunned by what had happwened and sent staff to clean entire room and apoligized and gave us $50 off our room per night, He asked if there was anything else he could do and I asked for 2 tickets to the Velvet lounge sessions concerts, it happens once a month, he gave us tickets no problem and that was a nice touch to a not so good begining.

Check in fast, efficient and friendly. Asked for room upgrade as I'm a Loews member and was upgraded to pool view room which was on the 6th floor. Chilled wine and large portion of nuts delivered too (Loews benefit). Room was attractive and large with a great vanity area with a big curvy backlit mirror. It was a little tired but refurb is coming soon and really the tiredness wasn't that noticeable. This hotel has a very strong rock music theming, yet manages to convey this theme with humour and real style. The music is played in all public areas all day and I really liked it. The public areas are smart, grand and tastefully done. The pool area is magnificent - a real tropical oasis. I did have two problems. The main one was banging, scraping and hammering coming from the room above me which was very intrusive on our last day. I complained to 'star service' who said they were renovating the room above me and the noise would stop between 7 and 8pm, however it did not stop until 10.15pm. Then, at 7.10 am I was awoken with the noise starting again. I complained again to star service, and said I felt a 50% concession on my last night's rate would be fair compensation. I expected them to bait me down or refuse this, but instead they called me back and said they had sorted this for me! I think that was impressive service and I was satisfied with this outcome. The other problem I had was a burger arriving medium rare from room service when I'd ordered it well done. They delivered another one (and fries) with sincere apologies and a basket of fruit by way of apology. They were totally forgiven! Like everyone says, the theme park express benefits are brilliant. The walk to the parks too is really pleasant with a meandering path by the canal with loads of interesting tropical plants, many of which are labelled. I wanted to give them an excellent rating, but because of the noise I couldn't.

Me, husband & three children ages, 15, 13 & 12. We stayed in a club level room. Everyday had breakfast in Club Lounge, saved time & money. Fresh Fruit, bagels, muffins, cereals, pastries, drinks. Snacks throughout day available. Dinner had three hot items & cut veggies, wine, beer & soft drinks. Late night desserts snacks & drinks, mini canolli, brownies, blondies, etc. You save so much money. We ate lunch out but for the most part the offerings in the lounge were fine for us. Everyday we would each get a bottle of water before heading out. In the parks you will pay between 1.69 & 2.50 per bottle. We would get more water when we stopped in during the day and again at night. We also saved money at the parks restaurants and shops by using our AAA card for a 10% discount. Even when we went to lunch outside of Wet N Wild the restaurants gave us the AAA discount. We arrived on 8/16 at about 12:00 and our room wasn't ready but they let us go up to the club lounge. Cold drinks and snacks. The consierge made a call and within 15 minutes we were able to go to our room. We made reservations for the 5 of us and there were only two queen beds in the room. We were told at check in that they only have 3 rooms that have the sleeper sofa and we would have to pay $25.00 per night for the cot. I complained that we booked the room for 5 and should have a room that sleeps 5. I contacted my travel agent at Liberty Travel and they contacted the hotel and made sure we did not have to pay the additional money. I would only go to Universal & IOA if I stayed on site or bought the express pass. We rarely if ever had to wait in lines. The most would be 10 minutes. Some rides would say the wait was 40 minutes, and we just showed our room key and you are shown a separate entrance and get to the front of the lines. This also worked for us at City Walk. We went to Margaritaville and there was a 45 minute wait for a table. I showed our room key and they said they would cut the time in half for us. We sat within 15 minutes. We had the tickets for Universal, IOA, Wet N Wild and Sea World. My favorite ride was Men in Black in Universal, my husband and son loved Spiderman at IOA. My girls' favorite ride was the Mummy. Shows were great. You also had preferred seating showing your room key. Loved Fear Factor which we saw the first day. Thankfully we saw it then since it closed after that until Halloween. Our rooms were always clean and ready for us when we returned around 4:00 for a break. Turn down service also was nice, getting clean towels, and little gifts for the kids at night. We usually just walked back and forth to the parks from the hotel. Less than 6 minute walk. We took the boat a couple times, since it was right there. If we had to wait we just walked instead. There was a free shuttle from the hotel to Wet N Wild 10 minute ride and to Seaworld about 20 minutes. We took a cab back from Wet N Wild since the return shuttle was later than we wanted. It cost just $6.00 for the 5 of us. One last thing. My husband loves Pink Floyd. Hard Rock Live had a group playing in concert Pink Floyd's albums. He loved taking our son to his first rock concert.

I read many of the reviews on this website to research where to stay. We are in our early thirties and really enjoyed our stay at the Hard Rock. Reading the reviews we knew that check in was later. We planned accordingly and arrived at the Hard Rock around 6pm. The lobby was busy due to the Flock of Seagulls concert that was going on at the hotel. We had no problem checking in and the service was great from the bellman to the person working the desk. We found our room clean and adequate but like other reviews, nothing spectacular. The Hard Rock is about a 5 minute walk from the City Walk, Islands of Adventure, and Universal. There is a water taxi and shuttle service as well as some guys on \"bike taxis\" to get you to the attractions. We tried the water taxi the first night there and waited longer than it took to walk. Forget the shuttles and taxis and enjoy the walk. We stayed on the club level. The club level is good if you do not mind the price. There are extra perks including breakfast (fruit ,cereal, pastries, etc) as well as snacks, drinks, etc..We liked it and would pay to stay on the club level again. The only draw back is that it takes a while for the rooms to be made up. This usually does not occur unitl after 2pm. No biggy though...our room was always cleaned very well. The express pass is awesome. We waited no more than 5-10 minutes on each attraction. We usually got the the parks when they opened and had seen everthing by 1pm which gave us time to enjoy the pool at the hotel before heading to the Citywalk at night. Citywalk is also very cool! We would go back to Hard Rock. To us it was a great experience. We had great service and really enjoyed the proximity to the parks. The food was good at the Kitchen as well as the Palm.

We had a few problems - the toilet became blocked and this was sorted out immediately, but the door did not lock properly and this was not sorted to our satisfaction throughout our stay.

The pool was nice with a great slide for the youngsters, but the incessant loud rock music made it difficult for any one wanting to read!!

We stayed in a deluxe room which is larger than a standard room and has a pullout sofa and separate dressing area. I thought it was well worth the extra money for the space. Because of all the greenery around the pool, I don't think any room below the 7th (maybe the 6th) floor would really be able to see much, so I wouldn't spend extra for a pool view. The rooms are run down as others have said. Mgmt has told us that they will all be renovated next year. Checkin was a hassle. We had the same experience as most others have posted (room not ready, give cell number but they never call when room is ready etc). Lots of posters have complained about the noise. I have to agree, the walls are thin and you can hear what's going on all around. But that is no different than some other hotels I've stayed at. The noise didn't keep us awake at night or wake us up early. We stayed at the Nick Hotel last year and that hotel is much louder than this one. Also, they nickel and dime you for everything - want a microwave - $15 a day; want to use the mini bar - $15/day; you name it - $15/day. The kids menu at the Kitchen has a lot to choose from and my kids really liked the food. We also enjoyed the food even though it was no bargain. The express pass was the reason we chose to stay here. Yes you can purchase one for extra $ at the park entrance, but purchasing one does not give you unlimited rides. For the popular rides, you get only 1 express pass. When you stay at the hotel, you can always go the front of the line as many times as you want. Plus the quick walk to the parks is a great convenience. I think this hotel is the closest to the parks of the three. The pool was better than I expected. There are activities for the kids which they really liked. And the slide was fun. We chose to get a cab from the airport instead of pre-arranging transportation via a Mears shuttle. The cab isn't cheap ($40 before tip) but it was cheaper to do this than to take the shuttle. Depending on the number of people in your party, it may be better to take a cab: you don't have to go to other stops and you don't have to wait for your bus to fill up. You'll get to the hotel quicker in a cab. If you go to the hotel expecting to get a 5 star-type quality hotel, you will be disappointed - it is not even close. But if you want to go to the Universal Parks, this is a great choice.

As most things in Orlando are. If you don't want to spend money, don't go on vacation. Reading the reviews, it amazes me that some people bother to go on vacation and then spend the whole time angry about the cost. The Hard Rock is less expensive than most Disney resorts, but offers a better locations in relation to the parks than Disney does. Food and drinks cost more than they probably do at your local pub, but they are not out of line. We liked the Hard Rock for dinner and \"The Kitchen\" inside the resort for brunch. Hated the Italian joint in the City Walk area (forgot the name, sorry- wish I could forget the terrible service). Stayed 4 nights at Disney Polynesian then Hard Rock. Highly recommend using the Mears transport service. Cost was about $50 (w/ tip). Service was great. Guy waiting for us with a sign outside our hotel. Also used them to get us back to the airport.

We moved from a Disney property to the Hard Rock hotel for the last 4 days of our trip. The Hard Rock had a lot of ambiance. But after having been in Disney, the Hard Rock employees lacked the 'charm' of Disney. The Hotel, even though not very old, appeared to be pretty run down. We had to switch rooms the first night three times before getting into a decent room. And I am not the type to complain unless it is necessary. There were many good points about the property though. The pool is awesome. It is 12,000 feet. There are underwater speakers that play music while you swim. And one whole side of the pool is a white sandy beach. There are also private cabanas that you can rent all day or partial day for privacy. They have a television and sound system in the cabanas. There is also two hottubs, ping-pong and shuffleboard available. The waterslide is 220 feet long and very well watched by lifeguards. They also feature poolside movies on a large screen at night. But the pool and everything else closes at 11:00 p.m. There is a restaraunt/bar right beside the pool with fairly decent food. There is a club on property that I would check into the next time that allows you to have priveledges to check out music and videos. The club also has Happy Hour and Continental Breakfast service plus other benefits. I would upgrade to do that in the future. There is a wonderful ice cream shop on the first level, along with a Starbucks. There is Rock and Roll memorabilia everywhere that we loved. And the best thing about the property is that it is a very short walk to CityWalk and the two Universal parks. It was so nice to be able to come back in the afternoon to swim when it was hot, and not have a long haul or bus ride. Just a beautifully maintained short walk. There is also a free water taxi that takes you to Citywalk and the parks as well.

I am VERY picky, too. This place is very clean. (Unlike many tourist hotels in the area) - Very nice and modern features. There is a CD player in the room and they give you a mix CD to play. - Large bathroom and large tub. Large vanity area with all the necessities. - Wonderful lobby with several dining options and a club called Velvet which is nice. Velvet has a great balcony overlooking the pool. - You can walk to Citywalk and the Universal Theme parks. Very beautiful walk. - The Express pass to everyride, anytime, all day. I cannot stress this enough: THE EXPRESS PASS IS UNQUESTIONABLE - YOU MUST HAVE IT TO ENJOY THE PARKS THOROUGHLY! Would you rather wait 45 -90 mins at each ride in the sweltering heat, or just cruise on in as many times as you want? Staying at the Universal Hotels or purchasing the pass for $35/per person/per day is the only way to get them. I am telling you that you must have them! - The pool is just gorgeous! It is HUGE with a really fun slide. The great thing about the pool is there is always space to be alone if you are out for a restful sunbathing session. There are 2 hotubs and a huge bar. Sometimes a calypso band will play. Cons: - Theme park prices on the food and drinks. I just love this hotel! You get what you pay for. This is a very clean, gorgeous hotel that has great benefits. We won't stay anywhere else. I have never paid more than $199/night, just book in advance and check surrounding dates, it usually works out. Tips: Margaritaville has good drinks and is fun. Okay food. But you must go! Bob Marley's is a great place to have some drinks and dance. The inside is open to the sky! Hard Rock Cafe has the best fajitas ever. You can stay out as late as you want, since you can just walk back! And there are security gaurds all the time so don't worry =) And if someone in your party gets tired, they can just go back 1st and not drag you with them! I hope this helps to convince you to stay....you will have a great time here. Walking to the parks and the Express pass will totally make your vacation!

Check in was fast, no problems. Girl gave us our keys and said to show them everywhere in Universal because they do \"something\", but shes not sure what...ok?

Our room was suppose to be \"garden view\"...we had a really nice view of the roof overhang and a parking lot...not exactly what I pictured \"garden view\" to be. I really liked the separate vanity mirror and sink...Magnified mirror was nice too. Made it easy for three girls sharing a bathroom in the morning!. What I didnt enjoy was the little kids running around screaming at 6 a.m. and hanging around by themselves at Midnight. I actually had to open my door at 5:50 a.m. to ask what the heck was going on outside my room...sounded like someone was getting killed with all the screaming and banging going on...Turns out some little kid (no more than 7) was running around...parent just smiled and told me they were on vacation...NO KIDDING?!?! GUESS WHAT? So am I!! Breakfast buffet in the Kitchen was very expensive for what it was...something like $17/person. $3.50 for a bottle of soda downstairs. CRAZY! Pillows were very uncomfortable too. Maid service was ok...only gave 1 washcloth for 3 people...only get one roll of toilet paper, once you're done thats it, I guess...same goes for tissues. Had to call the lobby and they brought it up within the hour...long wait when you have to use the bathroom. Maid kept taking our bathmat and didnt replace it..called lobby and they told me they didnt have bathmats..(they had them, turns out he just didnt know what a bathmat was...once he figured it out, one was brought up to us). Should really think about moving those ping pong tables...they are RIGHT on the walkway...every time you walk by you get whacked by a flying ping pong ball. Pool looked nice...didnt get to use it...Pool closes at 11 and I witnessed employees yelling at people to get out of the pool at 11 p.m. on the dot!...GET OUT POOL CLOSED!! Never saw people scramble so fast in my life. Guess I'd be scared too if someone was yelling at me like that. One night it looked like they had a paint ball fight going on...paint (?) was EVERYWHERE on the sidewalks and stairs by the pool. Overall, I think the hotel is overpriced, after reading all the reviews and seeing the pictures, I thought it would be better.

From 5pm-7pm there are hot snacks, e.g. spring rolls and dips, chicken, corn dogs,etc., cheese and biscuits, salad & dips, etc. Also during this time there is unlimited beer and wine served. From 8.30-9.30 there are desserts available, usually cookies and/or brownies. There have been comments on the site about problems with check -in. I have to say that we had no problems at all.

I was surprised to find that we were treated very well by everyone. First of all, let me say that if you are wavering about staying at the hotel, it is worth it. The room key is like gold at both Universal parks. Using the Express lines at each ride or attraction made it possible to do both parks in one day, even during Spring Break week. We were able to do it all, then decide what was worth doing again and again. For my impatient 9 year old son, this feature made it worth the extra cost of the hotel. Also, the Hard Rock Hotel is the closest of the 3 hotels to the Universal parks. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the front gates of Universal Studios and the City Walk, and 10 minutes to Islands of Adventures. Being able to head back to the hotel midday for a break and a swim, then head back later for more rides, was wonderful. My 13 year old daughter enjoyed the movie night in the pool on Friday night after sundown. I don't know if that is a nightly occurence. We just went to sit in the hot tub that one night. Rooms were adequate. I liked having a separate sink area outside the bathroom, and another sink in the bathroom. We had two spots to brush our teeth and clean up. I used the coffee pot in the room, but was happy to find a Starbucks in the City Walk on the way to Islands of Adventure. The biggest surprise for us was the level of service we received from the hotel staff. My son became very ill after our first day there. The concierge gave us directions to a nearby walk-in clinic, and even mentioned there was accomodations to get us there if we needed a ride. Later on, the emergency services staff called to check up on our son and see if we needed anything. Also, when a toilet clogged in our room, a hotel maintenance worker came quickly to fix it. When our remote control seemed low on batteries, they were quick to bring a new one to our room. On our last day, with our son still really sick, we requested a later check-out than 11am. Not only did the guest services employee tell us we could check out late, but she even asked the manager if we could have even more time due to my son's condition. I didn't ask for that. She called back to let me know that we could take our time checking out. I don't know if it helps that I tend to assume people want to help me, and am pleasant with them. My husband tells me that is why people are nice to me. I think the key is to ask for what you want as nicely as possible, and to let them know why you want or need it. We never ate at the hotel, so I can't give an opinion on that. There was a young woman making rounds in the pool area asking if we wanted a drink. One irritation for me was how loud the music played in the pool area. I would have preferred quieter music around the pool. After being at the noisy parks, a little peace and quiet there would have been nice. Given that it's the Hard Rock Hotel, they blared music all around the pool. The towel service was nice. They had a group of employees directing games for younger kids, which seemed to be a hit. The sand beach by the pool was nice, but made for sandy pools and hot tubs. All in all, staying at the resort is pricier than staying close by, but the convenience to the parks and access to the Express lines made it worth it for our family.

The kids got a welcome gift of an inflatable guitar...they thought it was cool. We stayed on the club floor. I highly recommend this floor if you have children. The extras are well worth it. They enjoyed the breakfast everyday, cereal, danishes, donuts, muffins, bagels, bread, srtawberries, pineapple, watermelon and other melons, yogurt, juices, coffee and teas. Available all day was diet coke, coke, sprite, bottled water, lemonade and coffee and tea. Between 5 and 7 free beer and wine, always veggies and dip and different cheeses and crackers as well as two other different choices each night. Sometimes mini quiche, meatballs, spring rolls, panzerotti, mini corn dogs, mini burritos and enchiladas. It was definitely enough for dinner, we only ate dinner out twice during our seven nights. Between 8:30 and 9:30 they served cookies, squares and cakes and milk, a variety of teas also. The kids ate lunch mainly at the parks with the \"kids eat free\" pkg we got included with our room. It was good although a little limited, they usually had three choices at the selected restaurants. The express passes and the pool made staying there worth every penny. We were there during spring break and our longest wait time was 10 min. Our room was large enough for the four of us but not huge. Cleaned nicely every day, sometimes a little late in the day...but we didn't mind we were usually in and out. The kids enjoyed the turn down service, they left something different every night for the kids. Sometimes tattoos, bouncy balls, key chains, pens, note pads. We tried the ice cream place on the first floor by the pool once, delicious but a little pricey. We got take out to our room from the kitchen restaurant, it was excellent, and the small steak on the kids menu was a hit. The staff at the hotel were great with the kids, different things dowm by the pool each day, water balloon toss and cannon ball contest etc. They loved the slide and the music. We used the water taxi once for fun, the walk is truly only about 8 min. to the parks.

The hotel is a quick walk to both Universal parks and Universal City Walk. We could easily visit a park in the morning, return to the pool in the afternoon and go back to the park in the evening.

Our car was always waiting after calling the valet at the Hyatt; at the Hard Rock be sure to call at least 1/2 hour before you need it.

Negative --people in general in hotel loud/ drinking and some kids knocking on room doors at 3am and passing notes under the door .. front desk not responsive. Background music in general nice in hotel, ground, pool. POOL- excellent, warm ,big , kids loved the water slide-- negative was pool max depth about 3.5 feet; kids had a blast however. Grounds very pretty although dogs should all be on leashes. kids enjoed \"counting the lizards\" everyday on our walks. UNIVERSAL-- easy walk to either park or portofino bay (beautiful) or could use boats (in good weather) but often a wait. The parks are great and of course FOL access makes staying on site a must.

Note- can use and are encouraged to use all pools at all three- didnt try Royal Pacific but looked very good for kids. RESTAURANTS- good but overpriced . all the hotel rest had charachter meals at various times and special areas for kids to hang and eat, watch tv which was great for everbody.We had prepaid for many meals and tip was supposed to be included however this was vague and the vouchers were handled differenly (and i believe incorrectly) at several of the restaurants at all 3 hotels; but not worth the hassle of argument or even discussion to spoil a meal. Nice but very overpriced ice cream shop; slow however.

Although the room rates at the Hard Rock Hotel\u00ae are significantly higher here than most Walt Disney World hotels and many of the hotels on International Drive, there are many advantages to staying onsite. The most notable advantage of staying onsite is the Universal Express ride access. Hotel Facilities: The Hard Rock Hotel\u00ae at Universal Orlando Resort is a AAA Four Diamond Award winner and is managed by Loews Hotels. This rating is equivalent to a British or European Four Star / Luxury hotel. The hotel offers an interesting mix of rock music themed entertainment and visually perfect surroundings. The architecture of this hotel is in the style of a California Mission and is reminiscent of The Eagles\u2019 Hotel California album cover. The hotel features a number of rare rock\u2019n roll memorabilia throughout the public areas rumoured to be worth in excess of one million dollars. The hotel also boats a large heated swimming pool with a great water slide and underwater audio system. Other facilities included a fitness center, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, onsite Hard Rock merchandise store (very expensive), game room, shuffleboard, life-size chess/checkers, volleyball, supervised children\u2019s activity center, four restaurants and several lounges all of which were beautifully designed and immaculately maintained. Dining: We did not try all of Hard Rock Hotel\u2019s restaurants and lounges. The main reason was the high cost. The Kitchen was great but we did not manage to catch any legendary rock star cooking their favorite recipe for us. The Beach Club bar and restaurant were great! The waiting staff here were very patient, friendly, polite and helpful. Overall the food in the Beach Club was great but a little expensive. Nevertheless we dined there most nights. The Marketplace area was disappointing. The variety and quality of the food on offer was below par. All they had on offer for breakfast was muffins (three varieties only: blueberry, chocolate chip and bran), regular and decaffeinated Starbucks coffee and a few varieties donuts!!! However, staff members in the Marketplace were very friendly and polite. Hotel Location: The location of the hotel is perfect; it is right next to Universal Studios (5 minute walk) and Islands of Adventure (10 minute walk). The CityWalk entertainment Complex is only 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel. If you don\u2019t like walking or have mobility problems, complimentary on-site transportation is offered via water taxi or shuttle bus. The best perk of staying at this hotel is Universal Express ride access. You just show your room key card and bypass the regular lines at your favorite Universal Orlando rides and attractions. You do not need to purchase the Express Pass or get ride reservations. We did not wait in line for any of the attractions. Another perk is priority seating at select Universal Orlando restaurants although we did not use this Rooms: Our room was a standard garden view room (375 square feet) with two queen size beds. The room was on the ground floor and featured a color TV, stereo with CD player (you also get a free Hard Rock Hotel music CD to take home with you), 2 dual-line telephones, voicemail system, data port, internet access, coffee maker, safe, two sinks and a hairdryer. Our Experience: The Pros: Staying onsite is great \u2013 a real bonus. I admit that the heated swimming pool at the hotel was fantastic. The pool is very clean and the kids loved the slide. The staff working in the Beach Club bar and restaurant were great! They were very friendly, polite and helpful. The Cons: I regret to report that we experienced quite a few problems during our four night stay. Although the room was spacious and comfortably accommodated all six of us, we felt that it was not cleaned very well. The carpets were really dirty. We had to keep asking for clean bath towels as the bath towels were stained and dirty. The poolside towels were cleaner than the bath towels!!! We had an infestation of ants in our room but the management were not very quick to deal with it. On our last night we had problems with noisy hotel guests who had just checked into the hotel. There was a huge national building convention in the new Convention Center. This convention started on Saturday 7 January 2006 but many of the attendees of this convention started checking into nearby hotels including the Hard Rock Hotel\u00ae the night before. Some of the convention attendees were not particularly well behaved and because of all the noise they were making and their drunken behavior we had to call security to deal with it. Unfortunately the hotel management and security did very little about this problem and we got no sleep at all on our last night at the hotel. This adversely affected our enjoyment of the last day of our stay. In summary, we may have saved over $400 by taking advantage of the \u201cFamily Free For All\u201d offer but we got a dirty, and ant infested room and noisy neighbors. My family loved Universal Studios\u00ae and Islands of Adventure and the Universal Express ride access was a real bonus. The hotel was visually very appealing but the level of service was unsatisfactory. I had hoped that $229 per night plus tax would guarantee a clean and quiet room \u2013 no such luck! On my next trip I will try another Universal hotel or just stay in Walt Disney World.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge U.K", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to stay .\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4415574", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock for 14 nights with our two children (15rs and 12yrs).

Got a great rate off Expedia for the Hard Rock by paying in advance. The hotel common areas and grounds have a luxurious, modern design -- worthy of a much more expensive venue. Staff was reliably friendly and helpful. Valet parking was $17 per night, versus $10 for self park. There was no reason to valet - the parking lots are not that remote to your room. The rooms were average size, nice, but nothing too fancy. We had two queen beds and a rollaway ($25/night)in the room without too much trouble. There is an $8 charge to use the Fitness Center. The maid service was not meticulous, but was adequate. The rest of the hotel is quite clean and well maintained. The large courtyard view from our room was nice. The hotel allows pets, who use the courtyard for their own purposes. The pool is nice for the kids, with hot tubs and a water slide. We ate at \"The Kitchen\" and found the food was pretty good, service spotty. The kids enjoyed characters Shrek and Scooby Do coming into the restaurant. Of course the snack bar and gift shop are ridiculously expensive, but there is a Walgreens within an easy 2 minute drive of the hotel. The water taxi to Universal is a nice service and works well, but this is the closest hotel to the parks, and the walk there is a short one (5-10 minutes) anyway. We waited until the last minute to purchase our Universal park tickets, and ended up getting 4 days admission free through the Universal internet site. The deals change from week to week, and we got lucky. The two Universal parks were ideal for our kids, we spent 4 days there and never made it to Disney at all. The hotel room key - express pass system works like a charm. Our oldest rode the Hulk roller coaster 10 times and usually \"walked on\" with no waiting. The room key supposedly works at the City Walk restaurant / shopping area - - although this was spotty and some merchants wanted your credit cards. The room key works just fine for charges in the parks, which is great in that you are not constantly juggling large bills. Punch a hole in your room keys and wear lanyards for the parks! Ate at Emerils in City Walk - dropped $180 for two people, but it was worth it, believe it or not. Also ate at Pastamore (average) and NBA City (good) and offsite at Thai Thani(good). We toured the Portofino Hotel, which was picturesque, but it is farther from the themeparks, if that is your destination. For a family with kids, we enjoyed the music and the higher energy of the Hard Rock. For your rental car - try digging hard on the Alamo website.

I had to pay Rack rate since it was high season, but it was worth every penny. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and our room was ready when we arrived at 10:30am! Our room was much larger than our room at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and it was furnished in a light, hip fashion. I loved the squiggy drawer pulls on the chest of drawers. The room had 2 queen beds, a table with 2 chairs and an additional upholstered chair with a funky ottoman. There is also a minibar, which we used to refrigerate a small bottle of milk and water. I had heard that people were charged for items moved around in the mini bar, so I asked at check-in if it could be emptied. It would have been an additional $25 charge, so I asked if it would be ok to use it for a few small items. I was told it would be fine, because housekeeping would check to see if anything had been consumed. We reserved a garden view, but was actually given a view of a roofline and a poolview. You could also see City Walk in the back. Very pretty at night. Our room was the first room in the corridor after exiting the elevators. There is very little insulation, so you can here the \"ding\" of the elevator all night. Other than that, it was a great room. It was very clean, and the furnishings were cool without being outlandish. The bathroom was quite large and the lighting in the vanity was amazing. We loved the gingerbread house of HRH and Graceland in the lobby. We also made good use of the self service laundry room, the video arcade and the boat to City Walk. We had some ice cream from the Coffee shop/Ice Cream place and it was only ok. The Kitchen served up some pretty decent food and the servers there are a lot of fun!! My son, who doesn't usually eat meat, loved my steak dinner, and kept asking for more \"tastes.\" The best reason to stay at a Universal resort is for the Express Pass feature. Being able to walk onto Spiderman during high season is priceless. We were able to ride everything we wanted without having to spend hours in line!! We are truly spoiled and will always want to stay on-site, just for this feature! Our first impression of this resort is a positive one, as we found all the staff to be cordial and helpful.

The music is also a good touch, not just the elevator music played everywhere else in the world, good rock. The pool was good, it has a water slide and 2 hot tubs. But it only ranges from 2-3.5 feet and the center is always crowded. The restaurants are great, some are a little expensive, but it's vacation, stuff's always expensive. There was a movie night where they projected Jurassic Park onto a large screen next to the pool. Not exactly a new movie, but a good one. The staff was very nice and we never even saw the maid, but the room was always perfectly clean. And finally the proximity to the parks and City Walk were great, Hard Rock is the closest on sight hotel. Okay, some of the bad things, there wern't many, but they were enough to cost the hotel a point. When we got there, the room was not ready. We had to wait for them to clean it or somthing. But instead of having to put our things back in our car, they held them behind the desk for us. This also gave s some time to tour the grounds of the hotel, so that inconvenience was a bit of a mixed blessing. The Gift Shop/Store is good, but expensive. They also didn't have one of the things my brother wanted, a Hard Rock poker set. They had display models all over, but none in stock. :( Magazines and snacks were also very expensive. Once we finally got to our room, it was okay. However, we got a Garden View on the 3rd floor. We didn;t so much over look the Garden as we did the front over hang for the cars, and the parking lot. But we never really spent much time staring out the window anyway. The boat shuttle service is over rated. It's slower than walking and we ended up waiting for it for a over half an hour once. City Walk is fun, but I don't recomend taking small children to a resteraunt with a band, they tend to turn the music up very loud. Other than that, it was great. The Express Pass with the room cards is a good touch, we rode several rides many times. But the express pass kind of kills the atmosphere that they set up in the line. You miss many of the videos that explain how the ride work, which can get confusing with interactive rides like \"Men In Black: Alien Attack.\" There are also a few thing I recomend doing that we never did.

If you hang around and are in and out during the day, it seems to mess their system up somewhat. This hotel is really great for families w/8yo to teens. My kids thought it was the bomb. Music is playing everywhere. In the lobby, the elevator, the pool, the whole property just makes you feel like you are 21 again even if you aren't interested. I could have cared less and by the second day it grew on me. The location is the best of the onsite hotels. It has the shortest walk to the parks, less than 5 minutes. Has a short shuttle and water taxi if you don't want to walk. Has great concierge, valet's,front desk staff, etc. They were all very attentive. Though you do find yourself tipping a lot of people. However, I always felt they earned it, they were just that good. This hotel has a starbucks on site, ice cream shop, the \"kitchen\"(a casual restaurant), the \"palm\" (fancy), the \"velvet bar\" great indoor lobby bar hang out, and the beach club outdoor bar hang out. Much more. The pool is always 86 degrees heated, much of area around it is sand, outdoor sand volleyball court, pingpong tables, lots for kids to do at night to hang out. Huge waterslide during the day. Aside from all of that, the front of the line access you get at the rides at Universal parks by showing your room key is worth the stay alone.

Also, you can set up adult room keys so you can charge all purchases in parks to your room back at hotel and have pictures and souvenirs delivered back to your room so you don't have to carry them around all day.

We also booked our two rooms months in advance, and upon arrival were told that the rooms we booked were not available, (due to overbooking). However....the hotel staff was very accomodating and upgraded my mom & brother to the \"VIP\" floor. My boyfriend and I wanted a smoking room and the \"VIP\" floor didn't have smoking available, so they found us another room we were very happy with. The staff also provided us with \"VIP\" keys so that we could access this floor to see my mom & brother or have a drink in the lounge up there anytime we wanted. We were very happy with the rooms we ended up getting. The pool only closed once during our stay due to inclement weather, and there were signs posted around the pool making us aware of the closure and they re-opened the pool within two hours or so. Anyway, we were informed why the pool was closed. Also, the staff working at the bar out by the pool area was friendly and attentive. Our hotel rooms were really nice and were cleaned at a reasonable time everyday by the housekeeping staff. Everytime we got back in the late afternoon our rooms were cleaned. We truly enjoyed our time at the Hard Rock. I will say that it was pricey, but I think that should be expected....anytime you vacation at Disney/Universal, you should expect to spend some money!! The food at the hotel was above average, drinks were very good, nice fitness center, beautiful sand beach around the pool, nice shops, and neat ice cream shop. The hotel is definitely decorated beautifully around the Hard Rock theme, and the music in the hallways and the elevator is a reminder that you are at a very fun place. I do understand and would be upset myself if I had some of the experiences listed in \"Hard Luck at the Hard Rock Go Anywhere Else\" but I just want to let people know that this is a beautiful hotel and although we found a few minor things wrong with it....overall we had a wonderful experience at this hotel and I would encourage anyone to stay there.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City Beach", "Title": "\u201cIt Rocks\u201d", "Author": "kirotank", "ReviewID": "UR4038750", "Content": "Our family of 5 had a weeks vacation planned since last year for Hard Rock and Universal.

My father had the kids suite and it was like a small apartment but had a mediocre view as well. Club level is highly recommended and a suite if you can swing it. A warning to those planning on going to parks on the day of check out. Your express plus pass will probably not work.

Unless you looked at the soap, you would not know you were in a Hard Rock Hotel once you left the lobby. We were woken by noisy people in the hall the first night. One the second night (about 2am), commotion starting with the phone in the room next door ringing dozens of times. Then security at the door of the same room trying to get in. Then a few hours later a fire alarm. Fire alarm went off again about 3:30am the next night. Every morning, the wake up calls came at the wrong time. The handset of the cordless telephone between the beds did not work, making answering those wake up calls a lot of fun. A blue/green substance (toothpaste?) on the ceiling. No vending machines. So when you're ready to kickback in the room and relax with a drink and a snack, go downstairs for soda at $3/bottle and $1.75 candy bars for the kids. For what it cost to stay there, I would like to be able to sleep through the night without interruption, be woken at the requested time, be able to answer my telephone, have a clean room and not get gouged for a snack. Too much to ask? Maybe.

Got to the reception desk and was greeted by reception, the most rudest staff I have ever met. They barely greeted us, hardly cracked a smile. I mentioned it was our first day of our honeymoon and no reply!, then they just gave us a room key. I pryingly asked if the room had a king size bed rather than a twin and they said sharpishly no!, all kings are taken. Then I said \u2018does it have a nice view\u2019, they replied \u2013 its of the gardens, so I thought great!. Finally brushing off their attitude, I asked what we do with our bags and they looked at us and the bags and said: \u2018theres 2 bags and 2 of you!\u2019 I was so upset and the room we got given was in the basement opposite the base of a tree. It was a dirty room and 2 small beds with a tiny bathroom, which I could barely turn in! I then went back up to reception to complain, funnily enough another couple who arrived the same time were about to complain \u2013 seriously \u2013 I\u2019ve seen better rooms in a motel, not 5* standards.So then on the second visit to reception, they sniggered and then gave another room on the 4th floor slightly higher up the tree! \u2013 same quality room. Once again they never offered us help with our bags and cheekily said to the porters thinking I didn\u2019t hear, that they were to open the door for us in our new room as we were incapable of doing so!!I was so upset and instantly called our holiday rep \u2013 give the rep their dues as they confirmed after a minute call that they would take it further and call me back asap. 2 minutes later they had arranged an upgrade to club level. Fantastic news as we ended up with a lovely view over the pool and parks and complimentary breakfast. Just another quick point to round it up \u2013 the next morning around 9am we were called by reception to come asap \u2013 no warning what about.

We are just your average family, not a rock star or movie star. However, we were treated like one. We are members of Loew's First Club. I do recommend joining it. You get a few extra perks, a welcome basket and the newspaper, etc. But over all the staff we talked to at the front desk, Velvet Lounge, and support staff were extremely nice. I know that when we go back to Universal we will stay at the Hard Rock. The best part is the Express Pass that you get by staying at an on-site hotel. You get to by-pass the lines. We were able to breeze thru all the rides. The longest time was 20 minutes ( the Ripsaw Tide) Log ride. The only thing that was a pain was the fact that they didn't have enough staff maning all the stations, the Express pass stations, we had to work our way in some of the lines. I felt bad because of the looks people were giving us. I am the type of person who doesn't like to upset others, especially if they have been standing in a long line. I don't blame them for getting upset either. I just wish they understood the express pass program. The Hard Rock is the best. My kids loved the pool. We spent several afternoons down there.

First trip in over seven years together so we figured we would have some fun, check out universal and stay at the Hard Rock. What a mistake!!!! We pre paid and booked this vacation over three months prior to our visit. We had CONFIRMED POOL VIEW room with a King bed. Upon our arrival we were told that they had over booked and that their were no more Pool View Rooms available!!! Guess it didnt matter that we were CONFIRMED for one over three months ago!! I asked if we could be upgraded for our trouble and even offered to pay the difference for the upgrade but alas the manager smuggly told us that they do not do upgrades(guess I need to be a celebrity in order for them to do that!!). So we took the downgraded room with NO King bed and a lovely view of the back of the hotel and grounds shed(ugh). You think they would have offered SOMETHING for our trouble but NOTHING was offered!! Chapter Two. The second day we were there the pool was closed. We were not told why the pool was closed but were told that we should be able to use it tommorrow. Come to find out from one of the pool staff that the problem was someone dropped a glass into the pool. A normal hotel would have vaccuumed the entire pool and reopened it. Not the Hard Rock.... THey had to call a consultant down to EVALUATE the problem(two hours) then they had to call an independent contractor to come down and take another look( another two hours) then they vaccuumed the pool and reopened it(WOW you get great pool sun at 7:30 at night!!!) So what was offered? NOTHING!!! Chapter Three. Ah on vacation and there is nothing like enjoying the day in Universal Studios. Figure you will go back to the room and relax for an hour or two before you start to get ready for your dinner reservation? BETTER THINK AGAIN!!! Maid service did not get to our floor until 5:30 in the evening!!! ( I guess when you get dumpster view rooms you get the service to go along with it!!) Worse yet is the fact that when we finally came back to the room we found the maid coming out of a closed bathroom door with the toilet flushing. Oh just finishing up so we thought until my wife went into the bathroom to take a shower and found SKID MARKS in the toilet!!!!! Talk about horrified!!!! Well at least she was nice enough to clean if for herself first. Called down to the front desk to file a complaint and all I got was we will look into it. Hence, no call back, no compensation of any kind. Chapter Four. Last day of our stay(THANK GOD) Called down to the service desk( you think by now I would know better) and ordered a town car to come and take us to the airport. Tight flight schedule so we ordered it to arrive at 3:15. At 3:15 we were waiting but no town car showed up. I went to the service desk to cancel the car and take a taxi. It was now 3:40 and the lady at the desk told me that I would be charged the full amount for cancelling the service since it was not 24 hours before. I told her that not only was the car a half hour late but it also never showed up. Took her a while to understand that concept but she finally did. She then told me that a car would be there in ten minutes if I wanted it and that they would knock ten dollars off the fair( just keeps getting better) I told her to keep the ten dollars, Im already late and I would be taking a cab. All in all it was a nightmare!!!! I have never seen such a poorly managed hotel in all of my life!!! With the Hard Rock name and prices they charged I thought for sure it would have been glorious to stay there. I was wrong. If you want to get POOR SERVICE, and like getting ripped off, please by all means stay at the Hard Rock. Personally I work way too hard to spend my money at a place like that!!!!

We had one of the best vacations staying there. I agree with everyone that the room key being used as express passes is the best!!!! I don't think we waited longer than 15 minutes for any ride. With an impatient 10 year this was great. Ate one time at Universal Studios Monster Cafe and had a great pizza, would recommend. We were told to take the water taxi and did that for the first couple of days. On the 3rd day we decided to walk back to the hotel and it was no more than a 10 minute walk. We walked to the parks the rest of the trip. The hotel was great, we arrived at noon and had no wait for our room. Suggestion is to register as a Loews club member, you get a treat of your choice delivered to your room which is a nice treat and it is free. We stayed on the club level and if we return and I would not opt for this choice, a little over priced for what you get. Basically you get a continental breakfast(bagels and fruit) and there is evening snacks that are not worth the extra $$$. Even though I would not stay on the club level again, another benefit is soda and water available all day. I would stay on a regular floor and drive over to one of the local stores(5-10 minute drive) for snacks and liquor(Walgreens has a liquor store beside it, ask the help desk how to get there). At the hotel we only ate at the pool side resturant and all in all it was pretty good. We took everyones advice and did not eat at the Kitchen. We did talk to some other guests that had and their impression was the same as others, not worth the $$$. The pool side drinks were expensive, although good, so I would suggest getting something at the Walgreen and mixing your own. We did venture to Wet n Wild and were very dissapointed, long lines and overcrowded. There are alot of kids at the Hard Rock, which we loved since we had kids of our own. They have one night of a big screen movie you can watch in the pool. That was pretty cool. The last couple of years we have taken a cruise and gone to Cancun so had some concerns because we went to Orlando a few years ago and stayed at a Disney resort and left very dissapointed. This vacation was the best vacation we have had in the US. The kids rank it up there with the cruise we took last year. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock and we plan on returning the future. I have never written a review but because of our wonderful trip and great memories felt it was something to share.

Clean rooms Overly helpful concierge service Well kept grounds Proximity to Universal attractions All expenses at Universal may be charged to your room NEGATIVES: No operable windows/sliding doors TOTALLY defeats the benefit of a pool room view and means you have few options for relaxing in room. Clothes wet from water rides have no place to dry. Pool is NOT for swimming. Average depth is less than 4 feet. Too few pool chairs/chaises. They get filled up early. Limited food options. Music can become annoying over time. OVERALL I would highly recommend the Hard Rock, or any other Universal property for the simple reason that the room key/express pass is invaluable. 60 minute + wait times become less than 10 minutes. You can ride your favorites over and over and get much more out of the parks. Ultimately, the reality is that you do not spend that much time in the room or at the property.

The club level food was not as good as Disney's Yacht Club but it was still filling. We had cereal, doughnuts, bagels, fruit and juice for breakfast; chips and drinks throughout the day; fruit, veggies, cheese and usually some kind of finger food (one day it was chicken wings) each evening; and cookies and milk each night. The walk to the parks was short and the express pass for the rides was great. All the employees that we encountered were very helpful and pleasant. I even had one of the employees stop me as we were coming out of the Fear Factor Live show to let me know that the Men in Black ride was having a small problem and that there might me a long wait until they got it running again; he said we might want to head towards Jaws instead, to avoid the crowd.

The walk to the parks is very nice - quite short, and beautifully landscaped. It was very convienient. When we got to our room, our bags were brought to us pretty quickly. We had a cruddy view - the roof of the building - but since we had gotten upgraded we couldn't exactly complain. The room's bed was the nicest hotel bed I've ever slept on! And the pillows were MUCH nicer than the usual hotel pillows. The room was good sized and had a couch to sit on. The best features of staying at the Hard Rock: 1. Express Passes for the rides...without a doubt worth the price of staying on site! My husband commented that it spoiled us on any other amusement parks we will ever visit in the future. We literally walked right on several rides without breaking stride. 2. Closeness to the parks and City Walk: A very quick and easy walk, and they even have a water taxi if you want to bother waiting for it. We tried it once but it took 20 minutes and we could have walked there 3 times over in that amount of time. 3. FANTASTIC pool area. White sand beaches, two hot tubs, a great slide, and just overal nice. We rented floaties ($10 apeice for the whole day) and spent the whole afternoon at the pool one day. It was so relaxing! The pool resturant and bar was really expensive - $8 for a tiny margaretia was a bit over the top - but it was convienient. The only complaint I have about the Hard Rock was that the resturant service at The Kitchen was hideous. We ate there for dinner and we waited 20 minutes for the server to bring us a desert menu after we requested one. It was soooo slow! Plus they seated us outside in what felt like the middle of the sidewalk with people constantly walking right around us and staring at us. The other complaint is that we wanted a fridge but it was an additional $15 a night to rent one. At the prices we paid for the room I think a fridge should be included for no additional charge. Overall, we really liked the Hard Rock and would like to return again some day. Both hubbie and I liked it better than the Grand Floridian.", "Date": "May 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hard Rock Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Lanikai", "ReviewID": "UR3420871", "Content": "My sister and I spent three days at the Hard Rock Hotel in February 2005 and had a wonderful time!

Made our vacation - no rush - walk on for all rides - just a great benefit!!! Stayed in a garden view room Wednesday to Saturday. Had room 5129 which was very far from the elevators and ice machine. Room had two queen beds with white covers - a dresser with 6 draws, a large closet, a decent size TV, bathroom with vanity area outside area with toliet and tub/shower. Attached hairdryer in bathroom. Also had a table with two chairs and a chair with foot rest with it's own light. Room overlooked the water taxi area. Very quiet - never heard any noises outside the room. Could be because it was almost at end of corridor. Was able to get into room when we checked in about 12:30 which was great. Pool area was nice but got very crowded even though Wed, Thurs the hotel was not booked. Had one very hot hot tub and one that was just right - though filled with small children probably because the weather was cool after 5pm. Slide was pretty good - great for the kids - I went on it once and was surprised it wasn't bad. Hotel is very convenient to City Walk - short water taxi ride or quick walk. Never waited more than 10 minutes for water taxi. Buffet breakfast in The Kitchen expensive but not bad. Had just about everything. Had dinner one night there - excellent steak - melt in your mouth and very good taste. Pasta dish was just ok. Very good waiters both times. Quick and efficient and on top of filling water/juice glasses. Good bagels/donuts/muffins in deli on first floor - convenient for a quick breakfast. Had chicken fingers twice from beach pool bar - actually received them before the drinks one time. Daugther loved them. Thought the $8.00 frozen strawberry margaritta was terrible. Had one in a nice plastic cup at RPH also and both had a strange taste I didn't care for. As mentioned before be careful because the beach club at the HRH does add 15% gratuity.

We used it to shower up as we had a 7pm departure and so we store the bags with the bellman and used the park and came back showered and left. the food is very tasty and the buffett runs 15 for adults 12 for kids and it has everything you need and more for breakfast. folks the price is normal for resort prices so get over it and dig in. now dinner i would try elsewhere if the prices scare you. the hotel is spotless! the rooms are clean and the beds are just like mamma used to make so sleep in and enjoy. i've read that some people think the rooms are \"dirty\" compared to what? the white house? yes there might be a stain or two on the carpet,but i'm sure your own home does not have any spots right? and with as much use AND KIDS in and out of these rooms they do a great job keeping them clean. Bathrooms were great and no problems with towels and toiletries. i wanted an extra pillow and less than 2 minutes later it was on my head! great place to stay as usual as it was our 3rd time in 4 years. we tried dominoes and they delivered it for 20 bucks you got 3 medium pizzas with tip, remember you bought snacks and drinks BEFORE so get the ice and relax inside your room. everyone knows about the express pass so i won't bore you with the greatnes of that. we did disney one day and i will tell you what our 11 year old son and his friend said....\"disney sucks\" i would agree on that one as if your kids like adventure and rides u.s. puts it to shame.

If location were the only consideration this would be a 5 * hotel. The hotel is a few hundred yards from the attractions or a short Water Taxi ride.

We were a couple of hours early but we were allowed to check in and were promised a call on our cell phone when the room was ready (the official check-in time is 4:00). We went to the Islands of Adventure and by 5:00 we still had not received a call. We stopped back by the front desk and were told the room had been ready for a while and the girl just laughed when we asked about not receiving a phone call.

We found the hotel to be very clean -- carpets were fine. I think some of the past reviewers interpreted the subtle shading as dirt. We even saw them shampooing the carpets while we were there. The staff was very friendly, professional, and helpful-- top notch. Our room was truly one of the nicest we have stayed in -- and we have been in a lot of hotels. Everything was clean, new, amenities were great. Here's your tip -- We had a Loew's First Card (free if I remember correctly) and the upgrade to concierge level was $50 instead of $100 per night. Just make sure you tell them you are a member; they won't offer unless you ask. You will get a newspaper every day and some other free stuff, too. There are even better benefits, like free room upgrade, the more you stay at Loew's hotels. I think there's information on the website... Here's my beef(s) 1. The hotel is sorely lacking in sundries -- magazines, toiletries, sunscreen -- the things travellers need. The only items available were in the back of the Hard Rock merchandise store. A tiny little section, with things like individually wrapped aspirins. And you will not find a good store anywhere else on the entire Universal properties -- I looked. 2. We have stayed concierge in many hotels and it has always been a quiet, quality experience. Not at the Hard Rock... There were more people in that small lounge than in the lobby! People sleeping, unsupervised kids in pajamas running through tipping plates of food on the carpet ... the whole gamut. I got the feeling that some of these people had crammed 20 into their room and were using the lounge as overflow. Most times we could not find a seat & wouldn't have wanted to anyway. The food was just OK... I think it was because it was such a free-for-all that the hotel decided to put out the \"bad stuff\" or the \"unwieldy stuff\" to cut down on the gluttony. Many times it was as if a swarm of locusts had descended. The worst was the night that someone had set up their child's birthday party in the concierge lounge. They had balloons, party favors, and the food was... evening cookies from the lounge! They took big plates of them for their party, leaving store bought Oreos for the rest of the guests. I guess concierge is still better than buying food at the hotel ($13.00 for two cokes and a bag of chips), but it sure wasn't the treat that I am used to. Note to HRH: Consider having a family level and also an age 15+ level of concierge service. Or limit the age that can say on the concierge level, and the number of guests per room. Note to self: Ask driver to stop at a grocery store before checking in. The extra transportation costs will be dwarfed by the savings in bringing your own sundries and snacks.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "connecticut", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3284774", "Content": "Just returned from HRH. Stayed March 10-15. I had read many reviews before going. Because of the reviews I called ahead of time to reserve club level. Basically it is the seventh floor. Your room key has to be inserted into the elevator for anyone to even get up there. I was told on the phone that club level was an upgrade of about $80 per night.. When I got there they wanted to charge me $100. I got it down to $80 by explaining that to them. For that extra money you get breakfast which includes bagels, muffins, doughnuts, unbelievable cut up fresh fruit, and juices and coffee and tea. From 5:00-7:00 they have happy hour. That consists of bottled beer and wine. They serve hot and cold appetizers with a theme which aren't really \"hot\". ex. mexican night , taquitas, salsa and chips. One night they had meatballs and rolls, and pasta salad. Between the breakfasts and happy hour, we never had to have lunch. If you were to get 2 beers at the pool bar it would cost you about $14. They automatically add a 15% gratuity onto all bar bills. They also serve dessert at night. Usually just cookies/brownies. Also they offer bottled water and mini cans of soda, coffee and tea all day. We really feel it was worth the money. We saved a whole meal for 4, and happy hour can get expensive. And if you are at the parks when it its really hot and are constantly buying bottled water, that can add up. Make sure you check out all web sites to stay here because the same room on the same floor can be charged differently depending where you found it. The rooms themselves weren't anything to write home about. Who cares? They were very clean, the beds were very comfortable. You're not there to hang out in your room. The pool only goes up to 4 1/2 feet. The kid's didn't mind at all. (12&14) There is a basketball hoop hanging over the water, a 260 ft. slide. There is a volleyball pit, and a game room off the bar area. Some nights they have \"movie night\". A huge screen is pulled down in front of the bar area and you can watch a movie while you swim. The pool is always warm. If you have read any other reviews you will already know about your room key being used as an express pass onto all rides (Except the teradactyl). There we waited 45 minutes for an 80second ride. I know it was 80 seconds because I asked the girl working it.Other than that I wouldn't do Universal again without it! Supposedly you get priority seating at the restaurants on city walk with your hard rock card. I don't agree with that. The strawberry margaritas in Margaritaville are amazing. Be prepared to spend alot of money on food and drinks. Even at city walk, which is where we ate all of the time. We looked at a menu in the room and a cheeseburger was $14. That is why we ate at City Walk. I think you can pull up the hotel menus online. They are The Kitchen and the Velvet Room, and I think the Palm. Another thing- the parks are literally a five minute walk. You go out to the pool, and follow a beautiful flowered winding path right to the front of Universal. Or you can take a water shuttle.

We went with our 13-year old son, who for the most part, preferred staying by the pool- trying to catch lizards and using the amazing waterslide (by the way, it's fun for us adults too)....instead of going to the parks. The amazing part is that since you're so close, you can have some down time in the morning just to relax by the pool and get in some Florida sun- no rush to get to the parks early because they are in such proximity to the hotel- just a 5 min. walk or water taxi- in addition, with the express passes, we were able to do the Mummy Ride 3 times in a row in the time it took most families to ride once- TRULY INCREDIBLE- and worth the money if possible. This certainly isn't a cheap place by any means, but for us, it was the Disney trip of a lifetime, and worth all the extra amenities for sure!!! The service was also amazing!! Staff was Always willing to go the extra mile. While we were there, we enjoyed one of the velvet sessions where they have a rockband from the past come in and perform- as many of us 80's buffs remember well- the Romantics performed for us. The HRH did an amazing job transforming the hotel lobby from the luxury of a 5 star hotel to a hip rock-star party-like atmosphere. It was also great for our son because as we sipped on Martinis and beer, he was close by at the pool and always in close reach, which was such peace of mind for us. The whole experience was amazing, and I hope that we are able to return very soon!!!! The final thing worth mentioning is the MUSIC!!

Two rooms each night, on the club/concierge level. I had problems from the minute I checked in. Unfriendly front desk clerk, non-smoking rooms full of smoke (even the valet noticed the smell) and an unhelpful concierge. The trip was very stressful because of this hotel's staff. Upon checking in, the front desk clerk attempted to re-charge me for the first nights' stay in each room that I had already paid for previously (and had documentation showing it). The clerk argued with me for over 5 minutes, then finally relented. When I got to my two club level rooms, one clearly smelled of smoke, even though a sign listed they were \"especially prepared\" as non-smoking rooms. The valet noticed it and said he'd send up an ionizer to help. The ionizer never showed up the first night. Because the rooms were adjoining, by the next morning they both smelled like smoke. I called the front desk and they said they'd send up an ionizer while we were at the parks. When I returned later that afternoon, no ionizer and still a bad smell. I called again, and this time the concierge said she'd personally put one in my room, or they could transfer me to another set of ajoining rooms that were smoking (?!!) After complaining for a few moments, the concierge offered my party free breakfast the next morning because of our troubles-not a big deal since I was already paying for the club level's free breakfast and snacks every day as part of my room price. The ionizer was delivered finally and the rooms smelled better for our last night. Upon leaving I went to the concierge to pick up my rental car-as I had been told to do-(one of the other Universal hotels has a rental car company in the hotel), and the concierge couldn't find my rental reservation. He just simply told me he couldn't help me and told me to go find the valet!!! I have stayed in MANY 4 or 5 star hotels and never have had a concierge tell me he could not help me, then refuse to help. I ended up speaking to the valet, who personally took me over to the other hotel where the rental car company was located, and that hotel's manager and concierge helped me from then on. The Portofino's staff was VERY nice and helpful and if I ever go to Universal again I will certainly stay with them. The Hard Rock's location is nice in that it is in walking distance of both Universal parks, but the value for your money is not worth it.

My husband had to go out into the valet area to try and find somebody to check us in as there was noone at check in, and we waited for nearly 10 minutes for someone to appear. The girl had either been asleep or was under the influence of something. By the way if anyone has had problems with this girl, she was early 20's, with dark wavy hair tied back in a ponytail. Should have got her name. She was the check in girl from hell. She worked in the evenings the time we were there. We knew that we could get annual pass rates from checking out the availability on the internet through the Universal website. We didn't know that we couldn't get them at front desk. She kept trying to get us to go to a cheaper hotel, and even phoned the Royal Pacific to see if they had rooms and the rates even though we kept repeating that we wanted to stay at the HRH. She was telling us to go to the RPR, or the doubletree or a holiday inn. She kept pointing out that the internet was different as that was Universal, and they were a Loews hotel and nothing to do with Universal. Why are they then a 'Universal Studios resort'? At this point I could quite easily have snapped. Finally managed to get a room booked at $219 + tax for that night (though we were told that we probably wouldn't be able to keep the room that we had and would most likely have to check out the next day if we got the AP rate as they have different rooms for this rate!!!!), and we had to unpack my two younger brothers and all of our luggage from the car, get them to the room and drive back to the other hotel to use their internet access to book up the annual pass rate for the rest of our stay (which was $149-169 per night, with a night free for every 3 nights paid for, so quite a saving on the rack rate). No help was offered with all of our luggage and we had to struggle with it to our room. This room was definately not a 5* standard room, and had a lot of wear and tear. It was on the 3rd floor (same level as the lobby). By the time we got back to our room after booking up the rest of the holiday it was 3.30am. The next day we rechecked in and were asked if we wanted to keep that room or move to a different room, we chose to move up higher, and got room 6131. This room was better that the one on the 3rd floor, so much for nastier rooms for AP rates! The hallways do need sorting out though, and the carpets replacing. Housekeeping were excellent and were the friendliest people there. I decided to use the TV internet, but after it breaking 3 times within an hour and having the wrong type of engineer sent up to fix it (he was for the phones, not the net even though we specified what our problem was), we called down and asked for it to be cancelled and refunded, which it was. Though we couldn't check our folio out for the entire stay as that didn't work, even though we notified them. They do offer internet access in the business centre, but want $10 for 15 minutes. We used the net elsewhere for less that half that price. We had another run in with the check in girl when we took our annual passes down to be added to the booking as we hadn't swapped the paper confirmation for them when we moved room and had been asked to bring it along sometime. My husband asked if it was possible to add the Loews member number to the room, but we were told no as we had a special rate. I said that it was fine (we really weren't bothered), but she kept going on and on and on about how we were already saving $80 off the rack rate and if we wanted points then we had to pay full price and we were getting such a good deal etc etc. We felt like trash. I practically had to shout 'THAT'S FINE!!!' at her for the 2nd time before she would shut up. We might not have been paying rack rate, but we were still a paying customer. We weren't treated like 'royalty' or even like decent people, apart from by housekeeping who were lovely. The front of the line access is great, but I wouldn't pay more that what we did for the hotel. The check in staff and the concierge need basic customer service training ASAP. I doubt if I would stay here again, if I want FOTL I will probably go to the Royal Pacific next time, but only for a couple of nights. 10 nights here was too long but we didn't know where else to go. Perhaps Disney hotels know how to treat the guests correctly. BTW I am not the only guest that felt this way about the staff at the hotel, I was talking to another lady in the laundry room who had a similar experience with the concierge and ended up walking away from him as he was so rude to her. Rooms are nice, the pillows are uncomfortable, bathroom is tiny and you have to really try and manouvre around the bathroom door! Everything costs you extra ($6 for a bottle of Evian anybody?), the barman in the Velvet lounge is really nice. They had Xmas parties on in the lobby at the weekends (well the lounge area was shut off to normal guests), lots of very loud music and really drunk loud people wobbling around, not very nice. There was an ant infestation around one of the jucuzzis, and one morning we walked past the other jucuzzi (around 10.30am) and there were glasses and empty beer bottles scattered around it.

First and foremost, the hotel has a wonderful location. Of the 3 onsite resorts, it's the only one within walking distance to both Universal parks. You don't have to deal with boats or busses to get to either of the parks or City Walk. Secondly, using you room key to enter all the Express lines in Universal is well-worth the additonal expense to stay onsite in comparison with the offsite hotels. My wife and I were easily able to cover both Universal parks and ride all the major rides in one day. In addition, the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms (i.e. carpet and walls) are starting to show some wear, but they are nicely furnished and the in-room stereo is a great touch. Bring your own tunes, play the radio, or use the CD they give everyone at check-in. Perhaps the only real drawback on this hotel is that everything, and I mean everything, costs extra. Self-parking is $7. Small bottles of water in the hotel snack bar are $3.15 - before tax! Want to you the fitness center? It'll cost ya. Need high speed internet...$10 more. I realize that all of these things cost money to maintain but for $250+/night in peak season, this hotel should include a few more extras. If the Hampton Inn and their $69/night rooms can include free Internet and workout facilities, Hard Rock shouldn't have any problem matching. In summary, great hotel for getting in Universal.

The pool was the coolest I've ever been in and have thought of it longingly since we left. We brought a cooler with drinks and snacks and sandwhiches for lunches which helped with expenses.

Why they chose to dispute an $8.50 sunscreen charge when our bill was $2200 US is beyond me (especially since I repeatedly suggested they send someone up to the room to see the suncreen for themselves) - I guess they're not interested in repeat guests.

After reading mixed reviews on this board, I was a bit nervous about our impending trip. We spent four nights at the Hard Rock (Aug 13t - 17th) and couldn't have had a better time. We were there for Hurricane Charley, which the hotel weathered extremely well. We never lost power or any services - except the pool was closed early the day of the Hurricane and opened a few hours late the next day due to cleanup. The large waterslide didn't open until the next day due to fallen tree on it. The Hard Rock was the ideal location for my family (myself, husband and two boys, 10 and 7). We arrived before 9:00 am and our club level room was ready - already a surprise if you believe what others experienced. The hotel staff were unbelievably friendly and not only those who worked for tips!!! The club level is the way to go - the breakfast, lite dinner fare, drinks and dessert worked perfectly for us. The concierge people in the club lounge were very helpful with everything from dinner recommendations to checking our departure flight. They were super friendly and again they don't work for tips. The room was very nice - not too big but comfortable for the four of us. The maid service was very good and each night we had turn down service, they left small gifts for the kids which our sons looked forward to. They were small trinkets but the \"thrill\" of getting something each day was special for the kids. The close proximity to the parks and city walk is priceless. It is literally a few minute walk or water taxi ride to the park entrances. The express pass is worth it's weight in gold!! I actually started feeling bad for those people waiting in line without the express pass!!! Of course the price for the hotel is substantial but considering the location and extra perks it is definitly worth it! The pool area was beautiful and we all enjoyed the shallow water and the incredible water slide. Each day there were activities for the kids (and kids at heart).

All the memoribilia is great fun, just like the restaurants. I went to sleep beneath a picture of Frank Zappa! The kids never heard of him! The rooms were very clean and the maid visited daily. The internet access via TV was handy and reasonable at $10 for 24 hours unlimited access. The bar in the hotel was good and they even catered for smokers out on the balcony. The pool was excellent and the music underwater was a great thrill for the kids. A couple of big advantages by staying here were that there was no queueing at Universal or Islands of Adventure, really handy when some queues were 75 minutes long. It also meant no queueing at the Hard Rock Cafe on a Saturday where some people waited over an hour for a table, and the restaurant holds 1500!

If you want the mausoleum vibe try the Portifino across the street. We stayed in a club room on the 7th floor, meaning free beer & wine for happy hour, and free food during other parts of the day. This was extremely convenient for our family and well worth the price of the club room upgrade. From our first contact with staff and for 8 continuous days, we were treated like kings, and every request was granted. I could rave on and on about this place - but 2 things struck me as truly exceptional. Being there for a week, we decided to spend one full day just at the hotel (mainly the pool area), and for us it was comparable to the enjoyment we had at the parks. At first I thought the price of a cabana rental at the pool was a waste, but my wife talked me into it so we got the Yellow Submarine themed cabana for a day ($70 which is half price for club room guests) - this made our pool experience wonderful! The cabana acted as our motel room at the pool complete with TV, Phone, fridge stocked with soda and bottled water, Ceiling fan, table, chairs, towels, and privacy tent. and in the evening we had a great private view of the movie which was played on a huge screen poolside (with a fireworks preshow). My kids made tons of friends that day and had a blast swimming, using the waterslide, and playing the organized poolside games. Me and the wife also opted for massages that day a few minutes walk down a beautiful landscaped path at the Portifino Hotel. When we went to that hotel, (me and my wife at seperate times for our massages) we both shared with each other how the Portifino was beautiful, but eerily quiet and dismal over there -- and we both knew we made the right choice by picking Hard Rock. The second great thing is...well, perhaps the most overlooked and underappreciated thing about the place - the music. I heard some great songs I haven't heard in a long time (mixed with new songs). And it isn't the usual 20 songs over and over like the radio - song after song you never know what you will hear next - I only heard one song repeated the entire week. You can tell someone put a lot of time making the play list. The variety of musical genres represented were wide, and the tonal quality was amazing all over the hotel. All over you could see both staff and guests singing to the music -- a great learning experience for my kids! If you are a musician, shame on you if you stay anywhere else in Orlando. Your kind is accepted here! As far as the other stuff goes - our room was beautiful, had a great view (7th floor folks have no problem seeing over the trees) and the maid staff gave us Hard Rock gifts every day. The only tips we gave were to the valet, waitress and bartender (we carried our own bags), and we never got any funny looks for not tipping anyone else. The amusement parks were amazing but stressful, and the cut-in-line passes were a life saver. A lot of people complained about the staff on this board. For those I have this advice...I kind of got the vibe that the staff will wait hand and foot on those who appreciate the culture that the hotel has to offer -- as opposed to looking at the staff like they are overpaid slaves who you can walk all over just becuase you feel you paid too much for the room.

The first night there we could see fireworks from our window. Express pass by showing room key was very fine! Ninety minute waits turned into 3 minutes.

Instead of reserving for 2 people they had reserved for 6 and had the first name wrong. I think it would have been better to skip the concierge and make reservations myself.

Hmmm.I guess they don't like to upgrade the middle class. The service at the Kitchen was outstanding. The express pass was awesome. One of the few pluses about staying on this property. The final straw is when we went to check out. I called to ask if we could arrange a later checkout, as our plane did not leave till 7 p.m, and my two year old daughter requires a nap around 11:30. We were told that it was not possible, and we would need to be out of the room by 11:00. So my two year old took her nap in the busy hotel lobby. Most of the staff at Hard Rock deserves an A.

The food at the Beach Club was way over priced but we only ate there once and did the restaurants at City Walk the rest of the time and their prices were much better. The only thing that was bad was the free shuttle to Sea World. We went twice and the first day it was 40 minutes late and when waiting with 3 small kids that starts your day off kind of bad and the second day the bus was so completely over crowded we stood the whole way there along with about 50 other people and no air conditioning.

I'll start with the negative points first: 1)We are generous tippers and agree that people should be paid for their services BUT everywhere you go or every service you request, a tip is expected! This can be costly. We had to tip from the moment we stepped out of our car at the front lobby. Scarey! I wanted to tell some of the staff...LET ME DO MY OWN LABOR AND I'LL KEEP MY MONEY! I felt a little violated considering we paid quite a bit for the room itself and then to have to tip tip tip on top of it. Hmmmmmm............You would think the staff wasn't being paid by the hotel at all. They sure get over well with all the required tips. This would be the biggest reason that I would NOT want to stay here again. 2) The check in process took too long, especially since I paid months ago and had to only get my key and go. The check in person failed to see that I already paid and was going to charge me for the room. I had to tell HER that I already paid which is not good. 3) Reservationist spelled my name completely wrong when I made the reservation although I spelled it numerous times and 4) Although the reservation noted that there would be FIVE people in the room well in advance, we did not have enough towels upon entering the room which meant we had to call someone to bring towels which meant...you guessed it....another TIP! 5) Parking - self park is $6.00 and $12.00 for valet with in and out priviledges. Self parking lot is a walk and not welcomed on a very hot day or after a long, tiresome day. JUST A NOTE: Be careful with valet parking as a tip is expected each time your car is provided to you and dropped back off. Very costly. This is why I opted for self-park 6) I asked the luggage desk to have my luggage delivered to my room as our room wasn't ready at 11:00 am (no problem, we didn't expect it to be - checkin is at 4:00 pm) and the person behind the desk said \"no problem but leave the tip with me\". I found this VERY OFFENSIVE and INAPPROPRIATE to say to a customer/client. I was going to do that anyway but it should be MY DECISION and the person should have kept his words to himself! I did not use the eating facilities or swimming pool (due to time constraints) but they looked nice. Swimming pool was to close at 10:00 or 11:00 but closed early due to rain although I didn't see the point. It was just sprinking but..............that's their call....maybe due to liability issues. I won't count this as a negative as it may be due to safety. Can't knock safety. The advantages is of course the express pass. It was wonderful and I would not visit Universal Studios without it. The location is great if visiting the parks. Room was clean. No complaints there. Beds were very comfortable. Furniture was nice. Bathroom small but nice. No complaints about the room itself and I'm picky about it being clean! The hotel is located not far from Universal Boulevard where you will find Wet and Wild Amusement Park and a host of restaurants and other amusements. I would recommend this hotel but just know that is needs to improve in some area that I've mentioned. My biggest complaint is the tipping and my biggest satisfaction was the Express Pass.

We had already had one bad experience with \"seasonal burnout\" in an Orlando hotel we stayed at right before we got to Hard Rock, so I was a little worried. No worries, though! We had a great time and service was excellent all the way around. We got in on a Florida resident special ($139 per mid-week night for garden view). This same bartender said that another great mo. for FL residents special is September as they are usually about 30% occupancy and screaming for guests. Join Loews' First club and get some freebies, like your choice of a welcome gift (we got 3 huge chocolate chip cookies and a carafe of milk delivered to our room with a handwritten thank you note to staying at The Rock). Loews First is free and after staying 6 nights you get a free guaranteed upgrade. THe more nights you stay at a Loews hotel the better the perks. You don't pay for using the workout room, plus more. We arrived around 10 a.m. and while we couldn't get in a room, they do allow you do check in and pick up your room keys so you can begin enjoying the express pass right away. They gave us a phone number to call periodically during the day to see if our room was available and it was by about 1 p.m. Rooms are really pretty--beautiful color scheme of soft greens and blues. Very comfortable beds. Clean clean clean as a whistle. The only slightly negative thing I can think of is the room was waaaaay far away from the elevators (only an issue when you get back from the parks and your feet are killing you) and the hallways were FREEZING for some weird reason. HRH is gorgeous, very clean lines beautiful landscaping. I'm a rock fan so I personally loved the music blaring everywhere (if it's too loud, you're too old). Had lots of fun checking out the rock 'n roll memorabilia all over the hotel. Pool area is unbelievably, takes up the entire courtyard of the hotel and my little one loved the slide. Food is pricey but good (mmmm--the S'Mores dessert at The Kitchen) and they serve lots of it. The little coffee shop downstairs serves Starbucks and it is pricey, but what I've never seen published on any review is that you can get free refills during the same day you buy a cup by showing your receipt. Staff went out of their way to be accommodating--my daughter got really sick one night and housekeeping quickly brought up an entire set of linens. I got some weird skin rash and when I asked the lifeguard if they had a first aid station, she called for assistance and half a dozen people (including security, oddly enough) responded.

Both hotels are owned by the same management group, so we assumed that the level of service and courtesy would be equal between the two properties. Let me be the first to tell you, it is not. The Hard Rock is too wound up with its own glitz and popularity to stoop to anything as slow as common courtesy and good service. Our first indication of this was the fact that our room was no where near ready when we arrived at the appointed check-in time. It was only after numerous phone calls to the front desk that we finally were able to check in at 5:30 p.m. By that time, my wife was nearly dead from heat stroke, as we had decided to go to the park since we could not get into our room. I, myself, was tired because the Hard Rock has no adequate facilities for moving your luggage from the parking area to your room. Guests must either endure the conga line of traffic to the front portico or hike up a mountain of stairs from the parking area. I chose the stairs, and it was after my long march up the stairs that the doorman greeted me with, \u201cDude, that luggage looks heavy.\u201d He was nice enough to open the door, but the thought of helping with my luggage did not enter his pierced and studded head. The room itself was nicely appointed with a good view of the garden. I was surprised by the comfortable bed, pillows, and quiet surroundings. Since most of the guests like to party, it is good to know that the Hard Rock has thick walls. After a hard and sweaty day at the park, we decided to hit the famous Hard Rock pool. It is huge and well-designed. Unfortunately, it is usually swarming with kids and sometimes there are \u201caccidents.\u201d As we approached the pool, we noticed there was no one swimming. The lifeguard informed us that they had to over-chlorinate the pool. When asked why, she said that a small child had emptied its bowels into the pool. YUCK!!!! Apparently, this is not uncommon at the Hard Rock pool. As we were waiting, another guest asked what was going on, and when we told her, she replied, \u201cOh, great! No again!\u201d It seems that the same thing happened the day before. So if you were looking to the Hard Rock as an adult\u2019s playground, think again. Dining: The Hard Rock has several semi-decent restaurants, but they are far too popular for their own good. The wait is extensive and the prices are high. We chose to return to the Portofino across the street for their excellent hand-made pizza. Checkout is early at the Hard Rock, and even though the room wasn\u2019t ready for us, they still insisted on early checkout. So once again, I marched down the long line of stairs happy to be leaving the Hard Rock.

They make you think the rooms are real big, but they are just normal unless you get a delux room.

He got us a frig ($15 per day) and a rollaway bed ($20 per day) for free. He didn't even want us to tip him, but we made him let us. Our room smelled real bad (like Cat Pee or Mildew) Finally by day 4, I couldn't take the smell any more so they told us that the room had a pipe with a water leak and sprayed something to cover it up. They should not have put us in there in the 1st place. We did not even get an appolagy from any one.The hall carpets are dirty and our furniture and comfortor in our room was stained (Found a roach in my bed on morning 2) The pool is wonderful and not to cold, but I never saw anyone cleaning it during our stay (even w/ babies in Dypers in it) ......Ecoli!!!! The Kids loved the slide and we did not have a problem finding chairs and they also do things to make kids happy and they have life guards which is nice. The pool staff was just ok, not overly nice. The Food was great at the Pantry, but service just so so, way over priced $75 for breakfast Buffet and $65 for lunch sandwiches for a family of 5. ($20 for 4 ice cream cones) Pool food and drink service was terrible and over priced as well. ($12 for nachos) The over all vacation was a great and We would not do Universal any other way. The resorts are close and no waiting in the lines. City walk is fun to, but the resturants do not honor your room key for prefered seating like the hotel says, and then when you ask the hotel they ignore it.

My family and friends stayed here in July and August 2003 and are returning in June of this year AGAIN (3rd time). I can't even think of a better place for a family of 4 to stay than the Hard Rock. It's the closest to the Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios parks, all within walking distance unless you take the boat which the kids loved. We bought a week's pass (2 park/5 day pass on-line because it's cheaper and less hassle than standing in line) and just went over for a few hours in the mornings and retreated to the hotel after lunch for a swim and some activities. We thought the hotel was the BEST EVER and the kids are STILL talking about it. Now, when we stay somewhere else, the kids want the Hard Rock. No wonder! They have the sand beach, a great water slide that even the adults enjoyed, movies at the pool twice/week (in case of rain it's in the lobby area with lots of bean bags etc.), lots of poolside activities, vollyball, etc. We loved the music around the property and ate at the hotel almost every day or night. The food was not cheap but it was really good and lots of it. And actually is wasn't that EXpensive either. The kids pool is about a foot deep and has little fountains in it. When my son was two we couldn't get him out of it. It's the BEST! You can actually sit by the pool in the sun or shade at any time during the day, watch the kids play, or take them to the child care facility for a small fee. They have lots of activities and the kids love it. They even feed them in the evenings. Some of the rooms have a view of the parks fireworks which we enjoyed. You can get a great rate through AAA so it's worth joining AAA if you are not already a member. You can get rates under $200/night for two queen beds, etc. We loved our rooms--they couldn't have been any cleaner. Also, they have a Starbucks and an ice cream parlor. Now that can be expensive if you have a sweet tooth. ha ha All in all I say the Hard Rock Hotel is my very favorite.

The stay was also improved by a complimentary upgrade because the first room offered wasn't what we had reserved. The room-key is great for letting you skip the queues at the attractions and for paying in shops and restaurants. A couple of days is about the longest we could have stayed - once you've done the rides to death and once even the Hulk has lost some of its oomph, you really need to get 'off campus' to other restaurants and shops. But while we were there, it was a fun place, piped music, donuts and CDs, live band performances in the lobby, biggest arcade games room I've seen in a hotel, great memorabilia and decent restaurants.

The car will make a stop on the way to the hotel if you want to buy milk, cereal, snacks, etc (so you aren't tempted to buy stuff in the room fridge). I think the car service is cheaper for a family of four than the Mears shuttle and about the same as a taxi. Of course a trip to Orlando is for the kids. My wife and I weren't expecting great things. We were worried about too many kids, too much noise, small rooms and poor service. Expecially since we were arriving late (we'll get the last room in the hotel?). But our 3rd floor room was quiet (at the end of the hall away from elevators made for long walks but a quiet room), clean and roomy. The roll-a-way was provided soon after we checked in. The weather was great, we swam all three days, played volleyball, had fun in the water slide, and watched our kids play basketball in the pool for a long time. Universal Theme Park and Islands of Adventure were great and the express pass means you never wait in line. The Bob Marley restaurant at City Walk had great spicy Jamaican food. Prices at the pool restaurant at the hotel were reasonable, and there's a market/store in the hotel where you can buy pastries, cereal, etc. You can walk by the canal to Portofino or the theme parks, or take the (free) water taxi.

I stayed at this hotel not so long ago and it was immaculate ,expensive but immaculate the rooms were not only clean and tidy they were luxury with the most comfortable bed i have ever come accross in a hotel, everything in the hotel was absolutely fantastic ,the pool was the best i have ever been in so classy and relaxing ,not deep but as i just said relaxing and classy which pretty much summed up the whole hotel, as for the staff most were spanish american , now where ever you go in america you are expected to tip , to think other wise is to say the least very nieve , and the staff in the hotel did expect a tip BUT YOU SHOW ME AN AMERICAN THAT DOSENT, now the staff were not rude they were just ... how shall i put this ..JUST AMERICANS its their culture , i mean you have to bare one thing in mind this is probably one of orlandos top hotels and if the staff were not up to scratch they would be out of a job but they are up to scratch believe me.

The very deepest it was (only in one small area) was 4 feet. We thought our teen-aged son would enjoy the pool - he wouldn't even go in. It is a great pool for kids aged 6 -10 or younger.Our big joke of the stay was that one area of the pool actually stated that the water was 9\" deep (yes inches, not feet ) Was that for fear that someone would drown in 9\" of water??? We did enjoy the memorabilia, the room was ok, the staff wasn't all that friendly. We went from there to the Polynesian in Disney World which was much better (we felt) as far as hospitality was concerned. Also, more food choices available in Disney. The only good part about the Hard Rock was the close proximity to the parks and express lines for rides.

The hotel could do more to stress to guests that not all residents appreciate hooting and hollering outside their rooms in the wee hours.

We stayed 5 days and they were the best five days I've ever experienced. Our plane landed shortly after 4:30 August 29th and by 5:30 we were settled in our room. We weren't planning on getting a view of anything but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in only to see a spectacular post card shot of the pool and a wonderful view of both theme parks. If I could give any advise it would be to stay on the Club Level floor (7th). It's only accessible to those who are staying on that floor so the hallways aren't as crowded or as loud. The club lounge is great and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. It is open from 7:30 am until 11 pm every day. You have free bottled water, coffee, lemonade, iced tea, and mini cans of coke, sprite or diet coke available all day long. In addition to that, you get a free breakfast with fresh doughnuts, fruit salad, bagels, muffins, and cereal every morning. If that wasn't enough, from 5:00-7:00 each night they have free beer, wine, and hors d'oeuvres (chicken kabobs one night, pasta salad and meatballs the next, mini hot dogs another night). Then from 8-9 they serve a dessert item such as cookies, brownies, ice cream, or pudding (it changes each night). Because of these convenient perks, my family only had to buy one meal a day making our trip a lot more affordable. There is always music playing throughout the hotel and they have speakers under the water in the pool so you don't miss a song. The parks opened at 9 each morning and closed between 6 and 8 each night. We stayed just as the peak season was finishing so the fireworks weren't on and the park hours were shorter. Having the front of the line access was priceless. You can do both parks in a day or do each ride at least twice all thanks to staying on site, and your hotel is at most a 15 minute walk away or a 5 minute boat ride. Everywhere you look people are laughing or smiling and enjoying themselves. It can't be put into words the happiness and joy this hotel brings to you. In my opinion, this hotel has barely been discovered and the 7th floor is only the beginning of what's to come.

I booked 2 nights at the Hard Rock since our 3 20-something kids were with us and thought they'd enjoy it. When we arrived around 6 pm on 8/24 we found out the travel agent had booked us a room with 2 queen beds but no sofa. My husband was offered a sofa bed for $25/night more or an upgrade to club level for $50/night more, which is the option he took. We were quite pleased with that decision. The room overlooked the entrance and had a nice view, and it was quite large and comfortable for 5 adults. It was also well-kept. In fact, we got a little smudge on the white comforter when we placed our suitcase on it and the next day, they changed the comforter. The mini-bar is over-priced but fruit and drinks are available in the lounge from 7:30 to 11 so the bar wasn't used at all. The breakfast buffet and the appetizer buffet were excellent and the \"kids\" enjoyed hanging out at the poolside lounge. The staff is friendly and helpful, and security was discreetly evident. It's a short walk out the back door and past the pool to City Walk and the parks or you can opt for a water taxi, and showing your room key really does get you to the head of the lines! The day we went to the park, the skies opened up at about 3 pm complete with thunder and lightning. Of course we didn't have rain gear and when we realized it wasn't going to let up we slogged back to the hotel through pools of water that were higher than my ankles joking that if we were REALLY stars they'd dry us off when we got back to the room. As we approached the back door of the hotel it opened and the young man who worked at the pool greeted us all with warm towels. After we'd dried off a bit, he took the wet towels and gave us dry ones to keep wrapped in till we got upstairs.

The location was great - you can walk to the Universal parks and CityWalk, or take the shuttle boat. My husband used the gym, which was very well equipped.

However we felt that although it was nice it lacked that wow factor. The rock memrobilla was scant. We would rate it as a nice four star hotel and not five as advertised in the brochure. Certain points to be aware of before you stay, are that the lobby is on the third floor which means that two floors are below. This coupled with the palm trees growing adjacent to the windows can result in restricted veiws. We were originally allocated a room on the third floor for which we had paid for a pool view. You could just see the pool between the large trees. Due to this we upgraded to the club floor. Club level does not mean exclusivity as promoted, just more large families, lots of young children, more noise and chaos when trying to eat in the club lounge. The pool is shallow with two small areas up to four feet deep. The table tenns, shuffle board and giant chess have all seen better days. The hotel is starting to look tired and would benefit from some overdue maintenence. The staff were helpful and friendly.

I knew we weren't going to be in the room much, so I didn't see spending the extra money for the pool view. However, had I known that the \"garden view\" room would mean putting you in the level below the main floor, then I would have paid the extra money for a pool view. We stayed in room 1123, the \"garden view\" window was too dirty to be able to see out of. The carpet in our room had a few stains. The room had a slight musty smell to it. The hallway to our room was very, very cold & the music was much louder than everywhere else, annoyingly so, even for someone who loves rock-n-roll music. The room next to us had their room service dirty dishes out and they sat there for hours. That was a view I didn't ask for! I would have asked to switch, but we arrived late (about 8:30 pm) and the hotel was completely full. On the bright side, all the staff were very friendly and helpful. My kids absolutely loved the pool and the hotel in general. The hotel is full of energy and fun, not stuffy- at all. But the best of all, access to express lanes was, BY FAR, THE BEST BENEFIT!! Your room key is all you need to show to hop into the express lanes. That alone is worth the extra money. If you want to go to one of the parks on the day of check-in, you can check-in early in the morning (you're room will not be ready yet however), leave your bags (if you want), grab your room keys and head off to the park to take full advantage of those express lanes. Our flight got in late, so we didn't do that. However, we did go to the park the day we checked-out (check-out is 10:00 or 11 a.m.), but we got to keep our room keys and they were good for express rides until the park closed. I think the longest we waited on any ride was 10 minutes. That is an almost \"too good to be true\" perk, but it's true! I'd stay in that crappy room again if I had to just for that benefit alone. However, I felt I had to base my rating on the room, the amenities and service. As I said, I wasn't happy with our room. Another disappointment was that once we were at IOA (Islands of Adventure) we discovered that for some reason their system was not allowing room charges. Apparently their computers were having problems. So, we had to go back to our room to get more cash. Bummer. We didn't eat at any of their restaurants so I can't give an opinion of that. I would have given a much higher rating if our room was more like what you would expect out of a $230/nite hotel.

From arrival to our departure, we were treated with first class treatment (Thanks Sarah). The staff was very outgoing, friendly, and helpful. It's a great family hotel--large pool, water slide, large beach area, plenty of lounge cots and chairs at the pool. Kids activities everynight at the hotel. The music is not as loud as you may read or hear about, unless you are near the Sunset Grill Restaurant. Great access to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure--by a 5 minute walk or a 3 minute boat trip. The room key access to all the rides is AWESOME! The wait time was an average of 7 minutes. We had the budget room--non pool view side (4th floor). But that's OK, our room still had a good view and it served it's purpose. Our family decided on the last night we would stay on the \"Concierge Level\" (7th Floor). I would only recommend the 7th floor if money was not an issue. Our family did the 5 Park, 14 day flex-ticket (Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, Sea World, Wet & Wild Water Park, and Busch Gardens. A great way to see the parks and a good investment! Each park had their own highs and lows for each family member. Busch Gardens: Do the rides and see the shows, you can see wildlife animals at your local zoo and you would be supporting your local zoo. Do the rides in the mornings because if the park is not crowded in the afternoons, you may find a ride or two closed down. One Note: Don't miss the Ice Show! It is totally AWESOME! Sea World: If you're looking at seeing the shows and the marine life, this is the place to do it. But if you have children who are planning on doing rides, you will be disappointed. Wet & Wild Water Park: It's compact and it will fulfill your water needs. The park is only a few minutes away from the hotel. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure: It's a Win-Win experience. By staying at an Universal Hotel and using your room key to by-pass the lines, you will have a great time! By going this route, you almost forget about the heat and the humidity. Alaska Airlines was our air carrier and they were great! Alamo Car Rental: Very convenient at the Orlando International Airport and good service. If you stay at the Hard Rock Hotel and you are planning on renting a vehicle, have the hotel send you driving directions to and from the airport and theme parks.
