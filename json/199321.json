I actually stayed here on two separate nights.First, the positives. The location was excellent, right across from the train station. The computer room had five or six computers with internet access, which was very convenient. As mentioned in the other reviews, all the drinks in the refrigerator were free. The breakfast was good, with scrambled eggs, sausages and smoked salmon, as well as cold cuts, cereal, bread, etc.The negatives unfortunately outweighed the positives. The non-smoking I was given had a strong smell of stale smoke. The furnishings were old and didn't feel clean. Luckily, my room did have a fan but my friends down the hall did not have one.The second night was later in the week, and the room on first sight seemed newer and was smoke-free so I was initially happy. However, I later discovered bugs resembling small cockroaches on the bathroom floor which went into a crack in the wall and after that, I didn't feel that comfortable. Despite the positives, I wouldn't stay here again because I didn't feel it was clean.

Right across from the train station, it's centrally located (10 minutes to get to most tourist sites, and the tram stop is right in front). Staff was friendly and accomodated our 6:30 check-in. The free minibar (two each of beer, oj, sparkling water and Pepsi, with a large still water bottle) was wonderful, as was the breakfast buffet (huge selection of pastries, cereals, yogurts, meats, cheeses - more than we could eat). The only downside was that our room (with a balcony overlooking the train station) was a little bit noisy - didn't bother my boyfriend, but I was fine sleeping with earplugs. The room was spotless, and we were very comfortable walking around the area at night.

Reading the other reviews posted here by previous guests, I figured to give the Excelsior a try. I'm glad we did. The location is very convenient, directly across from Frankfurt's main train station and subway lines. There is also a taxi stand in front of the hotel. Finding something to eat on a budget is easy to do in this area too. There are lots of food vendors inside the train station, ranging from McDonalds and Burger King to sandwiches and doner kebabs. I reserved a triple room and was upgraded to a four-bed bedroom instead. There was a double bed for the wife and I and a bunk bed for my two little boys. The rooms were a little small but for E81 (including taxes), it was a deal. My room faced the trainstation and street, but the traffic noise was not bothersome. My best part of this hotel was the freebies. The drinks in the minibar (2 beers, 2 Pepsis, 1 large water, 2 waters with gas and 2 orange juices) are free and restocked daily. Free telephone calls within Germany, which I used a lot to call Ramstein Air Base. The free breakfast downstairs has a good variety of foods to choose from: breads, cereals, yogurts, fruits, scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, even rice. The hotel also advertises a free laundering and pressing of an article of clothing but I never used it. During the day, the lobby serves cakes and tea/coffee for its guests, for free too.The front desk is a very busy one here, yet the front desk staff maintained friendly and jovial attitudes. They were very helpful.I am glad I read the other postings about this hotel from other posters because it's all true.
