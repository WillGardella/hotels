It was just as wonderful as the 1st time. The management and the staff were very welcoming and showed great hospitality, they were very helpfull and just our right hand whenever we needed any assistant. They showed great appreciation for seeing us again. They simply were like a family to us. Our room was on the 5th floor, wide and clean, warm and quite, the rates were perfect due to the discount we received for staying with them again, the breakfast buffet... so yummy, the swimming pool on the roof top is highly maintained, the location was perfect for sight-seeing and for shopping.

Room and pool were clean (pool was a bit chilly), breakfast was typical continental with some protein. Staff were fine. Hotel is in the middle of the shopping area for clothes, a bit like being just off oxford street, in walking times its 5 mins north of the tram stop (2 lira ticket machine near platform), 15 mins from the underground to the airport (2 lira again), 10 mins to the grandbazaar, 20 mins to the famous mosques. Locate it on a good map before you go as finding it for the first time needed a bit of seaching around. Ferries were good fun. Tip for a day out is to go to the new aquarium, one of the best we've been to, take the coastal train to Florya (2 lira) which is a mile past it (and where there's a good beach) and walk back to it.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMixed stay in Gonen Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Michaela-London-UK", "ReviewID": "UR120243202", "Content": "We stayed 7 nights here and in 2 different rooms - one a twin (5th flr), the other a king size (3rd flr).

The beds were firm but reasonably comfortable. Better than some hotels. Staff were friendly, spoke some English but not enough if you have problems. The wireless internet was a bit slow but did work on all floors unlike many other hotels. Bad things In both rooms we could smell cigaratte smoke every day, coming from the room next door through the bathroom ceiling. We could hear the tv and conversations of people in the room next door and the floor above. The included breakfast was so bad (tasteless plastic cheese, pink sausage like Spam and orange juice that was watered down) that we stopped eating it after a few days. The bread was nice and fresh though each morning. On the 3rd night there was no water to the bathroom all evening and when it did come back it was a dirty brown. The swimming pool on the roof was empty and out of action Both our suitcase wheels were damaged by the hotel staff dragging our cases side ways when they changed our room half way through our stay due to problems of the cigarette smoke. The hotel caters for large Russian tour parties and had a very noisy English student group who seemed to run riot in their rooms and spend most of the night being sick in the bathrooms - thin walls made it sound like they were in our room.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cclean and good rooms\u201d", "Author": "Muhammad k", "ReviewID": "UR119560182", "Content": "around every months \u00c4\u00b1m coming to istanbul for my bussiness and choosing g\u00c3\u00b6nen hotel.Hotel is very good and clean.Staffs are helpful and friendly.Gonen hotel is like my home.They made some renovat\u00c4\u00b1on in the rooms and looks much better.Last year there was some times problem in internet but this year it look they solved the problem.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mehrabani", "ReviewID": "UR119459863", "Content": "I went to Istanbul for the 1st time with a friend of mine, and we stayed at Gunen Hotel - Laleli.

On arrival we were encouraged that the hotel was clean, well situated and that the furniture in the room was nice and new. Although small the room was perfectly adequate for our needs and appropriate for the price. The rooftop terrace and pool were also a bonus. HOWEVER: We got no sleep at all in this hotel. We had seen an earlier review here on Trip Advisor where the reviewer mentioned issues with the management refusing to turn on the air conditioning, and hoped this was a one-off. It wasn't. The air conditioning is centrally-controlled and was not switched on the whole time we were there. The first night in particular was unbearably hot - the temperature outside was 30 degrees Celsius (we saw the temperature displayed on a number of signs around the city so this was definitely the case) and in the small room the heat was incredible. We repeatedly called reception who had trouble speaking English and who informed us that the air conditioning was \"closed\". The manager it seems is trying to save money by forcing guests to endure hot sleepless nights. When I continued to complain I was told to \"open the window\" - with a very noisy street right outside and a mosque next door, not an option and hardly an acceptable recommendation for a so-called 3-star hotel. Finally in desperation I asked for a fan and they managed to locate an old one with a broken base that we had to prop up against the wall, far from ideal. Air conditioning is a stated feature of this hotel and is the reason we chose it above lots of other, cheaper hotels. To me, the management actively deciding not to offer a benefit which is clearly stated on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and throughout all of its promotional literature is a trading standards issue. Imagine calling down to reception about the air-conditioning in a 3-star hotel in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain etc and being told that the manager refuses to switch it on and to open a window! The other thing to beware of is we booked via Booking.com (which is the site you get directed to from Trip Advisor) and our rate was quoted in Euros. You provide your credit card details to guarantee the booking but you need to actually pay for the hotel, on check out. We didn't have any Euros with us on check out and so to pay in Turkish Lira. The hotel insisted on an exchange rate of 2.9 Lira to one Euro - the real rate is 2.5 - so our booking cost considerably more. We stayed at a number of other hotels in Turkey, booked in the same way, on our trip, and they used a reasonable exchange rate so we were not out of pocket. At this hotel the extortionate exchange rate used added another 8.8 Euros per night to the room cost. So bring Euros with you to pay!", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cSomething not quite right?\u201d", "Author": "Westcoast8", "ReviewID": "UR118083650", "Content": "We had booked one night in this hotel as a stopover on our way home from Iran via Istanbul. We were pretty tired when we turned up only to learn that the hotel had cancelled our booking the day before. Apparently they had tried to email us (while we were in transit) that they wanted the pincode to our credit card. As we hadn't sent it to them, they had automatically cancelled our reservation which had been made almost three months in advance. Asking for a confidentia pincode and cancelling a reservation the day before is not acceptable so we think something funny was going on. Possibly they had someone wanting to stay longer than just one night or maybe someone was planning to abuse our credit card. Luckily the receptionist helped us to find another hotel just two minutes away. However, we would like to warn other travellers of this procedure. Do NOT give out your pincode to anyone as your bank will not cover the damages if your card is abused.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nairobi", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and we'll be back for sure\u201d", "Author": "Richie078", "ReviewID": "UR116288511", "Content": "Very nice place, very friendly and helpfull staff.

They offered free wireless interenet in the rooms, which was in a quite good spped.

The breakfast was Okey, I liked the fruit salad , and the staff in the restaurant was nice and cheerful.
