We stayed in a small, but very comfortable room with three twin beds. The room was very very clean with a separate water closet and bathroom. The hotel staff was lovely and helpful. Having said all of this, it is important to mention the LOCATION of Hotel la Bourdonnais. Several blocks from the Champs de Mars and a few steps away from the Ecole Militaire metro stop, there are fantastic restaurants and sights very easily accessible. Our favorite nearby location was Rue Cler. You must visit Rue Cler's restaurants and bistros. (Cafe Central has the best croque monsieur I've ever had... and I've had a lot of croque monsieurs!)

My girlfriend is a travel agent so she gave me a few choices prior to the trip and because of the location and price, we booked this hotel and stayed for 3 nights. My co-worker also booked this hotel a few weeks before my family and I went. My coworker and her friends who booked 2 rooms didn't get a view from their balcony. My family and I got super lucky, we had the eiffel tower view when you walk out of the balcony! It was amazing. All 4 of us stayed in the same room, and knowing Paris hotels are small in general, we managed well for all of us staying in the same room. This hotel has prime location. It is a few blocks walk away from the Eiffel Tower. It does not get better. Also, the metro is only a block away, so it makes traveling around the city so much easier. There are restaurants, cafes, close by to the hotel, and a supermarket right beside the hotel. Also, free wifi in the hotel room. There's a computer you can use at the lobby, as well as a printer if you wanted to print tickets or boarding pass. We also booked a shuttle through the hotel to and from airport. However, we find that taking a taxi is about the same price since our shuttle was cancelled on us when we were leaving. I did find the breakfast at the hotel quite expensive. it is 10 euros each for family of 4, but if you have less than 4, it is 10 euros and selection of breakfast wasn't that great. The only complain I have is the hot water. If you want to take a shower, especially in the morning, you either have to wake up super early , or else there's not enough hot water in the hotel. Also, only one room key is provided, so sometimes, that is a inconvenient.

It is next to Ecole Militaire metro station in the 7\u00e8me arrondisement, but everything in Paris is next to a metro station, so this is nothing special. It is at the opposite end of the Champ de Mars from the Eiffel Tower. If you want to walk to the Eiffel Tower, it will take about 10-15 minutes. If you want to go by metro, it will take 10-15 minutes as well because you have to change lines. It is really too far to walk to any of the other sites in the city. Metro or taxi is your best bet, but again, you can take the metro from anywhere in the city. And like everywhere in Paris, there are cafes and bakeries all around. - TV had lots of channels, all HD, and the on-TV guide screen was cool in that it showed everything that was on.

I have to say that I wasn\u2019t impressed with the room when we first checked in. I thought the room looked dated and it was freezing. Once we figured out the heater it quickly warmed up and became very cozy though and the room quickly grew on me. The room was very small but we made do. I\u2019ve come to expect small hotel rooms when in Paris. The bathroom was huge by European standards though. Like so many hotels in Europe it had a shower/tub combo with no shower curtain or door. It had one of those glass panels that only goes to the middle of the tub. This wasn\u2019t much of an issue once the bathroom heated up from the shower steam but it was a little chilly when I first got in the shower each morning. The shower had excellent water pressure and we had ample hot water except for one day. The hotel did not have wash cloths in the bathroom but most European hotels don\u2019t have them so I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own. We did request extra towels and an extra blanket for our bed and we were promptly accommodated. The room had a TV but we never turned it on. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well there. The walls do seem to be thin at this hotel because we kept hearing our neighbor cough and we the toilet was loud every time they flushed it but I learned to travel with ear plugs many years ago so none of this ever affected my sleep. We requested a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower and the hotel did accommodate us. We ended up on the 5th or 6th floor (whichever is the top floor) and granted we couldn\u2019t see the entire Eiffel Tower from our room but we could see the top of it. It was very romantic. The hotel is in an excellent location. The Eiffel Tower is literally on the next block. I was very thankful to be so close to the Eiffel Tower on New Years Eve. The area around the Eiffel Tower is packed with people on New Years Eve and I would not have wanted to have to the horrendous traffic or even squeeze onto a metro train that evening. Being able to simply walk back to our hotel within 5-10 minutes made the evening perfect. The hotel is not located near a major metro hub but a major metro hub is just one metro strop from the hotel. There is a metro stop very close to the hotel (a 5 minute walk max) but as I already stated its not a major hub. The hotel offers a hot breakfast each morning but the cost was 15 euros per person if I remember correctly. The only reason we ate breakfast each morning at the hotel was because we got it for free because of our Rick Steves 2012 Paris travel book. When I was reading through the book on the plane ride to France I realized that this hotel was mentioned in the book and the book stated if you mentioned Rick Steves 2012 book (I also showed the front desk staff at the hotel my copy of the book) free breakfast would be included with your room. The hotel did honor what the book promised. The breakfast was good and included buffet style eggs, bacon, a variety of pastries and bread, cold cereal and coffee but I wouldn\u2019t have paid 15 euros per person for it. Since it was free it was very convenient though. The front desk staff was always very friendly and helpful and every person we encountered there spoke excellent English. The hotel does offer an airport shuttle that we used when we got to Paris and when we left Paris. I can\u2019t remember exactly how much it cost but it was cheaper than hiring a taxi. The only issue is that you will not be only person in the van. The driver will pick up other people that have reserved the van along the way. We were the last couple to be picked up when we got to Paris and we were the first couple to be dropped off at our hotel and we were the last couple to be picked up at our hotel when we left Paris and we were the first to be dropped off at the airport so it worked out well for us. If you wish to know the pricing for this service and/or reserve the van you should email the hotel. The hotel was very quick to respond to all my emails and the responses were always in perfect English. I really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again for sure. This was my first time traveling to Paris in the \"off season\" and I was looking forward to it being deserted. It was far from deserted though. As a matter of fact all the attractions were more packed this trip than they were when we went in July. Most of the attractions close earlier in the winter than they do in the summer and this just seemed to make the crowds worse. If you are wanting to go to Paris when its less crowded Christmas/New Years is NOT the time to go.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garland, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location for our family of four on our 1st visit to Paris!\u201d", "Author": "GymboMom", "ReviewID": "UR124973894", "Content": "This was our family's first trip to France and finding the right hotel for our family of four was challenging. We preferred to stay in the 7th near a Metro stop. We also found it challenging to find a room that would accommodate the four of us in Paris. Most hotels only slept a max of 3 people. I came across the Hotel la Bourdonnais' website by searching on tripadvisor and booked directly with them via their site. We were able to secure a jr. suite for our family of four for 193 euros per night. We did stay in November 2011, which is considered off season. We were VERY pleased with our room. It was HUGE and the four of us had no difficulty moving around or storing our luggage. We had a sitting area that led into the bedroom with two beds and a large bathroom. The room was nicely furnished, had a nice flatscreen tv and was very CLEAN. Being a picky mom this was important to me. The location of the hotel was a huge plus as well. The Metro was just around the corner (literally) - easy walking distance to be taken anywhere in the city and much cheaper than taxis. When you step out of the hotel, to the right and up a few blocks is the Eiffel tower - we walked there every night. Also to the right is a convenience type grocery store where we loaded up on bottled waters for just a few euros. About two blocks over is the popular Rue Cler area with charming restaurants and shops as well as a fruit market and flower stall. We ate there several times during our stay. The hotel offered a full breakfast at 9 euros per person. We did not try the breakfast as we aren't huge breakfast eaters and the temptation of Parisian pastries and coffees in the morning were far more appealing to us. My hubby would go out in the morning and get coffee and \"donuts\" and pastries for a few euros and bring them back to the room. Or we would go out and pick them up and eat while we were headed to the Metro. Across the street from the Metro is a bank with an ATM machine to withdraw euros if needed. We found this very convenient instead of having to search around town for one. We loved our 1st trip to Paris and plan on going back again.

As per my other trips, all hotel arrangements are usually done at the last moment. This time, it was done about 3 to 4 days before flying into Paris. We had set a budget of about USD100 per room per night for our stay and I was given the task to make the hotel booking. I used Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews to scour for hotels that fit our bill. Based on the reviews here and offers that I found, I made the \u201cexecutive\u201d decision (;-)) to increase our budget to about USD125 a night and decided on this hotel (although with some reservation about the size of the room and the free WiFi service). Knowing the location and the fact that the hotel is ranked in the top 150 (= top 10%) of all Paris hotels here on Trip Advisor at the time of booking gave me the confidence to make the decision to increase our budget a little bit. I checked a few websites for booking but I subsequently made a booking directly with the hotel through its website and took up their 3-night-stay offer, which meant we got a twin room for just around EUR90 (roughly within our budget). Getting to the hotel from CDG Airport was pretty easy. At the train station at the airport, get the train ticket into Paris (EUR9.10 in Nov 2011). I also got myself a pack of 10 metro/bus tickets (ask for \u201ccarnet\u201d, e.g. \u201cune carnet, s\u2019il vous plait\u201d) for EUR12.50 (individually, each ticket would cost EUR1.70) at the counter. Take the RER B train to Denfert Rochereau Station. Change to Metro Line 6 to La Motte Piquet Grenelle Station. Then change to Metro Line 8 and get off at Ecoile Militaire Station. Or alternatively you can just walk from La Motte Piquet Grenelle Station if you don\u2019t have much luggage with you. It\u2019s a nice stroll if the weather is nice as you\u2019ll walk past Champs de Mars and see Eiffel Tower right on the way to the hotel. On the hotel itself, it's well located, just off Champs de Mar. Short walking distance to Eiffel Tower. Some rooms on the higher floors that face the street apparently have the view of the top of the tower. Our room was located on the 2nd floor so we didn\u2019t get any view apart from the street and the building in front of the hotel. Not complaining though :-) There're basically no negatives about the hotel. If there has to be any complaint at all, it's about: - the thin wall between rooms, although admittedly I believe this is the same case for most similarly rated hotels in Europe. We didn\u2019t have much problem with the noise except for one night when some girls in the room next door were talking rather loudly quite late at night (well past midnight). There was hardly any noise from the street although we stayed on the 2nd floor facing the main street. - The breakfast; we didn\u2019t opt for the breakfast when booking the room because we thought it\u2019s quite expensive \u2013 without knowing what\u2019s being offered. At check in, I was told that breakfast is EUR15pp but based on the reviews that I have read here (even as recent as November 2011 as well) it could be anything from EUR13 to EUR15pp. Not sure of the reason(s) for the difference in price for breakfast. The positives include: + Arrived around 11am and was given a room right away \u2013 although I know this depends on the availability of the room, I was pleased about it nevertheless :-) + moderate-sized room for a twin bedroom. (Check out the photos) Not big but not small either, just nice. Definitely bigger than the usual twin room in other similar priced/ rating hotels that I have stayed at in Europe though. + We got Room 205, which has a small \u201challway\u201d, a quite spacious shower/bathroom, and a separate toilet (Check out the photos). Beds are comfortable, hot water and water pressure were good. Not much of toiletries available in the bathroom although this was not a problem to us as we brought our own. Some reviewers here have commented that their hotel room looks a bit dated but we don\u2019t think ours are. + Free WiFi in the room. The connection was very fast when I tested by watching some videos on YouTube using my mobile phone. + Free WiFi, PC/ internet access and printer in the sitting/ reading room just off the hotel lobby + Location, location, location. You can view Eiffel Tower in all its glory from just around the corner. For food and other necessities, there\u2019s one supermarket (Franprix) that is located just next door to the right. Carrefour is around the corner to the left and across the street. Metro station is located in front of the Carrefour. It\u2019s on the same line with Opera station, which is quite convenient if you\u2019re planning to do some shopping at Galeries La Fayette and Printemps :-D Overall we\u2019re both very pleased with the hotel and our room.

I would also recommend Ru Cler, a lovely quaint street with cafes, boutiques and delis. We had coffee in one of the many cafe's and everyone was friendly (considering our limited French!). The hotel is a 10-15 stroll from the Eiffel Tower and you can see the top of it from the hotel. Our room was adequate, perhaps looking a little worn, but nevertheless was clean and tidy. Reception were very welcoming and gave us lots of detail about what to do and where to eat. If you have children, the family rooms have two double beds and are a good size.

The breakfast, which was included in our rate (they had a fantastic promo for Summer that included breakfast), was great!! The breads and croissants were fresh and tasty, there were bacon and eggs I believe, and several cereal and pastry selections. They also has a Nespresso machine. It was great because it was included in our price, but not worth 15 Euros per person if you had to pay for it separately IMO. I would stay here again especially if we get a fantastic rate and would, without hesitation, recommend it to friends and family. Watch out for the promos though!

If this kind of thing doesn't bother you, great! If it does, take earplugs. They saved me. Also, take shampoo, soap, conditioner and hand lotion. None of these were provided. (At $400/night, I found this a bit shocking -- they had a dispenser that was very hard to get decent amounts of an all-purpose liquid soap from. Not adequate.) You cannot buy travel sizes of these things in France (or at least not in the stores I looked at (grocery stores and pharmacies). Also bring sunblock. It was on average $30 a tube over there. Skip the icky Franprix next door and go to the Ave. Bosquet nearby to the much nicer Carrefour which is next to the most amazing chocolate place, Le Notre. Also, make sure you ask where Rue Cler is. I didn't know about this till the day I left and it was a terrific marketplace nearby with traditional Fromagerie, great bakeries, prepared food stores, great restaurants, etc. In France, they don't offer up any unsoliticited advice. You have to really probe -- and I am fluent in French and I didn't always get helpful or accurate information. Do your research before you go -- I heard Rick Steves book is really good. Unfortunately, I didn't get that one. The Unofficial Guide was good but I accidentally left it home. The staff were exceedingly nice and the hotel is near a nice park bench in the Champs de Mars where you can eat your croissant in full view of the Eiffel Tower.

I got a good rate with the hotel directly including breakfast. It is in an excellent location beside bus and metro routes in a nice district. My daughter thought it nice compared to large chain hotels - this was \"quaint\" coming from a 16yr old. The room was small but sufficient size for sleeping in. Double sinks in bathroom with shower on wall also bath. Shampoo/soap dispensers on wall too, and hairdryer. However we always bring our own small hairdryer with nozzle. Limited plug sockets - 2 but done the job for recharging phones. Flat tv, with 6 english speaking news channels incl bbcworld, cnn etc. Safe in wardrobe - you pay an \u20ac80 deposit on your creditcard which is refunded on return of the key. Plenty of hangers in wardrobe and 3 large shelves. Iron available at reception. Breakfast is served to 11 am and staff are all very friendly. Night porter on each evening we returned to give us our key. There are two computers in lounge with free internet access. A great plus for teenagers. Only problem I had with hotel was our room was located beside lift and the noise is bad all the way to the 6th floor however we put up with it, and I am sure if I had asked to be moved they would have accommodated me. Next time I return I will ask for a room away from lift as I am a light sleeper. Overall an enjoyable stay at this hotel. Being close to metro line no. 8 I soon got use to metro system (similar to new york ) where you can change at various stations to other lines on the one ticket. I done my homework and we bought two books of carnets \u20ac12 - for 10 tickets per carnet. Worked out better than Paris Viste card. Also as my daughter is under 18 she is free to many museums and sights so again did not buy musuem pass. A great little restaurant close by is Cafe Constant - We ate there on Tuesday night arrived at 7.20 and by 7.30 it was full - check out TA Reviews for yourself . Cafe Central close by on Rue Cher was not worth the money we paid \u20ac80.00 one night and did not like food. Cafe due Marche has good value on Rue Cher Ate at Hard Rock cafe another night at Montmarte. Stay away from Chartiers. I ended up walking out. We booked the Eiffel tower ahead of our arrival choosing a date and time, and was I glad I did as there were huge queues to buy tickets. We strolled up to the resevation blueflag at our allotted time and went straight in. I had booked up to the 2nd level and this was enough for us. You would have had to queue to reach the next level at the top. Lasted about 30mins up the Eiffel and then strolled over the bridge to Trocadero, then we strolled back across bridge to the foot of the Eiffel Towe is Bateaux Parisiens , Port de la Bourdonnais. This boat line is the same price as Bateaux -mouches but seemed to have more seats and to Port de l'alma was a good 15 min walk. We took it just before sunset so on the way back we got the night views. Took a day trip to Versaille also - From ecole Militaire station to Invalides and changed to RER C line to Versaille Rive Gauche \u20ac12.35 on metro total cost return for my daughter and I. I had prebooked Versaille however on arrival there at 11am we still had to queue for one hour to get in. This was in a ticket holding queue. If you only wish to see the Palace and some of the gardens then I suggest coming at 3pm (15.00) in summer times as it is open until 20.30 pm - all queues were gone when we came out at 15.30.!! There was not a whole lot more to see at the Marie Antoinette estate. We got a small train around saved the walking 30mins each way for \u20ac6.50 for adults and \u20ac5.00 children 11 - 18 yrs. Was worth paying it especially in the afternoon heat. We were disappointed with shops ( my daughter was !! would find better shops in Dublin - either very very expensive or very tacky...... I have nicknamed Tati as tacky Tati ( don't go near it) In dodgy area too. Area around Les halles gets dodgy at night - alot of metro lines meet here - was advised this from a work colleague from Paris and I saw it for myself and it was only 6pm. Best visit for my daughter was the Catacombes - Queue 2hrs to get in to see this. Get there early - opens at 10am and you cant prebook........ Loved Paris and would return.

I had decided after traveling to Paris with my husband, for my fifth anniversary, and with friends, for fun and shopping, that it was time to treat my parents to a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Paris, with their daughter. I was in search for the perfect place. I wanted a good area, and I needed it to be safe. I wanted the hotel that could accomindate three travels, which in Europe is not as simple of a request as you think, if you're from North America (Canada). I wanted the hotel to be surrounded with iconic scene's of Paris (the Effiel Tower, small shops and cafes), so that when we stepped out into the streets there would be no doubt to where we were. Hotel La Bourdonnais had it all, and then some. When we arrived from our cross atlantic flight we went stright to the hotel. From the outside it looked like something out of a movie. Picture perfect from the outside. The staff greated us so warmly and were quick to offer us something to drink and a comfortable chair to rest in. Even though we were not scheduled to check in untill 3:00, our room was ready, and they were more then happy to gives us our keys so we could rest. The room was perfect. It was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious. We had three single beds, a toilet closet, a bathing room, two wonderful floor to ceiling iron-rod window doors that opend up to a courtyard below, desk, fridge, Flatscreen tv, and a small halloway seperating the door leading to the hallway and into the actual suit (my dad claimed that as his private dressing area, away from us ladies). It felt like home away from home, and a far cry, like I said, from pervious hotels I had stayed in while in Paris... small and stuffy. The hotel offered free WiFi down in the hotel parlor. Large flatscreens and excellent wireless connection. I never had a problem getting a computer or delays in transmission. The hotel resturant, which offered us buffet breakfast each morning, 12E for outside guests, was to die for. Fresh bread, pastry's, cheeses, juice, and fruit. There was a beverage machine that dispenced coffee, hot water for tea, espresso, and hot chocolate. There were dry ceral, yogurt and jams and butter, eggs, bacon and toast. Topped off with bistro tables under a galss inclosure... it was the only way to start of a parisian morning. Once we were full and ready to hit the streets, the hotel staff was able and willing to help out with passes to exhibits, like the Effiel Tower and Louver (with line bypass) and maps with directions to almost anywhere we wanted to go. They offered to make dinner reservations, at great resturants, and arrange to have a car waiting to bring us there. Honestly, no detail was spared. I paided about $1200 (Canadian) for the week, for three people, including daily breakfast. For all that we got, I felt as if they were paying us to stay there the value was so good. Being so close to the river, metro, Effiel Tower and D'orsy, we saved allot of time getting to where we wanted to visit that we maximinzed our time not having to travel from further area's to get to many attractions. Taxi's can be expensive, and even though the metro is GREAT, if you're far you have to spend the time getting around if you opt to stay further away to reduce hotel costs. I have done the math and time calculations, its worth the money to stay central, especially if you need to return to your hotel after a long day out sightseeing to freshen up for an evening out. I cannot say enough good things about this place, and I do have something to compare it to. So if you're wondering where to stay on your next visit to Paris, look no further.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money near the Eiffel Tower\u201d", "Author": "loganmaxted", "ReviewID": "UR65080641", "Content": "We have stayed at three different hotels in the Rue Cler area--this is definitely the nicest, though more expensive than the other two.

We traveled as a family of four with 14 and 11 year old boys. The reviews were accurate, so we were fully satisfied with the hotel. The hotel was still being renovated. A couple of days the paint odors in the halls were a bit offensive, but the odor did not invade our room. That and the warm room temperature would be are only complaint for our stay. With the heat turned off in our room and temps just above freezing outside, we were warmer than we prefer in our room. Most buildings in Paris set the temperature higher than the States, which we found a bit confusing considering the lighting is kept very low to reduce energy consumption. We opened the windows for 15 minutes to cool the room off. Some of the many positives were that our 5th floor quad room was updated, clean and larger than I expected compared to other big cities (NY, DC, London). I was expecting no room to walk around, but we had enough of space to lay out our belongings. The furniture was antique, so appropriate for the setting. The room was cleaned and linens were changed daily. The flat screen TV was sufficient for the room size. The bathroom was tight, but we managed. Bring a bar of soap and shampoo if you don't want to use the body wash dispenser. The view was great on the balcony (really a ledge with no room for furniture). The windows kept the street noise to a minimum. Rarely heard guests in adjacent rooms. Occasionally heard guests using the main elevator that was located outside our room. None of that noise was offensive. It was nice having the living room by the lobby to lounge around in at the end of the day and the use of the two computers. Outlets were plentiful in the living room for plugging in and recharging electronics (bring an extra converter if traveling with teenagers). Also good place for behaved kids to hang out with their electronics when adults needed time to themselves (and visa versa). Ate the breakfast twice and was satisfied. The reduced rate for a family of four was comparable to other breakfasts nearby when you consider the unlimited food and coffee. The Staff was very accommodating and gave us prompt attention whenever we had a need. We relied on internet for local info and recommendations, although we did book our return to the airport with the hotel staff with great success. Also wanted to commend the staff for promptly communicating via email in the months before our trip and providing the room location we requested.. We loved that the hotel is located in a comfortable Paris neighborhood rather than a tourist or business district. Felt very safe at all times. This was probably the cleanest part of Paris. We kept noting how spotless the area was kept. There are tourists sites nearby (Eiffel tower, Napoleon's Tomb and Army Museum), but also elementary schools and local hang outs. We walked home from the Arc-de-Triomphe at the end of a day of sightseeing without being too tired out. Being a relatively new part of Paris, the sidewalks are wider, affording a pleasant cafe experience compared to the denser parts of the city. We preferred to rely on Bistros and market streets (such as nearby pedestrian Rue Cler) for frequent small meals throughout the day. Boulangeries have excellent baguette sandwiches for lunch. Was fun to pretend to be a Parisian and gather your meal at shops and bring back to room. Hotel staff gave us plates, cork screw and wine glasses. Our room had a small table for eating light meals. There are three mini-supermarkets within a block for snacks, drinks, wine, etc. ATM's are everywhere. We used the buses a little more than the METRO. The Metro stop was half a block away. Metro is quick, however, a few destinations by Metro required a long walk when we transferred. A bus hub with direct connections to many attractions is at the nearest intersection and other bus routes are no more than a block away. The bus is more intimidating than the Metro, but worth the effort to learn. Can't say enough about the buses. Unlike US buses, the buses have huge windows and theater seating, so much more to see than the Metro. Most bus stops and all buses have electronic messaging for tracking bus stops and max. minutes to next destination. The buses were cleaner than the Metro. Bus riders tended to be folks used to a slower pace like older workers or students, consequently felt more relaxed and safer than Metro. We had bus route guides printed from the RATP website before we left the states, so we knew where the bus stops were located. Be aware that the bus driver only takes exact change so you need to buy your carnet of tickets at the subway or a tabac shop. I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay here again should we return to Paris. TIP: We found the ultimate Paris market to be the Sunday/Thursday Bastille market for food shopping pleasure. The market is about a 20 minute Metro ride away (no transfers.) Wow, what a selection of good quality food at low prices. French merchants make an art of wrapping your purchase compared to the states, even the vendors at the market. The vendors recommended the cheese and sausage for our picnic. My wife also bought some better priced gifts of jewelry and scarves.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "CAGOttawa_Canada", "ReviewID": "UR59766244", "Content": "I recently travelled to France with a friend for a vacation in Paris and Provence.

If you're doing the same, use the ticket machines rather than queuing at Gar de Norde and buy a single for $1.60. All single journeys are the same price so the longer your journey the better value for money it is. You could also buy a zone 1+2 day pass for $5.60 which is only useful if your making more than 4 trips. On arrival at the hotel there was none of the usual form filling, passport photocopying, credit card swiping that occurs at every single other hotel in the world. We just gave our name and were given the key to our room. Floor 4 had been recently decorated and looked fantastic. Our room on the other hand had not been decorated and was typically European e.g. old decor and a bit small but was absolutely fit for purpose. All we needed was a bed to fall into after long days of exploring the city. We didn't eat the hotel breakfast and so I can't comment on it. For $60 for two people over two days we could have bought a weeks worth of croissants, jam, fruit and coffee around the corner from the Carre Four. Location wise, the hotel is great. A 2 minute walk from the Military School metro station and around 10 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. The metro is a brilliant and relatively cheap way of negotiating your way around the city and a much better way of getting to know the city than riding around in a cab (which will soon drain your spending money).

The area that the hotel is in is primarily residential (nice and quiet) so there are many supermarkets within a 100-200mtr radius, which is great. All items water, breads, pastries, cheeses, wines are really cheap. There is also a small walking mall just around the corner that has many cheap eateries, both restaurant and caf\u00e9 style which is great. It also has some lovely bakeries. Just beware there are also some very expensive restaurant /cafes just up the road on the main corner that will cost you $34Euro for 2 coffees, 2 hot chocolates and 2 small cakes\u2026yikes! We had breakfast included in our room cost and it was very good. It was all self serve but the coffee, breads, cheeses and pastries were delicious. The breakfast hot food is limited to bacon, scrambled eggs, mushrooms and potatoes but none the less delicious. The Metro station is just round the corner making it easy to get around the city. I also highly recommend the on off bus. Make sure you get the 2 day pass as this will allow you time to actually get on, get off and then see things. There is so much to see in Paris and 1 day won\u2019t cut it. The hotel is also just a 5 minute walk through the Champs de Mars park to the Eiffel tower and then another 2 mins to the Trocadero. Make sure you go to the tower at night it is amazing. It is quite unnerving with all the soldiers around though, but at least you kinda feel safe. This is also a good place to get the on off bus as it is a transfer post for these buses, by that I mean you can transfer from one route to another. Also here you can get the RER train that takes you to the Palace of Versailles, much much much much cheaper and quicker than doing a pre-booked one. E.g. Our friends, who were in Paris at the same time, paid $77 Euro each to do a half day tour, we paid $35Euro each (which included the train fare ) and that included the guided tour through the Kings Private Apartments, which you don\u2019t get on your self tour. Don\u2019t be afraid to go it alone it is very easy to get to. A tip to avoid the long queues is to pay and print your ticket online\u2026this will save you a heap of time especially if you don\u2019t get to the palace early to get a spot at the front of the queue. You will need a whole day to do the Palace and the gardens\u2026actually I reckon you will need 2 days to do the lot. As I mentioned the Eiffel tower is a must at night, however both day and night it is amazing, and to think they were going to pull it down. Get ready to be hassled by the many African gents trying to sell you souvenirs and also most importantly, be extra ready and aware of the many many gypsies (they are everywhere in Paris) that will be constantly asking you for money. The best thing to do is just ignore them and keep walking, if you\u2019re standing just ignore them but just be aware that they may distract you for one of their party top pick pocket you or your family. Another trick is that they walk past you and pick up what looks like a gold wedding band and ask you if it\u2019s yours\u2026whatever you do don\u2019t take it cause the harassment will start in earnest. Just ignore them and they will go away, or you can just tell them to p@#s off in a very terse voice and they will leave. Tip for avoiding the enormous elevator queue at the Eiffel tower is to buy a ticket that allows you to walk up to the first level(this queue is tiny) of the tower(it is not a difficult walk for any able bodied person with average fitness, not to mention the kids will love it), once up on the first level you can then buy your elevator ticket top go up to the next level and then buy the final elevator ticket to go all the way to the top and the best thing\u2026.there are no queues at any of these levels to get your ticket. Yes it costs the same as getting your ticket at the bottom. Most people don\u2019t realise that the Eiffel tower has 3 levels of viewing. The \u201cwalk up to the first level\u201d ticket box can be accessed at the left foot of the tower if you are looking at the Eiffel tower from the park. Each level will give you a different perspective on Paris. As I mentioned before, the Metro stop is just round the corner and we used this to go to Notre Dame and then walked from Notre Dame to Le Louvre, pleasant 15min walk. Most of the other places we did via the on off bus. Use both to suit your itinerary. Once at the Louvre your are within walking distance to Jardin des Tuileries, Place de la Concorde & Avenue des Champs Elysees amongst many other locations. One place you must see is the Opera National De Paris, you will be totally amazed and the view into the Paris streets from the first floor balcony is to die for, the view before you looks like a postcard. I could go on and on other places you must see is the Arc de Triomphe (go to the top for amazing views), the shops along the Champs Elysee, the Trocadero area, a cruise on the river Seine day and night, Montmarte, Sacre Coeur, Moulin Rouge (not much chop, over rated). There is so much more\u2026\u2026.

Maybe some problem with central heater tank Shower room door cannot be locked but not an issue for us. I dont lock hotel room's toilet door. Due to the new coat of paint, the door will go 'eee yakkkk kwakkk' when its abt 3/4 closed. Toilet door is fine Previous reviews talk abt leaking. I checked carefully for this and no leaking at all. Prior to this booking, I am informed by the hotel that the leaking problem has ceased. 3- Bed is reasonable comfortable. We have a room with 2 double bed. Pillow is fluffy? I like that. They have plasma TV and its something 'rare' throughout the Europe trip. The mini bar doesnt seem to work. Not cold. Aircon is okay. Can see it and can control it haha. No leaking. The elffiel tower view is blocked as the next building is under going construction. 4-Breakfast is provided in the booking. Although the spread isnt much, its above average for the foods provided compared to other hotels I have stayed in. Pastry is nice Bonus: Coffee machine that lets us choose hot chocolate, Espresso, Cupucinno etc. This is the best one I have found among all my stay in Europe (so far think i stayed at 5-6hotels for the trip, 4stars most of the time). Their orange juice is fresh too. I really wish I can enjoy my breakfast but I need to rush out for shopping :P 5-Staff I am one that likes to chat up with people haha and I must say that the staff here is very friendly. The uncle in charge of breakfast is a Chinese so its easier and normal that we can 'click'. But u wont find him chatting up with other guests The lady at front desk is also friendly too. We took the disneyland package from the hotel. Pay 8 pounds or so at hotel and balance at disneyland. Still cheaper than the board rate offered at Disney The guy in charge at night is friendly too. We lost the hotel room key and he helped us open the door and also replaced the plate on the hotel room promptly when we told him we lost the key. He assured me that even if someone picked up the room key, they wont be able to access the room anymore. He is extremely nice and never did he show any unhappiness or displease when he helped us with the door lock n card. I cannot imagine what will happen if I choose any hotel, including those at Pullman Bercy where some staff are more 'cold' and show unhappiness even when u asked one more qn on international calls. The door system is more of 'manual' like a key lock system where u have holes punched in the card and they have to match to open it up or so. THe only problem i find is I have to insert the card all the time when I want to open the door. In this case, there's been many times I have forgot to take out the card after I entered the room. At night, the main door is locked and i dont think a lot of people knows. Its safer to lock at night and the guy in charge (same person at night) has to manually press the button to let us go in and out of the hotel door. They have an airport pickup at 40 Euro for 2pax but we are told its unreliable because the driver has to wait for passengers. If the previous ones are late, then it will affect all the rest of the passengers. Train is said to be of low frequency on Sun. So we asked the guy to help us book for a cab We didnt know if its by meter or by per charge. Guess too busy to check. We are charged 60 Euro for the trip to Paris Airport and the car is big. Able to fit in 4 passengers and at least 4 big luggage. More like MPV? but bigger. Driver is already waiting for us at the hotel. We are late for 5mins after the check out. The housekeeping lady didnt enter our room when we put 'Do not disturb' sign. I know some other hotels does that. We asked for new towels and we make an 'exchange' with our old towels. 6- Location Very near to Elffiel Tower. We walked to the park at ard 11.55pm and at 12midnight, we saw the elffiel tower flashing blink blink!!! So surprised. They flashed for just a while and stopped. Although we are so near to Elffiel Tower, we only see it once as we are busy shopping. Easy to navigate because the metro station is really nearby. The 2 restaurants located nearby close at 1am and 11pm respectively. Foods are nice although the one that closed at 11pm (more pricey) is more salty. Summary I am not sure if the price i paid for is expensive or cheap but I must say that this is a cosy and nice hotel. Might look old because it is old (hundred + years old) but its still a decent hotel. Lobby is pretty and they give access for internet 30mins. Have 2 pc available and 1 printer. We managed to print out airline checkin with the printer. Its weird there's another door to be opened when the lift reached the hotel room level. After sometime u will get used to it. Its small and can only fit 1 person + 1 big luggage for one to 'enjoy' the lift with spacious space. Check in time 2pm but we arrived at 11am and as room is available, we are allowed to check in early. Otherwise, we have to leave our luggage with them and head for disneyland. Hot water is easily available. I do it the 'self service' way at the breakfast area although the guy offered to help me. We asked for car booking and we are informed that the phone isnt place properly. So at least we know the morning call is going to work in the morning Metro station is just 3mins walk away. Before u know it, u are already at the metro. I have bought Louis Vuitton bags and Chanel bags for my paris trip. They are placed in the room and I didnt have the space to pack all in my lugguage. So they are placed in big shopping bags with their own labels in the room. No issue and my things are still intact. So its pretty safe to put items in the room without being disturbed. I will defintely choose this hotel again if I am going back to Paris and want to stay near Elffiel Tower. The staff is nice. Its just a 2min walk to the park to get a decent view of the tower from far. (The tower dont look small) from the park. Just a note: Remember to remove the hotel card from the door after u open the door. Ensure that the door is really close. U have to push it to close it. Most hotels room doors have the system for it to close by its own but this hotel dont.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leland, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cReasonable hotel near Eiffel Tower\u201d", "Author": "BobGski", "ReviewID": "UR49293943", "Content": "Hotel was comfortable and clean but not a great value.

The location is awesome, close to the Eiffel tower of course, close to the boats, close to the Metro which gets you just about anywhere else you need to be. The staff was very friendly, professional, and helpful. Always available and attentive to our requests. We purchased tickets to Eiffel tower at the front desk as recommended by others. This was a BLESSING, as the lines were at least an hour long when we got there but since we already had tickets we walked right up to the line you go to if you already have tickets, they escorted us in and we immediately got on an elevator. Thanks to the staff at La Bourdonnais for this great suggestion. BTW if you live in the US you can buy tickets to The Louvre on line in advance and avoid that long line as well. Back to the hotel, the room was typically small as are most Paris hotel rooms, oddly the bathroom was very large, that was very nice. Plenty of hot water anytime of the morning or evening. The room was clean and bed comfortable. Housekeeping was great. No room complaints at all, the AC worked great. The morning breakfast is very good as well, so if your booking a room, try to book it with the continental breakfast, which is actually a continental breakfast plus bacon/eggs. It was very nice to be able to get a good breakfast at the hotel before heading out for the day. No issues with noise from the streets. Okay yes the lift is small, so what, geez I cant believe people complain about this. Obviously they have never tried to add an elevator to a two hundred year old building. It was small, but very efficient. Thanks to a great front desk staff for making our stay in Paris very enjoyable.

The only change which we'll make for our next visit will be to visit in May or June as during our week in March it was still to cool to fully enjoy the parks <and the gardens of Versailles were not in bloom yet>. The charm of this hotel is in its venerability. The narrow stairs and hallways creak as you walk through eliciting thoughts of times past. The comfortable sitting area off the main lobby <complete with gratis internet access> exudes old world ambience and comfort. The room itself was of surprising size as no shins were bruised in negotiating around the bed even. We were VERY pleased with the bathroom as it had been completely renovated and was gleaming. The shelf was of sufficient length to store everything in our arsenal. The room/bathroom overlooked the inner courtyard which was quite charming in itself! We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (15 Euros) with one reason being the close proximity of numerous vendors <for fruit> and patisseries<pastries>. Super breakfast for 1/5 of the cost. That being said we DID arrange at the end of the day for drinks to be sent up to the room which were very reasonably priced. There are a proliferation of outstanding restaurants/cafes very close by --- would recommend the Cafe Constant in particular <ended up going back there for final meal even>. Got the tip from Rick Steve's book which was invaluable for many things -- including walking tours. Staff at the hotel were excellent. Smiled at attempts to converse in French as were fully conversant in English <as in all other parts of Paris visited>. Hotel's location is absolutely superb -- quiet city location with so many shops/cafes, etc close by. Eiffel Tower only a short walk away<albeit more than the two blocks advertised>l and just around the corner from a Metro station. The transportation system was EXCELLENT - we had pre-purchased a five-day Paris Visite pass which was used extensively.

At night there was a little road noise, but nothing offensive. Great options abound from food, shopping and such. The metro was just around the corner which made it easy to come and go. The room was big. We had two queens and for Paris that is nearly unheard of. The Bathroom was even bigger. Watchout for that step up and out of the tub. But the bathroom was huge. The room was clean, and had a very Parisian style of decorating...say dark reds/maroons and a little victorian style. But overall I thought it was pretty clean. I certainly didn't feel concerned. We had two large windows overlooking the Ave de la Bourdannais. Now the only issue we had was that we were on the 1st floor...actually 2nd for us Americans. The problem with that was the hotel was under a little renovation on the outside...thus scaffolding and such. We had one window blocked because of it. Now, big city, open windows and scaffolding just are the best equation, so that was a concern of ours when we had to leave the windows open at night.

The internet was free in the lobby via access to two computers (no wireless) but be sure to use the computer with the English keyboard (not the French keyboard). Be sure to get the hotel's breakfast included special offered online - it costs 15 euro per person or 38 for a family of four. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, croissants and pastries, cereal, yogurt and cheeses, toast and jam, sliced oranges, and three types of fruit juice as well as hot drinks. The hotel elevator is REALLY small but reliable. There are two staircases but we were on the 5th floor (6 floors from ground level) so we only took them when going downstairs. The hotel is located near the metro, though I highly discourage taking it as it seems to be filled with beggars and mentally unstable people. A great option is the hop on hop off bus services (we used Paris L'Open). If you get a pass for 2 or 3 days, the per day cost becomes much more reasonable. There are four routes that take you almost anywhere you want to go in town and you can also add the water taxi service for an additional cost. Don't expect a great commentary on the bus, though, of the sites - they give you earphones and the English speaker is dull and doesn't say much about the sites - we spent most of our time listening to their piped in music. For those of you with kids, great news - your teenagers will probably be considered children at most sites charging admission (i.e. they get in for free, usually under 18 years of age).

Being at the front near the road it was VERY quiet no noise from the street what so ever and also the beds were very very comfy it taken a while to get out in the mornings it was that good of a bed. The hotel staff were poilte, there are two gentlemen who serve breakfast and help with bags etc t were always very friendly and helpfull.

We were in room 313 which was on the inner courtyard. The room was recently redone and quite charming. we even had our own little vestibule/foyer with an antique dresser in it. The bed was new and very comfy. The bathroom was HUGE and brand spanking new. The room was all done up in pale yellow, gray and blue. A good sized real closet with shelves, desk, 2 chairs, large windows and spotless! The walls are thin and the floors above are squeeky, but that's life. So if you are a light sleeper take earplugs. We did have some rowdy teens next door one night but simply banging on the wall shut them up! Loved the Rue Cler, reminded me very much of the Pike Place Market here in Seattle. Great people watching and the food shops are wonderful as is the florist. The best (and cheapest) cafe creme to be had is at the Cafe du Marche. For a more upscale coffee experience, go to La Tournville on the corner of Bousquet. Dinner at La Terrasse was very good, eat upstairs in the dining room, quieter, chicer, better service. if you go on Sunday night, order the nightly special of stuffed vegetables--lovely!

The location and that it has quad rooms have always been its great selling points for us. We are accustomed to European standards (small rooms, small elevators, many stairs) and these do not bother us. This last visit, however, we had an unpleasant experience at this hotel. We stayed in room 208 (quad room) and both beds were extremely uncomfortable; they sagged and were lumpy - I moved to every bed and the couch that night in a vain search for comfort. When we complained the morning after our first night, the staff at the front desk were not helpful. They said we could not change our room as they had no other quad rooms available. When I told them that we had stayed there many times, but would not stay there again, the woman at the desk simply shrugged her shoulders. The man at the desk said that he would ask the maid to see what she could do. (???!) Our teenaged daughters went up to the room and my husband and I went out. In our absence, the maid came to the room and was angry about our complaint; she took this out on our daughters, telling them, among other things, that this was just the style of bed that sunk in the middle, because it had legs (which she showed them). (???!) Our daughters are fluent in French, and did their best to ameliorate the situation with her. When my husband and I came back, we saw the maid outside our door, but she did not have the guts to discuss the issue with us - she did not even mention that she had been in the room. She should not have been handed this problem, as what could she do about it? But that was no excuse for how she treated our daughters. For us, having a comfortable bed is one of the most important things about our hotel room, because it affects how you sleep and how you feel the next day. Not only was the staff unresponsive at best (and rude at worst) about our complaint, but my sense was that nothing would be done which would improve the stay of the next people to book that room. Since we were only in Paris for 2 nights, we did not move to another hotel. But we will never stay there again. Aside from the bed issue, we had a room right next to one of the staircases, and we could hear everyone coming and going untli late into the night.

We booked through the Eurostar website. I also pre-booked the travel passes - which are well worth it, especially if you have a child who is into trains and undergrounds as much as ours are. The only thing to be aware of is once we arrived we still had to buy our first journeys fare - as you have to go and collect the passes from an outlet a few stops away from Gare du Nord. We also bought via the hotel a days pass for Disney Land. well worth it, not sure if you can get it slightly cheaper online before leaving uk. We only did the one park and couldn't get around that in one day - also worth looking into getting the fast-track passes for the rides as we ended up queing for upto 45 mins - there were plently of people bypassing the queue much faster with these tickets. Didn't bother with the continental breakfast offered at hotel after reading some of the reviews and did our own thing - calling into a bakery shop and getting freshly made choc chip french sticks and wolfing them down on route to wherever we decided to go.

The water was hot. This suite was 100% clean, towels were changed regularly and we were very happy.

Of course when I checked in there was NO AC available. Yes, there were units in the rooms, but they were \"broken\" and were being worked on. I had no AC for the entire length of my stay. Luckily it was cool in the mornings and evenings in Paris while we were there. But of course there was still lots of street noise to endure since we had to keep the windows open and during the day it did become rather warm. There were ceiling panels missing from the hallways with wires and cables hanging down. Not once did I ever see anybody working on these things even though I was assured that the AC was being worked on as quickly as possible. The rooms were tiny. The bathroom that was shown on the hotel's website certainly wasn't in our room nor in our friend's room. Our bathroom was tiny and even for 2 people would have been small. Unfortunately our room was a quad. The breakfast was OK, but not NEARLY worth the 10 Euro per person. We walked around the corner to one of the many patisseries and bought more than enough food for 4 people for breakfast at a total cost of 8 Euro. The extremely decorated room featured on the website is on the ground floor. It's a sitting area where nobody sits and it contains the hugely overpriced internet pc. Caution: Your room will look nothing at all like this room - not even close. This hotel has a good location, but other hotels located on the same street have the same great location. The difference is they tell you up front that they don't have AC and therefore they are about half price of this place. Try other hotels such as the Hotel Kensington (a few steps closer to the Eiffel Tower) or the Hotel Eber Mars (a few steps the other way). They are all located on the same street...the same great location. But they do not seem to have the same problem with misrepresentation as the Hotel La Bourdonnais. As for the final kicker...this hotel has the old style safes in the rooms with a key that you have to carry around with you. There is an 80Euro deposit required for this key and seperate paperwork is required in order to get the key. On this paper you must list name, address, and credit card details including card type, number, and expiration date. When I went to checkout and return the safe key, the guy at the front desk took the paper, wadded it up, and threw it into the trash can. Have the people of Paris ever heard of IDENTITY THEFT or CREDIT CARD FRAUD??? I'm sure it's not a secret in Paris. I had to tell the guy to dig my paper out of the trashcan and give it to me.

We found it to be nice, and very conveniently located. Our package allowed us to stay at several moderately-priced hotels while in Paris, so we got the opportunity to see several rooms on our trip. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable, but it was pretty cramped. The bed took up 90% of the space in the room, and you had to turn sideways to squeeze between it and the chest of drawers to get to the window. That also meant that the lower drawers couldn't open very far. The bathroom was good-sized for Paris, but had an unusual layout that wasn't very efficient. (The sink was in a corner and had no flat surfaces where you could put your toiletries.) The staff of the hotel was nice and helpful with directions to locations or ordering taxis. The real draw of this hotel though, was its very convenient location. It was right across from the Champs du Marr, the park in which the Eiffel Tower is located. In fact, we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room - if you stood close enough to the window! The Metro stop is maybe a half-block away from the hotel's entrance, so everything was well within reach. There were several shops, restaurants, and cafes nearby for a convenient nosh.

Good hair dryer. My in-laws from England flew down and stayed in another room (smaller but nice). Our room was exactly what I thought a Parisian room/flat would be, from the color palette to the shabby chic decor down to the balcony and the windows that opened to the street. There was never a lot of traffic, but this was August. It was air-contitioned, which was a plus, as it was very warm. Nice library to relax in between touring. Lovely neighborhood. We never felt unsafe, even if we were out walking at midnight. Loved being around the corner (literally) from the Eiffel Tower. We frequented the local bakeries for fresh croissants each morning and the hotel did a really great pot of coffee (the best we had while in Europe)...that was all we needed to get going. Loved several of the local cafes around the corner near the Metro for lunch...great to have several groceries nearby. Found a good laundromat a few blocks away. There were some homeless folks who frequented the area near the train station entrance, but it was good to show the girls that all is not perfect in this or any large city. Still, we loved the hotel and the neighborhood. The staff wasn't overly-friendly, but that's how I like it. If we ever needed anything they were ready to help.
