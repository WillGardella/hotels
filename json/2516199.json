The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the property backs up to an extensive vineyard with great views. There are various types of buildings, two pools, hot tube, exercise room, breakfast building, among others. The vineyard view rooms are very private and back up to the vineyard at the back of the property. The rooms have huge wood burning fireplaces and you have all the wood you will ever need. These rooms are spacious and have nicely tiled walk in showers,separate tube, and double vanity. I do, however, agree with a prior reviewer that for the price, the rooms and property don't offer a good value. At this price point you do expect more personal service. It's all self parking and there's no one to help with the luggage (and the walk from the car to the room can be quite long). A few other rather minor points worth mentioning that pertain to expectations: First, they don't replenish the bath products even when you stay multiple nights. We didn't get new bath soaps or hair products the entire stay. Second, they place a bottle of wine (375 mL) in the room but then charge you $15 for it upon check out. And third, they have a managers reception on Thursdays with complimentary cheese and crackers but no complimentary wine or other drinks (even sodas!). These three behaviors just don't seem to go with a property at this price point. I've stayed at many other chain hotels at much lower price points that have manager receptions with complimentary drinks. These are just not things I would have expected at this price point. They do provide two bottles of water at the evening turn down service and an ample breakfast is provide each morning in a separate building.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hidden treasure\u201d", "Author": "_JB2SanDiego_", "ReviewID": "UR126193436", "Content": "This Inn is in the middle of the Napa wine country right on the main route, but tucked back in a beautiful setting, with easy access to everything.

On Thursday they offer complimentary cheese and a discount on wine for the General Manager's party, although the General Manager did not show up so I think that they should rename the evening to the Harvest Inn Welcome party.

We found the prices continue to drop with the weather changing and November worked out well for us to see the changing of the colors. Also, go during the week to miss the weekend madness and the prices are also less then. Check in was quick and easy- they pre-charged our card for the first night so when we checked out the cost did not seem so bad-- the rooms are pricey ($465 ea with taxes for the vineyard view with the fireplace) but so is everything from Napa north on highway 29! Tip-- be sure to let them know if you are celebrating anything special --- we had our 37th anniversary and they graciously provided a bottle of Chandon bubbly. :) Thank you Harvest Inn! The beds are VERY comforable and down pillows that you can really sink into.

But the rooms are a bit old - there are 4 sections - Rose, Manor, Vineyard, Fountain. We stayed at the Rose section. The rooms are little clusters of wood cabins. Most of them are on the ground floor so it feels very humid & stuffy, plus rooms are small & dark. So if you are expecting something like bright sun-filled Caribbean resort rooms, don't come here. You'll feel very depressed. My friend's room's bathroom has ants crawling all over the counter top. Our room has quite a few fruit flies. The bathroom is fairly bright - painted white and with lots of light coming in. Our bathroom is as big as the bedroom - i.e., really small bedroom. No living area except a desk that's 3 ft away from the bed. If you tilt your chair back you will hit the mattress. Also as soon as you open the door, you see the bed. The mattress is like 2 steps away from the front door. So if anyone sitting out in the yard and you open your door, they will see you in your bed. Very stingily laid out floor plan indeed. The walls are very thin, you can hear the next door people talking in their room. Squeaky mattress as well. So if you are planning to come here for honeymoon, think again. Dog friendly though. They have some rooms equipped with dog bed and treats and water/food bowls. But other rooms dogs are not allowed. My friend's wedding suite is big, but also country cabin flavor.

Now keep in mind I had reserved 3 rooms for my 80 year old Mom , my 20 year old children and myself. We were in St. Helena for a family wedding. All the guest were staying at this property and that is why I chose to stay here. The young woman I spoke to one the 31st confirmed I was coming and would remove all room fresheners and understood my concerns. I even received a follow up call at my home stating all was taken care of. You must imagine my surprise when the desk clerk could not even find my name....... I was then informed by the manager that they were full except for 1 room that was a queen. I was also told St. Helena was sold out of all rooms except maybe the Whitehall Inn that is nothing like this property..ummmm did that mean it was a dive. I ask if they would please call Meadow Wood to see if they had rooms...this was when things began to improve greatly. The young woman on the phone was so kind and helpful I could have weep. We were able to secure 2 beautiful rooms at their sister property the Inn at Stonebridge. The manager and staff of the Harvest Inn were the most UNHELPFUL IN DIRE SITUATION. I stopped at the desk repeatedly to get receipt showing I had been refunded my deposit and never was able to get confirmation. It was refunded but with no help form the desk. Oh when told I could have one room with a queen for the siblings ( one boy and one girl) and they would give me a blow up mattress- then the manager corrected the clerk and said we could have a rollup for free. Finally after asking they help us out please they said they could give me the room for 199.00 Needless to say we declined their lack of help...I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL...AWFUL AWFUL EXPERIENCE.

This hotel is a GEM. From the very moment you enter the beautiful main house to check-in; you will be treated in every way like a special guest. Actually, the superior treatment started before we even arrived with the front desk staff helping us make dinner reservations at local restaurants for the three nights we were in Napa. Speaking of the front desk staff do not hesitate to ask them for advice as to which wineries to visit (special thanks here goes to Tara who helped us every day of our stay). Thanks to their advice AND some very useful vineyard passes we saved quite a bit of money on tasting fees (most were two for one). Two tips here: first, when you visit a winery we learned to always tell them we were sent by Harvest Inn, this helps everyone know they are being promoted (and sometimes even led to further discounts). Second, we learned that many of the wineries offer a military discount: you just have to ask. Special shout-out to Napa Mum for their 2-for-1 tour (making sparkling wine is more interesting than you would think) AND their 30% military discount. If you are going to stay at Harvest Inn, we definitely recommend the vineyard view room with fireplace. It's a beautiful site to wake up to every morning. The Harvest Inn also has a worthy spa; it's not as big or opulent as some of the other spas, but, ask for \"Cici\" and she will change your world. Also, don't miss breakfast (included in the price of your stay). It's far beyond the standard continental breakfast, offering pastries, quiches, fresh fruit, cheeses, and meats.

We stayed in a Fountain View room, specifically for the soaking tub and we were not disappointed. While the location was not as picturesque as other rooms, we found the room to be clean, spacious and exactly as advertised. I have to mention the turn down service! Each night when we returned from dinner, we had fresh bottles of water on our night stand, a full bucket of ice, a jazz CD playing and a freshly made bed. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast, both the food and the view. Despite the fact that it was only in the high 50's, we took our breakfast on the patio each morning. Fresh pastries, fresh fruit, cheese, meats and delicious quiche were among some of the selections. The staff was friendly and helpful. The grounds were beautiful. There were literally hundreds of tulips in bloom and the property was well manicured and the heated pool and hot tub were clean and well maintained. The hotel is very much an English cottage style hotel, yet it still had the feel of a more modern and updated hotel with new flat screen tvs and DVD players in the room. It does not have the feel of a sleek and modern hotel, but that is 100% of its charm. I must also say that Antonello at the front desk was the nicest, helpful hotel employee. It was perfectly located within the valley and very easy to access places both north and south.

Our room was also located right next to a wedding reception that was going on that night. No one told us anything about it, either while booking the room or checking in. My husband and I don't get away much and were looking forward to a good rest, so we were very dissapointed. We called to see if they could move us to another room and they were able to move us across the grounds. When we entered the room, no tub at all!

It is clear that woman was clueless and had some sort of personal axe to grind! It's too bad that a review like that might cause someone to miss out on an incredible couple of days like my wife and I just experienced! We have been coming to the Napa Valley for far too many years to count, both as leisure and as working trips. We are both make our living in the hospitality industry, so trust me, we understand \"Hospitality\". Our pleasurable experience started several months before we arrived at the Harvest Inn. We had purchased a 2 night stay at a charity silent auction event last year. As we were going through our stack of gift certificates last summer, we discovered that the stay at the harvest Inn had expired! I told my wife to make a phone call to the Inn before we just threw it away. The woman she spoke to was so nice, and yes, all of their reservations are handled on property by Harvest Inn Employees! She extended our certificate for an additional time period and we were able to finally book our trip in December 2010. We have stayed and a wide variety of hotels in the valley, including most of the \"Higher End\" properties, and the service we encountered was as good if not better than those properties. The front desk staff were terrific and even offered us an upgrade to the room type offered with the certificate. (Keep in mind that we were cashing in a gift certificate! The hotel certainly did not have to offer us any kind of an upgrade!) Our room was spacious and clean, with beautiful views of the vineyard at the rear of the property. As my wife put it, \"this room is so romantic\"! The wood-burning fireplace in the room was so cool! It was huge and the design is impossible to describe. The masonry work throughout the entire property is masterful! Take a walk through the grounds and look at the brick chimneys, pillars, pathways, and walls. It will amaze you! The hotel is located about a quarter mile from downtown St. Helena (our favorite town in the valley), and you will find wonderful restaurants and wineries very close to the hotel! We had such a great time that we ended up extending an extra night. Have you ever found that one special hotel that makes you feel like family? You know, the one where you end up missing the staff after you leave? That's how we feel about this hotel! We will definitely be back, and we both hope that will be soon! Folks, stay here!

Let me start with the positives...the inn is in a great location, convenient to everything in St. Helena (about 2 minutes to Press and Go Fish). The grounds are beautiful and the breakfast is very good...good coffee, oatmeal, quiche, fruit, pastries, etc. Before you get too excited, let me say that I doubt we would stay here again...read on. On to the room...we stayed in the Manor building which was located in the back of the property (which is what you want, away from the noise on Hwy 29) however, our room did not have a safe (??) or a tub and the hotel does not provide slippers. I thought this was odd considering the often cold temperatures in Napa and the price you pay for a room there (I think we paid approx $400 per night). I called and asked about the slippers and was told they don't offer them. I asked about the safes and was told only the newer rooms have them. We resorted to using our car as a safe which was easier then hauling our belongings to the front desk safes. Our room also did not have a balcony or a patio and when I asked about this I was told only half of the rooms have those. There is a big difference in the amenities you may or may not get in these rooms SO ASK! The room was very clean however the 2 glasses of wine we poured the first night (Thursday) were STILL in the room on Sunday when we checked out. Also, the complimentary bar includes 4 items - 2 water bottles, 1 orange juice and 1 Perrier. We took the 2 water bottles the first morning with us and they never replenished them. Internet - the free wifi *rarely* works. It has one bar at best and kicks you off...don't count on internet. I had 2 spa treatments here, a facial and a massage. The \"spa\" is a tiny, low ceilinged room upstairs from the pool where they also don't have slippers or robes or a sitting area to relax in. Each treatment was $110 and you would think you might get a few of the \"normal\" spa perks for this price. In fairness, the outside person, Tumi, that they hired to come in was very sweet and good. However, if you get a facial, do not expect a spa like one hour facial. This is more like a Swedish massage with a 15 minute, 5-step, very basic cleansing facial. This is fine if you don't care, but I have had many facials at many spas and this hardly qualifies. Finally, my biggest complaint with this property is their \"concierge\", Lisa, and the General Manager, Debbie [--]. I started emailing Lisa a month before our visit with some very specific wineries and restaurants that we wanted to go to. This is our 3rd year returning to Napa at the same time. I literally could not have made it any easier for her...I simply wanted her to make the reservations and to coordinate the stops based on location and proximity to each other. We got off to a rocky start when Lisa did not respond to TWO of my emails. I then called Justin, the assistant manager and asked for assistance. That prompted Lisa to leave me a condescending voicemail saying I must have misunderstood her but she was working on my stuff. She never even replied to me so why would I have thought that? So, she and I emailed for a few days with me doing all the work because every time she would tell me something was already booked, she did not offer any other suggestions. i still can't get over the fact that this gal is a concierge - she offered NOT ONE suggestion or idea as a replacement. Finally, I got fed up with her and called the GM, Debbie. After having a very nice conversation with her and explaining that we needed 2 wineries to fill the gaps in our itinerary and that we do NOT like the standing counter, walk up tastings but in fact LIKE the private tours, private tastings, vine to wine type of experiences, she assured me she would personally book us in to 2 great \"experience\" type tastings. The tastings we were booked into based on my research and request so far were Duckhorn ($35 pp for an estate tour) and Cakebread ($30 pp for a red wine tasting). Knowing ALL of this, Debbie took the liberty of \"booking\" us for a 3pm tasting at Freemark Abbey. We walked in and gave them our name and asked what we had been booked for - you guessed it - the $10pp standing room tasting. Just what we didn't want for our main afternoon \"activity\". Anyone can walk in and do this, all day long. After this experience I was highly suspect of the next mornings first appointment which Debbie also booked for us. I called the front desk and asked if they could try and get us into Far Niente or Nickel & Nickel. Lisa called me back and said neither was possible and that one of the wineries had a 28 person wait list. I woke up early the next morning and decided to take matters into my own hands. I first called Jessup Cellars, where Debbie \"scheduled\" us in at 10am. I asked them what we were booked for...you guessed it...the free tasting. I called Nickel & Nickel and told them how unhappy I was with the wineries my concierge was sending us to and asked if there was any way they could accommodate us on our last full day in Napa. I explained that it was my birthday, we were fans of the winery and that we were repeat visitors to Napa (not rocket science). Even with a 28 person wait list, they told us to come in at 10am and they would simply make their first group a group of 10, instead of 8. This was a one and half hour winery tour and tasting that cost $50pp and was great!! I'm still trying to figure out how I have more pull than a concierge and a general manager that live in Napa and work in the industry. Scratch head. The bottom line is that the place is well located, it is pretty, the breakfast is good but beware of the location and room type you are placed in and rely on the concierge for absolutely nothing (especially involving any input). And as far as Debbie, it's one of two things...1) either she did not care one bit about our experience or 2) she is simply clueless as to what a private tour and tasting is versus a walk up experience. Oh, I forgot to mention that we ended up walking into Jessup Cellars just to see what we \"missed\" since it is a few doors down from where we were booked for lunch...hmmm...it is about the farthest thing from a winery tour you could ever imagine. It isn't even on a vineyard...it is in a commercial building amongst many shops and it is nothing more than a small tasting ROOM. I understand they offer many free tasting coupons to the hotels and through the visitors center. This is fine but is NOT what we asked for, and more importantly NOT what we talked about on the phone or detailed in emails. All I can say is I am happy we didn't follow Debbie's itinerary and trusted our gut instead. Lastly, Tara at the front desk was very sweet and deserves mention as she was the only one who genuinely seemed to want to help.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful and Relaxing Inn\u201d", "Author": "sunshinefollower37", "ReviewID": "UR81964496", "Content": "We stayed here during part of our honeymoon.

There was a small patio area in front of the room, which contained two cheapish chairs, a table and a tacky plastic ashtray. Inside, the room was fairly spacious, with a fireplace and seating area, but I could not escape a certain motel feel about the place. The furniture was a bit tired, as were the linens, and we had problems with the TV. However, the bathroom was very large and well-appointed, and we enjoyed the oversized tub. However, my husband could not get over the cheap \"gas station quality\" toilet paper when he was paying around $500/night.

There were also two pools, although we did not get a chance to make use of them. I also have good things to say about the breakfast included in the price of the room, served in a restaurant or delivered to your room for a fee. It included a wide selection of the typical continental breakfast items, but also a nice quiche, as well as other hot foods like sausage, and made-to-order lattes and espresso drinks.

I read the reviews, good and bad, and have to say they are pretty spot on. If you can't get a vineyard view room, I would think twice about staying here. When I checked the rates online at the inn, the lowest price quoted was $569. I got deal through Orbitz for $444/night. It seems others paid far less, but it is high season in St. Helena so for a romantic getaway I went with it. I emailed the inn directly to let them know we would be traveling with our French Bulldog. She is all of 20 lbs,, well behaved, and we bring a travel kennel with us which she happily stays in when we're out of the room for a few hours, ensuring no damage can be done. I included all of this in my email. I received a rather terse response from Lisa, the front desk supervisor, that they did not have any 'pet friendly rooms' available any longer. For my $500 + pet fee you either are pet friendly or you're not. After exchanging emails Lisa said she would contact me if a pet friendly room became available before our arrival. Now when we got there they put us in a dark room right on the highway and the highway noise is significant, despite the fair job the inn has done of putting up trees and hedges to block at least the view of cars passing by. When we returned to the front desk to ask to be replaced, voila! a vineyard view room was available for an extra $40/night. Since we were already spending well close to $1000 for the weekend stay, we figured what the heck. I did not ask if this room happened to be pet friendly because I probably would have blown a gasket and at this point had decided just to enjoy the weekend. The vineyard view is lovely, but people did pass behind on a path and I did not feel safe leaving the door open in the evening. Reading about the people who had belongings stolen made me extra careful to lock all doors and make sure I didn't leave ANY valuables in plain sight. The room was adequate with a large brick fireplace, but I can say I smelled the ash every night when I returned. If you clean a fireplace and room out properly this smell should not linger....I know this because I have a wood burning fireplace in my living room. Ah, but the bathroom. We decided it was the 2nd best shower in America...the first is at my mother's carriage house. The soaking tub was also lovely and both me and my 6' husband fit in it quite nicely. Also the robes were soft and a nice weight so we actually purchased 2 for home. Lastly we LOVE air-conditioning and the weekend was quite room; the AC did not disappoint and for this we were grateful. As you walk around the grounds are lovely and well maintained and the pool looks nice, but we didn't use it since we were there to visit vineyards. If I were going for longer than one weekend I definitely would have wanted more amenities, i.e. restaurant, room service, activities, etc. The breakfast was meager, but the coffee was quite good and they gave me real half and half when I wrote it in on the breakfast card. I can see why some reviewers complained as it's certainly not what you would expect from a true B&B/Inn. Hard, sugary pastries, sugary granola, orange juice, and organic yogurt.

There's no one to help bring your bags to your room, so be prepared to shlep bags from your car to the room. Rooms: the rooms are really spacious and offer a mini-fridge and some complimentary beverages. The decor feels a little dated, and the plumbing fixtures in both of our rooms were a little \"off\" (you had to turn the shower knobs several times to get the water going).

The pools and hot tubs are also nice- we enjoyed a nice glass of wine in the hot tub at night.

There's also a great TV in the room, with a DVD player, and free wireless internet. All great extras! I also loved the L'Occitane bath products. The only thing that fell short was the room itself. Granted, we had the most base level room, and walking around the grounds, we passed some amazing-looking buildings (facing the Vineyards or fountain) which I'm sure had some great rooms.

What we got was a very nice room in the Rose building, and didn't realize until later that we had a room above us. And, the building was rather close to the very busy road running through St. Helena. But even so, the King bed was super comfortable, the bathroom enormous, and it turns out we had a smaller fireplace as well. It's a bit confusing to know for sure if the flue of the fireplace is open or not- they say it's \"always open\" but then instruct you to check (?) which of course is impossible unless you have a flashlight.

The grounds are nice, but I agree with another reviewer who called the rooms rustic. Our room was big, old and cold, and the thermostat was rigged so that if you turned up the heat, it automatically reset within a half hour. I had envisioned a cozy fireplace, however you had to make a special request to obtain real wood, and the configuration of the fireplace gave off no heat. They had a huge screen in front of it that we moved for a little while but that only improved things a little. Before I booked my room, I called to ask if they had DVD players so I could bring some movies with me, but I was told that only the new units by the highway had them. I figured it wouldn't matter much because our room would at least have movies on-demand like nearly every other hotel in the country, but I was wrong. Instead, the TV had a built-in VCR and there was a brand new DVD player in the room that I wish they had told me about. I figured that they've had the VCR's a long time, and now they have the DVD players, so the hotel must have a small movie library. They didn't and were entirely surprised by the question which is just plain stupid. It rained our first day and night so that's why a movie seemed like a great idea and I can't imagine I'm the first person to ever ask. All hotel mini-fridges are a rip-off, but the ones that burn me the most are those with the tiny glass bottles of soda so you get the least for your money, and of course that's what they had here. For the room prices, they could at least sell you a can for the $2.50. The free breakfast was mostly cereal and a number of bland looking pastries. It's provided until 11am, they put out the food and you serve yourself. By 9:15 any hot food except sausage links was gone and not replaced while we were there. From the empty pie plate, I guess it had been one quiche and maybe nothing else. We did not drink at the hotel's wine bar, but I glanced at the menu and it looked like the cheapeast glass was $12, which is higher than most restaurants charge except for very high quality wines. The one and only reason to stay at this hotel is for the vineyard and mountain views, which are lovely, BUT be careful that you get a room in the actual vineyard buildings. Ours was in a different building and although it had the view, there were two large trees blocking it. One of them had lost its leaves so we could see enough through it, but I would not have accepted it if everything were in bloom, and certainly not for the higher summer rates which people told me can be $600. This hotel is never worth that price. There was just nothing else special about it and no sense that it was being run by anyone who cares. One final disappointment is that my husband got sick the morning we had to leave for the airport and we still needed to ship a few items home, so he asked the hotel if we could pay for them to ship it for us. They said yes, but I just received the package and there was no care taken with our items and some are broken. They simply piled them in a box and crumpled a few pages of newspaper. We took a risk in not packing it ourselves, but if they didn't want to handle it then they should have said so. There was no chance that the items would arrive safely, and they knew it and didn't care.

The price of the room should have included a hot tub at least. Also, be warned that the spa services are contracted out from an independent dealer and quite frankly leaves much to be desired.

Overall, our stay was pleasant and relaxing. The location is excellent; a lot of wineries are within easy cycling distance or a short drive. We liked the rooms, although as other reviewers have said, the rooms with fireplaces sometimes retain a smoky smell when you arrive and the lighting isn't particularly appealing. But ours were large, clean and comfortable and each had a private deck. It's worth asking for a room away from the highway; I could see that it would be noisy. The staff was friendly, although not universally knowledgeable; they were all very young, and seemed afraid to make recommendations. We asked them what wineries they'd recommend and the response was \"they're all good.\" We would have preferred some more direction as it was the first trip to Napa for most of us, and I hadn't been there in years, and tthere are dozens of wineries in the vicinity. The \"spa\" doesn't really exist. They have a space where therapists can do massages; if you want one, book it when you book your room. We were there for four days, but that apparently wasn't enough lead time to arrange for anything during our stay. To be fair, we overlapped with a large wedding party on the weekend, so they had booked out services. But we were surprised that nothing could be arranged for any time on Monday or early Tuesday when we asked about it upon check-in on Saturday. The wedding also meant had to change rooms after the first night as the rooms we wanted (vineyard views) were not available. Our first rooms were in #133, one of the older king rooms. It had a private deck with nice landscaping; it felt very private. It was chilly, so the fireplace was very nice. It was very quiet. The next night, we shifted to ground-floor vineyard view rooms. These were GREAT. The views were lovely, they were spacious and each had a private deck. Our rooms were #310 and #311; any rooms in this part of the hotel are worth requesting rooms as they are far away the best ones; they're also away from Highway 29 and very quiet. I thought the bathrooms were fine, just a little dated. But the quality of the linens was superb, the robes were great and the L'occitane products a nice touch. As everyone has said, the grounds are lovely; this would be a great place for a small wedding. We saw a wedding setup, and it was lovely. The breakfast was good, if unimaginative. I wish they would alter the options from one day to another, though. We were there several days, and after day three, we were pretty tired of seeing exactly the same quiche and sausages. Overall, I thought it was pretty expensive, but Napa hotels tend to be pricey. If possible, I'd suggest going to Napa during the week; there's a significant price difference in hotel rates. We stayed Saturday through Tuesday evening. The whole experience was vastly more appealing on Monday and Tuesday -less traffic, less crowded tasting rooms and we had an easier time getting into restaurants. Side note - I visited the wine country in California a few years ago. I was surprised to find that virtually all the wineries charge for tastings now. Some are quite expensive. ($10 a tasting). We tried just getting two tastings for four of us and we were told that we couldn't do that at a couple of wineries; if we wanted to taste, we ALL had to get a tasting. We also went to St. Supery, where we ended up buying $200 worth of wine, but they woudln't give us credit for the $40 we spent on our tastings (which they promised). I would have genuinely appreciated more help from the hotel to direct us to the few places that don't charge for tastings. We stumbled on a couple during our last day there.

One corner of the room was occupied by a large brick fireplace. Unfortunately, the fireplace must have coughed out smoke during previous guest's visits, as the room had a strong smokey odor. Opening the french doors onto the patio, surrounded by large bushes near the pool, helped clear out some of the smell, and we eventually grew used to it. Walking through the gardens to the complimentary continental breakfast each morning was enjoyable and the nicely landscaped grounds in general were beautiful. I'd have to say that while it was a pretty nice place and we enjoyed our stay there, I would consider it a premium-priced hotel and I expected more for the money.

Our room cost over $400 a night and it was so not worth the money. The rooms are decorated like cheap motels, are very dark and dingy, and the bathrooms are old. The website is very misleading about the rooms. When we checked in, we immediately called the front desk bc we were unhappy with the room and believed that the room we got was not what we paid for or reserved. Our room was located in the spa and we had a view of nothing. In fact, we couldn't even open the drapes (to let in some light) bc our window led to the spa door where traffic was coming in and out. In addition, our ceiling was slanted and my husband is tall and had to duck to walk to the bathroom. They told us there was nothing they could do to change our room bc the hotel was fully booked. Interestingly, my grandmother, who checked in the following day, miraculously got a free upgrade. The next morning we found cobwebs in our shower and realized that the coffee maker had not been cleaned. We again called the desk to complain, and they again told us sorry, there is nothing we can do except have someone clean the shower and coffee maker immediately. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoon, after a lovely day of wine tasting, we asked for a manager. He told us that there was nothing he could do but that a complimentary bottle of wine was sent to our room that day as an \"apology.\" When we got to the room, there was no bottle of wine (not that we even wanted it anyway). I again contacted the manager to let him know that there was no bottle of wine, despite his promise, and we again told him we wanted soemthing done about the situation. We asked for a reduction in price, to which he flatly replied \"no.\" He honestly didn't seem to care about how disappointed or unhappy we were with the accommodations. If all of this is not bad enough, the hotel also screwed up the wedding plans. The wedding was basically a cocktail party with passed and stationary finger foods. I will say that the grounds are beautiful, but they ran out of food at the wedding - within 20-30 minutes - which is inexcusable. We were all starving afterwards and went out for dinner.
