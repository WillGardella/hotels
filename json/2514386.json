The apartment was well furnished, with very comfortable beds, a useful kitchen and very adequate bathroom, with instant hot water in the morning. The apartment was serviced every day and left immaculate. Another excellent feature was free internet available in the lobby (you could pay for internet in your room, but I can't see why you would do this). Laundry facilities were available, but, with four very cheap laundries with in a block or so, it is hardly worth availing oneself of this facility. The Murray Hill also has a very adequate gym and workout facility. The cost was extremely reasonable for a facility of this standard.

The king sized bed and pillows were moderately comfortable. The internet service, which I ordered from my room, was dodgy and I didn't have time for a technician to come up to sort it out, so I never did get it. The hotel is definitely older and could use a sprucing up, but it was clean. I walked everywhere I went, the location was so convenient, so I saved money on transportation as well as eating breakfast and lunch in the suite. I felt it was a bit pricey, however--for this money I could have stayed at the 4-star Carlton, or my usual favorite, the Affinia Shelburne, also in the area and more luxurious.

Overall we were very comfortable and enjoyed the excellent location despite the feeling upon entering the hotel that we had just stepped into the 1970's. Pros: The rooms were large, the staff was helpful, though not more than that. We stayed on the 8th floor facing away from the street and didn't have any problems with noise. The bed was comfortable and we didn't see any bedbugs -- sometimes a problem in New York City. The room had ample closet space, a small safe, a plasma TV (though only a few channels), a phone, and a small kitchen with a sink, oven and stovetop, and refrigerator. An iron and ironing board were also provided. We used the free wireless internet in the lobby which worked OK rather than paying for internet in the room (about $8/day). The room had a table with a couple of chairs for meals and a small area with larger chairs in which we were able to receive guests. The location is great! About 7 minutes walk from Grand Central Station. For those of you who don't know New York City, this means that it is easy to get to most attractions by subway. The hotel within walking distance of the Empire State Building and of a string of Indian restaurants on Lexington avenue near 28th Street. The kosher delicatessen 2nd Avenue Deli is only a few blocks away and very tasty. Also, there are reasonably priced buses from Grand Central to La Guardia and JFK airports. Cons: Except for the plasma TV, everything in the hotel seemed very old including the phone, the elevators and the decor. Stylistic issues aside, this only presented us with minor problems twice: At one point the elevators weren't working properly. This only inconvenienced us for a few minutes. Also, the lock on the safe (which is not big enough for a laptop computer) was mechanical rather than electronic. We needed to go down to the front desk to request a lock and key to close the safe. The hotel does not provide meals -- not even breakfast, though there are ample restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores withing close walking distance. Two other problems -- as in many New York buildings, the room was too hot. We had to leave the window open nearly all the time. Also, the entrance is a few stairs down from street level with no ramp. It was a bit hard managing our suitcases and I imagine anyone needing a wheelchair would find the hotel inconvenient. We paid $130/night before taxes (about $25/night). This included a $20 discount for being AAA members (American Automobile Association). I called the hotel directly and got a slightly better rate than what I saw offered on line. Overall, this was certainly not a luxury hotel, but we were quite comfortable and would stay there again if we return to NYC.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Friends Weekend\u201d", "Author": "happytoretire", "ReviewID": "UR120739213", "Content": "I was with 6 other friends and we had the 2 bedroom suite.

The biggest one being location. The hotel is a five minute walk to Grand Central Station. For first time visitors - it's a great place to get shuttles to any airport and it's a central hub for NYC's subway. It's a fifteen minute walk to 5th avenue, Time's Square and The Empire State Building. As mentioned before there is a kitchen in the rooms and you can buy food at Grand Central's market and cook it - which we did - and at the convenience store by the hotel. The other good thing about the hotel is the cleanliness - the staff are attentive and do an excellent and fast job of cleaning the rooms. The last good thing is the price. Most Manhattan hotels are far more expensive than where we stayed. It was good to have a \"suite\" in Manhattan for less than $200 per night. The fact that a kitchen is in the room can be a major price saver as you can make your own meals instead of going to Manhattan's expensive restaurants. The worst is to come. For a three star hotel everything in the room is dated. The carpet, floor and wall tile, fixtures, kitchen equipment, washroom and everything else is very dated. It's like a trip back in time. It wouldn't be bad but it feels unclean in the back of your mind. Also many other 3 stars I've been in had better more modern fixtures in the kitchens and bathrooms. This was not the case in our room. Also and I don't know if this is the case in most NYC hotels but here goes. Again for a three star I expect a few more amenities. This hotel had no pool, no washing machines, no vending / ice machines - they expect you to fill an ice tray in your own room's tiny fridge, no pay per view movie channels - NYC is fun but sometimes it's good to kick up your feet and watch a movie and relax, the best WIFI is in the hotel's lobby where I often saw many people on their laptops and no restaurant. There's a flat screen tv in the room with numerous channels and a fitness room. So most of the comforts of hotels are not at this hotel. The bathroom was the worst part for me. The kitchen is bigger than the bathroom! Forget about two people using the sink at the same time - if you can get two people to fit in that bathroom at the same time. And watch your feet as you walk in. For some strange reason the floor tile in the bathroom is higher than the carpet just at the outside of the bathroom.

We booked the studio room but on check-in found they had given our room away and tried to put us in a disgusting SMOKING room. We made it clear what kind of room we booked and made it perfectly clear what time we were checking-in (late) - and we arrived EXACTLY on time. We immediately requested they find us another room, and although they insisted they had no other available room, mysteriously moved us to another room that didn't smell (what happened to being fully booked and NO other rooms available??) The next day we were moved to a 3rd room that had 1 king bed instead of two smaller beds. We consider giving our reserved room to someone else and this deception about being fully booked to be totally unacceptable. This is not professional. I don't know what were the type of rooms we were moved to, but the first two were much larger than the final room where we stayed - the final room had the larger bed. With hindsight I wish we had kept the 2nd room as it had separate living room and bedroom, and was more comfortable (although there were 2 small beds instead of one large). The kitchenette in most (or all) rooms is a great feature, and even the smaller rooms are big-ish sized for NYC. However, the bathroom in the last room was small and VERY tight. Reception staff are typical New Yorkers - curt and unfriendly - compared to say Australia or England. The FREE internet in the lobby was most welcome, and the in-room internet rates were reasonable. We stayed on the back side which was MUCH quieter, and we occasionally were able to connect to a nearby open wireless network, saving us a trip to the lobby for the free internet. I guess overall it was not bad and not great - just average.

We cannot find fault at all, the suite was extremly spacious, beds brilliant etc - we were on the 14th floor. The only thing I would say is if you dont smoke make sure you ask for a non smoking room ours did have a faint wiff of cigarette smoke. The hotel is well situated for all the main attractions of New York. Times Square 15mins walk, Central park 30mins walk, Grand central station 10min walk. If you have not arranged transport to your accomodation, dont worry, I would recommend you get on one of the airport shuttles. We landed at Newark and it was $17 each to Manhatten, you can get a return for around $27 each. It does take longer as there are other passengers ( the shuttle takes about 12 passengers). But its alot cheaper than a taxi. You also get to see a lot of New york depending upon where they are dropping off. Taxis - we were told - charge extra for lugage and tolls. Be prepared for the cost of eating out. It is not cheap experience,it is just as expensive to buy and cook yourself. However, I can recommend the following: Siniqual, 640 Third avenue (on the corner of41st and 3rd avenue) - its just around the corner from the hotel and decribes itself as comtemporary mexican cusine . Sea, 114 north 6 st Brooklyn, a thai resturant reasonably priced. the one we visited was where a scene from 'sex and the City' was filmed. There is more than one in New York. Hale and Hearty, all over New York. They are a great place to go for a lunch time bite. Thye mainly have soup - homemade(?)- try the chicken balsamic and avocado ciabiato Andrews Coffe shop 35th st and 7th Avenue - great for breakfast and great coffee, a continual flow Chipotle, again all over York- A mexican take away.

The building is located two blocks from the drop off point for the Newark Express bus at the back of Grand Central Station. We were surpised when arriving that it does resemble a hotel with a 24 hour reception and concierge service. The accommodation was busy with travelers from a few different countries. It was the week of the New York marathon which might have been a factor but we got the impression that this was normal. It is clear that this had previously been an apartment block and the accommodation comprised of a large lounge area with bed settee, bedroom with two queen sized beds, kitchen and bathroom. There was a problem with the heating in the room when we first arrived. We were told it was in fact a problem in the whole building and could not be fixed till the following day. The reception provided a heater within a few minutes which we were able to keep for the duration of our stay. The accommdation is clean and comfortable without being luxurious. It is a bit dated but this is something that we've found in New York in general on previous visits. The building has a couple of good quality diners within a minutes walk (try Scotties for good value). There are some local bars in the area which are ok for a quick visit. If you choose not to walk too far, Manhattan is best navigated by the Subway system. Grand Central is the nearest subway station (about a 5/10 minute walk) with Times Square a further 10 minute walk. This isn't a huge problem but it can be a bit tiring after a day sightseeing or shopping. At $235.00 a night (plus tax) it is in the same price range as some hotels but you do certainly get more for your money than just a simple room.

For non US citizens the next information is quiet important. When we arrived we had to immediately pay the room. All the debit cards that we had didn\u2019t work although we later used then to pay for things in supermarkets and stores without problems, as long as there was a system were one could introduce the pin of the card. So if you do not have a credit card (which was your case), take the money to pay for the hotel with you. We had to go down the street to withdraw money to pay for the hotel, and if we had known we would have brought it from home (because it is cheaper and there is a limit to the amount of money you can withdraw, at least in Portugal, and we could only pay for the whole thing in money because there were two of us with to different cards to withdraw money). When we got there we were told that our room had been upgrade. We had booked the cheapest room for two people and I\u2019m not really sure what we were given because the bed was only a double bed. The room was huge and with everything one might need. The kitchenette had cutlery, plates, cups, frying pan, a cutting board\u2026 basically everything you need to cook. The cleaning of the room in the morning included the washing of the dishes which was very nice. The room was fairly clean without any major thing to report. We stayed in the 8th floor and the room was very quiet and we almost couldn\u2019t hear any outside noise. The air conditioner seemed to work fine but we didn\u2019t turn it on because the room was always cool even thought it was extremely hot outside. For me, the only problem in the room was the mattress. Incredibly soft and bumpy. Not very comfortable. The location of the hotel was great. We were just 5-10 min away from the grand central station and from there we could take the subway to anywhere in the city. Near the hotel there is a supermarket with everything you need as well as some bars. To go out at night it was not the best place, but again the subway is just 10 min away.

Not bad for a 5 night stay. The room was huge compared to rooms I've had before. Stayed at the Renaissance and Hotel Sofitel in New York, where the rooms where have the size and double and triple the prices, respectively. I wanted to go cheap so that I could spend on sight seeing, shopping, and eating. There's a recession this year, and I don't want to further myself into debt! What I didn't like about the rooms were that the carpet, couches, and bedspread were very dated and dark. The darker the better to hide the grime, I suppose. However, with a one year old and returning to the hotel after all the walking, we were too tired to care about the cleanliness factor. The great thing is that there is a kitchen, but no dish detergent. I had brought my own dish scrubbing pads to wash my baby's bottles and spoons, but I was annoyed that there was no Palmolive in sight. There was also no microwave. We never used the stove to cook, but there are pots and pans. I really needed the fridge for the baby's milk. The bathroom was kept clean. However, my husband noticed that when he ripped open a sugar packet, that the maid did not throw it away, but rather put it back with the other sugar packets. So she wasn't that attentive. The locale is great because it is 5 minutes from Grand Central station, where we hopped the Subway. We even walked in the rain from Times Square to the hotel and from the hotel to MoMA, about 20-30 minutes because we were tired of using the Subway. So a few spots are a comfortable distance to the hotel. There was also a CVS that I would send my husband to for Bengay for my aching knees or diapers a couple of blocks away. Great Cuban eatery close by at $20 for 2 people. The best thing about this hotel was the location.

We couldn't believe it -- an oven, in our hotel room! We're budget travelers, and we were blown away by how huge and well-appointed it was. Even the door keys were real metal keys. Turning a former apartment building into a hotel was a great idea. It was our home sweet home for two brief nights, and I was sad to leave! The staff was wonderful and very responsive. At one point our toilet got stopped up, and housekeeping responded immediately and fixed the problem. On our first night, some frat boys in a room down the hall sounded like they were getting violent, and all I had to do was talk to the front desk clerk and we never heard a peep from the boys again. Housekeeping also kept our room nice and clean, with plenty of fresh towels. We didn't get to use the free gym or laundry room, but they\u2019re there. The Murray Hill neighborhood is delightful; low-key but cheerfully lively, with restaurants to fit every budget, and lots of fun shops. I saw many people with dogs \u2013 this is a true residential neighborhood that probably sees less tourism that more famous New York neighborhoods. Yet it's close to Grand Central, the subway and bus service. We suspected there might be a boarding kennel nearby, having heard a group of dogs barking a few times at reasonable hours. Totally not a problem for us. Only one thing wasn't perfect; the rooms don't have wifi. This wouldn't be a problem for many travelers, but geeks like us need our connectivity, as do most business travelers. Wifi in the lobby wasn't really a solution. We jerry-rigged wired laptop connectivity in our room through my partner's PDA, but not everybody is able to do that. We would have gladly paid by the day for wifi, and I really do hope they\u2019re working on getting it into the rooms. It would make an extraordinary hotel experience perfect.

Ok so the tv was an old style one like some reviewers have mentioned however there was nothing wrong with the reception. I think if you go to New York and end up watching loads of tv then you are very sad indeed as there is so much to see and do in the city. Also it's even worse than watching it in the UK because there are adverts every 5 minutes or less!!!! Our room was cleaned every day too with fresh towels.

Also, the TV situation was pretty funny -- it was a huge, clunky TV on a rolling stand that could be moved around the room. Once again, for $110 a night, what do you expect? The hotel was definitely a no-frills experience. The largest problem is that the walls were extraordinarily thin, and we could hear every peep made in the rooms around us.

The last night I called the front desk to complain, and the man at the front desk was decidedly unhelpful. Also, we noticed that they never changed our bed sheets -- they just made the bed. They did replace the towels every day. We stayed on the second floor, which had its advantages and disadvantages. We had a lot of street noise (typical of New York -- I lived there for several years and it's just something you have to get used to) and there were neon lights in the windows across the street which gave our room an electric pink glow when the shades were open. When the shades were closed, the light was not a problem. The benefit to the second floor, however, is this hotel does not have internet access, except wireless in the lobby.

It is maybe a block from the hotel at 581 3rd Ave and it is called Hane Sushi. If you do decide to go there ask for Charlie and he will hook you up with the best stuff you have ever tasted!!! We also went to Margarita Murphy's and had a pretty good time there. I hope this was helpful.

Upon arrival, the hotel was better than we thought, from the very kind doorman to the spacious (not common in NY) hotel room. We were upgraded to the Queensize bedroom., which had three closet spaces including iron/board. cozy bathroom w/ courtesy toiletries and kitchenette w/ mini refrigerator and oven with all essential cookware (no microwave though). They even had a small area for dining and living room. The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect ! 5-10 minute taxi or walking distance to everywhere...Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, Chrysler Bldg, and Rockafeller Center. The lady in the front office even mailed out my postcards for me. There is no internet in the room, but if you have an laptop with WIFI you can go downstair in the hotel lobby / waiting area, you will receive free internet there.

Be sure to grab a slice of cheesecake at Junior's (originally in Brooklyn, they now have a storefront in Grand Central Station as well as a diner on Shubert Alley in the Theater District) too.

One small piece of advice; do not ask them to call a cab for you for an airport trip the night before you need to leave. Hotels cannot call cabs so they called a car service for us.

I was surprised by what I got for my money when I had \"won\" this hotel on Priceline. For those unfamiliar with Priceline you choose the area in which you would like to stay with its star rating (I chose 2 star, but got a 3 star so you can luck out that way), and they tell you pretty much right away whether your offer is accepted. The hotel name stays anonymous until you put in an offer and it is accepted. I managed to get a whole one bedroom suite (looks like renovated condo) that came with a living room, large one bedroom with king size bed, a small bathroom, and a kitchen. I got all this for an extremely reasonable rate (it would have cost the same for a hostel in downtown manhatten!). I was travelling with my fiancee and we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near all the attractions of NYC since it was our first time. This hotel is on 39th street, and Grand Central station is ony 42nd so it's pretty close, but not as close as some of the reviews made it sound. It is about a 5-6 minute walk, and it can be a long one in the 30 degree celcius heat. Nevertheless it's not a bad location. The kitchen was small so we didn't end up using it except for the full size freezer/fridge (great for keeping your drinks/leftovers cold). The only suggestion have for ths hotel is to put in microwaves. I was impressed by how clean our suite was, and by how large the bedroom and living room were. The tv (although tiny) was good at the end of the day of walking and walking, and there were many channels to choose from. The bed was huge, and the airconditioning in both the living room and bedroom was nice. The maid did an amazing job with housekeeping every day, making sure the bathroom linens were well supplied and the such. The concierge downstairs was neither rude nor over hospitable--so if you needed anything it was there but they don't bother you much. The hotel did not seem at full capacity which means it was really quiet. The hallways did smell like rancid smoke at times, but our suite was fine. The elevators are old, but I think most buildings would be old like that in manhatten, unless you plan on shelling the bucks for something fancier and much more expensive. Overall I would say choose this hotel if you are budget minded, and need/want a lot of room, and a place to stay close to everything. We took the subway everywhere, and you can even walk to the Empire State building from the hotel. It's not fancy, but it's good value for your dollar. My total trip (hotel & air from Vancouver) was $1000 CAD and that is a real bargain for such an expensive city. Tips: 1) Buy the new york pass. You can buy it there (planet hollywood in times square) or online at newyorkpass.com. Well worth the money and helps you plan your itinerary. You get $10 credit each day of the pass at Planet Hollywood which I used for souvenirs. The New York pass also allows you to skip ticket lines, like at the busy Empire State Building. 2) Buy an unlimited metropass--it's indispensable and way cheaper than taking a cab in this traffic congested city. You can buy these at the machines there. 3) Credit cards are accepted everywhere! I hardly ever had to fork out cash. Very convenient. 4) Some must see things (all free w/ the New York pass): Radio Music City Hall Tour Madisson Square Gardens Tour DO NOT DO THE ROCKEFELLER TOUR unless you want to just look at the art on the buildings for an hour NBC Studio tour (go early to reserve your spot--this fills up fast, we had to go the next day) Circle Line Boat Cruise (we upgraded to the 3 hour for $4 more--nice on a hot day and good to do in the beginning for a good overview of the city). 5) To get to the hotel from JFK airport we opted for the subway instead of a $45+ cab ride (flat rate plus tips/tolls). It is $5 for the airport airtrain to the subway and $2 for the subway (or you can buy the weeklong unlimited pass for $24/week). There are also shuttles you can take like airlink and supershuttle. We used airlink ($20 USD) one way to JFK from the hotel and had a HORRIBLE experience. They billed our credit card, and the driver asked us to pay again in cash! After a LONG discussion we finally got our cash back and was not a nice way to end our trip. You can prebook Supershuttle online at their website and they give you a discount.

I've previously stayed at the Eastgate Tower, across the street and a block east of here, and had a pretty good idea what to expect from this converted apartment building. In fact, the Murray Hill East Suites was nearly identical physically to the Eastgate Tower -- my room was a mirror image of the one I had at the Eastgate Tower a few months before. My general perception was that the furniture/drapes/carpets at the Murray Hill East seemed every so slightly newer/cleaner than at the Eastgate Tower, but the furniture itself was identical, and there wasn't much difference overall except for the bathroom; the bathroom in the Murray Hill East appeared to have been remodeled with completely new fixtures, tile, etc. sometime in the last year or so. The room itself was large and comfortable, with a dining table and chairs, sofa, end tables, arm chair, coffee table, TV stand, and dresser, along with a double bed and one nightstand, arranged in an L-shaped room with the dining table at the top of the L near the door, the couch along one wall, the TV near the angle of the L, and the bed/nightstand in the base of the L. The small kitchen is in a separate room near the entrance door, with a half-sized fridge, full four-burner (albeit small) range, coffeemaker, sink, etc. The bed itself was nothing much -- at the low end of acceptable -- and the pillows were barely there -- I had to scavenge the two extra pillows from the closet to make up a decent place to put my head, and the first time I looked in the closet for extra pillows I mistook the two pillows for folded sheets -- they were that thin and flimsy. I ended up not using the high-speed internet access -- I couldn't find any indication of a hotel-provided wireless signal, and there was no wired connection of any kind in the room. Since I didn't start looking until late in my only night there, I decided I could live without it until morning and didn't pursue it. Neither here nor there, but this was the first hotel I've been to in the US in fifteen years or so where I was given an actual, honest-to-god metal key for the room, instead of a magnetic card key(another vestige of the building's days as an apartment building). If you're particularly concerned about security and the possibility of someone duplicating the key, I suppose that might give you pause. Service, in the limited interactions I had with the staff, was courteous and professional, if not effusively friendly. All in all, this seems like an excellent option in this part of Manhattan, particularly for the price. If I were to return to this customer's location for several days, I'd definitely consider it.

Location is close to Macy's and a big shopping district. The Hotel was a great surprise! To our great surprise we had be upgraded and the room was HUGE! a large living room a good sized kitchen and large bedroom with 2 double beds. Travelling with 4 people it was a great size! We had our luggage lost upon arrival so the hotel was very helpfull to make our stay more comfortable. There is lots of places to eat in the area! if you walk towards lexington. Scotties is a GREAT dinner for breakfast or late night dinner and they deliver to the hotel!! If your going to New York City and looking to do some site seeing then consider doing the \"Grey Line double decker bus tour\" it is a hop-on-hop-off pass and it is a great deal! There is a stop at the UN building which is pretty close to the hotel! The Beds were comfortable and the airconditioning worked great! The only thing wrong was the tub collected water when having a shower but thats not even a big problem.

It has all you need close by: supermarket, internet access (next door), several diners, bars, restaurants all within a couple of minutes. Very handy also for the subway. The suite was extremely spacious and the bedrooms both had 2 double beds. The lounge /dining area was large and great for a late afternoon/early evening chill in between all the sight-seeing and eating out! There were two bathrooms, both with showers and masses and masses of storage. The only problems we encountered were one of the showers had no pressure and a heater was blowing cold. Both of these were rectified immediately we reported them and we could not have asked for more. The staff without exception, were very friendly and helpful. There is a little traffic noise but to be honest where in NY isn't there traffic noise? You quickly get used to it and it certainly didn't effect our sleep. The decor was a little dated, but we weren't there to carry out a critique of US tastes in wallpaper! We all agreed that any further visits to New York would include a stay here, it's tremendous value for money (each couple paid around $1450 inc taxes for 5 nights). I can highly recommend the Murray Hill East Hotel to anyone wanting a short stay bolt hole for a great price. Also, try a visit to the Russian Tea Rooms adjacent to Carnegie Hall for a special night out, but you must book. A bottle of wine from their world class wine list range from \u00a330-\u00a33000! The Boathouse on Central Park Lake is also a great venue, very very romantic! . Closer at hand, try Sams, a little Italian opposite the hotel. Another first for us on this trip was a visit to the observatory at the top of the Rockefeller Centre. Massive queues at the Empire State (2hours), hardly any at the RC and I think the experience is better. More centrally located so better views, especially of Central Park. No irritating grating to look through just clear glass panels, and something you could never get from the ESB..... a fantastic view of the ESB from 70 stories up!!

Lots of reasonable restaurants nearby. Even a market around the corner which is handy with a small kitchenette in the room. The room was good sized junior suite. There was a table and chairs - small kitchen area, sofa and bed nook - small bathroom - but modern with good water pressure etc. Good closet space with a small in room safe (not suitable for a laptop). The hotel also provided basic toiletries. If you are looking for a central location with some good space and the downsides below don't bother you - this could be the place for you. Otherwise I would suggest you find some other location. DOWNSIDES ------------------ The walls were paper thin - so if you are not used to city noise, you may find it a challenge getting to sleep. Be sure to ask for even number rooms which face a courtyard (not 39th) which can be quite noisy. I was able to hear verbatim conversations that people were having in the hallway. Also, if you are looking for high speed connect, wifi in the rooms etc so that you can work in your room - forget it. They told me they have modem - but the only phone in the room is next to the bed with a small cord - so I guess you are working in bed with an awful connection. Basically for the modern business traveller - this is not the place for you. Also, if you are expecting to order room service while you work - forget it - no room service offered. You will need to go around the corner and get take out. The hotel was clean - but quite old looking, they actually have keys in slots and most of their recordkeeping seems to be done manually. The first clerk I had was not too friendly and kept me waiting while he put papers in the slots. The second clerk however was very friendly and professional. Just as a comment - I actually left this hotel before my intended departure. I had to have my travel agent put me somewhere more in line with a business class hotel.

All in all, it is a very good place to stay if you are just regular folks who don't require a lot of special attention and want a clean hotel room that is conveniently located in New York City. Our room was on the 9th floor, and was equipped with a small kitchen with a refrigerator which allowed us to buy some groceries to eat in the room. The room was clean. The air conditioner worked fine, although I'm not sure if it would suffice in 100 degree weather (it was in the mid 70's and lower 80's during our stay). The curtains cover the air conditioner, which is a bit strange, but you can just shut the blinds and leave the curtains open, giving you the full air conditioning benefit which you will probably need, as New York is quite humid at times. The bathroom towels were a little worn, but everything was clean and maid service did a good job every day in washing our dishes, replacing our towels, etc. All of the hotel employees were courteous. The exercise room, although small, was nice, and overall it was just a fine place to stay. The rooms were quiet until the last night when the \"Loud Family\" moved next door to us. They had a kid who hollered at the top of his/her voice and they acted as if they were the only ones on the floor. But when these outbursts happened, they were quelled fairly quickly (I don't know if there were complaints from other patrons or what, but one minute all hell would break loose, then 2 minutes later , all was dead quiet, and stayed that way, until the next outburst which could come hours later.) You could also hear conversation quite clearly from another room through the air grate in the bathroom at times, but since we weren't spending a lot of time in our room, instead preferring to explore NYC, it was not a major problem.

We couldn't have asked for a hotel better suited to our needs. I can't imagine anyone not being thrilled with MHES, but I suppose it depends on what you want. If you are looking for the classic hotel experience (lots of fawning staff, big heavily-decorated lobby, glass-enclosed elevators, a hotel bar and \"what usually turns out to be\" a mediocre and overpriced restaurant), MHES (which was once an apartment builing) is probably not your place. If, on the other hand, you don't mind not having a chocolate mint on your pillow every evening, like staff who are friendly (but not over-the-top), like plenty of space, a reasonable price and want to be near, but not in the middle of, Times Square, you can't do better than MHES. Our suite had a more than adequately-sized living room/dining area, complete with a sofa sleeper, love seat, desk and dining room table. The kitchenette was more than adequate with a full size gas range, refrigerator, dishes and coffee-maker. We also requested a frying pan and microwave from room service, both of which were promptly delivered. The separate bedroom had two full-size beds with very comfortable mattresses (recognizing that tastes vary widely). The bedroom alone was about the size of what one would expect in a typical suburban hotel. The bathroom was small, but very clean. Overall, the worst you could say is that the decor and room, which is kept spotless by the crack cleaning staff (they'll even do your dirty dishes if you don't get to them first), is somewhat dated (but not at all worn). Did I mention quiet? We were next to the elevators and I never heard them. The location was perfect for us as well. The Murray Hill area is more residential than most midtown Manhattan neighborhoods, but from MHES it was an easy walk (less than a mile) to the UN, Chrysler building (actually about 4 blocks), Grand Central Station (about 5 blocks and the location of the nearest subway), Empire State Building and Times Square. There's a D'Agostino grocery store about 1 block away and a Duane Reed Pharmacy about 2 blocks. Eateries in the neighborhood are too numerous to mention, but our favorite was the Dining Concourse at Grand Central Station, which provides lots of not-so-typical options. Probably the biggest endorsement came from our kids (ages 10 and 13), who would easily have given up one more docent-led tour at a museum for a more downtime in the hotel. Lastly, from what we could tell, the neighborhood is safe. Returning to our hotel from a Broadway show at 11:00 pm seemed as safe as it is in Madison, WI, our hometown.

I am in the commercial real estate business and our company usually puts us up at the Peninsula or Four Seasons so I was a little nervous about this little place, but serving on a charity board, the group needed to watch its $$. We walked into the very nice and elegant lobby of the Murray Hill Suites. A doorman was there to welcome us and take our luggage and I was given a key to Room 407, a 1 Br Suite on the 4th floor facing 39th St. This really was a suite-a living room, dining area with table, a separate full kitchen with utensils, dishes, coffeemaker and full size frig. Decent size bath with plenty of towels, good toiletries and hair dryer. The bedroom alone was the size of the typical NYC hotel bedroom so having all this space was great. Lot's of closet space with iron and ironing board and a family of 4-6 could have easily stayed in this room. The price? Our travel person bought our plane tickets in a package deal with rooms through Orbitz, so for each person, with airfare and 3 nights, it was $602 per person. By my calculation, after you take out airfare it was about $100 a night-couldn't believe it, especially since we were at the Benjamin on 50th and Lex, 3 weeks prior at 5 times the price! I use this site a lot for travel recommendations as I travel for business and I had read the reviews here, before we stayed here. Some in previous reviews complained about the supposedly outdated decor I say c'mon. The furnishings were nice traditional, very well kept-more like something you'd see at your well-to-do great aunt's house. Sure they weren't Room and Board, but they were just fine. As for the noise, there is some but not like Times Square-this is a quiet residential area with access to lots of restaurants, grocery stores, Starbucks (2 within 1 block- we used them for WI-Fi access). A favorite eating place for all of us was Sarge's Deli at 37th and 3rd-3 blocks down 3rd (this hotel is on 39th in the middle of the block between 3rd and Lexington)-a lot like Carnegie Deli-but without the hype. Great menu and they've been there about 70 years. Grand Central Station was only 3 short blocks north-we had to take the train to New Haven one day for a day meeting-it was easy.

This is what folks told us who drove in. They told us the parking garage is couple blocks away, and about $30 bucks a night. We arrived via Taxi and had no problems. I have to close by saying if you want pure luxury, this won't fit the bill, but for a well-kept, clean safe alternative, you can't beat this place. Other guests who we saw in the hotel were well-dressed and ranged from 20 something couples to business people to families.

The kitchen was really cute in a room by itself about the size of a bathroom. So much closet space my goodness! I think we were on the 10th or 11th floor. We kept the windows open and listened to the taxis honking every morning. Enjoyed getting pizza delivered there too! Seemed like a much better room that you would get in a boutique hotel on the east side or near NYU. Interesting bakery/catering place across the street, a diner a 1/2 block away, and a couple of Italian restaurants and a small convenience store within 1 block. Took a cab to Zabars which has Feline's Basement across the street and a bagel shop in the same block.", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, clean & quiet\u201d", "Author": "Sneggie", "ReviewID": "UR4316669", "Content": "I've stayed at Murray Hill twice in the past year.

Even though they were very busy, we did not experience any problems. Check-in/check-out only took about 5 minutes and they gave us an extended check-out due to our later flight departure. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The housekeeping staff was polite and unobtrusive. Having a kitchen helped us save money by reheating leftovers. Daniels Bagels is only a couple blocks away and Patsy's Pizzaria is a bit of a walk but well worth it. We tend to use hotels merely as sleeping quarters as we like to explore, but this place was so comfortable we spent a couple evenings inside reading, planning our next day, etc. We're pretty low maintenance and don't require a lot of help so didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff, but when we did, they were courteous. The only negative I can think of is that our 8th floor apartment was above a doggie day care which had a play area on the roof.

Also, our room had a leaking sink that went all over the bathroom floor. The best was definitely the absolute lack of soundproofing; we all woke up in a panic one night thinking someone was getting killed down the hallway when, in reality, it was just someone laughing.

Much better than the place I have been staying in previously, which I will not name but which I will never go back to again now that I have found the Murray Hill!! We had a one bedroom suite - huge, this place obviously used to be an apartment building and I sure wouldn't mind living in an apartment like this! I love the bathroom (it's bigger than the one in my home)and has nifty art deco lights. The bathroom was white and green and the green theme continued throughout the apartment. Dark green carpet and the bed linens were also in the green hue. If you are looking for shiny new modern, then this is not the place for you. BUT if you are looking for large, comfortable, CLEAN, convenient accommodations, you can't beat this place. The kitchen has a dishwasher, some very basic pots and pans (not new but clean and they did the job). No toaster or microwave. The coffee pot is small and since we were there for a week and my husband drinks a lot of coffee we bought a larger coffee pot and 2 large mugs. No big deal to us. We had brought our own coffee and coffee pot filters. We never had any reason to call the front desk for anything and checking in and out was a breeze. The doormen were all charming, the housekeeping staff pleasant.

Finally found the Murray Hill Suites using Apartments2Book and got a suite with one big bedroom (with two double beds) and then a sleeper sofa in the living room. Price seemed good at $209. The suite was quite big by NYC standards. Galley kitchen was decent sized by NYC standards. Bathroom was a little tight. Closets galore. Two tvs (one in bedroom, one in living room). Squeaky clean. Towels on the thin side. My biggest disappointment was that the location was nothing special. We felt safe, and we could see the top of the Empire State Building from the living room window--that was very cool--but otherwise the hotel was on a nondescript street and the immediate neighborhood is not particularly vibrant or overly prosperous looking. I have stayed before in Times Square and that was much more fun. And, as we rode through the city on the bus and walked we saw other neighborhoods that were more prosperous-looking, and I was a wee bit jealous of folks staying in those neighborhoods. Will try for those neighborhoods next time. Each morning we walked two blocks to an excellent bagel place--Daniel's Bagels on 3rd avenue--and there were plenty of drug stores, grocery stores nearby. We were told about good restaurants in the neighborhood, but ate lunch and dinner in other neighborhoods where we happened to be at the time. Being in between Lexington and 3rd gave us great access to north and south buses, but a longish (about four blocks) walk to the subway -- I'm spoiled having stayed much closer to subways in the past. Good that the closest subway is Grand Central; we had no problems getting anywhere from there. Street would probably be considered quiet by NYC standards. Definitely an apartment building in a prior life. Has a real apartment building feel, not a hotel feel. Exterior is dated--1950s? The wait on check-in was painfully long with only one desk clerk on duty. We never saw more than one person at the front desk so it's probably a common problem. I was #3 in line when I walked in, but the clerk was so slow that the line grew to at least ten people while I was waiting. Had a snafu on check-in. I was given the key to 307, I unpacked, then fell asleep on the sofa as I waited for my other two travel companions to arrive. Was awoken by two Kiwi women opening my door as they had been given the same room. Called front desk and the clerk told me I was supposed to be in 208. When I said I had a key to 307 and had already unpacked, would he please put these women in 208, he relented and said he would \"fix\" it in the computer. However, when my traveling companions arrived, they were given a key to 208 and they walked in on the Kiwi folks. The Kiwis figured it out, told them to try 307, and again the front desk said he would fix it in the computer. When we checked out the clerk gave us the bill for #208. Not a huge deal, but I didn't understand why the mix-up was so difficult to cure.

There were tons of closets, and a small to average-sized bathroom. The room's decor was a bit outdated, but very clean and neat. The hotel seems more like a small apartment building than a hotel.

The hotel itself has no restaurant or bar, and that is a negative for some, but it didn't faze us in the least.
