It\u2019s a nice updated hotel near the highway, very close to the stadium. It\u2019s 15 minutes away from the zoo and downtown. Parking lot is sufficient and there is also a garage parking. The hotel was full during our stay, so the garage was full but there are parking spaces in the lot. Not issue with parking when we arrived around mid night. Next to the hotel is a small plaza with restaurants and Jack In the Box. The Thai restaurant in the plaza was very good. Across the road is another shopping plaza with more fast food, a super market, and gas stations. We are priority club members and the front desk staffs knowledge that. They gave us cookies and a cold bottle water upon check in. Front desk staffs were very friendly and professional. The best staffs we\u2019ve seen amount hotels. A+ for them. We have a double room facing the front on the first floor. We could hear the road noise even thought it wasn\u2019t too loud. The beds are not queen size as advertised. They\u2019re double size beds so it\u2019s tight for 2 adults. The linens are nice, the towels are thick. The pillows and beds are comfortable. The sink is outside the bathroom and it works well if you have more than one person in the room. The bathroom is big with a shower over tub and toilet. It\u2019s a nice touch to have plenty of shelves around the shower/ tub to put the toiletries. We had breakfast at the hotel and they were very good, and good value. The omelets were delicious, the home fries were very tasty, and the toasts were very good, too. The service was a bit slow, so don\u2019t expect a quick breakfast.

Parking is free and easy too, rooms are as would be expected from a holiday inn - spacious, clean etc... After getting a great deal on Hotwire and then finding out the name of the hotel, I called to make sure that the three rooms we were getting we're connected to each other and two of them had king beds ( both of these requests were very important since we are traveling with a baby ). We were reassured that it will be all good.. They also set us up for an early checking (10am they said, unusual but a nice bonus we thought) We called to confirm that our rooms were ready and as we requested half an hour before we arrived (1-2pm), and all was good... When we arrived however we were informed by a very unapologetic person at the counter that 1) one of our rooms wasn't ready as they were overbooked.. ( we were fine with that at first but didn't turn out to be ready until way after official checkin time)...2) only one of our rooms had. King sized bad ( we were willing to live with that ) and 3) rooms weren't connected ( that part wasn't ok at all but on top of it she basically was telling us that there is no way we could have requested it- she was actually implying we were making it up)...There is nothing she could do she said.. Just like that.since our hotel was prepaid for all 4 nights,, we couldn't just leave so waited for a manager who finally got us two connecting rooms ( the third one was nearby, not connected- which was ok I guess, it had a view of some dirty roofs too and wasn't ready for hours.. We were happy though that the main issues were resolved eventually ( after probably at least 20 minutes at the counter with a crying baby, manager was trying to fix the issues as she felt parenting comradely.., checkin was off putting.. I asked what they can do for us to compensate for this drama and they told us we'd get a free breakfast the next day and a fridge/ microwave ( both were nice gestures, although it took 3 calls to actually get that, and the man who brought them finally, didn't have a splitter available, so microwave had to end up on the floor.. Odd Wireless was a real pain and i needed t to work-I travel a lot ( as u can see, I usually leave nice reviews :)), and wireless works fine, in this case I had to call them several times a day ( they had to reset, blamed my computer and refused to do anything once, and in general it was a pain.. Finally figured out that their nets confuguration couldn't play nicely and consistently with my works VPN, which isnt normally a problem.. Waste of time Last complain: when we went down for breakfast in the morning, we waited 15 minutes in a half empty .restaurant.( it's more of a bar size), and then waited 45 minutes for our food which was pretty good.. Wait stuff was nice to us but very neurotic as even my 2 year old noticed :).. They did yell at some couple that they had to wait until seated.. And I mean \"bark\".. Odd, we were thinking maybe erected is a convention or something in another room that they are catering... Otherwise the place is good - beds were comfortable, hot tub was nice on a rainy day ( pool wasn't heated though as their website says, but that was ok) There is food within walking distance ( a great Thai restaurant across the street, fast food, bagel shop, Starbucks). View From the 2 rooms was over the highways and hills behind it, it ws pretty nice actually.

What's not to like? I have stayed here twice and my stay last week was better than my first a few months prior. That unfortunate time I had trouble getting hot water prior to a certain time in the early morning; the staff was unresponsive but I was extremely well compensated by management upon checkout. I gave them another chance last week and I was not disappointed in the least. The check-in process was fast and welcoming, and my suite was spacious and spotless. Between my two trips I have enjoyed the fitness room, the pool and hot tub, and the drinks and hot appetizers offered at the bar. Whatever problems they previously had with hot water have now been corrected. Just off the Interstate, it was convenient to travel in any direction (assuming you have GPS guidance), within a few miles of many excellent dining choices, and a truly delightful stay in every way. Housekeeping was outstanding. This hotel is also located a fraction of a mile down the road from the San Diego Chargers facility. The last time I was here I saw several of the players at various times in the hotel, and also had a nice conversation with one of their reserve linebackers at the bar downstairs. The bottom line: With its low prices, free parking, excellent facility, and good location, this is a very good choice for a pleasant stay. TIP #1 - Join the Holiday Inn frequent guest program. It offers many advantages and awards, not the least of which is free upgrades, when available.

She was awesome! She also let us know that there was free wifi in the lobby and she gave me a cable for my laptop so I could have internet in my room.

Like the last reviewer, I was worried about this hotel, given the recent reviews. But, I was surprised and pleased with my stay. LOCATION: The hotel is closer to Kearney Mesa and Miramar MCAS. It is not close to the shopping area and the other hotels of Mission Valley. It is close to the stadium, however, if you are going to a football game there. I needed to go to the Sports Arena, Mission Bay, and the Wild Animal Park on this trip. The hotel location provided easy access to the metro San Diego freeways. SERVICE: I called ahead to confirm my reservation, asking for a king bed and a room away from the freeway. The reservation clerk was very cordial as were the front desk staffers, when I checked it. There are no bellhops, but luggage carts are available. CHECK IN TIPS: 1. There is no large Holiday Inn sign. Mapquest or Google Maps the location before you depart. It is on the northeast corner of Aero Drive and Murphy Canyon. You will see the Jack in the Box, before you see the first driveway into the Holiday Inn. But don't take the first driveway! 2. Instead go to the second or back driveway off of Murphy Canyon Road. Then, make two right turns and enter the basement garage. Park and use the elevator to go to the first floor and check at the front desk. Then grab a luggage cart and go back to your car to unload your bags. INTERNET: It is free and fast. If you need an ethernet cord, the front desk will provide one for a $5 deposit, refundable when it is returned. NEGATIVES: 1. Stains on the carpets - given the closeness of the hotel to the stadium, I was not surprised at the number of stains in the carpet. The hotel rooms have probably seen numerous football parties. 2. Outside Noise - One side of the hotel faces the freeway and the other side faces a street that access a business park. A civil aviation airport and a marine corp air station are nearby. The windows are single pane, so expect some noise. The a/c and my white noise machine masked the outside noise for me. 3. Inside Noise - Thin walls, no noise insulation, wide gaps around the door allowed noise from within the hotel to be noticeable. There was a very loud child who was five rooms away on first night!

I actually went to Target and bought Lysol to spray the room! It is in the middle of town but it is in the middle of a bunch of strip clubs. This has turned me off of Holiday Inn for good.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Near Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cLess than expected, but very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Utah8", "ReviewID": "UR7009983", "Content": "Location - We booked through Priceline and were expecting a property closer to Sea World in the hotel circle area. Oh well. The hotel is located right next to I-15 within a professional business park. You can hear the freeway from inside the rooms at the back of the hotel. This wasn't a problem for us, but it could be for some guests, especially if you want to use the little patio of the suites. It is only a few minute drive to Charger Stadium. And Sea World/Mission Bay is convenient by I-15 to I-8, but at 15-20 minutes it was a little further than we wanted. Service - the best thing about this hotel is the friendly staff. From the moment we arrived they all were very accommodating. They worked us in to adjoining rooms and every staff member greeted us in a sincere and friendly way. Restaurant - all the kids were free at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was really good and consisted of scrambled eggs, toast, french toast, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy, cold cereals, juices, milk, fruit, as well as a great omelet and waffle bar. Breakfast is served until 11:00 am, unless its not busy, then they may close it down early. But you can order the pretty much the same things from the menu. Besides the restaurant in the hotel, there is a Jack-in-the-Box burger place, a Sizzler restaurant and a Papa Johns pizza place next door. There is a grocery store and a Mexican food place a block away as well. Facilities - The lobby, lounge and restaurant were clean and pleasant. The pool area was clean, but we didn't use the facility so I can't rate the pool or hot tub. It is outside next to the street although its fairly well screened. The fitness room is very small with one each of 4 or 5 pieces of equipment including a treadmill. I chose to do my running outside on the very hilly streets. It was a pleasant place to run. There was plenty of free parking; we never had any trouble finding a spot in the covered area next to the elevator. Rooms - We started with 2 suites on opposite sides of the hotel. The suites are located on the corners of the hotel. They have a little triangular balcony off the living room. They have one bed in the bedroom and a hide-away in the living room. There are 2 TVs, a microwave and small fridge. The staff was great to move us to a suite with an adjoining room when it became available. This was perfect for our large family of eight. The beds, however, were very uncomfortable. My wife and I woke up with very sore backs every morning. General - Priceline lists this hotel as a 3 star property. When you consider that the Double Tree downtown is also rated a 3 star, it makes you wonder a bit. This hotel is not near that level of quality, but it was fine for us and our six kids. My biggest complaint is that once past the lobby area, the rooms needed some updating and better cleaning. There was mold along some of the caulk joints in the bath tub. Some of the chrome fixtures had corrosion showing through. One of the drapes was torn a bit. The sink was cracked. The doors between rooms need the hinges lubricated as they creeked loudly when moved. The door stop on the hinge was pushed through the back of the door. It wasn't so bad though because we didn't have to worry about the kids so much. Overall this hotel was less than we were expecting, but not bad. I give it a mild recommendation and wouldn't mind staying here again.", "Date": "March 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price & New Look!\u201d", "Author": "California Sun", "ReviewID": "UR6511133", "Content": "Ok, now I wish I would have written a re- view for the last 4 times we have stayed here! They were at the beginning of re-doing the hotel last I wrote about it in 2005 I think it was....and yes...it is done and it never was THAT bad to start with. Look you guy's, you can't beat the price, It is a nice hotel, you have a bar & restaurant with GREAT prices and lot's of GOOD restaurants in the area! Great parking (undercover you guy's... for no EXTRA charge) try other hotels get a better price and then see if you don't pay an additional $10-$20 a day folks!!!!!!! For parking!!!! You don't know that when booking on line for an in expensive hotel with all the frills, next to all the attractions and wanting the bang for your buck. Oh what a surprise when you get hit for parking (and it's not covered to boot) no retaurant inside with good prices or a bar. This hotel is great for the business traveler or the leisure traveler having fun. After traveling and staying in hotels all across southeren CA to L.A. for years mainly for business (days on end every week) I think I get a birds eye view of whats hot and whats not. You get first time travelers for leisure (that have this golden picture I guess of what a hotel SHOULD be for the price) they got at bottom dollar and expect a golden castle? Hotels in any large city are not going to be the jack pot, you have hundreds of people in and out of the hotels daily.. This hotel is way under rated for some of the re-views I have read here and I am horrified to read. The hotel is great, the staff is great. It is not a rat hole. I hope and pray everytime I go to priceline I get this hotel for work or pleasure.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDecent value at discounted price\u201d", "Author": "Retropia", "ReviewID": "UR6336192", "Content": "This is an older Holiday Inn that is good in some places, and a little lacking in others. Overall, it is a decent value if you can get it at a discounted price. Value - through Priceline, I was able to book this hotel for a three night stay 12/1-4/2006 at $45 a night. Including taxes and fees, it came to $158.85. I think this is a good value for a decent hotel in San Diego. At the regular price listed on the Holiday Inn website of $119 a night, I would prefer a newer, nicer property. Amenities - there is a small restaurant and bar, which I didn't try. They also have a small outdoor pool and spa which looked sparkling clean. However, I felt it was too chilly to use an outdoor pool during my stay. I'd have prefered an indoor pool in December. They also have a small fitness center. In the room, there is a coffee maker, ironing board and iron, hair dryer, two phones, plus an ethernet plug for free high-speed internet access. There were no ethernet cables in the room, but you can borrow a cable from the front desk. There is no wireless internet access in the rooms, although I was told it is available in the lobby for a fee. Mechanicals - the older Amana HVAC unit was noisy, because the plastic grill buzzed against the housing. I fixed it by partially loosening the cover. Doing that, I noticed that the foam air filter was dirty; it should be cleaned more often. The toilet sometimes required multiple flushes, which reminded me of early low-flow toilet design. There was plenty of hot water and water pressure for the shower. It had a shower-massage head that took me three days to figure out the \"normal\" setting. The shower surround and faucet looked dated, but everything worked. The sink and faucet just outside the bathroom looked new, and had a granite counter. Decor / comfort - it looked like the room had been redecorated within the last couple of years, with new furniture, carpet, bed linens, curtains and wall coverings. The bed linens and towels were nice, and each bed had four pillows. Noise - you could definitely hear hallway noise, such as people talking and doors opening and closing. It wasn't busy during my stay, so this wasn't a big issue for me. The HVAC fan helped mask noise, but it was controlled by a thermostat and thus turned on and off. This hotel is just off a freeway; I could hear a little traffic noise if I focused on it, but it didn't bother me. Security - the neighborhood seems safe and I didn't notice any problems during my stay. However, a relative works across the street and they have had some car thefts and break-ins in the past. That business has beefed up its security and now looks like Fort Knox. I'm no expert and don't want to go into specifics on a public website, but the security could be improved at this Holiday Inn. Parking - the main entry driveway is narrow and winding, as another poster mentioned. If you're driving a large motorhome or towing a trailer, I'd recommend you use the second entrance, which takes you around the back of the hotel. There is a handy lower-level covered parking lot in back, with an elevator to access the rooms. Parking is also limited around the entry, but abundant in the back. I found the individual parking spaces to be smaller than what I'm used to, which seems to be typical throughout San Diego. Staff / service - I had good interaction with the staff. The front desk staff was helpful providing driving directions, and housekeeping kept the room looking great. Every day I had fresh sheets, towels, soap and shampoo, and coffee packets. Location - it is conveniently located off of I-15 and Aero Drive. There is a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant next door along with a small strip shopping center that contains a Kinkos and a few other restaurants. If you cross to the other side of Aero Drive, you'll find a grocery store, Wal-Mart and other stores. It didn't seem particularly close to the stadium. View - I had to take a photo of the view out of my second-floor room, which provided a scenic vista of the HVAC units arrayed across an expanse of rooftop of the restaurant and lobby. I especially enjoyed the artfully placed, crushed aluminum beverage can, thoughtfully tossed out a window by a previous guest. I was amused and not bothered, as I wasn't there to look out the window, and it is fairly typical of older Holiday Inns. However, if I was paying full price, I'd ask for a room with a nicer view. In conclusion - I would stay here again at this price, and recommend it to others with the cautions noted above. If any of the negatives I mentioned are really important to you, I'd recommend staying at a newer property.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel\u201d", "Author": "bs4u2c", "ReviewID": "UR6230654", "Content": "Stayed two nights, paid $56 a night through Priceline, reg price would have been $115 a night.

You would have thought after calling ahead and them knowing we might complain if there was a problem (which I did not), that they would atleast try and get us in a nice room. No luck. The doors are old and leave a big gap below, this means you will hear serious noise from neighbors also.

No coffee was provided for day two either. There was only one bar of soap which made it difficult since the sink was in a separate area from the shower. Only one trash can for the two rooms and it was not in the bathroom. The shower did not drain properly and we ended up standing in a foot of water when we wanted to shower. The restaurant was extremely slow because they underestimated the volume of orders they would receive on New Year's Evening (the day of the CHargers game.)

I don't see where the negative reviews are coming from! I had no problems whatsoever. Check-in was a breeze, the clerk was really nice. We needed a refrigerator in the room because we had to keep milk cold for our 4-month old baby. Before we even got to our room with our bags, there was a person standing outside the door with the refrigerator, who happily brought it in, hooked it up, and got it going for us. There was barely any noise in the hotel, so we and our baby slept very soundly. At first, I thought that we must have an inside room because there was no outside noise at all, but, I looked out the window to find out that we were right on the side along the freeway! I don't know how anyone could have been bothered by this previously! Housekeeping was awesome - every day our room looked brand new. One day, we stayed in the room until 1pm with the Do Not Disturb sign up, so they slid a letter under the door saying that because of this, they wouldn't be able to service the room, but to call if we needed anything. No problem, we understood. We left thinking that we would just order some new towels when we got back - instead, it was completely cleaned once again by the time we returned! How awesome was that! I have no complaints whatsoever with this hotel; I would gladly stay there again. I'm sure traffic to the stadium is horrible on game-day, but, it's that way no matter how you get there.
