It won't blow you away with awesome amenities or fabulous decor. The owners and the staff at this hotel, however, certainly work hard to ensure that your stay is a pleasant one. We recently stayed at the Champerret Elysees while on a business trip. In fact, my husband regularly selects this hotel while in Paris for business. The hotel is steps away from the Porte de Champerret metro station, with easy connections to various points of interest within the city. I believe the hotel is under renovation. There have been changes to the wall coverings; bathrooms have been updated -- really good showers! -- and carpets have been changed. As for the breakfast, sometimes we have breakfast at the hotel; however, with bistros down the street at Place Marechal Juin (one metro stop away at Perreire), you have a few options available to you. In terms of room size, the hotel has at least three different room categories. Of course, the price differs from category to category. Also, as is common in Paris (and in France and in most of Europe), hotels that operate in older buildings tend to have a higher ratio of small rooms. An economy/standard room in North America tends to be larger than on in France. On our recent stay we had a standard room which was just large enough for a double bed and a small desk. (The desk wasn't really useful as there was about 1.5 feet between the foot of the bed and the desk.) The same is true for the bathroom. Two people could just about fit comfortably. However, the bathroom was clean and recently renovated so no complaints.

So, while it wouldn't necessarily have been my choice, I was pleasantly surprised. Previous Trip Advisor reviews dating back to July highlighted that a major refurb was taking place, and so I figured that it had to be pretty much complete by Nov (it was - minor paintwork still happening). All in all, this was a good hotel in a good location - my pros and cons are summarised below: Pros - staff; really friendly and helpful, all spoke good English. Guy at front desk helped me connect to the hotel's free wifi (just ask for your password, it's made up your room number and letters from your name.) They also let us check in for our return flights and print off our boarding passes. Desk is manned 24 hours. Breakfast; very good selection of bread, pastries, cold meat, eggs, jams, etc - it was included in our rate, but if it hadn't been, we prob would have gone out. Tea / coffee was from a machine and the coffee was poor. Location; 1 minute walk from Porte de Champerret metro, 3 mins from Pereire metro. Nice, upmarket, classic French neighbourhood. Lots of great cafes and bistros nearby with very few tourists around. We found it better to do the sightseeing in the centre and come back to eat dinner near the hotel. The hotel may recommend Bistrot du 17e just beyond Place Marechal Juin, and it was fine, but you can prob find better value nearby (fixed price, 3 courses w/wine and coffee was 42 euros per head). Cleanliness / comfort; room was clean, as was bathroom, dining room and other common areas. Bed comfy, linen new and good quality. New tiles / fittings in bathroom. Cons - Toilet: this wasn't actually IN the bathroom! It was in a separate 'cupboard' (very small and tight for space) with no wash hand basin. Kind of odd - think if I'd been staying more than 2 nights we would have asked if another room with full bath was available. Long trip in from airport: while the hotel is pretty well connected, getting there from CDG was a bit of a schlep. You come into Gare du Nord, then it's an RER train, then metro line 3. Do your research on the connections first (there's lots of different levels / lines) and if at all possible buy your tix in advance because you really do want to look like you know where you're going.

Its location is quite convenient just a few steps from the metro (ligne ponte de Levallois) metro station Porte de Champerret. You can walk to to the Arc de Triomphe and its about a 20 minutes walk. First of all the area around the hotel is very nice, very classy, typical parisian area. The bus stops also just outside the hotel and you can catch it to go to the centre. Unfortunately we didn't take it so I cant give you some advise. To get to the hotel from the airport is a little bit complicated and if you travel with a lot of bags very uncomfortable. It takes around 1 hour and a half to get you to the hotel...The hotel is also not quite in the centre of Paris but with the metro it takes you just twenty minutes less, or more to the centre. Second of all the hotel is very clean, the rooms are small enough but efficient. We would appreciate a small refrigerator in the room and also maybe a chance to get your coffee or tea in the room would be much appreciated. We didn't get breakfast at the hotel, I think its overated. We did get our breakfast in the two small cafe next to the hotel, typical parisien with a lot of Paris citizents inside with just 7 euro per person, and it was just ok to start your day. We had once take a taxi as we heard that it was very expensive but it wasn't. We took it from Tour Eiffel 15 arrondisement to the hotel with just 13 euros. Paris is a very expensive city, as we all know. Cafe o lait in a cafe in Champs Elysees with 8 euros!!! A tip for the hotel, if you want a view and also quiet try to book one in the opposite road. It's just perfect... A tip for Tour Eiffel and Louvro museum, try to book your ticket online and not waist hours and hours waiting to get in. And not forget to take a trip to the river with a bateaux mousse... Also try some classique french cuisine, its magnifique!!!

When we got there, we were forced to buy two rooms, one for us and one for our children, doubling the cost of the trip. I suppose it's not fair to compare hotels in Paris to hotels in the US, but I felt it was very pricey for a room with less amenities than a motel 6. My parents were with us and given a room on a floor under construction that reeked of paint and new carpet and was downright dangerous to get to (construction supplies all over the place).

April was a good month to travel, not only was the weather good, we also got good bargains everywhere. Rooms - The rooms are just perfect for a couple, clean & well done. One of the best showers. The staff at the reception is very warm and welcoming, make you feel at home. Luggage Room - Since we were travelling to Amsterdam and Brussels for 5 days we decided to keep one of our strollers behind at the hotel which they gladly kept. Thanks for the same as it made our life easier. Location - The hotel is about 3 minutes walking distance from the Pereire Metro station and 5 minutes from the Pereire Levallois RER station (which is an added advantage). Between the two stations you can choose any one depending on where you plan to go. Local Travel - In Paris the only way to go around is by Metro which is very easy to understand. We did not buy any travel passes. We used to buy a set of 10 tickets, called carnet (works out cheaper instead of buying a single ticket and saves time), just punch as you go, very easy. If you plan to go to Versailles and Disney buy the open tickets along with the carnet, to save time. Neighbourhood - There are plenty of restaurants at 2-3 minutes walking distance to suit all budgets and tastes. The hotel is in a very safe neighbourhood and we were comfortable walking up to the hotel even at late hours from the metro station. Nightlife-Paris has a great nightlife especially on weekends (moreover most city hotels are cheaper on weekends) so ensure that you have a weekend included in your stay. Disney - Register yourself at Disney Paris website a few weeks before you travel, they will mail you discount offers, avail the offer and book the tickets in advance to avoid long queues at the entrance. Personally I would avoid wasting a day at Disney, far too crowded and we could hardly do 2-3 rides, inspite of our choosing a weekday. Eiffel Tower - Go right upto The Summit (top most level) as you are going to do it once in lifetime. The best time to go is at sunset, check on the net at what time the sun will set in Paris during your week of travel, and reserve the slot accordingly. We were glad that we had booked our tickets online weeks in advance as there was a separate entry (can say VIP entry). People were standing in queue for 2 hours to buy the tickets and moreover tickets to The Summit were suspended as there was congestion at The Summit. Seine River Cruise - Best to do after dark so that you can see the monuments lit up specially sparking Eiffel. Book your tickets in advance to save time as there can be long queues.

The breakfast was a perfectly adequate continental one. What makes this hotel stand out though I guess is it's location. We used the Metro and walked to a lot of the attractions. The only thing that disappointed us was the quality of the food in the local restaurants. This is Paris?? Thought French food was supposed to be top notch? It was terribly expensive, we weren't getting much change from \u00a3100 for a very average meal, (seemed everything was with chips) and bottle of average wine. The best meal we had was in the Thai Restaurant just up the road from the Hotel. Pricey again, but at least we enjoyed it!

It was 15 minutes walk from Arc de Triomphe and the top of Champs Elysee and using the Metro we could get to any of the main tourist spots within about 20 minutes. There are a few nice bars & restaurants close to the hotel but the chances are that, like us, you would only go to them on the way to or from the hotel. The area is reasonably upmarket and pleasant but there is nothing there to make it a destination in itself. From the moment we arrived the staff were very helpful and spoke good English. We had forgetten to bring a travel plug and they lent us one without charge - little things like this can mean a lot. The room was not huge but big enough, with plenty of storage for a short break and all very clean. The separate toilet & bathroom were modern and the shower was an excellent multi-directional thing. The safe in the room was useful and nice not to be charged extra for it. It is a shame there were no tea & coffee making facilities in the room though - especially as they are expensive in the bar and it is made clear that food & drink are not to be taken to the rooms. Also the walls were a bit thin - we could hear next door's TV and were kept awake one night by a group of shrieking girlies two doors down. The bed felt like a cheap springy mattress which was OK for me but my partner found it uncomfortable. Likewise the pillows were of the soft & puffy but ultimately thin type. Breakfast was OK. If I had wanted a fry up I would have been out of luck but there was a reasonable choice of ham / cheese, croissants, toast (including brioche), yoghurt, cereals, fruit salad. Not 5 star but enough there to fill up on before heading out. The bar area was quite pleasant & comfortable. Drinks were expensive, although no more so than in the surrounding bars & restaurants.

Hotel: First impressions were excellent.. the reception area is very classy & clean & the guy on the desk was very welcoming. The whole hotel was spotless. Breakfast was what i would expect, beautiful croissants & a beautiful room downstairs, attended to by friendly, uniformed breakfast staff. Room: We were on the 2nd floor (no.210) & the room was surprisingly big compared to what we thought it would be. I later noticed that it was a 'superior' room & i think that may have been down to the fact that i specifically asked for a room with a bath & the fact that the hotel wasn't too busy. Although the area around the bed was ample, the bathroom was tiny & the toilet was separate. Flatscreen TV only showed a couple English speaking channels (Sky News & BBC World). In terms of sleeping, you couldn't hear a pin drop & the temperature & comfort was perfect. Location: Perfect location. Not in the center where its dirty & noisy but perfectly situated up in the North West, 30 seconds away from the Metro station, Porte De Champerret. The area is just lovely, with a nice atmosphere & full of amazing restaurants. The Arc De Triomphe is literally 15 mins walk away. In all, i'm usually very articulate & picky about all aspects of a holiday & i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.. especially couples. Recommendations: - The Metro system is a simple, convenient, cheap way to get around. Print a Metro map from the net. In terms of getting to & from the hotel, If you're traveling via Eurostar, buy a one-way single each time (\u20ac1.60) instead of a day pass (\u20ac5.80). - The prices generally are ridiculous i.e \u20ac3.50 for a can of coke \u20ac7 for a baguette so be wise & take advantage of any Supermarkets you see around. - Going up the Eiffel tower is a lot cheaper if you walk rather than get the lift (\u20ac3.50).

As we walked out of the station then hotel was about a 20 meter walk away. When we arrived, the hotel lobby looked very appealing and the reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful. (Please do not believe all you read or hear about Parisians) - we found everyone wonderful, in fact it was the ignorant English speaking tourists that expected the French to communicate in our language and not the other way around. We don't speak fluent French, but we made sure we tried our hardest to attempt as much of their language as we could. I think the Parisians really appreciate you trying. Please do take time to look at the video trailer for this hotel as it is exactly as you see it. The hotel should be listed higher than a 3 star as the place was clean and relatively modern. The lounge area was nice and the restaurant was great, we had inclusive buffet style breakfast with enough coffee, juice, croissants, rolls, cheese and ham, cup cakes and fruit salad to fill yourself up before you embark on the wonderful sight seeing. What can I say.... The weather was beautiful and the sights even more so. We absolutely loved Paris, from the Arc de Triumph just up the road to the late night sightseeing cruise with Bateux Parisiens (http://www.bateauxparisiens.com/EN/boats-cruises-paris-seine-uk.html). \u20ac11 euros for an hour. You start the tour from the Eiffel Tower, go under Alexandre III bridge and on to view the Old Train station which is now a museum, then past the Louvre on to Notre Damne before the boat circles around an island a doubles back. We did the cruise in the day first but on our last night we decided to go back to experience it at nightime. We left the dock at 11pm and the Eiffel Tower sparkles like a huge christmas tree, its spectacular. It only happens on the hour and we were fortunate to see it go off twice, once again when we returned at Midnight. Another great place to go and see is Basilique Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montmartre. Its a wonderful Catholique church right at the very top of this hill and the views across Paris are amazing. There is a little square past the church that has a number of shops and restaurants that serve lovely food and alot cheaper than in the centre of Paris.

This hotel is ideally located near the Metro and within walking distance of bars and restaurants as well as attractions. I'd not been to Paris for 30 years and was shocked at the cost of living. This is a very expensive city. Tracking down a reasonably priced cup of Americano coffee was immensely difficult - most bars/cafes sold them around 5 euros! Eating out too is astronomical, I'd read in a guide book that it's more economical to eat lunch and many places did offer deals, although some tried to rip us off! As for the hotel itself, yes, the place is spotless and staff friendly but ignore their totally misleading website. On it, beds are described as queensize but I'd say they're more like a small double, very cramped and we also found the sheets and bedding really make you sweat. I didn't sleep at all well over the 3 nights we stayed. The rooms too are tiny, although the hotel's website makes them look big. We had the smallest wardrobe in the world. There is also no bath and no cooked breakfast as described on the website - that to me was a big disappointment. We loved the modern shower though, with its body jets and constant hot water and the view from the top floor was great for people-watching . Walls are paper thin and after a noisy night awoken by the people upstairs, we swapped our original 3rd floor room to one on the top floor which was far better. The swap was arranged by the staff without fuss.

We'd booked the hotel as part of a package that included Eurostar travel. We'd emailed the hotel in advance asking for a quiet room. Upon arrival we were allocated a room on the top floor. It was listed as a 'superior' room, but it was difficult to see why. The room was a pretty good size for Paris, and there was a flat screen TV, but the decor was a little tired - it really was nothing special. The bathroom was clean, but unlike previous reviewers' experiences, it had not been newly renovated and there was no multi-jet shower - although the shower was hot and powerful, the shower hose did not attach to the wall, which was rather inconvienient. Our room faced the back of the hotel, so we had no view, and outside our window there was a large and noisy generator, so not exactly the quiet room that we had requested. A room facing onto a side street would have been more peaceful and much more pleasant. We visited in August and it was very hot - expecting this, we had paid extra for a hotel with air conditioning. However, it soon became apparent that it was just recirculating air rather than cooling it. The room became very hot overnight - our thermometer said 30 degrees. We could not open the window because of the noisy generator outside - ironic that it was probably an air con unit so at least some people were getting cooled air! We asked the receptionist about it the next day and were told that we needed to set the temperature at no less than 19 degrees - bit illogical. But doing so made no difference. It turned out that the air con unit needed to be reset. This was not done until our third day - I have no idea why the receptionist could not have arranged for this to be done as soon as we mentioned it as apparently it was a simple job. So we had a few hours of blissful coolness on day 3 before the unit packed in again overnight, despite us following the instructions. So, three unbearably hot nights did not endear us to Champerret Elysees. On the plus side, the breakfast was pretty decent if you can get it as part of a deal - wouldn't have paid the 13 Euros they otherwise charge. The food didn't run out at all, as mentioned in previous reviews. The location was also good - although a little out of the centre, it was very close to the metro station and there were some nice cafes, restaurants and shops nearby. We didn't let our experience at the hotel put us off Paris - in fact we probably spent longer in the Louvre admiring the paintings because it was so much cooler than in our hotel - standing on an air vent was pure bliss!! The best part of the trip was actually the journey, as we had managed to get a deal with a free upgrade to Leisure Select on Eurostar - I'd highly recommend this; great (complimentary) food and they were also generous with the free wine and champers!!", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cA Little Gem\u201d", "Author": "Chorizogolf", "ReviewID": "UR21009705", "Content": "Other Tripadvisor members are absolutely right.

However, and to our plesent surpirse when we were greeted by the man at reception, who had excellent english in comparison to our french, he informed us that the smoking room which I had booked was not ready, but there was a non-smoking room which was available straight away, so we were happy to take that, as my partner had given up smoking since I had booked! The hotel is the normal small but quaint parisienne hotel that you might expect, but had obviously just been recently renovated. The rooms are small but prefect for 2, especially if your heading out to do the tourist thing. Spotlessly clean, and nice and warm at night and with an LCD tv and hairdryer.

Overall very pleased and would certainly reccomend/return.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThis place was fantastic!!!\u201d", "Author": "StoneSaver", "ReviewID": "UR12469917", "Content": "This place is wonderful! We booked a budget room and crossed our fingers. After reading several bad reviews on other hotels and hostels on TripAdvisor, I decided to trust the reviews on this place as they were all good. I was looking for a place that was near a Metro station, had a lift, was clean, affordable, and had good reviews; I found all that and more at Champerret Elysees. The Metro station is about a block away, the neighborhood is clean, quiet, and lovely, and all the places we ate nearby were delicious and affordable. The hotel is very nice with a clean, elegant lobby and very friendly and helpful staff. They let us check in 2 hours early since our room was ready which made us quite happy. As I've said, the room was clean and a good size by European standards. The shower was ample with plenty of hot water and the bathroom had clean linens which were changed daily. There was a flat screen television which made viewing the movies-on-demand very nice. The mattress was good and firm. Our window had a flower box with REAL flowers and a view onto the street that was absolutely charming. We stayed in 302 which was a budget room with a double bed. There is no doubt that I will return to this hotel again and again and again! If you can, try the restaurant across the street from the hotel. The food was delicious, the wine very good, and the prices affordable. We hope you enjoy it all as much as we did!!", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cowra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "MrStump", "ReviewID": "UR11562941", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here 5 nights during our first visit to Paris. While we really only used to room to sleep in, we couldn't fault it. The staff were friendly despite us not speaking any French. The hotel is in walking distance from where the bus from Beauvais airport ends (we flew with Ryanair). There is an underground metro railway line almost outside the hotel; Roys Cafe across the street is highly recommended - we ate there most nights. A three course meal with wine costs about 35 euros each; and even an excellent McDonalds close by - we can recommend their breakfasts. The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable. On our next visit we will probably stay somewhere different but that is no reflection on the hotel. Other recommendations are the metro; a two-day hop-on-hop-off bus ticket; a cruise on the Seine and of course the Eiffel Tower.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northen ireland", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "ardmacha", "ReviewID": "UR10087398", "Content": "we stayed 4 nites in hotel the room was small but we were only in it to sleep very clean and well run staff friendly,breakfast was 15 euro each good if you like bread chesse and ham etc .arch was only ten min away, found a nice place were we enjoyed eating to the right of hotel on a roundabout , le royal pereire. loved their chicken and apple tart and coffee for 14 euro. went to the boat trip on metro just beside hotel, that was fun as no help at station so go single 1.50e each and back single but remember to watch stops cause we got bit lost , but had good day out and some shopping along the way part of the fun we went to prix de arc de triomphe on the sunday (horse racing) at longchamp fantastic place got a cab for 13 euros as could not find free bus but came back on free bus ten min walk back to hotel so good day out , would go back to hotel and bring some friends next time.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

Great rooms, service, and location. Our stay was only 2 nights, but it was wonderful. The rooms were nicely furnished, a very large comfortable bed, a desk, 2 nightstands, and a great flat screen tv which you should be too tired to watch from all of your traveling. Other great features of the room were the shower and the air conditioning which were both exceptional. Also, the size of the room was very spacious, a lot larger than our room in London. We had a room facing the street, noise was definitely not a problem, and the view was nice. The location is great, about 1 minute away from the metro station( Porte de Champerret), and about a 15 minute walk to the Champs Elysees. While we expected the staff to be a little better with English than they actually were, they were still very very helpful and friendly. Another great service that the hotel offers is a luggage storage room, which allowed us to store our bags in between the time of check out and our train departure. This was great because we were able to have that day without the burden of our bags. The hotel also has a full service bar and food, which we were to busy to try or even take a picture of . But their pictures don't lie, everything looks exactly as they show it in their advertisements. One more thing, there is a great little street bakery right next to the metro station, we never got the name, but when you come out, it is to the left and it is to die for. The hotel was a little over a budget travel price, but search around and find a great deal, because it definitely doesn't look or feel like a budget hotel. Champerret Elysees was an amazing pick for a hotel in Paris, it made our experience that much more enjoyable.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place\u201d", "Author": "JamieLemon", "ReviewID": "UR7724337", "Content": "Rooms are great, a lovely size and clean and tidy.
