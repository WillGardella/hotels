They provide complimentary bus transportation to the Walt Disney World theme parks. At the time we visited, the buses were departing the hotel once an hour and picking up at the theme parks about every two hours. We rented a car from Hertz at the airport and returned it to the hotel. The exterior hotel grounds did not contain signs to Hertz or Rental Car Return and returning the car after hours can be a bit confusing. If you return your car to the hotel Hertz location, you would leave the car and keys with the valet located at the front entrance of the hotel. We stayed in a newly refurbished room in the Everglades wing on the third floor facing the atrium. The room was exceptionally nice and if you love the sound of water falling, you'll love leaving the french doors open at night and falling asleep. I did not have the opportunity to eat in the restaurants on the property but heard from many people (including the locals) that the Old Hickory Steakhouse is quite an experience with excellent steak and fantastic service. The menu is $$$. The room rate included the fitness center which was well appointed. They had everything from treadmills, elliptical machines and stair steppers to a row machine, weights, balance balls, kettle balls and resistance bands. I also had a need to utilize their on-site laundry facility that contains 2 apartment style washers and dryers. It costs $5 to wash and dry ($2.50/each) and requires the use of tokens or quarters. They also have a vending machine with laundry detergent and dryer sheets for $1/each. Note: One dry cycle did not result in completely dry clothes.

There are baby alligators over by the gym - follow the paths to check them out - especially if you are with kids. 3. The gym gets BUSY very early in the morning.

We budgeted all of these extras in our vacation. We also rented a car so we could drive to the parks on our own and we did not eat at any of the restaurants so I cant comment on that. The Gaylord Palms recently opened a water park for the children (and adults) and it is completely awesome!! They are four slides and a bucket that dumps gallons of water on everyone (there is a warning bell so if you dont want to get wet you can run away!) I went through the water house and also did all of the slides and felt it was totally safe for my children. I saw no children slipping and falling (not to say that its impossible) but who ever built this took the time to take all of this into consideration. They have staff throughout the waterpark and even at the bottom of the water slides. The childrens pool goes no deeper then 3 feet 9 inches and there is also zero entry. They had plenty of pool toys and there were plenty of pool chairs, umbrellas and plenty of towels. The hotel has put families as a priority in their upgrading and I think this is wonderful. There is also an adult pool for people 18+ and they also seemed very happy. We also saw trucks coming in with plants that were ready to be planted. So many upgrades going on and the rooms also have been done over. Our rooms were cleaned every morning and every staff member we passed by always said 'good morning' or 'have a nice day'. They also have a representative talking about the alligators that live at the resort and he was also educating the crowd which was fascinating to the children and adults!!

I went back to the hostess stand to ask her if we could just get a table because there appeared to be plenty of waitstaff helping diners and perhaps we would have better luck geting a drink that way but alas the few empty tables that were there were apparently being held for reservations and we were just plain out of luck.

The hotel staff were very pleasant and the resort is so clean everywhere you go. The spa is a treat, the rain forest like atrium is an illusion of being outdoors although you are still inside and the outdoor lap pool and and two spa tubs are refreshing when you crave naturual sunlight.

I will summarize the good and the bad with additional comments. Room on 6th floor in St. Augustine area. Newly remodeled, very clean, very comfortable bed and furniture. Balcony was a plus, with 2 chairs. Modern and fresh. In room amenities include lots of towels, coffee, 2 waters per day, wired and wireless Internet, shampoo/conditioner/lotion, and hair dryer. Ask for a room in this remodeled area, as everything is spotless. Several gift shops with snacks and beverages. Newly opened sports bar called Wreckers with good food and service. The Sunset Sam's ship restaurant was average; very pricey compared to quality of the food. Drinks and service were good. Old Hickory steak house was fantastic. Great service and food. Nice evening ambiance. The Mediterranean restaurant in the middle was the hub for breakfast with a decent buffet. Again, good service. I ordered room service twice (Reuben w/fries, then breakfast) and both times it was hot and good. The conference facilities were outstanding. There are no bellboys attempting to help with luggage, which was odd. I could have asked but decided to just handle by three bags as best as possible. People dragging bags all over the large property was again strange. The resort is expensive, but with that you get the benefits of mostly well-mannered people and respectful behaviors from kids and adults alike. The grounds are immaculate and the lush gardens and waterfalls are amazing. Having the balcony doors open at night was lovely to hear the water and smell the flowers. Door slamming was a problem. Not a lot of lunch options, unless you order room service or head to the sports bar. I did discover the coffee cafe had sandwiches and fruit; may I suggest advertising this around the resort to help people find a bite to eat. Used the business center twice. Very convenient, but also expensive for printing and Internet usage. Plenty of cabs and towncars ready to take you anywhere. We went to Celebration and dined at Antonio's. It was very good but be sure to make reservations.

Our first problem was we were quoted a group rate of $269 night and charged $300+ a night but finally on the third go around got it adjusted. The $269 is a pretty steep rate considering nearby hotels are charging $129 (Hilton) per night. As my husband had a display booth, it would easiest for us to stay on site and we figured it would be a more adult experience. The rooms are so noisy! We could hear the couple next door doing the \"nasty\". We got a good laugh the first time but it got old in the middle of the night - when we both were awakened. The door slamming never stopped!!!!!! When I mentioned it to staff, there comment was people complain of that all the time - really! fix it! Please put some mechanism on the doors to ease the doors closed. The children running up and down the halls, screaming off of the balconies, hitting the walls and yelling at all hours of the days and nights. I know they are on vacation but I do not want to hear their noise. I am here for work. Consider grouping rooms by adults only sections or floors. Room rates - here's the interesting part. We got the special group rate and then a friend of ours just drove up with no reservation and got a room for two nights at the rate of $207 per night. I guess the only thing \"special\" about our group rate is they saw us coming!!!! Do not plan on drinking anything here the beer was $7 each and the wine was $8 per small glass of house red or white. My husband and his friend drink Yuengling and the Key West were out of it from Sunday night until Tuesday - they \"had trouble getting it from their supplier\". Really??? I would be getting a new restuarant supply person. You should never be out of an item when it appears on your menu. If you are going to charge me a fortune - have what I want. On a good point the Shrimp salad was excellent but you might want to add a fish sandwich and some lunch choices that are seafood but not fried. I am pretty sleep deprived and ready to go home.

I have a hard time grasping how a hotel can charge you $16/night to park your car in it. Should I just parachute out of a plane to get there instead next time?! Room: The room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was huge and although two sinks would have been nice, we made it work. There was no balcony on the room and I could never imagine paying $600 to stay in it. Service: This was deffinitly the best part of the resort. All the employees were very nice and always willing to help or even just talk about whatever. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we had nothing bad to say about any employee. Food: The food was good but the prices of the food were outrageous! We booked the resort because it had multiple restaurants and so that we did not have to travel anywhere. The first night we ate on the \"boat\" which was pretty neat but the prices for a casual dinner were just too much. A rum and coke was $11.75! My girlfriend had a glass of wine for $10. You could have bought a bottle of the wine she drank for 10 bucks! The second night we went to celebration and had a lot bigger meal and more drinks for way cheaper! Pool: Unfortunetly we were a couple weeks to early as the new kids pool area is still under construction and should be completed soon. This meant that the pool we were at was full of out of control kids with parents that of course have no respect for other people.

Overall, this is a nice venue but very expensive, and they need to get on top o their housekeeping staff.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cFake Florida\u201d", "Author": "Nittany&Fargo", "ReviewID": "UR126491017", "Content": "I'll start off by saying that I am not a fan of the whole Gaylord concept - huge facilities with enormous atriums and faux attractions mimicking the local tourist attractions. Having said that, this is a beautiful hotel and I can see why it attracts the convention crowd, as the conference facilities are very nice. I also think that added \"resort fees\" are ridiculous, in this case, $16.95/day to cover the cost of the fitness center, newspaper, bottled water. I know why hotels do it (to show a lower base price on search engines), but for heavens sake, if the price is not \"optional\", include it in your base price. This is another reason why I will never stay in a Gaylord if I am spending my own money. The self service parking is a haul to the front lobby. Since I had material for the trade show, I opted to use the valet parking at $20.00/night (plus tax). There is also a charge for self parking. This does seem silly when there is ample space for parking. When I called for my car to be brought up from valet parking, it was done within 10 minutes. I stayed there for two nights for a conference. The front desk was very accommodating providing me with an early checkin at 1:00 p.m. Because of the conference rate, I received a run-of-the house room, which in this case was a two queen bed room in the St. Augustine wing. One thing about check-in - I asked the clerk about the hours of the fitness center. She said that it opened at 6:00 a.m. Because our conference started at 7:30, this meant I would get almost no workout in the morning. I found out the next morning that the fitness center actually opens at 5:00 a.m. The front desk staff really should know this type of information. The clerk said she was \"upgrading\" me to an atrium view room. Perhaps this is an upgrade because you have the world's smallest balcony overlooking the fake scenery. What you also get is very loud noise at night that reverberates from people talking or laughing in the atrium public spaces. The two queen beds meant that there was no space for a side chair or couch. The only chair available was the desk chair. The room itself was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated otherwise. The desk area was huge and provided plenty of outlets and space for paperwork and computer. The bathroom had a separate area for the double sink and then the commode/shower. I do love the Gaylord moisturizer that they provide. The pool area is, indeed, under construction and they start early (before 8:00). While the noise makes it almost impossible to relax, The pool itself is very large (I don't know where the previous poster got the 45 persons as a bathing load figure, but that is not correct). It was a great place to swim laps in the morning (the pool opens at 7:00). The two jacuzzis had a terrific design I'd never seen before - they were both shaped like barbells, so that even if you were on one side of the jacuzzi, another couple could easily relax on the other side and still have a bit of privacy (as opposed to everyone sitting in a round jacuzzi and staring at each other). The fitness room was very nice and is located in the basement near the great lawn. There were five ellipticals, at least a half dozen bikes, rowing machines, numerous treadmills, and all sorts of weight equipment, all in good condition. There were plenty of towels and sanitizing wipes. I like Life Fitness equipment, and enjoyed using the bikes. I heard one person describe the dining as \"paying too much for what you get.\" I thought at first that might be sour grapes, but that phrase sums it up precisely. I ate dinner one night at the Sports Bar, Wreckers. It is truly an impressive space, taking up two floors with plenty of TVs and large screen TVs. I ordered a mojito, which had probably two ounces total of liquid once all of the ice was dumped in. I understand that resort food is never cheap, but usually it is good food. I ordered a wedge salad, and a $15 cheeseburger with fries. The wedge salad came with absolutely tasteless tomato slices. Either serve food with taste, or leave it off the plate. The cheeseburger (with Havarti) was OK, more rare than the medium I ordered. The french fries were served in cute basket to resemble a deep fryer basket. They were, unfortunately, cool and hard. The absolute best thing I ate at the resort was the ham, cheese, and egg croissant from Java Coast. It was delicious and resonably priced at less than $7.00. Checkout was confusing. I received an itemized statement on my last day, but it did not clearly state whether or not I could just leave without going through the check-out process using the TV, front desk, or kiosks. I decided to play it safe, and use one of the two kiosks. One of the kiosks was broke. The other one worked, but I think you can just leave without using the kiosk if you receive your bill. I don't know. It still was not clear even after using the kiosk. All in all, the staff sure do seem to try very hard. I did not encounter anyone who was not pleasant. As a side note, the fake Mallory Square was a complete disappointment. If you're going to call something Mallory Square, have jugglers and musicians at sunset. The imitation \"southernmost point\" barrell from Key West just seemed pathetic sitting next to a fake boat in a fake lagoon. I can't really give this hotel a bad rating, as the rooms are clean and the service is good.

The worst thing for me was the water - the hotel had that sulfurous Florida water, and served that tap water with dinner. A small bottled water was $3.50 in the restaurant; but good water was included with the buffet. The rack rates are so high, I can't imagine who would pay them. We got a deal so it was worth it.

After a few minutes, Jessica told me that she had \"upgraded\" me to a suite and gave me my key. The room: The room was located on the main level just down the hall to the right of the reception area. When I opened the door...wow. What a massive room. I had a living area with a couch and two chairs, a circular table for dining for four, a small mini kitchen, flat screen mounted on the wall, and a separate desk area for business / laptop work. Then and area with two double doors that led to the bedroom with the king sized bed. The bathroom was huge with a door leading to the bedroom and another door leading to the living area. This room would have been perfect for four people. Not 5 minutes in the room, my phone rings and it's Jessica from the front desk checking in on me to ensure everything is satisfactory...now that is SERVICE! WIFI There is free WIFI in the rooms. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Any hotel that charges for this service should shut its doors and be ashamed of themselves. It should always be the norm that WIFI is included in ANY hotel stay in this day and age. However, WIFI is NOT free down in the conference areas. There is a charge for this and I'm unaware of that charge. Amenities: I should basically just list the things this place doesn't have!! There is a huge pool area, several restaurants, to include a sports pub that I've reviewed separately, steak house, seafood restaurant, replica fort, two separate lagoons, one with alligators, one with indigenous fish from Florida, shops, coffee shops, a Sushi restaurant, complimentary coffee, by the reception area, massive conference facilities, you name it. Conference Area: We used a small conference area that faced out to the pool area. I will say that there is construction going on in the pool area as a massive water park is being built. It was a bit of distraction at first, but after a while, it was just background noise. I imagine the convention facilities are massive, but I didn't not go. Summary: I was very impressed with the Gaylord Palms and would DEFINITELY recommend it to friends, family, and colleagues. It is a self-contained city that definitely caters to the business traveler as well as families with kids. I think they are doing a great job of catering to families where one parent may be attending a conference and the rest of the family comes along and enjoys the property.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery interesting place, clean suite would recommend\u201d", "Author": "Edenfamily88", "ReviewID": "UR125565105", "Content": "We stayed here for one night, we had a king suite with a queen pullout.

We were not disappointed after walking in. I had used their spa previously, but not stayed there (spa is lovely). The atriums are remarkable and the resort doesn't ignore a square inch of their property. There are beautiful tropical plants, water features and comfy seating areas around every bend. It reminded me a lot of the nicer Las Vegas hotels, but with a lighter feel. I am still a child at heart, so I was very excited to see the alligators, turtles, snakes and fish, which all looked happy and healthy, with beautiful enclosures. We stayed in the Everglades portion of the resort, which was quiet and inviting. I loved the way that they distinguished the differet regions of Florida within the atriums. The only complaint I have it that their linens are not up to par. The towels were a bit like drying off with a saltine cracker and the pillows were pretty much useless, as they collapsed the second you layed on them. Otherwise, the rooms were beautifully appointed and comfortable, with bright, sunny colors and modern lines. We also had breakfast at Villa de Flora. It is a buffet style restaurant located fairly centrally in the resort. It is open air, with our table overlooking the Key West atrium area and the sailboat. The staff was friendly and the tables were cozy and comfortable. The food was excellent and there was a large spread of food that should be able to accomodate anyone's breakfast cravings. The omelets were delicious and the waffles and french toast tasted home-made or better. They also provide a lot of topping bar type areas, including oatmeal, yogurt and bagels. My mom loved the bagels that she could top with lox and capers and anything else you could want.

It meanders forever through streets, tunnels, vegetation, man-made streams, gator ponds, and even a lake with a sailing vessel in the middle. The entire hotel and lobby is covered by a glass atrium. The room was large with all the comforts of a suite. Check-in and out were the best I have ever experiences anywhere. The hotel staff was courteous and responsive to your every need. The food we experienced was fantastic....even something as simple as the scrambled eggs served at breakfast were the best I've ever eaten! Sunset Sams and Villa de Flora were two restaurants where I had lunch and breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast buffet at Villa de Flora was for lack of a better word...amazing! The Carribean Nachos I has at Sunset Sams for lunch the first day were to die for...and probably would feed 3 people. What a great hotel! Don't miss the opportunity to stay here.

You could spend a whole day just exploring the hotel. Rooms were clean and I did not notice any kind of bugs like some other posts suggested. Loved having a balcony. Negatives: they do not supply enough shampoo and conditioner for 4 people. On the second day of our stay the shampoo and conditioner bottles were only refilled half way. If a room sleeps 4 they should provide enough toiletries for 4 people. For the price of the hotel you should not have to worry about rationing the shampoo. Yes I could have called the front desk for more but we were up at 7:00 a.m. to hit the parks and we did not get in until 11:00 at night. Also not a big fan of the parking fees and resort fees. We were not at the hotel long enough to enjoy the amenities. Must people staying at this hotel are spending most of the day at the parks not sitting around the hotel pool. As far as parking, if you have car you have no choice but to pay the $15/day parking fee as there is no off-site parking around. Location is close to Disney but nothing else. No stores or restaurants within walking distance. On site restaurants are expensive. Overall, really enjoyed the hotel but not sure it warrants the price considering I am just sleeping an showering there. If money is no object then I would highly suggest staying at the Gaylord Palms.

It doesn't feel at all \"resorty\" to me. -The pool is a long walk from the rooms -- 5 minutes of brisk walking. -A true resort style adult and kiddie pool is under contruction. Unfortunately, however, it's being constructed within spitting distance of the current pool, which makes it unsuitable for relaxation until it's finished. -I flat would not take a toddler to this hotel. The property is huge, there are escalators and stairs everywhere, water all over the place, and a lot of very windy paths in the atrium where small children can quickly become lost. -The food is expensive. $46 for a caesar salad, shrimp cocktail, and coke from room service. $11 for an Italian sub at the Java Cafe. -Mandatory $15 per day resort fee. -Unless you valet, you are going to have a 100 yard walk to the hotel entrance. THE SUBJECTIVE: -The atrium gives some people the feeling of being in a lush resort, while others feel like they are trapped in one of those science fiction biospheres that all humanity is forced to live in when humans have destroyed the planet. -Some find the humidity of the atrium tropical. It gives others the feel of heavy, recycled air. -Some find the atrium interesting. Others, as someone told me yesterday, find it \"tacky\" and \"poorly done.\" CONCLUSION: The Gaylord is a convention hotel that has made some concessions to attract leisure travelers.

When we pulled up to the hotel, correction when we saw the hotel from three exits away because it is so huge , we were cheering in the car. When we pulled up we felt like royalty. The hotel was astonishingly beautiful a 5 star hotel. When the door man came to get our bags we were sold. At check in I followed the advice of a girl I spoke to on the phone and asked for a free upgrade to a suite they happily said sure thing and upgraded us. It was December and off season so it was no big deal for them. When we proceeded to check into our room we nearly passed out. The design of the hotel is a covered dome. Imagine a square covered but a dome. the dome provides shelter to a city Literally a city the hotel has created and when you have an inside room with a balcony you can sit and watch all that goes on on the \"city streets\" from resturants to shopping to a man made lake with a BOAT in it that you can dine on and has night time kareoke. This is just the most amazing place we have ever stayed. Each section of the Hotel is named and decorated after a famous beach in florida. At the time we were staying there they had \"ICE\" a really cool christmas show featured in the attatched convention center and there was free shows going on everynight as well. We have since looked up that amazing suite we got and cant afford it unless offered in a package agian. It runs anywhere from $300-$500 a night .

I can assure you it won't be as of 1/22/2012 it was just a big noisy hole in the ground. The only open pool is one the call the \"South Beach Pool\" which is so far away from the guest rooms its absurd this pool is actually by the convention center and it is overlooked by the construction workers and an asphalt parking lot. The most ironic touch is the odd strip of astro turf they have some of the beach chairs parked on . Nothing south beach about this pool. The Spa totally screwed up our reservations and parked us in a room for 45 minutes and if I hadn't found my way back to the locker room to check the time and then made my way to the front desk to complain we may still be waiting. I was so upset and not relaxed I declined having the services done at all. The room they parked us in they called the \"Tea Room\" was actually dusty .

It is not as if we are non guests visiting this hotel and needed a day pass to use the resort facilities. My in laws booked this room without doing any research, they just saw it and fell in love with the appearance of luxury that they picked a dressed up motel.

Beautiful, enormous hotel-all decked out for the holidays. Huge atrium with bridges, walkways, shops, eateries and small animal exhibits. Very nice to walk around. There was holiday entertainment throughout the day. Convenient location to Disney, I-4, shopping and restaurants but most definitely need a car-it is possible to walk to shopping but it didn't appear to be pedestrian friendly (not sure about sidewalks/crosswalks, etc). Rooms are spacious and well appointed-had an exterior view room-very quiet. Not surprisingly, the hotel was very busy (may have been at capacity) and the impact that I noticed mostly was at reception-there was generally a line to speak with someone, no matter what the time of day and a very long hold time to speak to someone at the front desk by phone.(you reach a recorded message first, then hold). I find this surprising, as even the most basic hotels answer their front desk number reasonably quickly. As others have noted, the hotel charges a parking and resort fee (includes services I would think many people would not take advantage of, particularly if renting a car) ie shuttle to parks, water in fridge (got fresh water on only two of four nights there), newspaper (because of holiday, paper not delivered and one day was a Sat/Sun edition) WIFI (experienced intermittent difficulty connecting ), local phone calls and fitness center. Steam and sauna is an additional cost. The pool is large but has a small deck/chair area given the sheer size of the facility and the sun will be behind the building if you head over in the late afternoon. There is construction next to the pool area. Towels are provided. Overall, I would recommend a stay, however, I suggest they dispense with the additional fees and charge a rate that includes the amenities they offer. After all, the parking and resort fees are not optional if you have a car to park and add $30+/day to your bill (more if you valet your car).

It started out at about 6 pm with a lot of noise in the hallway slamming doors multiple teenagers with no adults . We went to the show and came back at about 9 . Now the noise from the next room was unbelievable loud profanity x rated vile graphic comments on sex acts coming from then next room. When we went by the room next to us and we saw 6-8 teenage boys in the room and at least 2 other rooms filled with teenage boys no adults. We called and complained and at first they said they could not control the noise in the hallway . I then let them know that multiple teenagers were in 1 room being very loud an offensive. They sent security up and all he said was quiet down .As soon as he left the x rated graphic sex comments about sex acts on the wall adjoining our room and loud noise got worse we went down and asked for a room change . We told them how offended we were about the graphic sex act comments and swearing coming from the Next room and how there were rooms of multiple teenagers with no adults. The manger named Mat said they could not change us because they had no rooms and asked us to wait 15 minutes-1 hour to calm the situation down. He actually told us to go back to listen and see if they stopped. Not wanting to hear any more of the pornographic talk we walked around for an hour hoping they would handle the situation. On returning we continued to hear loud noises . The security guard came again just told them to be quiet asked were was the adult but just left again. Within 3 minutes of his leaving 3 boys came screaming down the hallway swearing and banging on the room across from us yelling about being in trouble for pointing a laser at someone. My husband went down to check out and surprise now after an entire night ruined they suddenly had another room for us. At 11pm we were given another room. The next morning we got up and tried to salvage the day only to find out there was no water and they could give no time when they thought the water would be turned on. so no shower no teeth brushing and no coffee . At that point we decided to leave . my husband never even unpacked. As we said to the desk as we left It was the worst experience at a hotel we have ever had. Why when we complained the first time of such offensive noise they did not move us I do not know. I made it very clear how sexually offensive the comments coming through the wall were. From the service to the security policy and then the water break down it was a nightmare. We had 2 days of vacation ruined. they advertise as upscale luxury and it was as if we stayed in the red light district in a cheap motel. It may be a beautiful place but if they did not deal with this situation in any way appropriately.

On arrival, we were impressed by the hotel's grandeur, particularly the themed atrium. The rooms are nice, with double sink marble vanity, stylish appointments and HDTVs and refrigerators as standard equipment for all the rooms. The staff stands out even more than the hotel. We arrived at 1:30 am, and when the bell cap lead us to our room in the recently renovated third floor, my wife (who is pregnant) was so overpowered by the 'new construction' smell that she nearly became ill. The bell cap found another room for us on the spot. The cracks begin to show when it comes to the food, which is not to say the food was bad, in fact much of it was quite good. The Villa de Flora serves a nice lunch buffet, but at $21 per person, I expected more meat options (fish, chicken and pork were the choices, which was no choice at all for someone who doesn't eat fish or pork). The Old Hickory Steakhouse had wonderful staff, as it should for a restaurant that charges $45 for a steak served a la carte. Skip the steak and go for the $9 artisan mac and cheese, which was absolutely the best mac and cheese I've had in my life. The pricey restaurant offerings wouldn't have been much of an issue if one didn't feel like a captive diner at Gaylord Palms. The hotel resides three miles from Disney, right off a highway, and so there are no restaurants outside of these two locations nearby. In addition to the restaurants, it was hard to escape the feeling that one is constantly being marketed at while at the hotel. I found the nightly robo calls advertising hotel attractions distasteful and intrusive, as well as the shrek and puss in boots advertisements, particular the ones stickered over hotel walkways. Considering many of the hotel patrons are Disney-goers, it'd been nice to come home to a place that didn't feel like it was begging for your dollar. All in all, I do consider our stay at Gaylord Palms a positive experience, on account of the hotel's friendly staff, the themed atrium, and the ease of access to Disney World.

So for kids that wanted to touch the ice, it was a disappointment. And outside of a look at untouchable colored ice statues, all there was to do was 4 identical slides. And for my daughter (6) they weren't much fun. At her weight, she barely went down the slide at all. Most the kids had to self propel themselves down. It was slow for me, but I made it down.

The first thing you notice is that you have to pay $13 flat fee for parking, which is not unusual in Orlando but pretty steep since you have already paid for a room, We checked in at 2pm in the afternoon and it seems like we checked in with everyone else! The check in line was huge and we waited a good 15 minutes just to check in. The staff were pretty friendly and nice so it was a good experience. Be prepared to pay the resort tax which is about $15 dollars, again this isn't unusual for Orlando but steep when you consider the price of the room. We originally booked a Florida view room, having read reviews of the Atrium view rooms being noisy, but when we got there we were allocated an Atrium view room in Key west. The rooms are very nice, well furnished with two queen beds, a fridge, a good sized bathroom and flatscreen TV. There is also a balcony to sit out on. The beds were good quality and we slept well in them.........eventually. However the downsides in my opinion are the noise - the resort holds shows at holiday times (I dont know if they do at any other times) and the noise in our room was alarming - sleep is not an option with an atrium view room. We had all the doors shut, curtains drawn etc but the noise was still enough to drive you insance at 10.30pm at night. The inside environment of the hotel is nice to walk around, but not really all that special and although they have gators and fish you can see these most places in Orlando. The environment of the hotel did not wow us at all and the shops and resturants were, in my opinion too many. Another problem with this hotel is that is it in the middle of nowhere so if you dont have a car or bus you are forced to eat on site and the prices are unbelievable. We saw many people coming in with Mcdonalds bags and supermarket food presumably to avoid paying the prices.

I guess something has to pay for the alligators and turtles and the goldfish. Gaylord has done a nice job with the indoor sightseeing. Also, there is a nice-sized outdoor pool and waterslides. I wanted to get a ride over to Universal Studios to see the haunted houses (around 6 p.m.) - this being right before Halloween. Since I didn't reserve in advance (by 2 p.m. - not having arrived until 3 p.m.), it was quite an ordeal getting to know whether transportation could be arranged. It was, in the end, so we were happy. But, the rules seem a little restrictive. The rooms are also nice. I had one overlooking the atrium which is a good view. I don't think the parking lot is as good.

We stayed their last December and we thought this ICE! was nice but it was one of those things you only needed do once. Then this summer, the DreamWorks Experience was announced to be the new theme of ICE!. Due to my kids, 5 & 8 yrs. old love of the DreamWorks movies, we hesitantly decided to do it again and booked the two night package. I thought the package was pricey but considering the only full DreamWorks Experience with characters is the cruise (which is a lot more expensive), I booked the package. Surprise, Surprise... it was a totally different experience that the typical ICE! events and I am glad I booked it. We arrived late Sunday night to the beautifully decorated hotel. Check-in went smoothly and we arrived and in our rooms fairly quick. Our rooms was \u201crecently renovated\u201d and boy, what a difference from last year. The room we had last year was dark and slightly depressing. The renovated room we stayed at the last few days was bright and modern. The only complaint about the room is that I found the bed slightly hard. I have a bad back and felt very stiff in the morning. The next day we went to Shrek Feast, a buffet at their Villa De Flora restaurant. Shrek, Fiona and Puss in Boots rotated around the restaurant to take photos and interact with guests. Patrons were given green ogre ears after they have been sworn in as honorary ogres and wait for their server while drinking their green \u201cswamp juice\u201d. The hotel had Santa in the main atrium area to sit with kids and take photos (Parents cannot take photos and you\u2019ll have to buy the photo you want to keep that memory). My kids and I roamed the hotel the entire day doing their polar bear hunt and the Puss in Boots quest for the Magic Beans scavenger hunt. In the afternoon, we moved on to \u201cHoliday Hall\u201d for the meet and greet with the DreamWorks characters\u2026 we went around not only once but twice at two times during the day. My 5 year stated his favorite part was meeting the characters and taking photos with all of them (Alex & Julian from Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, Shrek & Fiona and Puss in Boots). At night was ICE! and the holiday shows in the atrium. (The bad part of this package is that you could only visit ICE! one time and SNOW! was a separate admission price). We were up down and all around this hotel the entire day; my kids were pooped by the end of the night. The next morning, my daughter\u2019s delight, we were woken by a wakeup call from Donkey (from the Shrek movies). The food overall in the hotel is good (the ShrekFeast was very good) but it\u2019s typical pricey resort fare (ex. $15 for burger and fries). If you are willing to leave the resort for food, you have many options one exit away on I-4. The service was good and I think the waiters at the ShrekFeast were in good spirits (especially since they were walking around with ogre ears all morning). The renovated rooms were definately an improvement. I will consider staying here in the summer when their new children's water park is completed. My son was already excited by their artist rendering of the new pool area that was on one of the walls. Was the whole thing pricey \u2013 YES! Did my kids love it \u2013 YES! So in the end, that was the reason I was there and it was well worth it for that reason.

But last year they did at least give every person a complimentary coupon for a free hot chocolate afterwards. And the show last year seemed to be a lot bigger & nicer with more characters & sculptures & more variety. And the ICE afterwards last year was SO MUCH nicer than this year, they had games the kids could play and win tickets , they gave away prizes , they had ice slides and just so much more the kids could do and enjoy. This year ICE was extremely small and very boring for adults and kids alike, we heard numerous people talking about both the Shrek the Halls and ICE about wow this is it this year? And not only that we paid $160.00 for 4 of us to go this year plus that sneaky $13.00 + TAX parking fee , and the $20.00 photo. Took us less than 13 minutes to go though Shrek The Halls and we struggled to keep the kids in ICE for 20 minutes they were bored to death, nothing to do. AND NO HOT CHOCOLATE this year.

We also did the snow attraction. A few tips: don't bundle up too much it's about 55 degrees inside, you really just need gloves to throw snowballs and a jacket and some boots. The ice attraction on the other hand is freezing!!! Bundle up as much as you can, they provide coats but we brought our own.

I had planned to stay a few days after working since the photos of the place looked so nice. Very glad I did not do that. This really is not a \"resort\" - as I define that kind of property. It is better described as a kitschy convention hotel. It is convenient for people staying there for a convention, but it does not feature top amenities I expect from someplace labelled a resort. The indoor atrium concept loses its appeal after two days. My room faced the atrium. The sounds of the waterfalls are pleasant enough, but hearing them 24/7 along with recordings of crickets and birds that play continuously can be hard to tune out. And trust me, you do hear these in your room. Even when you wake up at 1 am or 3 am or 5 am. I just don't understand all the effort to create this atmosphere inside when you are in ORLANDO - where it is warm and sunny for good portions of the day outside. The fake atmosphere was odd. And it was not easy to find doors to go outside to enjoy the real weather. The hotel has a very nice pool area. Very large pool with two offshoot whirlpools. I was annoyed to find that the second pool that was advertised when I booked my room was not open during my stay. Then ongoing construction on the site right now was so widespread that is really disrupted any time at the one open pool. Very bad planning. The room rates for the meeting I attended were over $200 per night. Ridiculous considering that construction was ongoing during the stay and one pool was closed. The fitness room was not special at all - same equipment as most Courtyards. The spa offered nice options, but to use the shower or sauna was a ridiculous fee of $20 - $30. You already pay a $15 per night \"resort fee.\" And then you have to pay to sit in the sauna? In my mind, a place called a resort has a nice fitness room, with shower and sauna facilities, easy access to outdoor spaces, a pleasant pool area, and the ability to walk the grounds outside. The Gaylord Palms did not offer most of these things. I never even saw the golf course. The isolation of the location was also a huge drawback. And they capitalize on that by charging high prices for food. All restaurants are squeezed into this atrium. What resulted for me was a feeling of being in a globe. All the noise just hung in the air. During my stay there was a holiday show that played on stage every night. Anyone with a room on that side of the hotel was subjected to an \"Up With People\" type performance whether they wanted it or not. Rooms have a tiny balcony with two chairs. I am not sure why - why would you want to be exposed to everyone walking through the atrium and not have the benefit of fressh air. Bed is very comfortable.

Also, a separate shower/toilet area from the sinks. * Nice style/pattern of decor - pleasing to the eye * Whomever made our bed knew how to make one right, those sheets did not come loose at night (I find that to be a rarity in hotel these days!) What needed improvement: * The wireless phone did not work - the base did, but the actual phone part did not * Bulbs out in the bathroom * The walls are paper-thin, you hear everything. I could hear the person next door closing their draps, just to give you an idea. * The bed was incredibly squeaky - and was worn to where you roll towards the middle (between that and the paper-thin walls not ideal for romantic time) * Our bathroom floor had obviously not been cleaned before our visit * The pillows were mush, worn out and tiny * Housekeeping let the doors slam as they began making over rooms, beginning early in the morning. Guests did it too throughout the night, but it became a consistent BANG by 7am. Did not make for a good night sleep. * There was construction going on outside our window, I believe it was also around 7am when began hearing those noises. * Only 2 jacuzzis on property (at least for now) - with as many people as the hotel holds, it was always a party in them.

I booked the Gaylord back in August with the intentions of travelling in November , the reason for booking so early was because we (( my husband , daughter and I ) had to be in Orlando for a wedding , that simply could not be missed . Alright lets get started , I will point form everything . - Check in was relatively simple . - Room was small but adequate , nothing fancy , nothing that would denote 4 1/2 star rating , but it was fine . - The atrium was nice, its basically a whole lot of greenery , tropical plants etc. and they have some turtles, alligators and snakes . Its nice to go for a stroll , because believe me , the hotel is not located near anything and you cannot walk anywhere , so if you suffer from cabin fever this hotel may not be for you. - Restaurants are ok, again nothing to write home about . We ate at the Ville de Flora for dinner , it is their buffet restaurant and I have stayed at 4 star hotels in 3rd world countries that served better food than this . Had lunch poolside one day and that was alright , although it was $54 for 2 Turkey Sandwiches, a rum and diet coke an a glass of Sangria. I knew the food would be expensive but this plae id just downright robbery . The Cafe Java was exceptional . Excellent Lattes, fantastic service and a wide assortment of ALL your breakfast needs and also lunch or snacks. We ate here every morning . - Now as you probably have read , there is a resort fee of $15 per day , which I knew about , but really what are you getting for that $15 ? Nothing . In the year 2011 , almost all hotels now offer free internet , so that didn't make sense , the bottled water the offer you , is 2 bottles , mini bottles of Dasani . DASANI !! and the best part is , we had to call down twice because the water was not replenished as they say it will be daily . They came with the water promptly after I called , but with a hotel that is charging me $275 a night for a really small room and then a $15 resort fee , I don't expect to have to call about the one thing that is complimentary . - The Construction ....ohhh the construction * sigh * , their main pool is indeed closed , but they do not advertise this fact anywhere on their website , nor did Expedia by the way , and the one pool that they do have open has constant construction going on right at the POOL , so there is tons of dust and noise and quite frankly it is so loud I couldn't even concentrate on reading my book, so much for a relaxing day at the pool with a good book . The water is FREEZING , ok wel lmaybe not that bad but certainly not the comfortable temperature that a resort pool should be kept at , and please understand , I am a pool owner , I can swim in pretty cold water , but this was just miserable .In adittion to the construction going on at the Pool , we were woken up every morning to the sounds of hammering and drilling right above our beds. If you have a 15month old as we do , you can imagine how our day started every morning with her being startled out of her sleep -Transportation , ha ! Good Luck ! If you brought your own car , perfect , you will be fine ...well expect for the parking fees they charge ( I over heard many guests grumbling about it ) as for us we took taxis or in the Gaylord's case \" we have a selection of Town cars conveniently available for you 24 hours \" ...what they dont tell you is what they really mean , you can ask for a Town car , we will pretend to order one for you and if after waiting half an hour and you still haven't given up you can complain and we will then magically conjure one up for you . THIS happened both times we asked for a town car , which apparently is cheaper than taking a taxi . I would have rather taken a taxi within 5minutes and paid an extra $2 then wait for 30 for a Town Car . - Check out ...this is hilarious , we waited in line for 25 minutes ! Who has ever heard of this ? Seriously , the desk is huge but only 2 maybe 3 people were working . - I get the feeling from the staff , that means everyone ( except the servers at the restaurants ) that they are doing you a favour , like a take it or leave it kind of attitude . Now listen , I am not a Princess , I can rough it with the best of them and I am not expecting any [...] kissing but at over $200 a night , smile and pretend that you are happy to have a job in this economy and how great it is that someone is willing to stay at your Hotel and pay a ridiculous amount to do so. Bottom line , the hotel is as it says ...a Convention centre , and I am sure for people who are there on business or conventions , this is a great stay , as it appears to me that is who the best rooms go to and whom they cater to , but if you are going for a vacation or a family getaway to Orlando or a Disney Trip , forget it , stay somewhere else . There are TONS of hotels to choose one , don't stay in one where you are made to feel like you are ' work ' to them. As a side note , the wedding we attended had its reception in the Hilton Lake Buena Vista , THEY treated us 100 times better from the minute we got out of the cab . We took a 10 minute ride into DownTown Disney and enjoyed an incredible meal at Wolfgang Puck ( The dining room ) , we strolled , we shopped and spent hours there . Its a definite must see. There is live performances, lots of free activities for the kids and just allot of all around fun . If you are going to Orlando , you can be ensured of a good time , just don't stay at The Gaylord Palms unless you can get the room for under $100 .", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston", "Title": "\u201cConvention hotel within a hotel\u201d", "Author": "KCIGM", "ReviewID": "UR120500159", "Content": "I attended a four day meeting and spent all but one night in the hotel.

Our group was myself, my husband, and my 2 children, ages 5 and 18 months (at the time). We stayed in an atrium-view room overlooking the fabulous atrium that is the focal point of this resort. Here are my experiences, good and bad: Good: Beautiful hotel, atrium and grounds - my kids loved the little crocodiles and other reptiles they have in the atrium. It was decorated beautifully for the holidays as well. Fun and well thought out kids pool (but unheated, and a little chilly in November - not unexpected, though) Spa - gorgeous, tranquil and rejuvenating, everything one expects from a spa. Bad: Restaurants - we ate at the Key West-themed restaurant and the buffet. Both had merely average food at very inflated prices. I understand that Orlando is a resort town, and this is a (supposedly) high end resort, so I expect to pay higher rates than in my hometown. However, I also expect decent food for my money, and they didn't deliver. PB&J or grilled cheese (only!) on the kids menu? My kids love those things, but not every day! The Buffet was ok - we only ate there for breakfast. Typical breakfast buffet-style food for $21 per person. That would have been me and my 5 year old. Who eats very very little. I asked for a reduced rate for my son, since he only ate a small box of cereal and a carton of milk. Manager refused, so that was the most expensive cereal my kid ever had. Front Desk Service (if you can call it that): Now, it was a large conference, there were a LOT of people staying at the hotel, and they were also running a holiday program with snow and music and the whole 9 yards. I get it. But. I expect friendly service and at least a little eye contact from the person I'm speaking to. Our representative couldn't get me out of there fast enough -- she barely looked at me, and when I asked for directions to our room (as the atrium is confusing to navigate), she simply pointed out the window behind her and said \"it's over there - take the elevator\". Ooooookay then! Additionally, we called the front desk for various things during our 7 day stay - we were always given some lame excuse for why the room is dirty, why housekeeping still hasn't made up the room by 4 pm, why my room service tray sat outside my room for 2 days (!!), etc. No real response, no genuine concern for guests - all lip service and false concern. Noise level: Man, this place is LOUD! The atrium has several waterfalls throughout, and it is a cavernous greenhouse, essentially. Understandible that we would hear echoes of guests' voices as they walk through, white noise from the waterfalls, etc. The hotel was also running a musical program with holiday carols and music. There was a stage set up with lighting, speakers, amps, etc. The performers were very professional with good voices. But. They rehearsed every night at 9 pm. 9 PM! For at least 2 hours. With amplified music and microphones, and electric guitars and drums. I have been to a lot of concerts in my day -- this was as loud as a rock concert, no question. Even with our balcony doors closed, it was terribly loud. My kids couldn't sleep, it was bad. So, we called the front desk to see if we could get moved to another room, or at least have something done about the noise level -- did it have to be at 11 (spinal tap reference - heh). Nope -- we were told that the performance was not affiliated with the hotel, and therefore they could not speak to the performers or musicians or anyone in charge of the musical performance at all. We were told there were no available rooms to move to - which was believeable, given the high occupancy that was evident as a result of the conference. However, the answer that there was simply nothing they could do was unacceptable - it's THEIR hotel, surely they have some say-so in what goes on there? They couldn't move the rehearsal schedule to 7 or even 8 pm? They couldn't minimize the sound levels at night out of consideration for the guests? The answer was a flat \"no\", and although I am not usually a \"free-stuff grubber\" at hotels, I did ask if we could have some sort of compensation for our inconvience. Maybe a comped meal, or a free day of wifi service, or SOMETHING -- nope, nada. Finally, on check out day (which couldn't come fast enough), we asked for assistance with our luggage. Front desk refused, said they were too busy, and that we had to do the self checkout, that they couldn't help us. Seriously? They couldn't even call the valet to have our car brought around. Explanation? Too busy, can't do it. Rude, rude staff. Dirty rooms and poor housekeeping: Our room probably hadn't been vaccuumed in a month. The floor had all kinds of dirt and dust bunnies and the like. There was mildew in the shower - unacceptable at the level of this hotel. There was dust on every surface. We asked for someone to come clean our room (after we checked in at 2pm) and were told that no housekeeping service was avaiilable - they were all \"doing rooms\". Well, that's what I wanted too - someone to \"do\" my room! Nope, didn't happen. We also had to ask for someone to come make up the room on 3 consecutive days - again, unacceptable. Overall, this hotel is no better than your average Hilton or Marriott. The exorbitant \"resort fee\" that everyone pays is outrageous for what one gets (2 bottles of water and a non-existant newspaper every day? Really?). It looks nice, but the service is terrible, staff is rude and not well-trained, and the whole place seems to be understaffed in general. We'll never be back, and we defintely tell everyone we know not to stay here. We did do the guest review that was offered online shortly after our stay - we let them know exactly what we thought. Did we get a response at all?

I had some issues with my prepaid reservation upon check in, which took about 15 minutes to resolve, and then had issues at check out where they refunded the prepaid reservation to my credit card (which was given for incidentals) and re-charged the company card. Fortunately, it only took about 5 minutes to resolve this. The hotel advertises a free shuttle to Disney World and Downtown Disney, so I thought I'd take advantage of this for transportation to restaurants the evening I arrived. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything, as is common of many hotels in the area. However, on arrival, I learned tht the shuttle operation is very limited and there were no shuttles going to Downtown Disney for the rest of the evening. I could, however, take a taxi for @$18. I opted not to do this just for dinner. I would recommend that if you plan to leave the hotel often, you may want to compare the cost of a rental car versus taxi fares. The hotel has baby alligators and some turtles on the property, as well as koi. There are posted feeding times where you can observe feedings, but I was unable to do this due to our schedule. However, this could be entertaining for families with kids. The hotel itself has a number of sections each with it's own name and color scheme. Many rooms face the interior with balconies on some of the rooms. The ceiling of the center of the hotel is glass so you get the daylight, but without outside air. This could be advantageous during hot or rainy weather. There was also an outdoor pool and kids play area, but I did not spend any time at either of these.

In addition to all this, there is a very large convention center that can host thousands surrounded by a host of retail shops. Oddly enough, I never felt crowded while visiting this resort on a business/conference trip. The room quality was outstanding featuring a king bed in a corner triangle shaped room which offered more space than usual. The double marbled vanity sink was nice, but lacked a bit of room. The bathroom featured a nice ceremic tiled shower, but no bathtub. Overall, the facility and room are five star! So... why the four star rating? First, when management was informed that I did not have WiFi in my room, I was told that it would be fixed \"immediately.\" After a 3 day stay, it never was fixed. In fact, I noticed a problem with WiFi throughout the facility using my Ipad. Second, food quality was definitely not 5 star - more like 3 star - average at best. A word of caution if you stay here - do not buy the \"generic\" peanut snacks in the stores on site. I bought 2 bags and they tasted like they had been processed 4 years ago - almost inedible.

The receipt I received from Priceline said the room was \"pre-paid\" with all taxes and fees. When I arrived at the hotel, they informed me there would be an additional $15 charge for a \"resort fee\" which was not included in the Priceline charge. I said \"no thank you\", I won't be using any of the resort features. The desk clerk said that \"everyone has to pay it, it's not an option\". I got upset at that, because the whole purpose of the \"name your own price\" option via Priceline is to \"pre-pay\" for the room. I protested the fee, and the manager said that it was no different than a fee charged for parking. I disagreed, because I reminded him if I didn't have a car, I wouldn't be charged a fee, yet if I don't use any of the resort amenities, I still have no choice but to pay the fee. I told the manager I was upset that he was not accepting my pre-paid rate through Priceline. He said \"we are accepting your pre-paid rate\". I then said, \"okay, does that mean I can go up to my room now with no other fees\", and he said \"no, we accept your rate plus an additional $15\". At that time I decided I would simply stay somewhere else, and I asked them to refund the price of the room (since it was pre-paid) and he said he couldn't do that (since it was pre-paid). I realize it was only $15, but it really felt like a \"shake down\" for more money. I wish they would simply raise their room rates by $15 and have it fully disclosed rather than this \"bait and switch\" tactic. In the end, the manager agreed to waive the charge, but it was such a hassel I doubt I will return. I also had an issue with the cleanliness of the room. There was a used bar of soap left in the shower, which made me wonder if the shower had been cleaned at all? My room was also right next to the mechanicals room for the elevator, so I heard that all night. Absent those issues, and thus the reason for a 3 star review vs 1 star, the rest of the hotel is quite nice. It reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino (minus the gambling). There is a large open atrium in the middle of the hotel, and they have 5-6 on-site restuarants. I ordered some fish at one of the on-site restuarants to bring back to the room and it was quite good. The self park lot is a decent walk from the front-desk, and at $13 plus tax per day it is fairly pricey, but at least you have a choice (unlike the resort fee). Most of the employees I encountered in the halls were pleasant and helpful with directions. I don't think I would ever pay $200+ per night to stay at the hotel, but $70-$90 through Priceline seems fair for the overall quality.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newburgh, New York", "Title": "\u201cOver the Top\u201d", "Author": "atima", "ReviewID": "UR119825499", "Content": "I stayed here for a business event for 6 nights.

I knew in advance about the parking and resort fees prior to booking and that was not a huge concern since we got a great deal on our two night stay. We thought the resort was beautiful. Our room was nice, but,not amazing. I read several reviews discussing unclean rooms and that was NOT the case in our room. It was maintained nicely and clean upon arrival with plenty of towels. We had a view of construction, but, we did not spend a lot of time in our room so it was not a concern. I read many complaints about the poor accoustics at Gaylord Palms. We stayed in Emerald Bay, not near the Atrium, but, I can agree with some of those comments. I could hear the maids at 6:30 a.m. outside of our room speaking loud and clear as if they were inside our room. The same goes for other guests speaking loudly. I tried to be courteous when in the hallways and kept my voice low. Unfortunately, I can't comment on any of the restaurants inside the Gaylord Palms. I hate to say this, but, I read a few too many comments about them being over-priced and under-delivering so we chose to eat off the property. We did have one drink at a restaurant in the Key West area (forget the name). Some people may feel that the prices of coctails are high here (i felt they were a tad inflated), but, I can say on a positive note that they were plentiful in the alcohol content. We had our own transportation, but, did use the Gaylord's car service to take us to Johnnie's Hideaway on our first evening. It was about 3 miles away (about a 10 minute drive) and I believe the cost was $18.50 (plus tip). Not too bad in our oppinion, but, we got a cab back for much less. Check in and check out was a breeze. I really can't complain about anyting at this hotel. I think it is a really nice experience, especially for families. We would go back to this resort under the right circumstances.

The walkways are laid out as streets with street names. There are shops, lakes, etc., all among the \"city\" streets.

The room doors are not sound proof and don't seal well...since there is no weatherproofing needed in the enclosed space. Drunken customers decided to scream at each other on two of the four nights we stayed here, one night from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM. On another night there was some hotel sponsored event with very loud boom box type of sound, which fortunately ended at a reasonable hour but did prevent us from going to bed early as we had planned. This must be a well known issue and it is baffling why the hotel management allows loud customers to be yelling at each other in the middle of the night. The food at the hotel restuarants was very average but way overpriced for average food. We are Ok with high end choices if the quality is equally high end...but this was not the case. On the other hand, we were attending a conference at this property and the food served during the conference was reasonably good...even though we heard from the conference organizer that it was equally expensive and not worth the amount being charged.

Also, the $15.00/day resort fee should be optional, not a mandatory fee tacked onto your bill. If they're going to charge it regardless,why dont they just include it as part of the room rate. If there is going to be an extra charge for bottled water and internet room access,etc., it should be optional for those that want those extras. Everyone needs to be aware that these two mandatory charges will automatically add an additional $28.00 per nite to your advertised room rates. Having got that off my chest, I love this place !!!!

I needed a hotel for a night which was not \"Disney-focused.\" The price was very reaosnable considering the size of both the resort and the indivdual room. The room was very clean, well furnished, and extremely large. The bedroom is separate from the living room and both are very large. The rooms for the most part even have their own balconies that extend out into the atrium of the resort which is all glass enclosed, planted, water, restaurants, bars, and even live alligators contained within. The rooms aren't sound proofed and the noise from the activities in the atrium can be heard rather easily (and at time loudly) from the bedroom whcih face out on the atriums. That might bother someone not used to city noise, but being from NYC its a non-issue. The hotel is literally at the \"mouth\" of the WDW grounds. It's a quick turn out of the parking lot and not even 5 minute drive to WDW. Very close. There's nothing like staying at a Disney resort (especially if hooked up tothe monorail); however, the price ofthe Gaylord is a lot more reaosnable for those indivduals who would be on a budget. You're not giving anything up and getting a lot more as it relates to room and space. Check-in was easy and check-out equally so. Room service was ordered, available 24 hours with an ample (not stingy) selection, and arrived timely. Bathroom is large and well spaced (not to mention clean). I highly reccomend the hotel. I have stayed at the Orpyland in Nashville and this resort has the same \"concept\" different enclosed atriums with their own unique theme.

The pillows were as if someone stuffed cotton balls in them, lumpy and flat, the sheets felt like sandpaper and the bed itself was like sleeping on the floor, something you'd find at a Days Inn or something similar. A hotel of this caliber should have way nicer beds. The shower pressure wasn't great and the maid service was off too. One day we came back to find the bed half made with the pillows on the chair next to the bed...weird. We ate at the buffet one morning and it was bad. Just to give you an example, they had quiche which had been sitting out so long that it hardened. Most other samplings were cold too. Quite dissapointing especially when it's over $25 per person.

They were about to have live music, so we hung out to see how that would be. Wow it was depressing. I'm not a fan of Jimmy Buffet or anything, but you'd think they would at least play something Key Westy or slightly upbeat. The fastest song they played was \"Smooth Operater\".

When my bid was accepted by Gaylord I thought I knew what to expect, having stayed in a similar property in Tennessee about 10 years ago. When I arrived the entry smelled of cigarette smoke, it was strong. Inside the air which comprises their atrium was odd (at various times throughout my one day there they seemed to add something to make it smell fresh, but the underlying air was damp and musty). I elected to self park, which I later learned meant I had the privilege of paying $13.91 for parking in a uncovered parking lot, in the baking sun, a long walk from anywhere. Who knows what the valet cost is, and you can't park for free. The room (8122) looked 4 star, but small, the beds were tightly made but the linens not special, pillows small. There was dust all over the TV and middle stand, a hair ball hanging on the hinge and the furniture was dinged up. The windows were dirty looking out to my power transmission line and road view (yes there were some trees... whew...). In the hallway there were people camping outside their rooms, making a racket, kids running up and down the halls screaming. From when I arrived until when I left there was what looked like a box of something odd and a tray of room service food in the hallway in which I had to walk about 1200 feet from the elevator to my room. It was NEVER picked up! I woke up early and got my bill. Of course I had prepaid on Priceline. My bill included my self parking charge of $13.91, and a $16.95 resort fee. I called to question the fee. They said they charged it on all rooms. I asked them to take it off as I had prepaid for a fixed price for the room. They refused. The manager was inept who I spoke to. Later, my sister indicated that the fee was for two bottles of water and internet. I tried on my iPad and my laptop to connect to the internet (wifi) unsuccessfully. Oh yes, Domestic beer, about 6 bucks, well drink, $10., didn't bother to ask for what a call drink would cost, it was too absurd. This place is out in the boondocks so the idea of your waking to alternate venues for food or beverage are out. And remember, the environment inside often is musty, no doubt a great place to transfer germs and viruses. Other cleanliness issues: mold in my bathroom tile and soap dispenser, lousy package coffee in the room and no alternative for tea, the telephone, which is a wireless, didn't work, the TV never got local channels nor the hotel billing folio information. The carpet was loose so you could see concrete etc at the window. I was thinking about a massage at their spa, but they charge more than the casino I go to in Vegas, and I really doubt they come close to the level of service that consistently exists in Vegas, so who would really bother?

Very clean hotel, everything was immaculate 4. On-site restaurants. The food was very fresh and tasty. Sometimes you get frustrated because of price of hotel food, this is one place you will not be upset to spend it. The fish was local, wild and tasted great. The vegetables were nice, crispy and not mushy and overcooked. Also the vegetables were not just a couple carrots and mostly squash like many restaurants try to do to cut costs. 5. Shuttle buses made it very easy, time saving and money saving vs. driving to and from the parks. I highly recommend this hotel and suggest an atrium view as they are beautiful and the balconies are nice to sit on and enjoy the scenery and sounds.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIncredible stay\u201d", "Author": "TravellingRomantics", "ReviewID": "UR114577845", "Content": "We stayed at the Gaylord Palms over the Father's Day weekend.

Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations any more so then the last time we stayed for a sleepless visit. Gaylord prides itself in it's amazing Atrium that is home to a scaled down model of Fort Matanzas in St. Augustine, a lifesize sailboat in Key West, Everglades scenery, and other wonderful natural attractions of Florida. Prices for an Atrium view room are higher then those of the exterior or \"Florida View\" rooms. Unfortunately if you are at the Gaylord during a convention you will have very sleepless nights if you pay the extra money for an Atrium view room. The atrium is amazing until it hits bedtime. If you are up for an all-night party atmosphere make sure to book a balcony, Atrium view and you're sure to feel like you partied all night. If you would like to sleep make sure to request an exterior room as far away from an elevator shaft as possible. If you want your stay to include sleep my suggestion would be to spend time walking through the atrium and taking an elevator ride in the Everglades section to enjoy the arial view and save the extra cash for an amazing buffet breakfast at the Villa de Flora when booking an exterior florida view room. And if you have children this is a must. Even when we visited and there was not a convention we had very sleepless nights as until late in the evening and early in the morning the staff is cleaning up and preparing for the next day of festivities - dish carts, cleaning carts, all sorts of things making noise. I noticed from about 4am - 6am there was a slight lull in commotion in the atrium but 2 hours of sleep is hardly what you want when trucking around Disney World the next day!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and really go pools\u201d", "Author": "Yandelluny", "ReviewID": "UR112977844", "Content": "i went with my family, it was a great location of the hotel near all the different attraction, really good adults pools and kids pool area with the movie . it was great family get together", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience at Gaylord Palms\u201d", "Author": "stylinkaren", "ReviewID": "UR112333297", "Content": "Loved staying at the Gaylord Palms great time!

Our room contained massive furniture - beds, armoire; it just made the room seem even smaller. The beds are now so high that it was difficult even getting up in them and I am not particularly short! Once in bed, I found the mattress to be rock-hard - I was only able to sleep for a couple of hours at a time & woke up aching! When I complained, the girl at the desk said that they could remove the box spring & just leave the mattress or send up a chair to get in & out. As for the \"firmness\", she said she would see if they could find an egg crate to send up for me to put on top of the mattress, or at least send more bedding that I could pad the bed with. Nothing was ever sent to the room and no mention of my complaint was ever made again. I did not want to eat at the hotel restaurants if I could avoid it , so I usually got a carry out meal in the neighborhood & brought it back to my room to eat. But where to eat? Not the bed, obviously - too hard, too high, too messy. The desk seemed like a good bet, but between the computer monitor, the phone, and the room service menu, there wasn't much room. It was just all-around uncomfortable in the room - even the trash cans were inadequate. And no recycling in the rooms? On the positive side, employees were courteous, if unhelpful, and there was lots of room for clothes - plenty of big drawers and a nice-sized closet. My other complaint involves the resort fee attached to the room. I liked the adult pool, but one of the nights it was closed for a party and for a couple of days it was open to all ages for some reason - charging the whole resort fee doesn't seem right to me. I suppose they are almost exculsively convention business and the general feeling of the guests is \"well, I'm expensing it, so at least it's not MY money\".

We stayed the first half of the trip in a condo-style room at a Hilton and the second half at Gaylord Palms. We were so excited to see Gaylord Palms! Let me say that the hotel is amazing! Unfortunately, it just wasn't an amazing place for a family with two little ones. The positivites about this hotel are - There is a lot to explore. The children's pool area provided hours, if not days of entertainment (zero-entry pool, waterslide, small playground, sand area, splash pad). The rooms are pretty and clean. And, it's located close to Disney and Interstate 4. We loved all of these things. However, there were a few aspects of the hotel which were challenging for a family with small children. First, after staying in a condo-style hotel first, it was hard to settle into the small, single rooms at Gaylord, especially since this hotel is so expensive! Second, since the Gaylord grounds are so large, it was a bit frustrating to get around. We had to walk a long way to the pool, restaurants and parking. So, we didn't visit the pool as much as we might have. Also, the children's pool has an octopus, which sprays water about 30 feet out into the rest of the pool. Though this feature looks fun, I noticed that hardly anyone used that part of the pool, since you were constantly sprayed in the face. It also made it difficult for parents to wait at the bottom of the waterslide for small children. I hope Gaylord will consider just cutting back on the water pressure a bit:) Third, on two ocassions we couldn't use a specific entrance/exit point because they were having a private event. So, we walked an extra 15 minutes around to get where we were going. This hotel is so large, I would think they could find countless locations for private parties, which would not require closing a frequently used entry/exit. And finally, as many other reviews have stated, the extra fees and high food prices are frustrating! They should increase the price of the room a bit and get rid of the resort fee ($15 plus tax) and parking fee ($13 per day). If you stay here, bring your own water, breakfast food, and snacks and save yourself a lot of money. Overall, I think anyone would enjoy the Gaylord Palms hotel and all of it's amenities.

The sign states 18 and over. However when I went down to the pool one day it was filled with routy teenagers. It wouldn't have bothered me except we couldn't swim anywhere in the pool because they were throwing a ball that would skip across the water. At one point there was someone who worked for the resort cleaning up towels and the ball skipped out of the pool. He went and grabed the ball for them and gave it back to them without saying anything to them. There was NO inforcement by the hotel of the policy stated on the sign. 2. On two nights my wife and I were trying to go to sleep and we could hear the guests in the next room talking. They weren't talking loud, it's just that the walls are probally the thinest I have ever experienced. 3.

You can hear doors slaming all the time and people talking. I could also hear the noise from the pool all night long and I was at the 8th floor! The kids pool, although enormous, it has some features that are kind cheesy, like a giant octopuss that I thought belonged more into those cheap old orlando hotel than this one. It was also crowded! But i guess it was because of the convention. I went to the buffet restaurant one night and was very disappointed, 23 dollars for all you can eat but the choices and quality was less than stellar.

Phone calls are cheap these days, except at Gaylord. They reduced the charge to $10.15 each call after a furious phone call from me. The Gaylord is in the middle of no where. You are forced to stay there and eat and buy stuff there unless you have a car or take a taxi. Parking fees, you don't want to know... I ask for a \"TAXI\", \"Right outside\", is the reply. Funny this isn't a taxi, it is a car service. Gaylord only allows \"their\" car services to wait outside. $45.00 for a 10 minute trip down the street to a shooping plaza. $25.00 for the taxi back. We got smart and called our own taxis. Believe me, you cannot walk to anything. My workshop... We needed an extension cord for 90 minutes.... $22.00.

Orlando weather in March is unpredictable and we chose the Gaylord for the indoor park with its walking paths and scenery. Temperatures fluctuated outside from chilly with rain to sunny and hot, which made us appreciate the indoor park setting. The food trends toward trendy and away from complexity. Our seafood entrees were good, but not great, but we understood we were paying for the ambiance of dining on a boat in a lagoon with sting rays and tarpon swimming around us.

I blame half of this on priceline as they tell you that you must check with the hotel prior to booking to find out all of the fees.

It's so nice to walk around and go to all the shops and restaurants. Everyone there was very helpful and hospitable. Our room was decorated nicely and was very clean. The only thing I didn't like, was my husband requested an outside room because during our last stay, it was hard to sleep with the inside room because your balcony is right over all the night life and can get loud. Our outside room was lacking in the view department, our view was partical pool and roof tops. On the weekend we were a little disappointed because they closed the adult pool at 2:30 in the afternoon for a private party. We had no choice but to use the kiddie pool, which is not relaxing. I also wish they would do more to recycle. There were no recycling bins in the hotel rooms or that I noticed by the pool. Most importantly, the hotel is goregous, friendly and relaxing. I really liked that there were desktop computers in all the rooms and we were abler to take care of all our needs through the internet. We even got to hand pick our drinks and snacks for the room fridge. This was so much easier then having to call room service for all your needs. The housekeeper was great, everything so fresh each day and she took great care of us. The resort is just a hop, skip and jump from all the disney resorts and parks. We enjoy going to Disney's Boardwalk, and it's a short drive and both Boardwalk and Gaylord have free parking if you do not use the valet. Also, not many people realize it, but it's a close, pleasant walk from the Boardwalk to Epcot. I'd prefer parking at the Boardwalk then in a theme park, parking lot any time. We visit Disney regularly, and have stayed at the Carribbean Beach Resort, Yacht Club, Wide World of Sports (never again) , and our favorite is the Boardwalk Resort.

I used to stay at another nearby hotel until it was sold this past year and the new owners did not maintain the property to the previous standard. This made me find a new place to stay, and i am very glad to have found the Gaylord. In the center of the hotel property there is a stadium sized gazebo with tropical plants and live alligators! Being a Floridian, I do not get too excited about alligators, but if you are from out of town it would be neat to see them this close. The only downsides to the property are the rooms can be a long walk from the elevator. It was not a problem for us but, if you have mobility problems ask for a room close to the elevators. Also, we got back around 11:00pm and were looking for a bar/restaurant on property to have a drink and a late snack, but everything was closed (on a Saturday night). There are no bars/restaurants even close to the property so we went without. Also, if you self-park there is no clear signage showing you where to park, so we had to drive around a little until we found it.

We spoke to the trainer and he said he would get us the same room on the other side of the Atrium, but the room was not ready. It was now 7pm and the room was finally ready after 4 hours of waiting. We entered the room and saw it was not the same room, but \"an executive suite\" that was not much larger than a regular room for $100 a night. At that point, we just took the room because we had dinner reservations at 8pm and didnt want to totally ruin New Years. We definitely got scammed.

It was the first time we ever stayed there, and we had a very nice time. I found the hotel staff to be delightful and helpful in every way! The hotel was beautifully decorated, and the shows were pretty good. There was a definite feeling of warmth and Christmas cheer. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the coffee shop was good, and there was a nice selection of shopping. My kids really enjoyed the Polar Bear Pursuit. We did NOT find the hotel overly crowded, and we had no problems checking in. We loved the ICE exhibit, it was absolutely beautiful! It was well worth the price, and as Floridians, our whole family had a blast on the ICE slides! It is very cold, so be well-prepared, and you will do just fine! The whole family really enjoyed it, and we got some wonderful pictures. As for the SNOW exhibit...it was cute, but too small. My 10-year-old thought it was lame, but my 6-year-old loved it. We all enjoyed the tobogganing, but the 45 minute time limit was not enough, considering it seemed very crowded. I am glad we had the combo ICE/SNOW discount ticket, because I wouldn't have wanted to pay so much for just for SNOW. I don't think it was so bad since we kinda tacked it on to ICE, though. I look forward to visiting the resort on a warmer occasion, as the themed pool areas looked very inviting. The resort is broken up into different \"areas\" of Florida. There are baby alligators in the St. Augustine section, fish and stingrays in Key West, and snakes in the Everglades! It's kind of a neat place, whether you are there for a holiday or not. Now, I'll admit, the rooms WERE too dusty, so housekeeping needs to step it up a bit on that. And there were a lot of fees, but ALL the resorts in Orlando have these fees, so it is not unusual.

We have been going to Gaylord Palms for years at Christmas. We started because of the huge atrium that, particularly at Christmas, allows for a myriad of activities without leaving the hotel. During Christmas, they have 5-7 shows during the day that are roughly 20 minutes. The shows have singing, dancing, and aerial acrobats. This is really great if you are traveling with elderly people who would just like to sit and watch the shows or if you have young children who would love the atmosphere that the atrium offers. We love the Ice exhibit, and the Snow exhibit is a nice addition. I do agree that it is expensive, but if you book the Best of Christmas in Florida package, you get repeated entrance to the two exhibits during your stay. Be warned, the atrium rooms are loud while the shows are ongoing, but the shows end by 9:30pm or so. I should also say that the room service is VERY speedy and the breakfast is not outlandishly priced. Now, there are two things that I hate about Gaylord. 1) The check in process is tedious and does take a long time. My advice is to arrive at off hours which will significantly reduce the wait. 2) DO NOT GO TO THE SPA unless you want burnt eyebrows and a tiny (read : the size of a closet) pedicure room. I have other favorite spas that I drive to instead of Gaylord's. I will return to the Gaylord at Christmas because of the the various activities offered for the entire family.

Even though we were unable to get reservations on Christmas Day for brunch (lack of planning on our part doesn't consitute bad service on the part of the hotel) we were able dine on the buffet Christmas Eve. We had Christmas Brunch at the Hyatt Grand Cypress and there was such a staunch contrast atmosphere the Gaylord Palms was joyful, warm and friendly and although the Hyatt's food was very good it was very commercial and politially correct holiday dining. Does it really hurt to say Merry Christmas on Christmas Day? The very best part of the stay was the fact that the guests and staff were celebrating Christmas. My family had a wonderful Christmas experience. Although the hotel was clearly busy we liked the expansive temperature controlled atrium that allowed you to stroll with the family without lugging jackets, etc. It was a great opportunity for Florida residents to break out our stylish sweater, boots and scarfs without having to cover them up with jackets! The ICE show was absolutely beautiful and our 4 year old had the opportunity to pay in snow. The Gaylord Palms is a very nice resort and the Florida resident package was unbelievable. It was a great value. Anyone complaining about value for the dollar should have probably stayed home because the clearly couldn't afford to go and clearly don't stay at resorts often. All resorts charge a resort fee (Ritz, Marriot, Four Season, Hyatt, Disney, etc.) so just expect it and be greatful that it was included in the Florida resident price. Anyone who travels often knows that the worst time to check into a hotel is at the regularly scheduled checkin time. We always ask for early checkin to avoid lines or arrive later regardless, but it is essential for travelling during the holidays. Additionally, it is always better to call and speak with the concierge immediately after you make reservations so you can reserve seats for dinner or brunch. This is the main problem with booking through online sources without the involvement of a concierge. You can either deal directly with the hotel or with American Express. American Express will manage and confirm your reservations so there are no surprises when you walk up. Again, it wasn't the hotel's fault that we didn't reserve earlier. It wasn't the hotel's fault that there were a large nuimber of Floridians who wanted to see snow on Christmas and that it was booked to capacity.

They repeat the same awful floor shows in the atrium many times per night at very high volume so that you are unable to relax in your room until well after 10pm. Even then, there is so little sound insulation that you are awakened many times each night by people screaming and slamming doors both in the hallways and down in the atrium. Although I requested that my room be made up each day the room was only cleaned once during my four day stay. The dust was still thick on the desk and nightstand when I departed. I did not receive any clean towels until the night before my departure. The hotel was woefully understaffed and overcrowded with parking spaces very scarce even though we had to pay an extra fee to park our own cars. I tried to have tea at the onsite coffee house, but was told they ran out. We went for ice cream at the onsite ice cream store, but they had run out of all but two flavors. The food at the restaurants inside the hotel is actually quite good, but horrendously overpriced and the service is terrible. Forget booking the package that includes the Snow! & Ice!

Not due to the EFFORT of the staff - they try very hard to do a good job. But the fact that the hotel was crowded due to the holidays and woefully understaffed. Examples: 1) The check in process was fine, but probably because we arrived late at night. 2) The room we got was not what was described. We traveled with 3 children and asked for a suite with 2 bathrooms. of course when we arrived at our room there was one bathroom. the front desk staff was able to change our room out - but charged us even though the room was not what we had requested. Side note the suites are not what one would expect for the money. I thought the room was okay until my wife told me what we paid for it. 3) Valet was a nightmare- the valet who took my car when I arrived made it very clear that I should CALL prior to coming down for me car as the hotel was crowded and there could be a wait. Great advice. Except that my repeated calls over the next 2 days to valet went straight to voice mail. I called valet at least 5 times and never got a live person. 4) So I got to valet downstairs and am told I should expect a 10 minute wait. 30 minutes later my car arrived. the valet guys were hustling -clearly there were not enough of them, and the expectation management on wait time was grossly understated. 5) When we checked out, I had a question about my bill. I tried calling the front desk for 10 minutes - no one answered the phone - AT THE FRONT DESK! 6) Several members of our group were charged a valet fee when they did not have cars. They had to wait in line at the front desk for well over 30 minutes to get this resolved - again woefully understaffed. 7) Finally, the snow and ice exhibit is a complete rip off.

The signs in the parking lots are horrible if you can even see /find them. Went up to the room exhausted and had to call security to unlock the safe- isn't that housekeepings job? Went downstairs to find something to eat only to come upon an exasperated hostess that did not look us in the eye as she kept saying I'll be right with you, I'll be right with you. The Holiday show was going on in the center courtyard and was very loud. 15 minutes later we were seated and ate a $80.00 dinner that inculuded only one glass of wine not a bottle. Really? $80.00 for a buffet dinner?. I won't even tell you that it wasn't good. Tried one of the hot tubs- not working- no sign to tell us that after we walked from one freakin end of the hotel to the other. Tried another- not working either- no sign on that one either. Finally found one that was 82 degrees on a cool Orlando night (Ammenities fees of 25ish per night) . Tried another resturant the next day for lunch and once we finally got our food- it was ice cold. Didn't see the waiter for quite some time and was starving- so I ate it. He did a wlak by and winked at us and gave us the thumbs up sign(seriously?), but never stopped. When he came back after I was done, I told him it was cold but ate it anyway, he pretended to find someone to tell and he never said anything again. I asked for the check, paid it and left.

Once with the kids using the $199/night Best of Florida Christmas Package B and once for a nearby convention at a $130/night Expedia rate. The $199 is an absolutely awesome deal if you come with a family (there was 5 of us: 2 adults, 2 kids over 3 and one kid under 3 who gets free entrance to everything). The package includes parking (otherwise $12 plus tax), breakfast buffet ($19.99 plus tax per person), daily resort fee ($17 a day), unlimited entrances to ICE and one entrance to SNOW (a least a $30 value), free hot chocolate after going through ICE ($3 per person) and a picture with Santa or in the ICE exhibit. The lower rate is only a better value if you are on your own or maybe two adults with no plans to go to ICE/SNOW and no interest in a heavy buffet breakfast. PROS: FACILITY: absolutely stunning facility with all the vegetation, waterfalls, canals, Christmas decorations, baby alligators and turtles, shows etc.Better than any Disney Hotels or other local resorts we have tried to date. Very decent video game room although a bit pricey for each game BREAKFAST BUFFET: excellent choices of food. Come hungry and fill up to make your $19.99 plus tax worth it. Did not try dinner or lunch at any of their other restaurants. Hickory Steakhouse sounded very appealing but the minimum of $40 minimum per piece of meat put a stop to that. SWIMMING POOL: big, heated salt water pool with a small fun slide with the kids. It is outdoor though so it will not be very easy to use during colder days. CONS: PARKING is indeed bad. When crowded, they close up additional spots to generate more cash through valet parking causing folks to either go round for ages or park pretty far away. Parking slots also very narrow, only suitable for compact cars really. Saw many SUVs stuck close to each other, forcing drivers to crawl through rear windows! Self parking rates seem to vary by day of the week and purpose of visit. Variations range from $12 to $15 plus tax. ROOMS: the check-in staff has instructions to try placing you in the worst possible room available, especially when you come in at a low rate. That means giving you an \"oversized\" room on the first floor with view on the parking lot. Got that both times but we did not really care since we only go to the room to sleep. However that can be important for some people and from previous reviews, the atrium view seems pretty nice. Rooms were standard fare, the ones we were in looking ultra modern. Their in-room computer is pretty slow, probably due to the number of users. Even their wifi was rather slow. SHUTTLES: if you think you can use the hotel shuttle to go to Disney, forget it. They are infrequent (every hour or so) and very unreliable. We gave up and decided to drive and park in the Disney Parks ourselves despite the extra cost of parking there. ALLIGATOR FEEDING SHOW: at 6:30pm on select days but really a waste of time, more of a 10mns advertisement to entice you to go to Gatorland (which is not really worth your time either) ICE and SNOW: ICE is interesting to see. It is indeed quite cold to go through and the displays are interesting but the multi-colored ice they use makes you think of plastic by the end of the visit. The ICE slides are OK for a few minutes of fun especially if there are no big lines but that's about it. SNOW is a joke unless you are from the South and never seen snow before or you have very small kids who can get easily amused.

I will attach a picture or two that no nice words can describe.

I had an average tasting scallop appetizer as a special which I unwittingly paid $19 for. Don't order the fish stew. Not worth the price ($29) - it is mostly broth. Stick with sandwiches and other soups. Room service had good burgers and club sandwiches. The shop that sells sandwiches and pastries sold me a \"muffin top\" that must have been a week old (maybe older). I think I paid $7 for it.

First the good things: the resort has some awesome atriums that are fun to walk around, some lazy gators and turtles to observe, a few restaurants, clean rooms, nice flat screen tvs, refrigerators, and a computer with internet in the room. the resort is conveniently located close to Disney but not that near anything else really. The place was really not very crowded during the weekdays, mostly just people attending a convention. Most nights we had a hot tub to ourselves. The bad: we reserved a king room but they had NONE available and put us in a room with 2 queens. :-( not ideal on our honeymoon, and I didn't see many other couples there so I can't understand how they would give some business traveler priority over a couple when it comes to a king sized bed. no microwave in the rooms, so that fridge is really only useful for drinks. the computer in the room is awful...very slow and you can only access a few websites. the parking lot is very confusing and if your room is in certain parts of the hotel, you will have to walk a long way from your car. Not to mention they charge you $12 a day to park there, even after you've already paid the $15 a day resort fee! Presumably you are paying the resort fee to have access to the pools and hot tubs and all that stuff, but 3 of the days we were there, the adults only pool was closed for private functions.

Not dirty as in filthy, but dirty as in there were dirty towels laying on the bathroom counter, pocket junk (like plane ticket stubs) on the nightstand, and food sitting on a counter. We went back to the front desk, and because they were booked due to the convention & unable to upgrade our room, they gave us a $75 credit. Needless to say, the lady seemed embarrassed and was very apologetic. The room was spacious, but not decorated as richly as I would expect for a place in that price range. It was nice to have a handful of restaurants onsite, however, they are quite pricey. I know that some people at the conference were alloted only so much money from their companies per day for food, but there was no way their allotments would cover the cost. For this particular conference, breakfast and lunch are included for the attendees, but my husband only ate the breakfast 1 day, and then ordered room service with me the rest of the mornings so he could eat something healthier. There is a restaurant with a breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet, but it's over priced for the quality. We ate at Sunset Sams twice, and the food was delicious. The 2 pools are very nice. They are both salt water, and I appreciated that one was adults only. When I ordered 2 drinks, at the pool I was surprised by the Vegas price tag. We did not have a car, so we didn't have to pay for parking, but it's pretty ridiculous that they charge for parking when the parking lot was probably only 10% full at best. The resort is not within walking distance to anywhere, so take that into consideration, seeing as taxis can get expensive. There are, however, free shuttles to the Disney parks. Overall, I enjoyed our stay, but we didn't pay for most of it, my husband's company did. Even though it's a beautiful place, I don't think I would pay the money myself to stay there, and I think it would be too expensive for people with families.

The Gaylord Hotel in Texas does not charge this fee based on research. $20 a person for a breakfast buffet and much more than that for dinner. Luckily, we had a car and ate at the many restaurants off 192. Happy hour was a term that did not exist here. The bars charged Manhattan prices no matter what time of day.. Last time I checked, this hotel is not in a urban area that justifies $6 for a beer. Room was very clean. Bed head and foot boards were heavily worn and the TV was the old analog tube type you see at roadside motels.

We stayed over the fourth of July weekend and was surprised and delighted to be upgraded from a standard room to a suite at check-in. The room was great and very roomy. We stayed in the St. Augustine area of the resort on the fifth floor with a great view of both the Key West area (from the bedroom balcony) and the St. Augustine area/Castillo de San Marcos replica fort from the other balcony off the hallway. We loved the inside atrium, especially considering the weather outside was a little rainy over the 3 days and hot - beautiful grounds and plants / trees. They have three very distinct areas \u2013 Key West, St. Augustine/Old Florida, and the Everglades. The trees, shrubs, and flowers were a sight to see, especially in AC. The gator feeding was pretty cool. It was also cool seeing our name on the big screen in the plaza area celebrating our anniversary. The pool area was great! We used the adult pool which the staff check id to only allow adult guests to use. It made for a very peaceful and quiet pool experience over the three days that we were there. They even have attendants to take drink and food orders poolside. We only ate on the property for Sunday brunch as I had heard it was very good. We enjoyed it very much and it had the best desserts! There are many other dining choices only 5 to 10 minutes from the resort. I understand the food in the other on-site restaurants are good but a bit pricey. Since we drove and had a car, it was no big deal to drive and we enjoyed dinner at Joe\u2019s Crab Shack and Romano\u2019s Marconi Grill the other night. The Sunday brunch was so good and filling (great prime rib and cold peeled shrimp), we didn\u2019t even eat dinner that night. Service was also very good during our stay. We had two issues, one with the self-serve parking and one with the room not being made up one day in a timely fashion. We paid to self-serve park and when swiping our key, the light would turn green but it wouldn't open the gate. The attendant would have to come out and open with a swipe. i was told by several of the attendants that this was a reoccurring problem. When I complained, my parking was camped for the stay which I appreciated. On the second day, we turned on the 'Make Up Room' light at 9am that morning. When returning from the pool at noon, it hadn't been cleaned which wasn't a big deal at that time. I found a housekeeper a few rooms down and asked her to see that our room could be cleaned before we go back from the Sunday brunch. When we arrived back 2 hours later, the room was still not cleaned at which time I called to bring to the attention of housekeeping as my wife and I wanted to take a nap. After waiting 45 more minutes, I went down to the front desk and complained to the manager who got a housekeeper up to the room within 20 minutes and credited our brunch which was not asked for but much appreciated. So while not an issue-free stay, they were dealt with and corrected and actually comped something which was not expected but appreciated.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, OK Room, Lots of Activities\"\u201d", "Author": "JLentz57", "ReviewID": "UR76846701", "Content": "The Gaylord Palm is a huge convention hotel with tons to do- 4-5 restaurants, bars, coffee shop, spa and gym.

Those who are not attending events within the hotel or attached conference centre could receive a room of similar quality for a substantially lower price elsewhere in the area. The primary attraction for me was the proximity to the conference centre (and my employer paid for the room - yay!). My wife accompanied me so this review also includes the perspective of someone who did not attend the conference and therefore had more time to explore the hotel amenities. LOCATION: As previously stated, the main reason you would want to be here is for a conference. There is a small town centre containing various fast food outlets, Publix supermarket, and souvenir shops approximately 3/4 mile away. There is no footpath (which we knew before we went, thanks to Google Maps Street View) so pedestrians need to walk along the road verge - there's sort of a faint trodden path from other people like us who walked along it. However, the road beside it is a 3-lane dual carriageway so my wife and I quickly decided that since the traffic along the road is quite light, they could use 2 of the 3 lanes and we'd walk in the lane nearest the verge. We stepped off occasionally when some driver just could not understand the concept of pedestrians (let's face it - there's not many pedestrians in the USA!) and it only took 10-15 mins to walk to town. It was easier during the day, of course, since it's easier to see pedestrians but we walked to town a few times during the week during day and night hours without incident. THERMAL COMFORT: The hotel was definitely air-conditioned. In fact, several of the people at the conference I was at ended up having to go find jumpers and light jackets to wear because it was over-chilled. The resort could definitely stop wasting so much energy and rachet up the thermostat a few degrees without a problem - it would still be lovely and cool without giving people headaches and sore throats from recycled air. The attached conference centre was also an offender in excessive air-conditioning but I think that's an independent issue since they seemed to be run separately. Inside the room, the airconditioning unit was easily controlled, and also located near the hottest part of the room (the window) not pointed at the bed so it was well positioned. It's irritating to have a noisy air con unit blowing directly on you in bed at night but this problem did not exist in our room. ROOMS: We had specifically asked for a room where we could watch the Disney fireworks at night (since my wife would be in the room whilst I was at the conference). That request was granted, so we were on the 8th floor, overlooking the adult pool and could easily see the Epcot fireworks at 9pm without any visual interruption. The Magic Kingdom fireworks at 10pm were slightly obscured due to another resort between the Gaylord and Disney so there was nothing that could prevent that, and the fireworks were launched higher than the buildings in the foreground anyway. It seems the hotel is slowly renovating rooms over time and we had an older style room (since we had a CRT TV, not an LCD flat screen. The TV is located in a cupboard that requires the doors to be wide open to view the TV, thereby blocking the only passage through the room at the foot of the bed. This was a bit frustrating when I was working at the desk and needed something on the other side of the room since I needed to close the TV cupboard (blocking my wife's viewing) just to get past. The most disappointing aspect of the room was the hotel guide is not a book, but instead delivered through the internet-enabled computer. This seems like a good thing - easier to maintain, more environmentally friendly, etc. Unfortunately, the connection speed was dismal and it took up to a minute from clicking a link to viewing the page, and most of the links about hotel services were dead links anyway. The resort really needs to spend more time investing in this service given there's no other way to find the information from within the room. I had internet through the conference so I was glad I didn't have to pay for it through the hotel because that was quite expensive. BED: The bed was extraordinarily high off the ground. We've not encountered any bed like it in any other hotel during our travels. Even I (6'4\" tall) felt like I had to climb up into it. It was most puzzling - I can't imagine how shorter folks enjoy the experience. Once in the bed, it was comfortable. An unusual visual element was the bedspread which featured historically attired monkeys. We were in the St Augustine section and even the carpet in the corridors had monkeys playing violins, drums, guitars, etc. It didn't affect the sleep quality in any way (I guess it might if you have a monkey phobia!) and other wings (eg: Key West section) reportedly featured kites and brightly coloured objects instead of monkeys. RESTAURANTS: We did not eat at any of the restaurants within the resort. We seriously considered Villa de Flora which is $30pp buffet on the first night we were there (French themed meals) and the host fortunately offered us the opportunity to view the food first. We quickly saw the quality of the food on offer was substantially below what we were expecting for the price, and seemed to largely consist of casseroles and unappealing desserts. We walked to town and found much more appealing fare in Logan's Roadhouse for half the price. If you want to eat here, obviously check the reviews from those who tasted the food - this is a visual review only. POOLS: There is an adults-only pool (a large rectangular pool, two hot tubs and reclining lounges) and a family pool (water slide, fun play area for toddlers with sprinklers, etc) and the separation seemed to be quite respected. We certainly never saw any kids in the adult pool, though a couple of other adult conference attendees told me they thought the adult pool was boring so went and played with the giant water-squirting octopus with the families because it was more interesting. LAUNDRY: There are a couple of laundry rooms in the hotel, offering self-service washing machines and dryers @ $2.50 per machine. They use 10 x quarters and/or tokens so if you're short on quarters, you can change $1 notes into 4 tokens. Obviously don't take in 3 x $1 notes since they don't give change and you'll waste two tokens. Machines were a good size and clean - no complaints at all. TRANSPORT: My wife does not drive and there are no public buses in the local Lynx bus network that service the Gaylord Palms. However, it is possible to catch the Gaylord shuttle bus to the Disney transportation hub and then catch one of the local buses into town from there. This is obviously not the fastest option - it can take a couple of hours to get from the Gaylord Palms to the northern end of International Drive but if you're not in a hurry and just filling in the day with some shopping, it's cheap ($4.50 for a day pass on the Lynx network). For comparison, one of the many town car / taxis that sit at the Gaylord waiting to take folks places quoted ~$30 to go to the Sheraton Four Points resort (north end of International Drive) so if there's a few of you, the car might be worth it. If you're an individual and time is not an issue, take the shuttle/public bus combo. You could also consider the Gaylord Palms bus @ $16pp which is probably faster than going to Disney first but it has scheduled times anyway so there's less freedom than the public bus system which has more vehicles.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a few adjustments\u201d", "Author": "Trolly089", "ReviewID": "UR72601591", "Content": "For the Gaylords size it is very impressive with every detail, we were there for the AMTC convention for 1 week.

It is directly connected to the convention center, so if you are attending a convention, there is no better place to stay. When we arrived there were no bell men to help with our luggage (4pm??) Check-in was not a problem, however we asked if there was a possibility for an upgrade and were told \"no\", but the gal checking in a honeymoon couple comp'd a suite for them, and told them to just complete the survey, and to mention her name (the employee's) directly. So I guess it depends on who you get at check-in. I was traveling with my daughter, so there was no way to make up a quick \"I'm on my Honeymoon-story\" ha. Depending on where your room is located, you can feel like you're outside even when you're not. There is a huge atrium in the middle of the hotel, with a skylight, to make you feel outside. If your room faces the atrium, then you never really see the \"real world\". Our room had a balcony, overlooking the steakhouse. Our balcony seemed larger than some, and room service could put the table out there, which was a nice touch. Our location to the convention center was great, so for us, that was awesome. There was a family next door with small children, but the walls are fairly thick, so we weren't bothered by family-noise. The TVs are the old box type, and they do not get many channels. The atrium noise can be loud (the waterfall runs all night, and if there is a reception in the atrium, be ready to turn up your TV all night!). The comforter on the beds is nice, however the sheets are horrible! Flat sheets only, so they pull up while you sleep, only to expose your feet to a felt-style blanket covering the mattress. Our housekeeper was lazy, so we had to make our own adjustments each night. The mattresses were firm, but fine. The room was small, but we didn't spend too much time in it, so we were pleased. If you are going to try and sleep someone on the floor air mattress, or on a roll-away, a 2 Queen room will NOT work. When we arrived, the bathroom shower wall had a bundle of \"hair\" on the tile. I have a photo of it to upload later. Uck. There are 2 sinks, which was very nice. The coffee maker is like any ordinary hotel-coffee-maker, but our housekeeper continually forgot to leave condiments with the new grounds. There is a 24 hour coffee shop located in the atrium. It's nice. There are other shops inside as well, which are nice, too. The restaurant we loved was the buffet! In my opinion, buffets are usually hit or miss. This one was a HIT. Even my picky 13 year old daughter enjoyed the meals. We also ordered to-go items from the downstairs cantina. The Gaylord is not located close to Disney. They do have a bus, however, that runs every 30 minutes to different parks, which we found convenient, but if we were traveling to Orlando to go to Disney World, we would NOT stay here. It is much too far away. The best part about the Gaylord for us was the location to the convention center, and the excellent food. Room service is delivered within 30 minutes, and was always good, except for a \"herb-twig\" in my daughter's pizza slice one night. They are supposed to remove that from my VISA, we will see. The down-side of the Gaylord is it is FREEZING in there! The room thermostat cannot be adjusted past 72 degrees, so we constantly were cold, slept in sweats, and by the 6th night, my daughter started losing her voice due to a sore throat. The business center is located in the convention center, and I had an item shipped there, but even though I was a guest at the hotel, I had to pay them $3.00 for them to just hand me my item. The rooms each have a computer, and it will connect you to popular internet sites like Facebook, yahoo, etc. But. Ours kept crashing.

We arrived to a huge dentist convention at this hotel. Although this is a very large property, MOST of the hotel lobby, and many of the amenities were closed off for the use of the conventioneers. They had advertised a special message on the TV screen as part of the package. However they misspelled our names (both of them) even though I had sent them an email with both names, and listed our anniversary as the 5th (it was our 7th). We had paid extra for an upgraded room. However our room was missing the robes, and slippers. Additionally we were left a half empty bottle of water (presumably left by the last guest). The bellman sniffed at our request for a robe and slippers. (How dare we ask for something we paid for!). I also asked him to bring up a bottle opener. After several hours and another request the brought me a corkscrew. The valet said our car would be brought around within 20 minutes. However it took over 45 minutes, and we were late for our dinner reservations, and had to scramble to make it to our show (Cirque du Soleil). However this did give us an opportunity to enjoy the company of several dozen drunken dentists, one of which made a very inebriated pass at my wife. When we arrived later in the evening to park at the valet again, they informed us that there was no more room left for valet service, and we were out of luck.They did say they would waive the self parking fees. HA! The next morning we were awoken toWHO WANTS TO MAKE SOME NOISE!! EVERYBODY GIVE IT UP FOR SUNSHINE DENTAL! or whoever the hell sponsored this round of 80s hits, and island music. I guess no dentist convention is complete without a screaming DJ. Remember this was a trip to relax, and unwind. Our rooms were right over the atrium, and we were about blasted out of bed. The next day was fairly unevertful now that the dentists had cleared out. However the alcoholic apothecaries had been replaced with wedding parties. Almost our entire atrium section was reserved for weddings. Practically everywhere I went we heard 'Sir are you with the party'?' or signs marking an area off limits. Enough was enough! I started looking forward to leaving. We are longtime residents of the Orlando area, and we realize the 'tourist' mentality at many of these hotels and restaurants. No, I am not refering to the visitors. I mean the staff! It was ever so obvious here. Their whole attitude seems to be: Do the minimum amount of work possible, collect your customary tip, and repeat. Service is missing from this equation, but it's really not needed since more tourists will inevitably replace the old ones. Brilliant! In closing, once the novelty of the atriums, and the alligators wears thin the lack of attention to detail, and complete disconnect from their guests' wants and needs becomes grating.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "river falls,wi", "Title": "\u201cTrapped in the biosphere\u201d", "Author": "ortwinverona", "ReviewID": "UR68366075", "Content": "Most rooms overlook an interior, glass covered courtyard which reminded me of the habitats you see at the zoo.

It is an okay location and is a quaint hotel. I say quaint because I have been to the Gaylord Opry in Nashville TN several times and it is huge in comparison to this one. Here, one does not get lost and yet it retains an excellent inside decor. The staff including. The maids are very friendly. The rooms are also very nice and clean. I really liked the bathroom as the shower was tiled and provided a sit down area. They provided basic shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The carpet was especially nice. I always pay attention to carpet because I determine right away whether I intend on walking on it barefoot. It also has comfortable chairs but not a comfortable bed. It was a little too hard. The pillows were pretty good. At least they were not foam. Wireless was free for those staying at the hotel. They have an in-room computer for one to get on line and view Disney and order room service but my understanding is it can't search anywhere else. My biggest gripe is not really the fault of the hotel but something a traveler should be aware of. When I first checked in, the lady said I had a double bed with an exterior view. I asked if there might be a king room available since I hate two beds in the room. She accommodated me immediately with a king and interior view. Well, I wish I had not asked because the noise that comes from the atrium is ridiculous at times. People are really loud at all hours and they have music playing until 10:00 pm every night. If you are the kind of person that is not bothered by this or does not go to bed until late, then by all means get a beautiful interior view. I on the other hand will never stay in one again. For the first time, I actually liked the coffee from the in room coffee maker. There was a paper delivered most mornings. I ate at two restaurants: Villa De Flora and Sunset Sam\u2019s Fish Camp both of which I reviewed here on tripadvisor. I give thumbs up for Villa and thumbs down (way down) for Sunset Sams. There was a Java Coast which served coffee and sandwiches and salads. I did not try it but wished I had in lieu of Sunset Sams. They have free shuttle service to and from the Disney locations. It is about a 15 minute walk through grass to a strip mall area where they have a pizza place and a Logan\u2019s steakhouse and Publix. They have a very nice general store where one can buy snacks and drinks and souvenirs and such. The convention center is really nice.

In general.... *The rooms need to be updated. While the bed was comfortable the TV is late 1990s and, as a result, the quality of the viewing was just not what you would expect for $200/night. *The internet speed was really slow. However, you can't complain since it is free. There were times when the service was flat out down and a call to the front desk didn't help. They said they would \"tell someone\" but it still took several hours to fix. *All room service comes with a 25% service fee. The pricing was already pretty expensive before the fee. *The one good thing is they do have a 24-hour mini restaurant open on site if you really are craving something. But like everywhere else, pricing is expensive (bottled water was $3, medium coffee $5). *The hotel WiFi doesn't reach beyond the main entrance of the convention center. So, if the convention you are there for doesn't pay for \"convention center WiFi\" you are out of luck and have to walk back into the hotel. They don't offer individual pricing for WiFi in the convention center. *The on-site workout facility is pretty good....if not a little cramped. They had a good selection of free weights, stationary equipment, trendmills and bikes. What they need to do is give us a little more room...everything was pretty close together. Take out 2 or 3 treadmills and a couple bikes and then there would be plenty of room to move around. The staff though were really good. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my car from the valet. They always helped you find your way around (the place is MASSIVE) and they were alwasy polite and efficient when in the restaurants, etc. So, I am giving this place an \"average\" rating.

The next morning we ate at Villa Del Flora the Italian restaurant and it was out of this world but a bit pricey. We would eat there again, loved it. At check out they charged us an additional $16.00 resort fee and an additional $12.00 per day for parking. They should add that into the fee when they quote you the price per nite, because we didn't know it. There is a lot of walking to do! It is a gorgeous resort, a beachy, resort feeling, but disappointed in the food prices and their menus.

My favorite, hands down, was Sunset Sam's Fish Camp. Be sure to check out the Fish Feeding sessions in the Key West atrium lagoon on Mondays and Wednesdays. They also have feeding sessions for the alligators (baby gators..) in the St. Augustine Atrium on Tues./Thurs/Sat. Also, go walk through the Everglades Atrium and check out the mini-museum, called Sawgrass Place. The convention center is lovely and easily accessible. The room was very nice and comfortable, with a comfortable bed. Unfortunately, since we are at these places with a corporate group rate, we inevitably get a room on the back side of the hotel overlooking the highway. Overall, we had no complaints. The staff was gracious, and the service was very, very good!! Oh, and there are more places to go off property to eat and shop (Publix) just a minute or two away, and this was apparently not the case a few years ago.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTreated like royalty!\u201d", "Author": "Clover483", "ReviewID": "UR60788564", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for our anniversary and from the time we made the reservation people were friendly and accomodating.

When we got there the valet and front desk staff were very nice and professional. We were a little taken aback at the fact that you have to pay $12 for self parking a day or $20 for valet but we didn't let that bother us. The first night we were in Orlando it was raining so we were concerned about how we would keep our daughter entertained but as soon as we entered the hotel we knew it would not be a problem. The inside of a hotel is like a city in itself. There are ponds with fish, alligators relaxing around the hotel, and little cute shops. My daughter was very entertained watching the fish and alligators. That night we ate at the buffet restaurant in the hotel which was great. They had a great assortment of all types of food --definitely worth the money. The room in this resort however is nothing better than staying at a Holiday Inn. The size of the rooms were not large and the bedding in the room was horrible. I honestly felt itchy sleeping in the bed that night. One of the decorative pillows they put on the bed smelled like it hadn't been washed in months. It was a very big turn off. Since the resort amenities were great and staff was nice it was a great experience for us anyway. But everyone has different expectations. Ours was to have a nice, kid friendly enviornment so the bedding issue didn't completely turn us away from this hotel. Although I must say I got this room at $85/night on Hotwire but it ended up being about $120/night when you add on the daily resort fee and parking fees they charge you everyday.

It's predominent feature is the huge atrium which is a lovely man-made environment including a \"lagoon\" , a replica of the Castillo de San Marcos, several active water features, restaurants and a shopping \"mall\". Upon arrival it is hard to not be impressed by the facility. It is really lovely and has that \"wow\" factor that I'm sure they were looking for in it's creation. The driveway signage is in dire need of change, however, as those arriving at night will have a difficult time seeing the very small arrows that direct you to the hotel entrance. We had an atrium \"king\" room in the St. Augustine section on the 8th floor. Nice location as it overlooked the entire atrium floor, but getting to it was quite a trek. Would highly recommend getting assistance with luggage unless you have a very easily managed suitcase. With golf clubs, you will definitely want help. Room was nicely appointed with comfortable king bed, media cabinet, desk, chaise-type chair and dual nightstands. Very nice vanity area with double sink and granite counter. Shower and toilet are enclosed in a \"cozy\" enclave which may be a little hard for claustrophobics to tolerate. I've seen complaints about the linens on other posts, but I couldn't fault them... Conference facilities were very nice and would highly recommend for that use. Our issues were with things that should never be missed in a high-dollar facility such as this..they didn't get us our wake-up call on day one, and did not follow-up on our request to know why the call wasn't made. We also found the concierge department to be somewhat lacking in efficiency- they don't sell attraction tickets and they don't really seem to know how to get places since they look up everything on the computer. It may be that they prefer to refer people to the on-site restaurants. Regarding restaurants, I found it odd that the furnishings in such an expensive venue would look so shabby. Many of the tables have large scuff marks and some chairs have actual gouges where they have been man-handled. The price of the food implies impeccable surroundings and we did not find that to be the case in any of the 3 restaurants we visited. Transport to the Disney campus was very efficient and easy to understand. Daily updates to park closings and appropriate bus changes were readily available. One of the best aspects of the stay. On site restaurants were pretty good, will review separately. Would not recommend an atrium room if you are a light sleeper. Echoing through the night would be a problem. Spa experience was excellent. Had a pedicure and massage. Both technicians were very adept at their task. Did feel that the masseuse was pushing for a tip, which I didn't appreciate as an 18% \"gratuity\" was added off the top. Nail technician was Liza and very good. Would highly recommend her to anyone. 2 nice pools- it was too cold to use them, but one adult pool and one for kids that looked like lots of fun. Also a fun looking arcade room for kids...probably some adults as well. Did not use the fitness center, but it looks well appointed for a hotel facility. It was seeing consistent use while we were there. This is a good facility for an adult get-away or as a base for a family event, but I wouldn't refer to it as romantic or family oriented. The children we saw were awed by all the waterfalls and fish, but I suspect that attraction would only hold for a short time. If the weather is warm then perhaps the pool would serve well for a distraction. Overall, I like the concept of the facility, but I think it misses the mark for the price paid for lodging here. The restaurants are expensive, the shops charge exhorbitant prices ( 2.50 -4.00 for a 16oz. soft drink, as an example) and there is a \"resort fee\" charged daily which seems high to me for 2 bottles of water and the shuttle service. That may include internet but I'm not certain...still, $12/day??

When I arrived at the Gaylord Palms, I called the Budget in Oldtown (407-396-0928) and they promptly came and picked me up, had the paperwork done in a flash and I was out of there with a resonabley priced rental car (they are very close to the Gaylord Palms). The web site said they had a shuttle from the airport, so assumed it was a free shuttle, but NO!!!!! You had to pay $20 and the shuttle they used was not very friendly or informative and hard to find in the airport. Even with the price of the shuttle I saved money with the rental, and they let me return it at the airport. The rooms were nice and the staff was nice, but only high end restaurants in the resort itself. A car is needed, but more on the extra costs of having a car, later. We had an atrium room on the Everglades side and had no complaints about the noise, but others in the group that had atrium rooms down on the Key West side complained about the noise that kept them awake all night. There was an additional charge for parking and no signage to tell you where to park (I think they really want to push the valet parking, which is even more expensive. And the hired help in the booths in the parking areas were oh so friendly and helpful: I am being extremely sarcastic with that statement.). There was an additional charge everyday (a resort fee) which included internet, 2 bottles of water, and the use of the exercise room. Both of these fees added like $30 to the price of the room and the taxes on hotel rooms in the area are high, too. I can go to the Hampton Inn and get free internet, free parking, and a hot breakfast. Went to the exercise room and the music was so loud each and every time I went that I could hardly hear the TV's with my ear plugs in (I like to listen to the news). If you could find someone to complain to, they would cut the volume down, slightly. The music itself was great, but just way too loud. We ate at the restaurant in the Key West area and the food was great, the service was excellent. There was entertainment and all the people there were having a great time. But it was not inexpensive. Would recommend with the caution not to get an atrium room in the Key West area and to be prepared for the extra fees and only upscale restaurants. In other words, be prepared to spend lots of cash.

Read the other reviews about where this is located, the high room cost, the ridiculous amount of added fees, etc.; I agree with many of the statements there. Our room this time was okay, fairly quiet, and high enough in the atrium not to hear the screaming kids down by the Christmas trees and gators. Decorated for the holidays this is a spectacular sight, and we wanted to make an evening of it - see ICE, have a meal, something to drink and then check out in a leisurely fashion the next morning. All of that was possible, just not as enjoyable as we'd hoped. The hotel really IS attractive, but don't show up hungry. There are darned few food options here (and you're a gazillion miles from any other restaurants, barring the scary section of 192) so you're stuck. They have a fish-boat which we have not tried, an Italian buffet which we tried last time, a high-end steak place, and a sushi restaurant. We went for the sushi. It was attractive, and decent, but (surprise!) very overpriced and quite small portions. We sampled some wine and a souffle at the steak place, which was the best experience of our trip, even if it took half of our food budget. We sat in the bar, which is lovely, even with a table full of people who let their toddler scream and run around (in a bar!) The worst food experience of this trip was breakfast. Clearly, the hotel simply cannot deal with their rooms full, because they failed with room service on all fronts. We decided to indulge, but still have something simple, ordering granola, OJ, coffee and bacon. If they don't have it to you in 30 minutes it is free, so we figured, why not? Well... they missed their window, but we had to argue with the server to get the credit. The worst part of breakfast however was the granola. This is supposed to be a high-end hotel, and they delivered 4 tiny boxes of Post cereal. I almost fell out of my chair. When I see granola on a room service menu, I'm expecting something special, and definitely NOT something still wrapped in cardboard. Come to think of it, the bacon tasted a bit like cardboard, too. Final analysis: Great place to visit and look around. Self-park, walk around, don't come hungry, and don't expect service of any kind at all.

There was someones dirty underwear shoved up under the bathroom sink, hair everywhere, and the shear curtain was severely ripped! We then called and complained to the front desk and they sent a bell boy up to supposedly assist us and bring us new room keys and our receipt that we didn't get earlier. When the bell boy arrived, he just shoved the receipt and keys under the door and took off!! We couldn't believe it!! We called the front desk again and someone walked up and personally took us to our new room. He waited inside our room while we checked it over. We continued to find hair in the bathroom but took it anyways. After the man left our room, I questioned whether or not the sheets were clean. There were stains and we found a hair on the sheets.

A major plus for my wife is to have a hot relaxing soak in a tub in our room. Impossible at the GP unless you have two queen beds. The shows were really loud in the rooms and we actually were a upgraded to a quiet suite which of course had no tub. We went to the fitness center to possibly get a warm sauna and steam room and the steam room was not available without a daily charge of $30. This is not the case at most hotels at this level. The hot tubs were not a warm temperature either when we visited all four of them, unusable. The prices at all of the restaurants were totally ridiculous and way over the top for items received. The steakhouse wanted 56 dollars for a 12 ounce dry aged steak and I had a KOBE steak at Emeril's the day before for 35 dollars, In NYC the going rate is 40 dollars. My wife and I had three meals at the hotel and they were each 60-100 without alcohol. This pricing is crazy and exploitive. All in all the total two 41 hour stay costed 589 dollars. This much and we received a night free! The Villa brunch was great, the Sushi was great but at a super premium price. At one point our waitress at Sora the second visit took 40 minutes to deliver three sushi rolls after our appetizer came out in a normal 10 minute time period.The restaurant was not packed as I looked around. Here's more, The shower in the first room leaked water over all the floor, the computers for iconnect were so slow they were basically useless in both rooms. All we wanted was a quiet two day stay with baths, etc...a romantic visit. Capped off by a thirty minute wait for a bell captain at checkout I lugged my bags myself to the car on the way out. A perfect ending to a really disappointing visit. Not to mention a semi-rude valet parking cashier. If i could only turn back time I would have surely chosen another hotel for sure. We live in Orlando and have a lot of meetings for ministry professionals. I must say that believe it or not the embassy suites or the Hampton Inns in town do a much better job, at one third the price. The tub dilemma is a major design flaw. What were they thinking? The double the value food prices are a deciding factor as well. Good luck in getting a lot of repeat business. I won't be back for this type of stay that is for sure.

The indoor garden atrium was stunning, with full sized palm trees, koi ponds, gator viewing pond, streams, waterfalls and lush vegetation. Our first room overlooked the bar in the Key West area of the property. It was decorated in bright colors, but had a gaudy, not tropical appearance. There was alot of noise from the restaurant & bar, so we requested a different room and were moved to the St. Augustine area. The room was laid out similar to the first room but the decor was much more pleasing. We talked to some people who could not use their balcony as there were 3 wasp nests on it, and others had to be relocated to another room when they discovered a pest infestation in their room. Our room was comfortable and clean. The toiletries were of great quality and ample portions. The temperature controls were easy to use and kept the room at a pleasant temperature. The in-room internet on the computer provided was extremely slow, and it disconnected several times each session. We did notice some room noise from our neighbors, and sounds from the hallways, but the most surprising was the noise from the atrium-facing balcony. We were on an upper level but the music and people noise was constant, however not to a volume that kept us up at night. The meals included with the conference were very good, and we felt we had a good sampling of what type of food could be found at the restaurants on the property. We did not eat at the restaurants at all, except for coffee one morning and lunch on the day of our arrival, also at the coffee shop. We found the menu prices to be a bit high. We did not utilize the pools, fitness center or spa services. The conference facilities were laid out well and very convenient to the hotel property. Overall, we had a nice stay.

These activities and this restaurant was the reasoning for choosing this particular resort when there are so many to choose from in Kissimmee..

The hotel is very nice and very impressive. It's like a whole city under glass! The main downfall in a complex of this size, with an all-glass dome is the heat. In the middle of the oppressive summer heat, the air conditioning in the common areas of the hotel under the glass was not sufficient. Walking from one area to another under the dome was a trek because of the size of the hotel, and by the time you got to your destination, you were uncomfortably warm. This becomes an issue especially when this hotel caters to business travelers, who are typically wearing suits and/or jackets during conventions. The restaurants are all very delicious - the sushi is enjoyable as is the steak restaurant. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are very picturesque, so please remember to bring your camera with you throughout the hotel! If you're traveling on business, and you're staying in one of the towers that is farther away from the convention wing, remember to leave at least 10 minutes beforehand as its a long walk...and the elevators are small, very slow and tend to get crowded quickly. My room was on the second floor, and there was no stairway for me to utilize! I asked a staff member if there was a stairway that led me down a flight of stairs, and he sent me on one staircase, which led me outside and did not have a first floor entry door back into the hotel. I went back up the stairs, and the door on the 2nd floor was locked, so I had to go back down, go outside, and walk the perimeter of the hotel to get back in through the front doors!

I was going to Orlando to celebrate my birthday with friends and wanted to stay somewhere special with a spa where I could indulge in some pampering. Jeanette on the reservations line was extremely kind. She wanted me to be \"happy on my birthday\" and gave me a room rate of $83.40, but there would be another $27.00 a day in resort and parking fees. Making the reservation was the best part of my experience. After I arrived I wasn't happy and there was no pampering. I have wonky knees, but can comfortably walk about a block on level ground. The walk from my car to the reservations desk was almost a block, then another block back to my car. It was another block from self-parking to my room. The room was small and dark. I needed to rest, but the noise from the atrium and the slamming of doors by other guests made that impossible. (The front desk had assured me that the atrium would be quiet and was a prettier view.) I took the elevator down, but the LL button turned out to be lower level, not lobby level. More walking and ended up in kitchen. More walking. In the Atrium there were steps to shops and restaurants, so couldn't get to them. The restaurant I wanted to go to was closed. My knees were now swollen and painful. I had to walk to front desk as room phone audio faded in and out and I couldn't hear person on the other end. The desk clerk offered to move me to another room, but I was too exhausted to pack and move and unpack again. They gave me a $50 credit, which was a good thing, because the entree I ordered from room service was $26.00 +delivery charge+gratuity for a small circle of fish on three skinny stems of broccoli and three quarter-sized potato slices. Yikes! Maybe they could include a magnifiying glass with their orders to make them look bigger :) Also, the audio on the TV cut off and on, there were numerous black hairs (I'm blond) on the bathroom floor, and the toilet seat was wet with what I'm hoping was water condensation. Sleep was elusive due to the aforementioned slamming doors, plus the fridge compressor shook and rattled when it cycled off, and there was activity in the halls until almost 2:30 in the morning. In the morning, a blast of music from the atrium jolted me awake after too few hours of sleep. I cancelled my second night and after calling for a bellman, it took two more calls and 45 minutes for one to show up.

It is a fee to use the gym, pool, hot tub, atriums, etc. We won't use these then.....which is when they tell us the fee is not optional. You pay whether you use the amenities or not. Nice!

My wife loved this feature for shaving her legs.... I was a bit miffed by the spots of mildew in the corner of the shower floor and the edge of the seat. But again, no big deal, we all have some mildew in our showers right? The atriums were gorgeous, like being in a indoor botanical garden. The fitness center has top-notch equipment and was great for a morning workout. The Adults only pool would have been at home on South Beach. The kids pool could have been a corner of a water park just for kids. It had a cartoon-esque dragon fountain and waterslide combo with a waterfall....looked amazing. Ultimately the hotel was beautiful. I would not recommend eating on the property if you do not have seriously deep pockets. A couple of burgers, fries and cokes might be $10-12 bucks at McDonalds, but the poolside Cafe here ran $40. I was shocked. Room service was pricey too at $20 for eggs and oatmeal. I want to be clear, the resort is beautiful and a great place for a romantic getaway or a family vacation as it is close to Disney and has a free shuttle to the park. It just misses on the fine points that turn a mediocre resort into a great one.

The rooms facing the inside overlook the most amazing hotel atrium I've ever seen, all Florida themed. Mini replica of an old St. Augustine fort (which would make an awesome wedding stage), man-made nature walk over Everglades-like streams with lush vegetation and even small alligators basking on rocks! Koi ponds, turtles, etc.. But this is no tacky tourist trap - this is all done very tastefully and it really feels natural. There is also a sort of \"Main Street\" area with high-end shops. This atrium-shop area would also make a great wedding backdrop (they even have wedding cakes on display in one of the shop windows). The hotel rooms are divided into different sections based on Florida theme. The main two sections seem to be Key West and St. Augustine (I think there's also a section called Emerald Bay, but I can't remember). The St. Augustine section seems to be more upper-end simply because of where they are situated over the atrium. The rooms look over the old fort/natural everglades area. We stayed in the Key West section, but decided if we ever came back we'd stay in the St. Augustine section simply to try something different and listen to the waterfalls. That brings me to one point to consider - If you stay in the Key West section and overlook the amazing atrium, you will hear live music until about 10:00 or so. If you are an early sleeper, you may want to stay in the St. Augustine section and hear the small waterfalls in the Everglades themed atrium. With the doors shut, however, the musical noise wasn't bad at all. The Key West section was over one of the restaurants called Sunset Sam's Fish Camp which was Key West themed with a ballooon maker on stilts and a \"pirate\" who did balancing tricks with a knife and other objects making the rounds between tables. If you have children, make dinner reservations at Sunst Sam's, this is the most kid friendly restaurant inside the atrium. There are two pools, one for adults and one for children/adults which has a cool waterslide. This pool seems to be heated and feels just like bathwater! There is a sports bar/restaurant next to the kids pool called H2O, and though the food is good the atmosphere is noisy inside. My suggestion is if the weather is not too hot sit outside and enjoy the pool scene while eating at H2O. Speaking of restaurants, the price of food is my only complaint. Other posters have said it before, and it's true. The food price is sky high. The Old Hickory Steakhouse is not for families on a budget. Everything is a la carte and the steaks alone are around $40 and up. Add sides, dessert and drinks and you alone could easily pay over $100 just for one person! Sunset Sam's and H2O would be the choice for budget minded people, but even these places aren't real cheap. The breakfast buffet at Villa De Flora was awesome - and it was \"only\" about $21 per person. Our young daughter was free, however. If you want a great breakfast buffet, this is the place to eat. It lets the kids pick what they want and it's fast. This hotel is also really geared towards conventions. Huge convention areas and many rooms for get togethers big and small. From major drug companies to a small family reunion, they were all there during our stay enjoying this awesome place. Big group or small group, this would be a great place to gather. Besides the sky high price of food, everything else about the place was perfect. I would stay there again for sure, and would recommend it to anyone.

While much of the resort was buzzing due to a large \"tool dealer\" expo, we were in Kissimmee to spend the week at the Disney parks nearby. The Gaylord Palms is truly a breathtaking example of human ingenuity and creativity. Most of the nine story resort is centered around an atrium that fills with sunlight as the sun beams through the glass rooftop in the morning. The atrium contains countless native floridian plants that landscapers have done an incredible job designing, along with numerous ponds and creeks that contain many species of fish. Making this a truly unique resort, there is a pond that houses aligators who can be found sunning themselves most of the day. From our atrium view room on the ninth floor of the St. Augustine section of the hotel, we truly enjoyed everything that the Gaylord Palms had put together. Even though we did enjoy the resort, there were some shortcomings which I will explain in detail below. Positives: 1. We had a room containing two beds which easily housed four adults. The room was very modern (although they could upgrade to flat screen TVs in the room), and was always kept nicely by the housekeeper. If you are a family of 5+ people, it might be a bit tight, and the hotel charges a whoping $30 a night for a rollaway bed, so plan accordingly. 2. Vicinity to Disney Parks. The Gaylord is literally within a mile of Disney property, thus making it a desireable place to stay if you'll be spending time at the parks. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the parks, which helps if you're looking to avoid parking fees at Disney. Be on time for the shuttle, because they leave exactly on time, down to the minute. 3. Family Friendliness. If you are simply looking for a place to bring the family for a weekend, Gaylord Palms would be awesome. They have a very cool kid's \"water park\" area that kids seemed to really enjoy. I think the kids would be entertained solely at the hotel for at least a couple days or weekend. There is also an adults only pool if you are looking for some solace by yourself. Negatives: 1. Overall cost. We booked this hotel through hotwire, assuming this would be a great deal for us, but the extra mandatory costs added an extra 25%. Parking alone is $13 per day, with in/out access. The Gaylord is not in a dense urban setting, so simply charging for parking does not make sense. The resort also charges a $17 mandatory \"resort fee\", which includes two measly bottles of water, internet access, and use of facilities that normally are included with every other hotel. Between these two costs, it added a significant amount to my bill upon checkout, so budget accordingly. 2. Staffing. I understand that less people are traveling during the economic downtun, but there wasn't enough staff to cover all areas of the hotel. Specifically, room service carts were routinely left in the hallway almost 24 hours to the point where the food was beginning to smell quite a bit. I don't think this issue will affect most of your stay, but it was something I did notice over the course of the week. 3. Did I mention the parking and resort fee? 4. Cost of food. If you are on a budget, bring your food with you or plan to go out. The restaurants inside the hotel average a whopping $30 per entree (yikes!). Overall, we really did enjoy our stay at the Gaylord Palms; a very unique and classy hotel.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan, NY", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!!!

Let me preface the review by saying that I am not a cheapskate, but I am always looking at getting the most for my money. I booked the hotel through Hotwire for around $96/night before taxes and fees. Which isn't bad considering that the lowest prices elsewhere was $205/night for the same weekend. The Good: Everywhere we went, from check-in to check-out, the staff was extremely nice with the exception of one - which is explained in \"The Bad\". I asked for a King Bed, and was accommodated without hesitation. For a $10 tip at check-in, I was also able to score a room with a balcony overlooking the atrium. We forgot to pack milk for our toddler, and the wait-staff was more than happy to give us a couple extra pints of milk for the room. My wife and I thought the hotel was absolutely beautiful. You are definitely paying for the the spectacular atrium and lush landscaping indoors and out. For what we paid, I felt like we got our money's worth. The room was well appointed, with nice furniture and the bed was comfortable. Local calls are free (20 minute time limit) which is convenient. The in-room computer was nice to have, but as others have stated, the Internet was very slow. It was a nice way to learn about the hotel and make reservations. Also, you can view the menu of every restaurant in the hotel, including prices - which was great so you know what to expect. We sleep with a sound-machine so I wasn't worried about potential noise from the atrium. We were on the 5th floor above the tower of the Castle, and even without the sound-machine, the noise was very tolerable in my opinion. Mostly all we heard was a light jazz music being played, and an occasional outburst of laughter from someone in the bar below. This may depend on where your room is however and/or how busy the hotel is, as well as your sensitivity to those things. We felt it the view was worth it. The Bad Food was EXPENSIVE. I wanted to go the the Old Hickory Steakhouse, but when I went online and saw the prices ($35 and up - not including any salads/sides), we decided to try Sunset Sam's Fish Camp. The food there was just OK, yet still pricey ($25 and up). We ordered 1 mixed dink, a soda, a cup of milk, 1 cup of bisque, a sea-scallop dinner, a seafood pasta dinner, and 2 shot-glasses (literally) filled with creme-brule for dessert ran us $87 plus tip. To top it off, this was the only bad service we received in the hotel was at that restaurant. The older waitress that we got was not very helpful, and seemed to be rushing us into decisions, and it felt like she was just trying to get us out of there. In hindsight, we probably should have bitten the bullet and gone to the steakhouse, for a little more money we may have enjoyed it more. The next morning we ate breakfast at the buffet restaurant Villa de Flora. After spending so much the night before, this seemed much more reasonable. $20/person, drinks included. Unfortunately, as much as I tried, I could not eat enough to make up for what I had paid the night before. : ) The Atrium: The atrium is divided into 3 areas, KeyWest, St Augustine, and the Everglades. The gator feeding in St. Augustine was interesting, but my 1 1/2 year old wasn't as interested as I had hoped. Get there a few minutes early so you can get a good viewing area. The reptile area in the Everglades section was small, but unique. The sail-boat in Key West was also pretty cool. There were also a couple of scavenger hunt type contests that I'm sure older kids would enjoy. You could easily spend a 1/2 day or more exploring the grounds of the hotel. The pools: We walked by the adult pool, which was usually pretty empty. It looked like a decent size regular hotel pool. There were also 2 jacuzzi's in the area. My son really enjoyed the family pool. There is not a separate kiddie pool, but the pool is zero entry at one end, and they have a nice water-play area, including a sand box area behind the pool slide that he thoroughly enjoyed. The pool was a little crowded, but we were still able to find empty chairs. On Saturday nights they have a DJ and games for the kids. Also, they had a guitar-hero competition inside the arcade - which was also very nice. Drinks and food at H20 (the pool bar and grill) were a little cheaper, but still overpriced in my opinion. Sandwiches were $15 and up. We split an ultimate burger, and fries for $16 plus tip. At the pool I ordered a Corona and a soda, and it came out to around $10. Overall we had a good time. The fees have been covered here a few times, so we knew what to expect. I agree with others that the $12 self-parking fee is ridiculous. Money saving tips: Each room has a fridge, so if you can fit it in your luggage, bring along some snacks and soda for the room. Split a meal at H20 for lunch if you can, and then go off property for a reasonably priced hearty dinner. If we stay there again, I think I will pay the extra $8 and do the valet parking. That way, we will be more likely to leave for dinner since we can easily load up and go and have a reasonably priced meal. Believe me, you will save more than the $8 difference, as there are plenty of restaurants in Orlando competing for your business. If you do eat on property for dinner, the best bargain may be the dinner buffet. It's $29 per person, but non-alcoholic drinks are included and you get unlimited salad/appetizers/entrees/desserts. I've seen a better selection for less, but you are paying for convenience, and the food is pretty good. Also, if you eat at the buffet, you can tip less...", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota", "Title": "\u201cWhat an amazing hotel! A truly remarkable experience!\u201d", "Author": "Traveling4Three", "ReviewID": "UR31802771", "Content": "I thoroughly researched various hotels in the Orlando area and decided on the Gaylord Palms because we have already stayed at the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton is next door so it wouldn't be a \"new\" experience. Disney resorts have been getting mixed reviews so we decided to try this one. We paid $209/night to stay in the Emerald building Atrium view because we wanted quiet and I've read others complaining about the noise from the Atrium. I'm sure that's why the rooms in the Key West and Everglades buildings are a little less expensive. We stayed on the 6th floor and had very peaceful nights. Pools: Both pools on the property are amazing. They're open 24 hours a day which I've never seen at any other hotel. Both pools are absolutely huge. I was envious of those taking advantage of the adult pool because there were plenty of space, good music playing and seeming very relaxing. We have a 4 year old we went to the other pool which was very crowded but we were able to get three chairs together. I thought my son would hang out in the zero-entry area but he loved the water slide. The pool was just great and is enough to entertain all ages for an entire day. There are plenty of towels and a nearby sports bar and grill. FOOD: We picked up muffins and coffee every morning from the coffee shop. Everything was good. The prices weren't as high as I'd expect them to be when you pay for the convenience. The coffee shop is open 24 hours and also serves sandwiches. We picked up \"snacks\" at the marketplace which had plenty to choose from and again wasn't as pricey as I had expected although don't expect to get grocery store prices. We ate lunch at the sports bar and grill and the food was good. For the three of us our bill was $38 (with tip). Again, a little pricey but very convenient and the food was good (not \"wow - best chicken sandwich ever\" but nonetheless good.) For dinner one night we ate at the Old Hickory Steakhouse and all I can say is \"WOW!\" I read some reviews and was a little nervous that I would be disappointed for the price I was expecting to pay. It was well worth it. The steaks are wet-aged 21 days and are grain-fed Black Angus (means a lot if you know your steaks). We started with the warm pear with gargonzola cheese and it was truly amazing. If you go to this restaurant, you must try this appetizer! You don't taste the pear but the texture with the cheese flavor inside a flaky pastry style crust is just outstanding! We split a caesar salad which I'd recommend not doing because it was still too much salad for two people. The dressing was somewhat bland (I prefer caesar dressing that has a little \"kick\" to it.) I got the filet and my husband ordered the New York strip. He couldn't stop saying \"wow!\" as he was eating it! He says that this steak was not as good as \"Gene & Georgetti\" (Chicago) but tied for second with \"Flemings\" (Sarasota) and beats \"Ruth's Chris\" hands down. My filet was absolutely wonderful and I'd say it was the best steak I've eaten (I haven't tried \"Gene & Georgetti\")/ We had the loaded mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms which were both very good. For dessert we ordered the berries and cream, an apple tart (I forgot the name) and the chocolate souffle. The berries and cream were very good - nice and light. The apple tart was forgettable and I wouldn't recommend it. It wasn't bad but just not at the same level as the appetizer and steaks. The chocolate souffle was AMAZING! What a dessert! Just last weekend we had an amazing chocolate lava cake and this weekend - this souffle wins the \"Best Dessert\" award! It takes a half hour to prepare so you may want to order it early. We didn't order it in advance but the wait gave us time to finish our bottle of wine and relax for a bit. I had decaff coffee with dessert and typically coffee isn't memorable but I had to tell our server how amazed I was at the quality of the coffee. I wish I could have come back to just have the coffee! The server commented that the coffee is one of the best kept secrets. This was the best coffee I've had at a restaurant (and the price let's you know that!) The one bad comment is that I did send my steak back because it was not done enough for my liking. However, I really am a picky eater and I tend to send food back if it's not done to my liking. Our bill was $238 but well worth every cent! TIPS: 1) The free shuttle to the Disney parks was great. \"Paul\" the bus driver was very nice and friendly. What a guy! The shuttle was on-time to take us to the park and in picking us up. 2) We paid for valet parking and it wasn't worth the extra $5/day. We never left the resort so the convenience of having our car whenever we wanted was pointless. Save the extra $5 and park yourself. Self-parking is right around the corner! 3) Be prepared to pay the daily resort fee (around $16) and parking is not free. 4) Don't plan to do any work using the hotel's free internet service - it's not fast enough and \"froze\" several times. We saw people on laptops near the coffee shop and it's possible they got a better signal than the room. 5) Our room only had a shower (no bathtub) which somewhat of an issue with our 4-year old who does not like showers. It wasn't enough for us to switch rooms but if you have a preference you may want to make sure you get a room with a tub. 6) We decided to get a cot for our son (for some reason I thought we had a sofa bed in our room but we didn't). The charge was $30/day. Next time we stay, we'll get the two queen beds instead. Not all hotels charge for cots but this one does. Overall, I will absolutely be back to the Gaylord Palms and will eat at the Old Hickory Steakhouse when we return. This was a great experience! The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The grounds were well-maintained and our room was very clean.

We were staying in the hotel with 2 sets of friends and had requested our rooms be together since the hotel is huge.

First, the good: the hotel has a huge atrium divided into sections that is beautiful and a lot of fun to explore. The pools are beautiful and clean. The rooms are nice (if a bit small), and the shampoo etc. are high quality. Now, the not-so-great: although the hotel is only about 2 miles from Disney World, it seems further. Yes, there's a free shuttle, but be warned that it only runs every hour, and if you are unlucky enough to be the last drop-off or the first pick-up, you'll spend a good 45 minutes getting to your destination. The hotel restaurants are expensive. Drinks by the pool were good, but outrageously priced. There is a little sundries shop, but it was $3 for a 20 ounce Coke. There is a fridge in the room, which is helpful. We didn't use the spa or fitness center, but heard they were nice. This hotel hosts a lot of conventions, and we were sharing the place with a national cheerleading competition, which was not so relaxing: 1000 teenagers with glitter makeup running and cheering at all hours. Overall, this was a great deal for the Hotwire price. If we'd paid the $250/night they claim to charge, I wouldn't be as happy. The room was nice (and we were in the Emerald Bay section, which I think is less desirable) but unremarkable. If I go back, I'll try to book an interior room with an atrium view. The inside and landscaping really are fun and interesting - fish, turtles, lush landscaping, alligators and some over-the-top settings, like the ship in the Key West section.

It really is a great hotel, but gouging pure and simple. There is plenty of room around the resort so WHY should I be charged for parking when I am already supporting them by paying for a room and buying their over-priced food, drink, and services? Seems absurd! Actually they should give a discount to people who drive because that means they have a car and won't be using the hotel's transportation to the parks. Fees add up to about an extra $30 plus per day. It was a nice room too but very average. 2 queen beds, a TV, fairly basic. No privacy or partition. Actually a little on the small side plus the bathroom dual sink was quite small. Also, the 2 beautiful pools are too small for a hotel of this size. We were there on a cooler windy day and the kid's pool was full with no available chairs. Only one guy was serving drinks to BOTH pools. Only the most persistant got service. Nice guy though.

I am giving you the negative things you might want to know, but I still highly recommend this place. Very close to Disney. There was a computer in the room with sloooooow access. The grounds and flowers were absolutely amazing. Whoever does the landscaping needs a raise! There was a stone structure straight out of Tomb Raider. A little swamp area complete with sounds.

I had a 6am flight the next morning and was trying to get work done and get to bed early but it was basically impossible to concentrate or rest with the obnoxious music infiltrating my room. I called the front desk to complain and inquire how long the event would be taking place and was told that it would be going on until 10pm. This was on a Tuesday night, not a weekend. I asked if they constantly received complaints from guests for the noise and was told by the front desk person 'no, because most of the guests are here for the event.\" I know that is not true (and it doesn't even make sense) because there were at least 2 other conventions going on other than mine and it was spring break so there were a lot of families. For a 'group rate' of $216 per night, $16 daily resort fee plus loads of other taxes and charges, I was forced to hear crappy music in my room that was so loud I couldn't drown it out from 6pm-10pm. I find this completely unacceptable and rude to subject most of your guests to noise from one group's event. I wish I'd been at the Hampton Inn, at least it would have been quiet.

When we called to complain, we were told the reservation was not \u201cguaranteed\u201d and that the only room with a king-sized bed was a \"handicap accessible room.\" I understand contracts and fine print, but what's the point of reserving a room (and paying for it, and then flying to Florida) if you don't get what was promised to you. They take your money up front, but claim they have no obligation to supply what you believe you were paying for? Gaylord Palms can certainly rely on fine print, but hotels should avoid that, because relying on fine print almost always results in poor customer service. With regard to billing, there are some pretty significant hidden fees. It was borderline humorous to review the bill. Fees included property tax assessments against the hotel property that they were passing on to customers. It was borderline absurd. It's not a time share, people. Passing on your property taxes to a tourist may seem like a good way to pay for schools, but don\u2019t put it on the bill, just disclose it to customers when they reserve a room. Likewise, the overnight parking fee was over $12.00 per night and the \"resort fee\" was over $16.00 per night. Just add the stupid fees into the room fee, rather than hiding them as an after-the-fact charges on the bill. With regard to security, one of my wife's necklaces was stolen from the bathroom counter. We could only presume it was the cleaning staff who took it. We discovered it had been stolen when we packing. My wife went to the front desk to file a report, but no one from security was available to take the complaint, so we eventually left because it wasn't an expensive necklace (fortunately) and we didn\u2019t want to waste our time. Still, any hotel where anything disappears is cause for significant concern. Finally, and it's a minor issue, but the toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom was loose and falling out of the wall when we arrived.

We ordered to go, when we got the bill they had added the tip, although it was only two people and the menu says tips will only be added for groups over 8.

We were delighted by the Hotel's appeareance; it was easy to find, and beautifully decorated for the holidays, but it had its flaws. Extra charges are my greatest complaint. After booking through hotwire we learned there was an additional \"Resort Fee\" of $16 per day. We spent most of our time off property, especially since the swimming was limited, and received no value from this unanticipated charge. We also had to pay $12 a day for parking in a lot with tiny spaces that was always almost full. The \"Free Shuttle\" to Universal Studios was charged at $16 per person and the free limited local phone calls showed on our bill at $3.40 each, although those charges were removed after an argument. We were wanting to see thier famous ICE sculptures, but it was another outrageously high additional charge, so we skipped it. The concierge was nice, but his food recommendations were not very reliable and his description of some attractions quite inaccurate. The resort is huge, and we had a long winding walk from the room to the exit. Our room was clean, quiet, beautful and very comfortable, although both the internet and toilet were broken when we arrived. They were repaired as soon as I called them in, and the plentiful large fluffy towels totally made up for this flaw. The pools were a major negative. The only pool that allowed swimmers under 18 years was a nice zero depth pool, delightful for young kids, but not even four feet at its deepest. This did not impress my young teens who were not old enough for the other \"adults only\" pool. Even the hot tub was closed the day we tried to swim, so our swimmming action was severely curtailed.

The drive to Magic Kingdom was literally 6 min door to door, it is so conveniently located. The hotel is tremendous with many restaurants, lounges, and great sitting areas. They had a large area right outside of there Coffee House (Starbucks like) that was great for my kids to run around. I traveled with my husband and two daughters ages 3 & 5. They absolutely loved the atrium. It was really cool to walk around and see all of the different things they had going on. Unfortunately we didn't make it to ICE so I can't comment on that. We had one minor problem on our bill upon check out, they charged us for a movie that we did not rent. With a quick phone call, they took care of it right away. The hotel was extremely clean, and so was my room. Yes some of the furnishings are different some may seem old but a good old they are. If you have stayed on Disney property it is the same way.

I had heard such great things about it. Normally, I stay only at Marriotts, so this will be sort of a comparison to them. First, upon check-in, I was not able to get a king room, only two queens. The room was in the St. Augestine section, on the second floor. As soon a I walked in, I noticed that the room smelled like a smoker had been in it recently (it is a non smoking hotel). I tried to switch rooms but they were full. So, I thought, I would open the windows. Well, they didn't open and I didn't have a balcony. So, I went and bought a scented candle and tried to make the best of it. The room was pretty small and the colors/decor was brown/rust colored and pretty dingy. I was not at all impressed. As some have mentioned, the resort fee was high, and was supposed to include two bottles of water per day. I went to the gym after my conference and returned to my room thirsty, and found no waters in the fridge. When I called down, they said \"well you must have had some in there, that is why they weren't replaced\". No, I was staring at an empty fridge. I didn't appreciate having to argue. Also, on my bill they charged me for valet even though I self parked. I got that fixed after some arguing, and then they didn't want to let me out of the self park without showing my bill to prove that I had paid. It was very frustrating. For the amounts they charge ($250 and up per night), I would expect better service. Besides not replacing the water, the maid also did not replace the shampoo, lotion, etc. There was no turn down or anything. From what I can tell, she replaced may towel and made the bed only. Also, I want to comment on the expense of the restaurants. The cheapest I could find for dinner was the buffet. It was $30 for the meal, plus tax, gratuity, and one drink, got to over $40 for one person for dinner. I just thought that was too high. The second night I got room service, which was a tad cheaper, coming in at $30 for a salad with grilled chicken. The fitness center was pretty weak. When I went, no one was working there. There was no locker or changing area. They did have towels and a water cooler, with about 4 teadmills and some weights. The ICE show was neat, but a bit pricey I though considering you are only in there for about 15 minutes. Also, as someone else mentioned, the adult pool was closed 2 of the 3 days for private parties. Pros - The atrium was beautiful and well taken care of. Room service was quick and the server was great. They have a well stocked gift shop and a few other stores to browse. The servers at the restaurants were good.

This time we stayed for two nights from Nov 21-23, 2008 in Room 3301. I do not like high floors. This is a \"destination resort\" but only sort of. The pool is big and nice but adequate. What makes the entire experience is the great atrium. This is one of the nicest places that I have been in. What made it interesting is that this time it got dark early. So it did not seem like an immense wall enclosed structure. It actually seemed like being outdoors without nasty insects, winds or temps. Our 13 and 12 year old really enjoyed it. We were in an Emerald Bay Room. When you check in study the map with the clerk to see if the room has the view you would like. We went to \"Ice\" twice. We got the season pass since it is less than two admissions. Here are my photo tips. Make sure your camera is charged up! The super cold temperatures chew up the batteries. Try taking lots of photos without flash. The ice sculputures have lots of lights in them that make great photos. The workers are very polite and will take photos of your group. Bring light gloves, socks and shoes. They make you were a huge parka that works but the hands get freezing.

Do not miss this place. Haagen Daz ice cream was excellent. Coffeebar was also good and has nice starbucks type food. If someone wants pizza and wants you to bring something up to the room then go to H2O. It is near the pool and under a walkway. Good pizza and sandwiches. Here is their gimmick. Six widescreen flat panel televisions on the wall. Each table has a radio receiver. Tune it to the station that is playing the audio for the show you are watching. It was mostly sports but if a table wants any show they will put it on. One show had some soap opera on it since some ladies requested it. Kids are definitely welcome. All in all very fun. Try and do things when it is dark ouside. It makes the mystery easier to believe. Winter is better than summer for that reason. There is nothing to walk to. Have a car. It is a quick drive to Universal and Disney. There are also restaurants like Capital Grille nearby if you need a change. We also went to Ripley's Beleive it or not. Better than I thought it would be. Our room was 3301. This is right over the buffet restaurant that we did not eat at this time. Across from the lobby opening to Key West. It may have been neater to have a straight shot at the stage where they did lots of Christmas shows.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Smashing Good Time!\u201d", "Author": "Trip4AWeekend", "ReviewID": "UR22114635", "Content": "I booked this as a surprise to my husband for our first wedding anniversary.

It was nice to be able to take an actual hour long walk and not see every aspect of the hotel, that's how big it is. We wanted to see how all the different sections were decorated because each part has a different theme (Everglades, Key West, St Augustine). We also got to see the annual ICE! exhibit, which is a definite must see. The exhibit is truly 9 degrees like they advertise but you won't be in there long enough to freeze to death, I promise. The rooms have ceiling fans, which I have to say I have never seen in a hotel, and I liked it because I like to sleep with a fan on. It was just enough air circulation to not have to turn the a/c on and worry about being too cold. Every employee we encountered smiled and said hello to us the entire time we were here, which was nice. It made me feel welcome.

My wife loved the spa, and rates it second only to Qua spa at Caesars Palace in Vegas. We stayed on a night when they had \"family fest\" on the sailboat in the Key West section. We had a blast! Had dinner, kids got face-painted, saw jugglers, fire-eaters, animal balloons, etc..and then Capt. Sam took all the kids throughout the hotel trick or treating at various shops and restaurants. This event included dinner, and it was a bit pricey, but so much fun. Loved that each room has not only free internet, but a free computer to use(I don't travel with my laptop) Normally, things like resort fees, parking fees, and the fact that there is only expensive food options would bother me. Not at Gaylord Palms...it is so nice, relaxing, and luxurious that I didn't mind paying the fees at all. The food is expensive and average as described in other posts. We ended up doing coffee and muffins for breakfast(about $5 for a muffin and coffee), and ate most meals at Disney or nearby restaurants other than the family fest dinner. Again, this would usually bother me, but not at the Palms. Just prepare ahead of time, and realize there are many restauraunts within a 3 minute drive.

We couldn't get a room inside Disney and found a great deal on a room at the Gaylord Palms through Dreams Unlimited Travel. We couldn't have been happier with our hotel decision. The hotel was mainly just a place to stay for our long weekend, but we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to any of our friends and family. Check in -- We arrived around 12:30 p.m. I wasn't sure if we would be able to go to our room yet, but I was pleasantly suprised when we were told our room was ready. The check-in staff was very pleasant and efficient. Room -- We had an Atrium View room in the Everglades Section with 2 Queen beds. The room was impeccably clean and tidy. The bathroom had double sinks and large granite vanity area which were separated from the tub/toilet room. Our balcony overlooked the atrium which a great view. The room was spacious with a nice sized closet, separate wardrobe and desk with desk top computer. The balcony had 2 chairs on it. There was no table and chairs in the room. Would have been nice to have a small table either in the room or out on the balcony to have breakfast on, but it was no big deal. There was also a small refrigerator in the wardrobe. The hotel includes 2 bottles of water a day in your refrigerator which was a nice convenience. Bell service -- Prompt and courteous. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said our bags would arrive in 10 minutes. It didn't even take that long. Check out was just as efficient. We called for bell service and someone was there to get our bags within just a couple of minutes. Pool -- We only went to the family pool b/c we were there with our 2 year old. The pool is heated and has a short waterslide. There are also other fountains and another small slide for the kids. It's a zero entry pool and the deepest the pool gets is 3 1/2 feet. It was nice to have such a large shallow area for the kids to play. They have plenty of nice large pool towels for guests' use by the pool. The only downside was that there is no waiter/waitress service by the pool, but there is a sports bar right next door. Grounds -- Amazing atmosphere with reptile park, beautiful foliage, etc. You could spend a day just wandering around the hotel. Restaurants --There were plenty of shops/restaurants as well. We had the breakfast buffet at Villa de Rosa. It was about $18 for adults but our 2 year old was free so it ended up being pretty reasonable. I don't know what the age cut off for kids is. They had smoked salmon with all the accoutrements, an omelet station, waffles, pancakes, fresh fruit, grits, oatmeal, assorted breads/pastries, fresh squeezed juice. The service was good and the food was tasty. We also grabbed breakfast one day at the little french pastry shop. You could get fresh fruit, bagel, cereal etc. there. It was open 24 hours a day. Those are the only places we ate at on site, but there were plenty of options including a sports bar and steak house. Valet Parking -- It was around $20/day with tax. We would call before we left the room and the car was always ready when we arrived at the lobby. I knew ahead of time about the valet or self park fee, so we were prepared for it. Resort Fee -- $16.95 day. This covers your internet service in your room, shuttles to the park etc. We didn't use the shuttle service so I can't comment on convenience etc. Location -- This hotel is as close as you can get to Disney World without staying on Disney Property. When you leave the hotel take a left and you will see the main gate to Disney as soon as you go through the 1st traffic light. It was also easy access to the interstate. Spa -- they have a beautfiul Canyon Ranch spa that I didn't get to take advantage of.

This time was different. First let me start by saying they had a wonderful slow food event on June 27 with wine tasting . This was wonderful ! Hats off to Chef Paul ! We had decided this would be great as a birthday dinner and would stay the weekend. I called to make a reservation at the hotel and the young lady I spoke with was rude, so I wrote a letter to a manager and they responded and said they where sorry. The reservation manager promised me a quiet room in the Everglades area, she even called me to ask what area I would like to be in and if I would like a high floor. We agreed on a high floor and that the room would be in the Everglades area. Check In : People standing in line and only two people at the front desk. Lisa said our room was ready and I asked where it was located .....she said in the Key West area ..this is, by the way a noisey area as they play music and it seems to be where alot of families go with young ones. I asked to see the room first. She took us down to the room which was on the first floor and remember she said the room was ready. When we walked in the room was dirty and the bed was not made. Back to the desk . Now remember we where to have a room that we requested because of a problem we had on the phone . Wouldnt you think a reservation manager would note in the computer everything she and I spoke about. Lisa kept saying that there was nothing available.....she spoke to a manger on duty and explained the whole thing to him. He totally ignored us like we where not standing there until I asked to speak with him. He walked over and I now explained everything to him and he said he would give us a room in the Everglades for the night and change to the suite we where suppose to have the next morning they would call us when it was ready. Room : Finally got to the room and it was one that had a connected door to other room ! They had a child who screamed most of the day and into the night. I called down and asked for Lisa and she said she would call me back about another room.NEVER HAPPENED. Guess when I got the call that the new room was ready 9PM the next night! Wonderful, we where leaving in the morning. Pool : They have a wonderful pool for children . Adult pool says no one under the age of 18 in this pool . Well there are parents that cant read as this one guy is swimming all day saturday with a baby in a diaper in the adult pool. Screaming wonderful! This was suppose to be a quiet relaxing weekend for us. I told a attendant but he did nothing about it. A group of drunks took over the jacuzzi with there own cooler filled with bozz. WHERE IS MANAGEMENT ? Beds : I agree with someone who wrote about the beds. Poor sheets and cover. Good Points : Beautiful resort to walk around in and enjoy there plants, kept up nicely. I have told many of my friends about this hotel from the north and ones that live here in Florida as well, but after the problem with the room, and noise I have my doubts now.

The bed was poor - no down duvet and a couple of lumpy pillows. The mattress was hard and uncomfortable. I have slept in better beds at 2-star hotels! The room had an empty fridge, but no mini-bar.

Upon arrival we were very impressed by the outside of the hotel. The pictures do it no justice. Before you read about all of the things we loved here's a few things we didn't like so much. Reosrt fee- We figured it should be included in the regular price. It's roughly $16.95 per day if you don't take a car. If you have a car it's another $12 per day. The resort fee includes the shuttles, internet, paper, and 2 bottles of water per day. Our room was basically over the valet and drop off area. It was rather noisey. We kept hearing loud noises all night. The rooms don't have a mircowave, but have a mini fridge. So don't bother bringing things home from the resturants that need to be reheated. And now the things we loved.. We had an early flight into Orlando and were very happy that the hotel let us check-in early. Our room was very nice. It was on the 7th room. We did not have an atrium view room but it really didn't bother us. We didn't see paying the extra money per night to be worth it. You can basically spend the entire first day exploring the resort, it's SO big. The atrium was awesome. There's so much to look at. The stores we're cute,but a bit on the pricey side. We decided to eat at H2O after we got settled. Be prepared for high resort prices. It was $14 for cheeseburger and fries. After lunch we went to the transportation lobby and found that the Universal sales rep had left for the day.. it was only 1pm. That seemed a little off. So we decided we'd have to come back tomorrow morning and get our tickets. After that we layed out by the adult pool. It was nice to not have screaming kids running around and relax. There is a waitress walking around and you can order drinks. The pool was a nice size and there were plenty of lawn chairs. There are a few hot tubs near the pools. They are open 24hrs. We found going after sunset was best and it's much more enjoyable. For dinner we went to the Pirates Dinner Adventure. The hotel workers were very good at getting us a cab. For a Mears towncar it was $35 for maybe 12miles. We got a another cab on the way back and it was only $28. The hotel has free shuttles to most of the amusement parks. I suggest taking the shuttle and not driving. We did the Villa de Flora resturant for dinner the second night. They have a nice buffet. It was roughly $30 a person plus tip.

Unlike most other hotels that will provide you with three bath towels and then you have to call for one more (being that we are a family of four) they routinely provide you with six bath towels at the Gaylord. There is a refrigerator in the room and a computer with internet access and access to detailed information on what the hotel provides. You can even schedule having your luggage picked up at a certain time and getting your car out of valet as well, through the computer. The hair products and soaps were fabulous and unlike the Ritz Carlton you get a fresh supply each day. Luckily, at check in I was provided with a map. You will need it for at least the first day to find your way around this immense wonderland. The Everglades area is beautiful and something to see both in the daylight and at night. It looks very different in the evening. Be sure to look at the snakes and baby alligators. The St. Augustine area has a large castle reproduction of the Castillo San Marcos in St. Augustine, FL. Kids will enjoy pretending to be pirates in this area. The Key West section is very nice and has a very nice restaurant part of which is on a ship in a lake in this area. Best thing is it is all air conditioned and you feel like you are outside. There are also alligators that are fed three times a week and feeding times are posted. The pools are both great but I have to say the kid's pool was my favorite. It has some great areas for kids to play in and a water slide. All the restaurants are great. You need to make reservations for Sam's Fish Camp and the Hickory Steakhouse. The Sushi place and H2O are also wonderful. I did not have one bad meal. If you want to save money, the Java Coast Cafe has great sandwiches and salads for a much lower price than the sit down restaurants.

The poached eggs over hash were especially good, as was the oatmeal with fruit. For lunch the Mediterranean buffet was excellent as well, with tons of choices.Don't miss the ice cream bar, where you can add your choice of candies, cookies, and hot fudge. All rooms come with a computer. I had read that they were really slow, so I brought my own laptop. This was not necessary as we found the internet pretty fast. The rooms in the Everglades section were nice. They may not have been upgraded yet to the pillowtop mattresses and the plasma tv's, but the room was comfortable none the less.The rooms with the balconies were $40 more a night, but we felt it was worth it. It was a nice place to sit out and enjoy a glass of wine before dinner. Yes, the hotel has a resort fee, but you know that upfront. It includes 2 bottles of water a day, free internet, gym, and 1 bucket of golf balls a day. Service was good,from the front desk, housekeeping,concierge, and valet. There is free transportation to all the Disney theme parks. The bus leaves every hour in the morning and comes back every hour and a half in the afternoon. It was a very short trip to Epcot. The outside pool is really nice, and there are plenty of lounges.2 hot tubs as well. Food service by the pool was good. We had salads which we all liked. The BAD: We did not like the rooms in the Key West section, where they put us at 1st. The rooms had a musty/fishy smell, and the carpet looked gross.It is also much noisier here as it overlooks the noisy bar in the atrium. They did switch us to the Everglades section. One day they closed the pool at 3:30 for a function. The kids pool was closed for renovations so this left no options for swimming.We were there for 4 nights and this happened just once, but still I think that is totally unfair to the guests. Tips: If you have little kids, the Emerald Bay section would be a good choice to be close to the kids pool. The Everglades section is best if you want a quieter area that is the closest to the adult pool, gym and spa. 20 somethings would probably enjoy the Key West section the best.

I showed them my drivers lic. and gave them my husband's corporate credit card, since this was a business trip. Although the desk acknowledged that I requested the Emerald Tower, they put us in the Key West section. The room was terrible. The closet consisted of an indentation in the wall from which a 1 foot long rod was mounted on one side, about 4 feet from the floor. The bath room shower consisted of a shower curtain hung across on end of the bath room and a drain in the middle. No lip to prevent the water from covering the entire bathroom floor. The view from our postage stamp balcony was of very large ship in a very small man made pond, which was their fish rest. At about 3pm extremely loud entertainment began on the deck of the ship/rest. That was it, I called the front desk. After telling them we were checking out, they found another room and moved us to the Everglades section. The room in the Everglades was much much better. It was larger better appointed, relatively quiet, had a real closet, had a real shower and decent bathroom. The second day we were there my husband went off at a business meeting and I decided to return to the room on my own. My key did not work in the door and the maids were not in the hall. I went down to the desk and asked them to replace my key. The desk told me that I was not registered. They asked for my drivers lic., said they could send a security guard up to the room to let me in, but could not give me a key unless my husband came to the desk to authorize it. Now remember I am the one who checked in. The desk never asked nor saw any of my husband's identification. I asked for a manager. An assistant manager came out. She said she was so sorry so sorry, the clerk make a mistake at check in, by not registering me in the room, however I had to get my husband to come to the desk in order to correct the matter. She told me to ask for her when I could reach him and she would get the matter straightened out immediately. Less than 20 minutes, my husband now out of his meeting, called me to tell me he was free. He was not too happy when I told him he had to come down to the desk so I could get a key to our room. He met me there and I asked the person at the front desk to get the assistant manager that I had spoken to before. The message came back that she was too busy to come out from the back. Fortunately a very kind desk clerk who had over heard all that went on earlier came to our rescue. They do not have enough dinning options for dinner on the premises. They have only one pretty small steakhouse, which is had to get in unless you eat before 6pm or after 9pm. Their continental rest. is buffet, which I hate, and their seafood rest. has very LOUD music, so you have to go off premises to eat. Although it is supposed to be completely non-smoking. My husband and I were in the hot tub at the pool, and two women came over parked themselves down and proceeded to smoke. They did not even bother to ask if we minded the smoke. There is no pool staff so no one is there to enforce their no smoking rules. My husband and I just picked up our things and left, it was easier. All in all it was a very unpleasant stay.

There is a lot of habitat in the main courtyard. They keep young gators on site which you can watch get fed. A lot of fish and turtles, too. I believe I saw a stingray in the pond by Sunset Sam's.

One of the pillowcases had a black smudge on it but it was replaced. BTW, there is no traditional \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. There's a couple of buttons by the door; one that turns on a \"Do Not Disturb\" light. The reason I mention this is that if you forget to turn it off when you leave for the day they'll pass over your room for cleaning. Since I'm used to having a sign to hang on the door, I forgot the first day. But no biggie. There are two outdoor pools... one for family and one for adults only.

Both provide decent entertainment without having to drive anywhere, which if you have been to Orlando before, can be an adventure. The room I had was in the Everglades section overlooking the inside and all the inside rooms have doors and a balcony so if you were so inclined, you could sit and watch everything going on inside the area. The rooms were decent, but not upgraded anytime in the recent past. A small, older, tube television was inside an armoire with a safe and mini fridge. The bathroom accomodations were decent as well. Overall, if you are going to a convention at the Gaylord Palms Convention Center, it's probably a good idea to stay there. Also, if you have young children and are hitting up the Disney parks, the resort is very close to them. It is also situated in a nice area, right off both I-4 and Osceola Parkway, so it is easy to navigate the area without using the major highways.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Gorgeous\u201d", "Author": "MugRug", "ReviewID": "UR12584695", "Content": "What a beautiful hotel!

Our stay was 5 days. Having spent time at the Dallas Gaylord property, I was a bit familiar with the hotel brand. Having a some what pleasurable experience at the Dallas Gaylord, I was anticipating my stay at the Kissimmee Gaylord to be similar. Let me preface that as a frequent business traveler I am accustomed to a level of acceptable practices, chief among them, a clean and sanitiary room. Although I cannot expect perfection, for what my room rate was (even at a reduced cost through the convention) I had tremendous difficulties with many issues during my stay. To begin, as soon as I checked into my room I immediately noticed ripped wall paper in the common space areas and dirty carpet in my room. As I browsed the washroom and toilet areas I found a dirty towel in the bath tub and the shampoo amenity was half full. It smelled of sewer each and every time the toilet was flushed and of sulfur each and every time I used the shower. The shower pressure was also pathetically low and the water didn't drain properly in the tub. I stood in 4 inches of dirty water every night to get clean. The towels offered desperately need to be replaced. Many of the ones I was provided with were horribly worn with random threads dangling from the stiched seams. My dog is dryed with better towels than the ones I was given. Simply ridiculous. The bedding is aged and the pillows are depressingly thin and offer no support. The mini bar is not stocked with anything, but you are left with a nice message on a bed card letting you know that if you purchase at least $20 worth of product, they will happily stock the refrigerator for you. Completely ridicuous. The room thermostat is limited. It doesn't enable you to go beyond 75 degrees. If a guest needs to feel warmer for whatever reason, that decision should be left to them and their comfort level. Totally wrong. Transporation outside of the facility is limited to the use of pre-selected town cars only. Taxi cabs are not permitted to enter the property except to drop you off from the airport. During my stay town car fees ranged from $25-$35 one way. Total nonsense. With a resort of this size, one would think there would be a wonderful selection of fine dining and easy casual restaurants. Not the case. There are less than 5 mediocre eateries on the premises. The food at Villa de Flora could have been so much better. Super dissapointed. Contained within a dome of controlled air conditioning and pressure, and with no real activities on the premises there is literally nothing to do. All in all my experience was terrible and I would never recommend anyone come here for casual vacationing. It is clear that the management company is focused to one thing. Convention revenue. With as many of these issues during once visit, it's pretty clear that they are not too concerned about guest comfort.

I just stayed at this property this past weekend on a \"romance\" package with an Atrium view room ($400.00+ booked online). For the money there are much nicer properties in the area with much better service. First impression upon entering the property - I opted for self parking ($12.00/day) and after droping my wife off at the main entry, I found no clear signs to the entrance to the parking lot (signs take you to the exit which is not maked as an exit but gated so you cannot enter). Once I got the car situated there were no signs from the parking lot back to the lobby for check in. I walked the long way, up and down stairs through the atrium - I later discovered that the signs I finally found in the atrium took me the long way around. When we checked in we were given no information about our package or how to arrange for the various elements of it. I thought maybe there would be a package for us in the room or someone would call. There wasn't and they didn't. Eventually I called guest services and I was given at least partially wrong information. In the room we found a used toothpick on the bed which made me wonder about the quality of housekeeping. The room itself, though adequate, was nothing special and was somewhat shabby (the carpet had holes, the upholstery on the chairs was stained, the bedding drab and of mediocre quality, the furniture had scratches and the television was old with varying qualities of reception on the various channels - some came in good, some had static). I couldn't get a reservation in the steak restaurant for dinner (at a decent time) so opted for the seafood restaurant. Part of our package was a \"wine and cheese flight\" for two at the steakhouse restaurant. We went there prior to dinner to have our wine and cheese flight for two in the bar. We were given a wine and cheese flight for one. I asked about this when we were given only one set of glasses. The waitress explained this was what we were to get as per her manager. The manager came over and explained that we were only to get the wine and cheese flight for one as this was more romantic. When we arrived at the seafood restaurant for dinner they didn't have a reservation under my name. They had a name somewhat close so I'll assume they just misunderstood. They did seat us right away but not in the restaurant. They seated us in the bar area - (not being familiar with the restaurant I didn't realize this until later - nor were we told by anyone that we were being seated in the bar). Being in the bar area was not too big of a deal until the band started playing - five feet away from us - about 20 minutes into our meal - too late for us to get up and leave. That was the end of any possibility of conversation or even being able to hear the waitress. Instead of a romantic anniversary dinner we were in the middle of Margaritaville. We rushed through the meal and got out of there asap. Back in the room we found that the muzak they pipe into the atrium (which was like various ambiant tones repeated one after another) leaked into the room in an endless cycle and was annoying to say the least. Thankfully it was shut off at about 11:00 PM. There was a lot of outside noise from kids and teens running around the halls and slamming doors til all hours but I understand it is a resort area and there's going to be some of that almost anywhere you go. Room service breakfast guaranteed for 30 delivery (or its free) took 45. Couldn't take advantage of the guarantee as breakfast was included in the package. I wonder if that had anything to do with the late delivery. (BTW, room service breakfast - 2 entrees 2 large juices over $60.00 with service and delivery fees - good thing it was included). Having a computer with internet access in the room was nice. In checking my account, I found several incorrect charges on our bill which had to be corrected. Staff was very nice in addressing problems but problems kept coming up. On a one night stay, at least 4 charges in error which had to be corrected. Wife had massage at the spa and, due to spa's mix up, she was given someone else's treatment - and they got hers. Spa gave her a discount but still. It was one mistake and mix up after the other.

This is more than I am usually willing to pay for a hotel, but having been here before for a business convention, I felt strongly that my fiance would wholly enjoy the experience. I was not mistaken. This location can often be had via Priceline for about $99 before tax, but was sold out for the last two nights of my stay, so I opted for a direct book for the night I could get. With that said, we were upgraded to an Atrium view (an absolute must to truly appreciate what the Gaylord Palms has to offer) in the St. Augustine area upon request, having indicated on my reservation that it was our anniversary. This would have cost us $40 more per night, and would have been worth it. I had a Florida view last time around and it made the hotel feel generic. Having the ability to open the French Doors to the balcony overlooking the Atrium is a great perk. The Key West section of the hotel is noisier than the Everglades section, so opt for a room near there if you prefer the sound of waterfalls rather than music from the bar. I am not sure what I can add (other than my pictures) that has not already been said before, but I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted a place to stay in the Orlando area. Service is wonderful, the room was immaculate and the experience is just one of a kind. If you are two adults looking to get away, there is an adults-only pool, a safe haven from splashing and screaming kids. For families, there is also a kid-friendly pool. I just got a kick out of walking around the Atrium area, checking out the fish and other wildlife and poking into the various shops available. If budget is not a concern, there is no need to leave this hotel, as everything you need is here, along with complimentary service to all area attractions. Sunset Sam's is the most reasonable restaurant, and I would recommend it for lunch as you can easily get out of there for under $20 per person. Villa de Flora is $19 per person for breakfast, which is buffet style; other meals there increase by about $5 from there. The steakhouse is a budget buster for most, but the ambiance is almost priceless. I'd say you are looking at about $60 per person to dine there. By the looks of things, reservations are recommended. Based on my memory from my business-orient trip, the food at the steakhouse is nothing to write home about. However, it was great place to take in the sights and sounds, and kick back with friends over a decent meal. I'd skip desert at the restaurants and stop into the Java Cafe (24 hours) for a pastry or Haagen Daaz (open until 11 p.m.). Either one will be easier on the wallet and likely be more satisfying. In sum, the Gaylord Palms is an experience in and of itself. For someone who has never been here before, I'd say 2 or 3 nights is ideal. 1 night is not enough, even for someone who has been there before...I never wanted to leave, and the 5-star Hyatt Grand Cypress is, in my opinion, a much lesser hotel than the Gaylord Palms.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cStay here, you'll love it\u201d", "Author": "carpediemnyc", "ReviewID": "UR10151526", "Content": "Loved it!

It's very impressive (palm trees, orchids, ferns, etc.) and very well-maintained, and I liked the alligators and fish in all the water features. My room was in the corner where the St. Augustine section meets the Everglades area, and that was nice - I had the warm colors of the St. Augustine room (which was great, since the hotel follows standard Florida practice of being arctic in its air conditioning) and the beauty of the Everglades area (also, proximity to the adult pool.) There's a printed walking tour of the atrium available from the concierge, and that's fun if you've got spare time. Make sure to ride the glass elevators, especially the everglades one, for a full view. The pools are impressive - the adult only pool is huge, and heated and peaceful, with plenty of lounge chairs and tables, and an enormous cabin-like building containing the best hotel towels I've ever seen, actually large enough to use as wraparound towels. The little poolside (actually, just outside the main entrance to the pool) was rarely open, but I did see employees bringing people food from the H20 grill, which is a bit further away. Also beside the pool entrance was one of those big water dispensers, crammed full of ice and sweating mightily in the sun. The water was always ice cold. There are cabanas near the pool, but they're a bit set off and nobody seemed to use them; maybe they're there for functions. Speaking of which - the adult pool had two main gates, and the second one (nearest my room) seemed to have a permanent sign \"Pool will be closed from 8am-2pm for private function\" but there never was one; the pool was always open and I never saw a function. The pool is swim-at-your-own-risk, and open 24 hours. The children's pool appeared to be under construction; it was open but the octopus slide was blocked, and that general area was being worked on. The steakhouse is very expensive, but delicious steaks. The seafood place did a very nice cheeseburger and flavored iced tea. And having a Haagen-Dazs in the hotel was fun. The room service is quick and useful, available 24 hours, and expensive. The pizza's gummy, but the fries are good (I believe they were both from H2O). There are snacks available in a sort of general store near the walkway over to the conference center. This is a well-equipped store with snacks, sodas, (if you're a Pepsi fan, it's all Coke products), business products, magazines, gift items, etc. There's a little boutique nearby that has upscale gifts. There's also a couple of clothing stores, and a Disney store where you can buy theme park tickets and souvenirs. The transportation lobby has a Hertz rental desk, handy for when you snap and realize that you have to get off-property before you go stir crazy, and a Universal Theme Parks rep who can sell you tickets to that set of parks, and give you tips about the shuttles. There are free shuttles to Disney, Universal and Sea World. They are handy because the cab fares are atrocious. Also atrocious is the hotel's parking situation; I have no problem paying for parking in the city, but I am amazed that a hotel in the middle of nowhere, whose nearest neighbors are a herd of beef cattle and a highway, actually charges people to park. They do take wonderful care of the property, and I suppose it makes the place more secure to monitor parking. A few additional points - the snakes mentioned elsewhere are in a few well-fastened aquariums in the little 'shack' structure in the Everglades section of the atrium. This area also has the baby alligator display, and they're cute when they're little. The hotel's grounds are beautiful and ferociously kept up, and the whole place looks very nice. The details were a little shabbier. The room safe didn't work, and took a lot of maneuvering for the hotel to fix. Two lamps in my room had electricity problems, and when I was doing a pre-checkout sweep under the beds, I found a child's toy, a mini candy bar, and several other objects clearly left by previous inhabitants. The TV cabinet/bureau had a crack in it. Mostly, though, it was a nice place. The empty minifridge was great, you can fill it with whatever you buy outside to keep from eating out every meal (there's a Super Target a few miles down 192, so if you have a rental car, go get supplies; their Cuban bread is excellent) and the in-room computer and internet access was fantastic. I wish all hotels came with a free internet-ready computer.

Parking at $12 is ridiculous- even if you park there for an hour, it is still $12. That is an absolute ripoff.

We were told that there were no king rooms available that night but that they might be able to move us to a king room the following day. A coworker checked in a couple of hours after us and he received a king room. He was traveling alone! The bedspreads in our room had a hole in it, the carpets were stained and the ceiling fan (a nice touch, if you don\u2019t turn it on) was covered in dust. We were very disappointed in the room. Although the valet service was competent, there was no one to help us to our room with 6 pieces of luggage. There didn\u2019t seem to be enough staff. There were a lot of little things that were irritating, but not quite big enough to complain about. Also, if you want a room facing the interior with a little balcony--it is $40. extra. The restaurants are very expensive and the coffee house made Starbucks look cheap! $2.50 for a regular cup of bad coffee! Also, our room wasn\u2019t cleaned until 4:00 in the afternoon. I saw the maid in the hall at around 10:30, so I took my book and went and found a nice place to read, I had lunch, shopped a little, came back at 2:00 and NO clean room. So, I waited in the room, reading and watching TV --the maid didn\u2019t show up until 4:00. That was totally unacceptable to me! One of our restaurant reservations got screwed up and the host actually had the nerve to act as if it might be our fault!

Pros-we were moved to a king room the next day, the room was much cleaner, and bigger, it had an awesome shower and clean carpet, however the ceiling fan was still dusty! We had a corner room with 2 windows which was great for the light. There was a computer in the room, a refrigerator and a safe, also an iron and ironing board and a coffee maker. Those amenities are important to me. There a handful of little boutique type gift shops, watch the prices though, you can find most of the items at the local malls for less money. Speaking of malls\u2014if you are a shopper there are a couple of fantastic malls within minutes of the hotel, there is also an outlet mall, but the weather was so hot and humid we waited until evening when it was a little cooler to visit it. All in all for a hotel of this size and caliber, I expected better customer service--you kind of feel that once they get you there\u2014you\u2019re on your own. Everything is over priced and you just don\u2019t get that warm fuzzy feeling. The d\u00e9cor is a little Disney/cheesy but it\u2019s OK. I liked the waterfalls, koi and baby alligators.

Hey, it's Orlando - relax and enjoy the play-acting! Noise is not much of an issue as all entertainment is ended at 10pm, unless your room was right over one of the restaurants, I suppose.

My boyfriend had a convention to attend and I was happy to tag along for a few days of relaxation. Wow, this place is huge. It feels like it's its own little city, if that makes sense. We were greeted by the valet staff, who were very friendly and welcoming. They examined our rental car for any dents or scratches before parking it - few hotels do this, but I think it's a really good idea. Linda, the young girl at the front desk checked us in and was just lovely. We asked about paying for an upgrade, and at first she was going to put us in the Key West section of the hotel. Then she thought about it for a minute, and excused herself to go talk with the manager. She told us she was given approval to instead give us a suite in the St. Augustine section. It turns out that I'm soooo glad she did this because I hear the Key West rooms are decorated in loud/bright colors and are located in a noisier section of the hotel. I liked the St. Augustine color schemes - dark and subdued. We took the elevator up to our room on the 7th floor, and at first I was very nervous because it was located RIGHT next to the elevator. Rooms near the elevator are normally the loudest, with people getting on and off all night. However, the way this room is set up is perfect because the living room area of the suite is what faces closest to the hallway, and the bedroom is tucked far away so you don't hear anything! I'm a very light sleeper and extra sensitive to noise (drives me crazy!) and we barely heard a peep during our 3 nights here. Also, the room stays very dark with the curtains closed - great for sleeping in. (We refered to the bedroom as \"the cave.\") Our suite was huge! It could have easily fit 4 people, comfortably. The bedroom had 2 balconies overlooking the atrium area of the hotel. Our bed was really comfortable and had a nice desk with computer, (included in the $10 resort fee) lounge chair, closet and refrigerator. Bathroom was a good size with nice \"stone\" tiled shower (no bath tub) and two sinks. The living area was huge also, with a dining room table, couch, coffee table, sink and another refrig. We spent no time in it, unfortunately. I loved the fact that they had an \"adults only pool!\" No, that doesn't mean it was topless, ha ha. It means that anyone who uses it needs to be over 18. This avoids lots of little kids running around, splashing, etc. for those adults who want to relax and have some quiet time. Don't worry, the kiddies have their own pool complete with a cool dragon slide - thingy. Drink service at the pool was a bit slow, but they were busy with the convention going on. The gator pond they have in the atrium of the hotel was very cool! There were different types of turtles and koi fish, as well. Very fun to watch and take pics. Yes, you will pay a LOT to eat and drink at this hotel. Our first night, we ate at the sports bar because we were tired from our flight and just wanted something quick. We each had 2 cocktails, shared a cheese and mushroom pizza (tasted no better than a $5 microwave pizza, by the way) and a shrimp salad, and our bill with tip was just over $90! Very spendy and not good quality. No atmosphere either, unless you count the numerous t.v.'s blaring in the background. A large vanilla latte at the coffee shop was almost $6. Absurd!!! And their idea of \"large\" appears to be a little off...Looked more like a medium to me. We ate a couple of lunches and dinners catered by Gaylord because of the convention. Food was good, not wonderful. Nice salads and dessert selection, but most of the foods that were supposed to be hot, were consistently NOT. All employees we encountered were friendly and a few of them really went above and beyond what you would expect. Overall, I did enjoy the Gaylord but was ready to leave after 3 days. The place is just so huge, and the fact that you are enclosed in glass, \"Biosphere style,\" can be a bit much to take after awhile.

Unfortuantely we had to share rooms, but that's how life is when you work for a small company. My first reaction of this hotel upon arrival was \"wow- it's huge\". For those who dislike large, you'll definitely hate this place. Parking was kind of a nightmare here - the parking lot is huge, and they charge you $10 and change per day even if you're a guest. I think that's kind of rediculous considering this is a 4-star hotel with plenty of parking spaces. I ended up being blocked out of the main lot by a line of cars waiting to exit, so I had to park near the convention center, which was a 10-minute walk to the front desk. Check-in was fine, although it took a while for the front desk clerk to find my name among all of my co-workers. The front desk was very well staffed with what appeared to be 10+ agents. There was no wait at 4PM on a Sunday, and the clerk was friendly. The hotel rooms are divided into four themed sections. Our room was in the Key West area, which featured bright carpeting, comforters, and the like. Because we had asked for a rollaway bed for our third roommate, the front desk assigned us to an \"oversized\" room, which definitely was a good size. However, the room overlooked the parking lot and roof, while most of my other co-workers got balcony rooms overlooking the atrium (definitely request an atrium-view room). I saw some rooms in the St. Augustine-themed section, and they were more tastefully decorated. The colors were more subdued and made the atmosphere more luxurious as opposed to the loud colors in the Key West rooms. At any rate, the rooms were nice - of Hilton caliber - but not any better. Our bathroom had a door between the dressing area/sinks and the shower room. The bed was comfortable although the pillows were very flat. One nice feature was the computer with internet connection - free of charge courtesy of your $10 resort fee. Vending machines don't take cash, so be sure to bring your room key. As for facilities, this is a great place for a convention. The atrium is huge and has many restaurants and bars to spend time (and money) at. If you happen to be travelling for business, you'll enjoy the selection, and make sure to charge your dinner/beverages to your expense account! Anyone else on leisure travel, prepare to spend a pretty penny for pretty much anything. A slice of key lime pie came to $7, for example. If you happen to be visiting Orlando for the theme parks, do not stay here unless you have a car. Despite the shuttle service to the parks, the hotel is somewhat isolated, and nothing is within walking distance. Restaurants and stores are a 5-minute ride by car. Int'l Drive is fairly close and the parks are a few exits down I-4. In closing, I'd say that this hotel is large, impersonal, and pretentious, and does not entirely live up to its wow factor. The rooms are good, the service is good, but the price is high and they get you for loads of fees and add-on costs. Because of those drawbacks, I would not give it an excellent rating; however, I don't think many people would find fault with much else at the Gaylord Palms.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patchogue, NY", "Title": "\u201cOkay experience\u201d", "Author": "lvgiants10", "ReviewID": "UR8520104", "Content": "Booked this hotel for 4 nights on Priceline at a rate of $95 per night.

We were finally checked in and were given an option of upgrading to an atrium view room for $30 per night more. We declined to do this and were given a Florida view room in the St. Augustine section on the 5th floor. We go up to the room, open the door and are completely overwhelmed by the smell of smoke. I called down to the front desk and they sent someone up to the room with an ionizer which would require us to be out of the room for at least an hour and a half. So back down to the front desk we go to say that we would like to upgrade to an atrium view room. This apparently was a bother for them as 5 employees stood around discussing it for 15 minutes before we were assigned another room in the Key West section. Not sure what the fuss was about, we were paying for the upgrade, not getting it for free. We move all the luggage over to the new room which does not smell like smoke and has a balcony that looks out into the indoor atrium. The Key West section is loud because of the music they have at night, but that was nothing compared to the loud colors on the bedspreads. They were enough to give me a headache. These have to be the worst decorated hotel rooms I have ever seen. I've seen pictures of the other sections and those rooms seem to be much more subdued. Okay, enough complaining! I rated this hotel 3 stars so surely there must have been good things, right? Indeed there were. Valet parking was expensive but so worth it. They were prompt and friendly and remembered our names after the first night. One of the good things about Gaylord is the free in room computer. What a fabulous idea!! You can request your car from the valet right on the computer and tell them what time you would like it to be there. I can't tell you how much time that saved. The restaurant/bar in the Key West area was also very good. We ate there twice and enjoyed it. The hotel could definitely benefit from having a Starbucks there as good coffee is sorely missing. The indoor atrium is truly stunning and we thoroughly enjoyed walking around looking at everything. The novelty wore off after 4 days, but it's certainly worth seeing. We especially enjoyed the Everglades area. I thought the pools were nice, but being that there were only two for a resort this size was a bit odd. They should take a page out of the JW Marriott Grande Lakes and put in a more elaborate pool area. The hotel had some lovely shops that were actually quite impressive. One of the best hotel shopping experiences I have had. For you Vera Bradley lovers out there, they have an outstanding collection in two different stores. There are vending machines on each floor and the only form of payment they accept is room keys so make sure you bring your key if you are planning on getting any sodas. They do give you two waters each day in your hotel room fridge which is a nice touch. Overall, my stay had glimpses of excellence, but the check in experience along with the incredibly rude front desk staff left a bad impression that was hard to shake. I might stay there again if I was able to get a good rate. One last thing...if you are going to stay here, you need a car. No ifs,ands or buts about it.

Following is my experieance at this hotel. I ordered room service which they gaurantee delivery in 30 mins or the food is complimentary. Each time I placed my order I was told it would take up to 90 min and the print ad could not be enforced because they are letting me know in advance. However each time the food was delivered cold and late based on the time promised for delivery almost 30 mins late each time. The food is terrible, you would find better breakfast with friendly service at McDonalds. The room was not cleaned properly each day of my stay they kept on throwing away bottled water and food which was placed in the fridge. However I found hot dogs in the room safe which was not cleaned from prior guests. I did not feel like using the safe and I ended up caring my computer for my entire stay. The pillow and the blanket had a smell of vomit which was not changed through out my stay upon several request. I wanted to move to another hotel close by but they would not refund my deposit of $200. The front desk told me I would be getting a king bed as promised when confirming the reservation, to my surprise I got double bed. Upon calling the desk to change the room I was told hotels is sold out and that all king beded rooms was occupied, however my co worker who came hours later was put into a king room.

There is a resort fee, and it covers bottled water in the room (a plus to take to the pool), transportation to the theme parks, Internet service on the room computer, etc. Regarding the transportation to the parks: my friend and I were starting late afternoon and wanted a ride to the Magic Kingdom, literally a few miles down the road. We were told it would take over an hour to get there because the bus stops everywhere else first. We opted for other transportation! The hotel itself is fun to walk around; there are baby gators and beautiful plant life throughout. There is a useful 24 hour food shop for snacks and beverages and a dueling piano bar if you're looking for a place to unwind on the premises. We sat on the outside patio and relaxed / had a nice time. I thoroughly enjoyed the adult pool and the spa! I had a great aromatherapy facial and the spa facilities were excellent. Definitely a nice way to spend the day! I requested a room in the Everglades section so we wouldn't have to trek our stuff all over the large hotel (the Everglades section houses the adult pool and the spa, so our destinations were very close). I agree with other reviewers that they shouldn't charge $10 for parking when the lot is huge and they have so much property. The hotel was busy when we stayed, so we had to self-park clear across the universe, which can be annoying with all your luggage.

I was able to get an extra large room with 2 beds since they didn't have any more king beds, and it had tons of space. Closet space and drawer space was perfect. The bathroom is seperate from the double sink area, very nice for getting ready in the morning. One of the best parts was the housekeeping.

Anyway, if you press the clean room button and leave, they clean it in a half hour. I thought that was great, since I had to go back and forth from the convention. Were the rooms anything special (besides a few nice perks)? No, but it was clean, and warm. ALL the restaurants were very good. All had a nice unique atmosphere depending on the location inside this place (Key West, Everglades, St. Augustine). Was the food a little over priced? Yes...They are all expensive, but for the most part worth it. Sunset Sam's in the Key West area was the best in my opinion. Great fun with all the side shows, and REALLY great fish. Crab Cakes and Lobster were superb. Pools were booth nice. One for the kids the other for adults. Convention space is huge and easy to get back and forth to and from your room. Shops were very nice and you can get Diseny tickets at the Diseny Store. The PGA Store has great prices on clothing. 24 hour market place to get food late, and GREAT Cuban sandwitches.

The price we got was $189/night. I checked on-line with the hotel website, priceline and expedia the day before we left and it was the exact same price. Getting there: Since we live several states away, my husband and children and I flew to Orlando and took a car service (Happy Limo) which is only slightly higher than a cab and yet so much more luxurious. It takes away the stress of navigating and they throw in this bonus: a free 15-minute stop at a grocery store. They will even tell you which one is most convenient so that you can fax an order the day before you leave, then on your way to the hotel just pick it up! Why not take advantage of the free fridge the hotel gives you? So, we picked up some bottled water and snacks, what a savings when you compare what those same items cost at theme parks/hotel! (Note: MCO Orlando's main airport is only about 20 minutes from the hotel. Sanford is about an hour away.) Check in: Went smoothly. They honored every request. My husband does not like bright yellow or pink, it is hard for him to relax with loud colors so we avoided the Key West hotel rooms and were assigned to the Everglades section of the hotel where the decor was more subtle and restful. This hotel is quite large but directions were clear and everything well-marked. The room: It was clean and smelled fresh. It was perfect for the four of us. We requested a Florida view so that we could see the fireworks from Epcot at night. Right below the view was of the parking lot, but we were on the fifth floor so mostly our view was of Epcot from afar. Closet space and drawer space was plentiful for the four of us. The bathroom is seperate from the double sink area, very nice for getting ready in the morning. The room was a good size, no complaints! We were traveling to relax and found plenty to do over the long weekend at the hotel. There are two pools, one that is adults-only and the other, busier pool for families. The pool has an octupus-slide that was a lot of fun! It also has zero-entry and the little kids and their parents liked that! I will advise you parents to bring your own pool toys since they charge for theirs at the pool. I just brought a blow-up beach ball and inner tube and the kids had a blast playing with them! I will also warn that in the summer the area has \"lovebugs\" . That is what they are called. They don't bite and they didn't come near the water, but if you sat on the chairs by the pool you would notice them. Also, the hotel has a spa, an arcade (our children loved playing air hockey) and there are lots of scenic areas to the hotel. We had an employee take our picture as a family and are glad we did. This is a great incentive for weddings to book here. There is a wedding pavillion over the \"fountain of youth\", waterfalls, koi fish, lush foliage, bridges...all well-maintained and little benches tucked into the nooks to read or just sit and admire the beauty. The longer you look, the more you will notice. We began to notice a real banana tree and flowers that were shaped into the form of a bird. Our children also liked exploring the fort and a small area of the Everglades with turtles, snakes and an alligater! The alligaters in the main part of the atrium are fed nightly at 6:30. Theme parks: Gaylord Palms will shuttle you for free to Disney. Their buses are well-marked, air-conditioned, comfortable, clean and the driver was funny and knowledgable. (When you factor in the shuttles and in-hotel entertainment options, it doesn't seem as expensive!) The schedule is printed out for your convenience near the concierge. The shuttle leaves about every hour and a half. While I think that is pretty good for a non-Disney hotel, if you have come to the Gaylord Palms to go to the theme parks every day, I think you are in the wrong place. Disney hotels are comparable in price and their shuttles leave every 15 minutes and are much, much closer to the gate. (That may sound lazy, but after walking ALL DAY with your kids, it is a big deal.) If you want to visit Disney only one day then you could just peek at the schedule and plan around it. Serious fans of the Mouse will be annoyed at how long it takes to get to the parks (Magic Kingdom is furthest and you would want to be there early since the park is opened in a special way. Also, crowds are lowest the first hour the park is open.) So, consider transportation but remember that at the end of your Disney day if you don't want to waste your precious vacation time waiting for the shuttle you can do what we did and just take a cab back to the hotel for $20! Dining Options: You probably have heard about the $8 hot dogs at the pool, or the $28/ person buffet. We ate them and the food was fresh and tasted good. We especially enjoyed the Italian buffet because it was fresh, plenty of options- a bar for salads, a bar of appetizers, a bar for freshly carved meat, pasta made-to-order and a dessert bar. The atmosphere was classy with candles and low lights. Adding to the romantic atmosphere is a roving musician that serenades the guests. My husband and I loved this darling man playing his guitar and singing us a love song. Then my husband tipped him to come back and sing another one. Wonderful experience! We also ordered pizza one night to help our budget. For those on a tight budget, while you are putting in your order at the grocery store, just add on peanut butter and jelly, bread, paper plates and milk and that will help a lot! For lunch one day we took the hotel shuttle to the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. At this entrance there is also an entrance to Disney's Monorail. (Make sure you don't go into the theme park, you want to go to the Monorail!) The Monorail is free to everyone and it stops at Disney's Grand Floridian (they have many dining options including an afternoon tea. This hotel is Victorian and beautiful!! Outside just walk around the pools, stop and get a drink near the pool then walk around their white sand beaches and enjoy the view! They are plenty of beautiful spots to sit down and relax.) , Disney's Contemporary Resort, and Disney's Polynesian Resort. We ate lunch at the Polynesian's Kona Cafe, they have a chocolate torte for dessert that is sooo yummy! Sure, it isn't much cheaper at Disney than at the Gaylord Palms, but it is a change of scenery and opens up your options. We think it is neat to see what these hotels offer and their theming is pretty neat, too! Overall, we had a great time. The hotel was beautiful. There was plenty to do over a long weekend. Bring your camera. I would recommend this hotel for families that want a quiet weekend to swim and unwind, honeymooners, seniors.

I endured doors slamming every few seconds day and night, girls runnning and screaming through the halls nonstop, groups congregating outside my door tossing a ball against my door and cheering. At first security did basically nothing and said \"oh well, the cheerleaders are here\". After two nights I was ready to abort my vacation (this hotel was prepaid for me so I was stuck) and go home. I went to the desk and initially the staff gave me the party line \"we can't move you, there aren't any rooms where the kids aren't\" but then took pity on me and moved me to a suite in the area of the hotel where the \"staff\" for the convention stayed. Why they didn't automatically put people uninvolved in the convention there in the first place is beyond me. It was like trying to relax in the middle of a loud sporting event day and night. It was hard to enjoy ANY of the amenities of the hotel. Once I moved and once the cheerleaders left, I was able to finally relax, enjoy the pool (they returned the adults only pool to adults only half way through my stay) and jacuzzi.

I\u2019m an early riser and if you have a balcony room you get to see the cleaning that goes on while everyone is sleeping. One thing I love is that they wipe down every handrail in the place on a daily basis. The food here was quite expensive and I was fortunate to have driven here. I had a real bad fish sandwich by the pool the wife and kids had nachos and cheese sticks, a few beers and a couple of Cokes. $76! I swear the fish I had was a frozen Gordon\u2019s breaded fish filet on a bun. Not having ate in the other restraints in this hotel I can\u2019t tell you if the prices are worth it or not but you can get a great dinner anywhere for $25 a plate. This place does not have any businesses in walking distant so your pretty much trapped here and forced to eat their high priced meals. Unless you drove or have a rental car, but I\u2019m sure most are there for a conference (Like we were) and it\u2019s going on the company\u2019s tab. I couldn\u2019t even justify someone else paying for it and we always went out. Nashville was a little better in the food department. That was a couple of years ago though and it could have changed. Like others said, the stores were nice to look at but to pricey. Others complained about the noise but we never had a problem. We slept with the doors open every night we were there (Wednesday through Saturday and left Sunday). No parties no band, just the soothing sounds of waterfalls. The bed were better than average, but I\u2019ve had better. The bath area was big with double sinks ceramic tile floors. There was plenty of coffee, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, refrigerator but no microwave. No way to heat up your leftovers, so you have to go buy more food, no doggy bags. There were also plenty of wooden hangers a safe for valuables and internet access. You have a password protected computer in your room that only you can access. There are personal greetings from the hotel as well as the conferences you\u2019re attending. All of your meetings are easily accessible and each meeting you click on brings up a map from your room to the room the meeting will be in. This was a real neat fetcher and very convenient. One thing that was a little concerning was all of the solicitations we received at our room. Walking down the hall you could see that these were conference related solicitations and only targeted to people attending the conference. These were not place on ever door but it made me wonder who was doing this and how much information did they have about who was in the room. I forgot to ask about this before I left at 5:00AM. To busy loading up the car. To sum it all up, this hotel was pricey, but clean. If you\u2019ve never seen one of these huge floral, jungles inside a huge atrium I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be impressed. If you are in the area take a look inside (pay parking) you may be sold just looking at it.

We booked the room on a \"name your own price\" website and were able to secure a room with a king size bed for Friday-Sunday for less than $100 a night. I would suggest following this avenue for anybody interested in staying at this property. The price I paid is about 1/3 of what the room would have normally cost. The check-in process was very easy. The gentleman at the desk was very cordial and extremely willing to help. This is, however, where I ran into the largest problem. The gentleman asked if I was parking with the valet or if I was self parking. I have no problem with parking myself, so I chose that option. You can park in a gated lot that requires a room key to access after hours. To my surprise, upon check-out I was charged $10 a day for self parking. I have paid for parking at a hotel before. But generally that would occur in a more urban setting. And was always notified ahead of time. The Gaylord Palms is off the highway surrounded by cow pastures. Literally! Charging hotel guests to park is beyond ridiculous. Because this occured upon check-out , it did not affect the actual trip. The room itself was very nice. Aside from the king size bed, the room featured a desk with an actual desktop computer for internet access. The bathroom was large and well thought out. My only complaint would be there is no fan in the bathroom. The amenities of the hotel are top notch. There are two outdoor pools; one for adults and one for children. Both are well maintained. The children's pool features a water slide and water cannons. The hot tub is also well maintained. Also the inside of the hotel is designed to feel like three different areas of Florida; St. Augustine, Key West and the Everglades. All of are very pleasing and feature live animals. There are multiple restaurants, shops and bars on the property. All of the restaurants are high priced, same with the bars. If you are staying on the property it is a good amenity to have. However, because of the location you are within driving distance of many, many restaurants and bars. My overall experience was great. The hotel has spent alot of money making it a top hotel in Orlando.

It is a fine conference hotel but I wouldn't elect to stay here for leisure travel. It is an impressive-appearing place inside and out; however the novelty of living inside a glass atrium bubble wears thin after a couple of days and you are captive without a car. There is much to see under the bubble for first-time visitors and I definitely recommend strolling each path through the themed areas of Key West, St. Augustine and the Everglades replete with lush area-appropriate foliage, fog machines, koi ponds, tropical fishponds, the castle, Sam's sailboat etc. It would be a terrific place for kids on a rainy day. Conference food was excellent -- it is hard to feed 1,000 people simultaneously and they do an outstanding job. The few times I purchased food or beverages I felt they were of excellent quality but pricey, e.g., $13 hamburger. I loved having internet access from my room and that was a huge plus. What I disliked about this hotel experience is the construction: flimsy walls between rooms so you hear your neighbors; economy-minded HVAC systems that turn off the air circulation fan; noise that carries from the atrium bubble and hallways into the guestrooms. If only they'd paid as much attention to construction as they did to landscaping; I guess this demonstrates why this hotel is run by Gaylord Entertainment Company and not the Gaylord Hotel Company. \"Florida View\" rooms are quieter but have no balconies and overlook expansive parking lots and highway. Staff are generally very accomodating. The Canyon Ranch Spa is a wonderful amenity. Onsite shops are average and carry souvenir and personal care basics. It was too cold to use the pool and jacuzzis during my recent stay but the facilities are lovely and add to the \"resort\" feel.

The Gaylord has complimentary shuttle service to the Disney parks and to Falcon's Fire golf course. The golf course \"shuttle\" is actually via a town car. If you are going to be at the hotel or just going back and forth to the theme parks then I would recommend that you hire a towncar to take you to and from the airport as it actually will end up being cheaper than renting a car and paying the Gaylord daily parking fee. Your driver will meet you at baggage claim and by the hotel when you leave and let him deal with traffic, tolls, and directions.The way to go. I arrived at 10:00 am on a Saturday, had to wait about three minutes in line before the courteous agent was able to check me in early to a requested room with an atrium view. I stayed in the St. Augustine section and it was a bit of a trek hauling my luggage to the room. The room itself was very nice with an upscale feel to it. As mentioned I had an atrium facing room with doors that opened onto an indoor balcony with two chairs. Yes, if you are a light sleeper an Atrium facing room may be too noisy otherwise you may notice some noise but it never was a bother. Room had a ceiling fan as well which I used and enjoyed. King sized bed, chair, desk and work chair, good sized tv, and a computer with hotel info and internet access comprised the room. A refigerator was underneath the TV and had rom to store some drinks, snacks, leftovers, etc. The bathroom had a double sink vanity with enough room, hairdryer, coffee maker, and a variety of toiletries. No bath but rather a very nice tiled shower, actually one of the nicest hotel showers I have ever experienced. Large towels were very nice. The $10 dollar resort fee gets you 2 bottles of water replenished daily in your fridge and a daily paper as well as access to the gym. The gym was a decent size with about 7 treadmills, 3 or 4 bikes and 3 or 4 ellipticals along with a variety of weight machines and free weights. There also is a small area for classes but I think there is a separate fee for those. Two large pools, sand volleyball, a fancy putt-putt (extra fee), rounded out the recreation options. Other than conference food, which was the best conference food I have had, I ate at two of the restaurants. Sunset Sam's is a seafood themed restaurant which I enjoyed. $45 for two drinks and my entree, and tip. I also ate in the bar at the Old Hickory steakhouse. $35 for a drink and two appetizers.

My husband, five year old son and myself stayed at the Gaylord Palms February 7-9th. We had a great time, and there was tons to do. I have nothing negative to say at all about the hotel. Check in was a breeze and then we drove to the Key West parking to leave our car ($10+tax a day fee.) We got a little lost on our way to the room- the hotel is that big, they even give you a map when you check in. Our room was in the St. Augustine section, a suite on the 7th floor. What can I say- it was gorgeous. The suite was immaculate and very tastfully decorated. We had a livingroom/sitting area, dining table with seats for 8, computer station, wet bar with fridge, 2 balconies, bedroom, and bathroom with separate toliet/shower area. The room was VERY comfortable and we could really spread out. The couch pulled out so my son could sleep there and my husband and I had some privacy with our own bedroom. There was a tv in the bedroom and living room, DVD player too. At the hotel there is a daily resort fee of $10+tax. This included internet, 2 bottles of Dasani water, paper delivery, and use of the fitness club, etc... The bed was very, very comfortable and clean. I am a germaphobe and I felt right at home. In the bathroom they give you nice toiletries: soaps, body lotion, shampoo & conditioner, and an amenity kit. They are replenished daily. There was no tub, but the shower was roomy with a built in bench which was nice. Some people have complained about noise but I honestly have no idea what they are talking about. It was very quiet in the room. The hotel itself has so much to see. My son and I would take a walk around in the afternoon while my husband napped. While we were there they we doing work to the family pool so it was closed. It looked great though, it has some sort of octopus slide and a sand play area. This is also where the kids club is. There is another pool, the south beach pool, which is normally for adults but since the other pool was closed everyone could go there. It was very nice, reminicent of the pools at the Delano or the National hotel in South Beach. It was heated just enough so we were able to go in, there are also 2 hot tubs. I didn't use the spa or fitness club so I can't comment but they looked very nice and I noticed the fitness club offered classes like yoga and pilates at certain times. The hotel is designed into different areas that you walk through on your way around the hotel. Each area has it's own theme and restaurants. The Key West area is very colourful with wooden decks and beautiful sand scupltures around a big water area that even had a very large boat in it (it's a bar) every evening they have performers around just like at Mallory square, a few times a week in the afternoon they feed the fish. The Everglades area is something to see. There are little streams and flora and fauna everywhere, it's even a little foggy. In the evening little lights come on that look like fireflies. There is also a little shack ( make sure you go inside) that has tanks with snakes, turtles, baby gators and I think frogs. It's great for kids, don't miss it. Twice or three times a week (in gator springs) thay have gator feedings which is also fun for the kids to watch. My son loved it. The St. Augustine area has a scaled down replica of Castillo de Morro. It's fun to walk around in there, there are little ponds all around with Koi. In the Emerald area there are shops and it leads to the convention center. It's a beautiful hotel to walk around and there are plenty of places to sit.

I found this hotel very reasonably priced for a decent resort \u2013 averaging $249 USD a night for our atrium view room in the Saint Augustine section. The service at the hotel was very good. We called from the airport at 7.30 AM to see if we could get a super-early check in after our redeye from the West Coast and they went out of their way to have a room ready for our arrival an hour later. Check in itself was extremely expeditious. During our stay we had a problem with housekeeping, but as soon as we complained, management dealt it with very quickly and courteously. It seemed as though all of the staff members was very committed to high service standards. The atrium was beautiful, and I enjoyed walking around the pathways, checking out the baby alligators etc. We didn\u2019t try any of the restaurants in the hotel as the only one that looked appealing to us (the Old Hickory Steakhouse) was booked up during our stay. The main casual restaurant was buffet only, and we\u2019re not really buffet people. There was also a casual caf\u00e9, but all of their food was made elsewhere and sold as packaged sandwiches etc., and that is not really our thing either. An informal family style restaurant where you could get a quick sandwich or salad would have been appreciated. For a hotel as large as the Palms is, I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t have one. The only really tempting option was the Ben & Jerry\u2019s sundae shop, and we managed to resist. But only barely.

We were \"upgraded\" to a Double room - Atrium View. We stayed in the St Augustine wing - Room 6119. This is, without a doubt, the NOISIEST hotel I have ever stayed at! We had to sleep in earplugs due to the blaring music and bass coming from the Christmas shows and other random noise in the atrium. It actually vibrated the french doors that led out onto the balcony overlooking the atrium! We had flown all day, and were very tired. Plus, my wife is pregnant. My wife called to complain, and the person who answered the phone was very short. He said, \"Well, the shows will be over by 10:00 pm.\" Not much solace to someone who wants to take a nap or is worn out from traveling or spending all day at the theme parks! There are NO rubber gaskets around the door frames that lead out onto the balcony overlooking the atrium. In fact, we could see about 1inch of daylight under the doors! The glass in the french doors themselves is just single pane - not double pane. While I will say that we both loved the Christmas decorations throughout the atrium, if we hear one more rendition of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" I think we will pull our hair out! The property needs to invest some capital in soundproofing the Atrium view rooms. We visited some friends who were staying in rooms NOT facing the atrium (Florida View). Those rooms had no outside noise problem. The last night, after spending 13 hours at Epcot, we arrived back to the hotel at 10:00 pm - dreading our flight the next morning. Before we even approached the door to our room, we could hear yelling sounds coming down the hallway. It was the sound of about 4 guys yelling at a football game on the TV in the room adjoining ours! Once in our room, we could hear every word they said. Again, we were worn out and just wanted to get some rest We called the front desk, and were told security would be up to talk to them. Again, there was no sound proofing around the door between our two rooms. We could actually see their lights on coming from underneath the connecting doors! At 2:00 am, they finally turned out the lights and went to sleep. Finally, the towels were less than luxurious for a supposed 4 star hotel.

Our check in was anytime after 3:00 p.m. so we arrived at 6:00 p.m. to start our four day New Year's vacation. Within \"just a few minutes\" our car was unpacked and taken off to the valet parking lot (at a rate of $17.00 per day). After \"just a few minutes\" of waiting in a terribly long line at the check in counter, due to a terribly understaffed reception desk, we were assured that our room would be ready in \"just a few minutes\" and we would be called on our cellphone. After wandering around the hotel atrium (which after 4 visits is not as terribly impressive as the first time you see it) for over an hour with no call, we returned to the front desk to see what was taking so terribly long. There, after waiting \"just a few more minutes\" for a second time in a similarly terribly long line, the terribly exasperated young man at the reception desk assured us that it would \"just be a few minutes\" more and we would be finally called. After \"just a few more minutes\" than that, we finally got our room. When I informed the young man that we had checked in our luggage at the bellmen's station ($10.00 tip) \"just a few minutes\" after our arrival, but well over an hour earlier, he assured us that a bellmen would bring our bags up to our room in \"just a few minutes\". Within \"just a few minutes\" walk across the lovely atrium gardens, we finally arrived at our 7th floor suite (7331) in the Emerald Bay section (at a cost with tax of over $300.00 per day). Every call to the bellmen's desk was answered with the response \"your luggage will be there in 'just a few minutes' \". We patiently waited for 45 minutes and then left wearing our same travel clothes, since our luggage had yet to arrive in our room as promised, and we had dinner reservations in the hotel restaurant in \"just a few minutes\" at 8:00 p.m. We arrived after \"just a few minutes\" stroll across the replica of the \"Castillo de San Marco\" at the picturesque mock sailboat floating Sunset Sam's Restaurantat promptly at 8:00 p.m., only to be told that our reserved table was not available, but if we would go wait in their bar section it should be available in \"just a few minutes\", and our beeper would vibrate and flash. The four of us proceeded to the neat looking bar where we each ordered a drink. Since I was terribly disappointed at having to wait for a reserved table I had two single malt scotches. Within \"just a few minutes\" we had spent $80.00 for two rounds each but since we had neither felt any vibrations nor seen any flashes, we proceeded to order appetizers at the bar. Even though we were assured by the nice bartender that it would only \"take a few minutes\" to get our three plate tower of cold seafood (at a cost of $40.00) the order didn't arrive until we were taken to our table over one hour after our reservation time and \"just a few minutes\" before our entrees arrived at the table. When we saw bread on all of the nearby tables other than our own, we inquired of our waitress if we could get some for ourselves. She returned to our table after \"just a few minutes\" only to tell us that they had run out of bread \"just a few minutes\" earlier. We finished our meal and paid the terribly over-priced bill ($178.00) for the terrible service and returned to our room hoping for a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, to our terrible surprise instead of a restfull slumber, we were suddenly awakened \"just a few minutes\" after 8:00 a.m. to Christmas music blaring from loudspeakers. This terribly loud barrage of nonstop Christmas selections continued on all day until \"just a few minutes\" before 10:00 p.m. I never thought I would resent hearing Christmas carols like \"O Holy Night\" and \"Gingle Bells\", but after 10 or 12 hours of listening to this music blaring through our terribly poor sound proofed room, I felt like Manuel Noriega in Panama who had American rock and roll music blared into his hideaway until he finally surrendered to the American troops. I found myself aligning with the likes of Ebeneezer Scrooge, the Grinch and saying \"Bah Hum Bug!\" as the day progressed and the music continued unabated. Keep in mind that Christmas was five days earlier and we were on the eve of a New Year by the morning of the 31st. I was ready for Frank Sinatra's New York New York and Dick Clark 's Rocking New Year's Eve, but instead I got Andy Williams, the Chipmunks and Charlie Brown's Christmas for fourteen terrible consecutive hours! Even my kids complained when on the morning of January 1, they were awakened by the same terrible barrage of Christmas music \"just a few minutes\" after 8:00 a.m., when we had gone to sleep \"just a few minutes\" (relatively) earlier. Enough already with that crap. It was enough to convert me into a Jehovah's Witness. I tried to make it up to them but the $80.00 that it cost to see the ice display that took \"just a mere 10 minutes\" was a terrible disappointment. The next day I did salvage the vacation by treating everyone to the wonderful Canyon Ranch Spa, where a massage and a facial for the four of us set me back a mere $1000. The total hotel bill with brunch at the buffet and dinner at the quaint Old Hickory Steakhouse was a whopping $3100.00. So next time, \"just take a few minutes\", shop around, and ice this place from your list, because at a rate of nearly $1000 per day you can go to the Bellagio, a Ritz Carlton, or a Four Season and get terribly good service at a terribly reasonable price.", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, FL", "Title": "\u201cIce- don't waste your time!!!\u201d", "Author": "lsm112375", "ReviewID": "UR6510916", "Content": "Went to see the Ice exibit today.

It never ceases to amaze me how the same hotel can provide such mixed experiences, but here is my $.02... I have stayed in many Orlando hotels (the Peabody, Marriotts, Dolphin) for numerous reasons (company business trips, conventions, business+family), and I have to say that the experience at the Gaylord absolutely tops the list. First of all, the hotel is close to many attractions and great restaurants but isn't necessarily in the middle of everything. It feels like an oasis from a lot of the hustle and bustle that has come to define Orlando. For this reason, you really need a car to enjoy your stay here. We are admitted foodies and while the food at the hotel is great (for hotel food), we also like to eat at various restaurants around town as well as tour. A car is a must if you want that flexibility. I read that some people felt bound to the hotel without a car, and I can absolutely see how that would be true. The grounds of the hotel are absolutely immaculate, and one gets the sense of approaching a compound when you drive up. Self parking is located on either side of the hotel and once you get used to the swipe card system (swipe in and out to exit), it's no problem. Per the advice of many Tripadvisor travelers, I was very up front about my request for a quiet room as I was traveling with my family and wanted to ensure that we could all sleep when we wanted. I made this request when I made the reservation and followed it up when I was checking in. Our front desk representative more than accommodated us, placing us in the Everglades Wing on the 4th floor, about as far away as one can get from the live music at the bar/restaurant at the opposite end of the building. Our wing was an absolute oasis of quiet and calm throughout our stay. About my only complaint is that the walls are a little thin and the only noise that kept us up was our next-door neighbor watching \"Sex and the City\" on TV. As for the rooms, they are definitlely a notch above a Marriott hotel room. The $10/day resort fee includes high-speed Internet access, 2 bottles of Dasani water, admittance to the health club and other amenities. You'd pay $10/day just to get Internet access at a Marriott and not much else. The rooms are much larger than most hotels, and the toiletries are generous and high-quality. Housekeeping isn't afraid to provide plenty of towels, either, something we appreciated. The beds were extremely comfortable. From the expedient, friendly check-in to the clean, spacious rooms to the great food had at Villa de Flora (we ate Sunday brunch and a mid-week buffet dinner there), we were quite pleased with our stay at the Gaylord. I told my husband that the staff has taken a pagebook from Disney as their customer service was simply excellent. One night, I was dining alone at the Villa de Flora and told the hostess that I wanted a quiet seat for one. The manager overheard my request and personally took me to a quiet corner of the restaurant that was actually closed off so that I could enjoy some privacy and read my book. As for whether the hotel is appropriate for small children, our daughter absolutely loved walking around the interior of the hotel, marveling at the huge indoor palm trees, anxious to see the \"fireflies\" (small lights that dim like fireflies) at night on the first level and happy to visit the baby gators and the turtles on the second level. While there is a Ben and Jerry's within the hotel, the Villa de Flora has a Ben and Jerry's section in their dessert area, and that made her day. As for me, I can vouch that the Canyon Ranch Spa is fantastic and boasts the talents of an incredible neuromuscular masseur (Michael) who will soothe you with a tailored massage. While there is shuttle service to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, we opted to drive our car as we didn't want to be bound by shuttle schedules. The drive was short, and parking was easy. Having been to many Orlando hotels, I can say that our stay at the Gaylord Palms was so comfortable and enjoyable that we are already planning a return trip, this time with even more family members as we are convinced they would enjoy it as much as we did.

The hotel offered an early check in request which I requested but did not get. I wasn't able to check in until 10 minutes before 3 pm, and didn't get their promised call to my cell phone until after I had already checked in. My room had an overpoweringly toxic detergent/chemical odor. My respiratory/sinus system reacted immediately and I got sick. The room was also unclean. There were drips of dark dried liquid on the desk lamp; drips, dried-on sprays, and smears on the room walls and bathroom walls; and oily smears on the window. The hotel\u2019s website implied that my room might have an upgraded bathroom with separate granite shower and tub. In fact, there was NO bathtub in my room. It is unacceptable to me for a $293++ per night U.S. hotel to not provide a bathtub, and it is unacceptable to me for them not to mention that in the room description. I had nothing but trouble dealing with the staff. The front desk person argued with me, saying that there were windows I could open when there were not. She also told me there were no other rooms available, which was a lie, and made no apology or effort to help, so I said I would have to try to make a reservation somewhere else and check out. I had asked to talk to a manager and was told they were all unavailable. I began looking for a new hotel. The manager eventually called but didn't, nor did anyone ever come to the original room to check on what I was reacting to or experience the extreme odor. She asked if I wanted to think about changing the room (to an even less desirable room), and she asked if an hour would be enough time to decide, and I said yes. I decided to try and find a new hotel and, working as fast as possible, I began to make arrangements. Not five minutes later she called me again and with an irritated tone, asked if I had made a decision. She said I \u201cwas now holding up two rooms\u201d.

The Everglades section of the atrium is very restful with waterfall sounds and piped in cricket and bird noises. The restaurant in that area of the atrium, The Old Hickory steakhouse, is very calm with no entertainment. The Key West section is loud with Sunset Sam's restaurant entertainment and there is a piano bar that you can hear in the St. Augustine and Emerald Bay areas of the atrium.

This is by far the nicest hotel we have stayed in, in Orlando, much better that the Wilderness Lodge at Walt Disney World. Comfortable beds, lovely pool. If I was vacationing, with adults, I would have rated this above average. The hotel isn't geared for kids or the business traveler. It is more of a of a young adult, cruise ship atmosphere. Surf, turf, drinks with cute names. It is very, very, noisy, until about 1-2AM , due to the piano bar and other entertainment in the atrium. Bring your earplugs and you will be fine. If you aren't willing to use earplugs, stay elsewhere. The beds are really high and you have to climb in and out of them. If you aren't able to climb, stay elsewhere. If you can climb, the beds are great, really comfortable. The big drawback is the lack of a restaurant, with quality, everday food, such as soup, sandwiches,burgers, pasta or eggs and toast. The sort of food normally found in a coffee shop or diner. The resort has the Java Hut, which serves good coffee and a limited selection of bakery goods of very poor quality and truly bad, pre-made sandwiches. You can observe the frozen grocery store type bagels, being set out to defrost and based on the deflated and wrinkly appearance and freezer burn taste of the bagels, I would guess they had been frozen and defrosted several times. The average 7-11 offers more tempting fare. This was odd, becuase the remaining restaurants and room service serve much, much, better quality food. Unfortunately the remaining restaurants and room service, assume you are on vacation and can devote two or more hours to a huge, rich, meal and snooze by the pool to digest it all. The resort also assumes you have the metabolism of a 16 year old boy. Vegetables, fruit and grains are scarce and always cloaked in butter, whipped cream, cheese, or all three. I love rich decadant food, but three times a day for a week, without a break, is not appealing. The cooking style is very plain, hunk \"o\" meat, hunk \"o\" fish, starch and several sauces. Spaghetti would have been a real walk on the wild side.

The hotel is immediately across the street from the entrance to Disney's Animal Kingdom and around the corner from a road with many national chain restaurants, groceries, etc. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to all the Disney parks and Sea World -- we used it for the Magic Kingdom -- a tip for families with little ones -- the hotel shuttle is a bus that can take strollers without folding them up -- we had a double and so this beat driving ouselves for that very reason. We were very impressed with the property -- 5 acres under glass and -- key for July in Orlando -- all air conditioned!! Other reviewers below complained about noise -- we had an exterior facing room in the St. Augustine section and didn't notice any at all. Other reviewers said a number of the plants were fake in the atrium areas, but we didn't notice any - the running water and natual plants, walking paths, and sitting areas were a HUGE plus for this property in our view. Really unique. The kiddie pool is outside and also huge, clean, and wonderful. Another reviewer below mentioned it is a bit disconcertingly unsupervised and we'd agree with that, but if you keep your kiddies in sight everything should be fine -- nothing negative, just found ourselves worrying other folks kids might get hurt running on the pool deck or sliding down the water slide too close together-- the kiddie pool is huge and our two boys (2 and 4) loved the octopus waterslide and \"spitting\" sea horses. Also, the continuous entry side of the pool is nice for playing with infants we noticed. There is a nice adult pool on the other side of the property, but we didn't use it. There is a \"kidz camp\" -- we checked it out but our 2 year old is not fully potty trained so they would only take our 4 year old so we skipped it. It appeared to be supervised, but not adult guided play so I'm not sure it's quite as great as it's billed for little ones, but the 5-10 year olds inside it appeared to be having great fun. The hotel also offered in room babysitting, but at $28/hour for our two kids we decided to take a pass. The hotel's restaurants seemed to be high quality -- we ate at the Key West section boat restaurant and the fish was first rate and fresh. We didn't eat at the steak house or the italian restaurant but they both looked nice. Top prices, but the quality seemed to be there so probably worth it. We did order room service pizza and breakfast. Part of the problem of running an operation of this scale is our pizza arrived late and near burnt but still cold -- but it ended up free because all room service comes with a 30 minute guarantee so not worth any real complaint. The breakfast was ok -- a bit pricey for what you get and not particularly hot, but it did come on time. Surface parking is no problem at this hotel and we skipped the valet because we never had to park more than 5 or 6 rows from a hotel side entrance door. Linens in room are good. Carpet was clean but not new any more. Room furnishings are on par with a nice Hilton or Hyatt, or perhaps a notch better. All rooms have coffee makers, refrigerators and safes, which was nice. They forgot to clean our room one day, but quickly ran towels and coffee and toiletries to us and refused a tip. Again, small service glitches the hazard of running an operation of this size. There was a convention at the hotel and adjacent convention hall while we were there, but the hotel absorbs crowds so well we barely noticed it was there. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel, esp. for Orlando attractions family visitors -- it really couldn't be more convenient or much nicer than it actually is. Also, would recommend this hotel for family reunion functions -- everyone can come and go and get together -- really a nice place for such things. We bid on Priceline for resort and paid just under $100/night. Resort fee and self parking added about $25 per night (incl. tax). Well worth that price for sure. Probably worth anything up to about $200 -- might look at Ritz or a couple of other Orlando properties if going above that price.

Of course our kids were worn out from walking around Sea World all day, but I had to stuff my ears with tissue. Then at 5:30AM the fire alarm went off!!! We made our way down to the stairwell exit closest to our room in our pj's only to find the access door at the bottom was locked.

Other areas did seem noisy, adjacent to piano bar, and the sounds do stay inside the enclosure.. I'd strongly recommend the Glades section if you want atrium view. Room was clean, although mildew on shower curtain. I agree the parking and \"resort\" fee are big profit maker, but you know going in they will charge $20 per day. Pools were very nice. We ate at pool bar(H2o) on first day, prices were resonable. Ventured out to eat, make right onto International Drive down to 192(go left). Plenty of places, including decent breakfast buffet at Ponderosa for $ 3.99. Also, Publix right there for snacks water, etc. Food prices were actually good , compared to the Northeast. If you eat at the Gaylord, bring your wallet. Rental car was a good move. We did not take shuttle to parks, but I did inquire one day. After hotel operator put me on hold for ten minutes, she reported busses run at 90 minute intervals. Last thing you want after the parks, is more waiting. $9 per day at parks(can be used at all four).

Then you can get to anywhere you like fairly easily. The pools are nice, but for such a huge hotel, we thought they should have been bigger. The kids pool was crammed most of the time (Memorial Day weekend) and we also found it interesting, and perhaps disturbing, that kids were in the pool around the clock, seemingly without any parents checking on them.

We ordered extra towels and linens (via computer), which arrived within 15 minutes of our arrival. Likewise for razor and shaving cream later on in the week. Our only problem with the room were the electronic keys which were VERY picky, requiring multiple resets. The facilities were beautiful-- Pools, hot tubs, walkways, waterfalls, restaurants. I personally felt very safe and comfortable walking around alone at any time. Staff was friendly and helpful. The Gaylord Palms is quite capable of handling multiple groups at once. Often central areas of the atrium and once the adult pool were cordoned off for \"a very special group function.\" This never seemed to block traffic, however. But lines at the coffee shop could get long. Expect to spend money on food. The buffet at Villa de Flora is great, and worth the money.

The woman who worked there was lovely with children, and they practically had this great facility to themselves. They easily would have spent hours there if we'd allowed it.

We had a catered event in a suite -- cerviche and an antipasto buffet -- and my team was pleasantly surprised at the quality. The wait staff was fantastic as well, allowing us to keep the food and drinks well past the designated \"clean up\" time. As for the onsite restaurants, they were very expensive but the food was good except at the 24-hour cafe, which was underwhelming. My biggest complaint, however, was with the valet parking service. Again, I was so tired when I checked in at 2 a.m. that when the valet offered to park my car, I said go ahead. He was kind and attentive, and I did have a lot of boxes to carry for our exhibit. But everytime I went to get my car, it was an ordeal. Once, I had to wait over 20 minutes for my car even though I had requested it via the online service 20 minutes before that! It would not have been so aggrevating if six other people came after me and almost immediately got their cars ahead of me. They apologized for the poor service but every time I requested my car, it was a 20 minute wait. As a convention exhibitor, the Gaylord is very nice (far better than the Disney property last year) and I wouldn't mind another show here.

Service, unfortunately, was lacking the week I was there, most notably at the eateries. The room was satisfactory, but the bed comfort was lacking in comparison to the room price. All other room amenities were average. Housekeeping was excellent. But there were concern: Concern 1 came at Sunset Sams, where seating was slow (open tables) and what was ordered wasn't what was received. Because it took so long, I accepted the meal, but no amends were made by the restaurant. Concern 2 came at the H20 Sports Bar, where we sat for no less than 10 minutes and not one of the wait staff even acknowledged us, though there was eye contact. We left. Concern 3 came with the room, which, though a non-smoking room, was clearly used otherwise. Kudos, however, to the effective use of an ionizer to rid the smell, but it required that I leave to have this done. Concern 4 was in the convention center, where there was little information at all about where our training sessions were to be held. The most helpful were the guys setting out sodas for another convention's event. Concern 5 was with the concierge, who, in spite of our attempt to explain that we were looking for a down-to-earth jazz bar, found ourselves with a printout for two very upscale restaurants. Unfortunately, the standoff-ish attitude of the concierge made us decide to figure it out on our own. (Must've been the jeans we were wearing at the time.) Concern 6 was a billing error, which resulted in about a 20 minute delay at checkout. Concern 7 was the misfired response to an online survey I completed after my stay. I was contacted by someone there via email asking for the best time to contact me. After three replies to this person, I gave up.

We stayed at numerous hotels during this visit. In part because we plan to return with our children and wanted to 'scope out' the hotels. We have previously stayed at Gaylords in Nashville. This hotel is close to Disney (very close to the Wide World of Sports - WWS - complex). Because of WWS tournaments the Gaylord had tons of kids - someone at the hotel advised 600 kids playing at the WWS checked in on 1 night of our stay. We thought we would feel overwhelmed with kids but we didn't. This hotel is great for adults and for families. The atrium (evergrades) is what sets it apart. They had performances in the atrium. They have shops, adult pool, family pool, 3 bars, etc. I could have simply stayed at the hotel all day and not felt like I 'missed' a thing. There was an ICE show in the connected Convention Center which looked amazing but we did not see it as we are from the north and have enough cold temperatures! We dined at the Old Hickory Steakhouse. Prior to going we read reviews. We parked ourselves with no problem and knew parking would be $7.50. Some reviews of the Old Hickory Steakhouse complained about the prices. Gaylords has 3 dining options. We elected to eat at the Steakhouse ($$$). My husband and I had a wonderful 'dining experience' at the steakhouse. I had one of the very BEST meals I have ever had in any restaurant. Yes, it was expensive but it was ABSOLUTELY supurb. Because they were booked we ate at the bar and actually ordered 2 appetizers and then split one (steak) meal. What I liked is that the waitresses suggested this when I mentioned that I didn't want too much. They brought an extra plate and were very gracious, funny. It was wonderful. I think, with drinks and tip, we spent around $60-80 and it was worth every cent. For adult entertainment we took a taxi ($15) to Downtown Disney (Pleasure Island). I thought this was an adult venue but it was overrun with kids. I didn't quite get that and I think it was because it was still earlier in the evening (7-8pm) and not 10-11. I did like the fact that the 'taxis' from Gaylord were more sedans (limo style). We had a Florida room (aka faces out) with a king bed.

So when business travel took me to Orlando, I was very excited to stay in another Gaylord property. I arrived during daylight hours and checked in with no problems. The room was clean and overlooked the atrium in the Everglades section of the hotel. The view was lovely although I did look down later to discover previous guests had some success throwing a few pieces of garbage (napkins, cigarettes and one chicken bone) on top of the coffee shop roof. My biggest problem came at night. The place is NOISY!! In my section of the hotel, the open atrium features an all-night coffee shop. My first night there a group camped out until 2 a.m. laughing and yelling after clearly having a few too many adult beverages. Felt like I was sleeping (unsuccessfully) next to a college campus. The next night and every night of my stay, the piano bar with its doors open into the atrium kept me awake until they closed at 1 a.m. Turns out that lovely balcony's glass windows and window treatments aren't really enough to keep out the Billy Joel \"Pianoman\" Wannabee's singing until all hours. If I was vacationing, I don't know that I would have minded the noise and would have just compensated by sleeping in during the mornings. But since I was travelling on business, I needed to be out of the door by 8:15 every morning and was suffering from severe sleep deprivation by the time I got home. As has been noted in other reviews, the prices for in-hotel food are quite high although were comparable to other Disney properties at which I've stayed over the years. Paying additional for parking didn't reflect great guest services, in my opinion, but I also acknowledge is fairly standard for the area. On the plus side, the staff was very nice especially the housekeepers I met and the servers in the restaurants. The alligators in the lobby make for a good show and the grounds are quite beautiful. Didn't have time for the spa but did take advantage of the in-hotel workout space which, while smaller, is well stocked with up-to-date equipment.

In one word it was awesome. I genuinely believed that the wow factor would have disappeared because I had spent so much time on the internet looking through pictures and reading reviews about different aspects of the hotel. The novelty never wore off. When we first arrived we were in awe at the scale and beauty of this building. It was very pictureque, especially when lit up at night. Getting in with all our luggage was slightly troublesome (mainly because we opted to park before checking in with our bags and there was no bell service in the car park.) The car parking was a small negative because after forking out for staying in the hotel for 7 nights, one has to pay $7.50 to park per night. This was not encouraging but we didnt want it to ruin our stay. The service was excellent for the most part. The staff are courteous and thorough in their approach. Things were done with no questions asked. We particularly enjoyed the cordless phone in the hotel room with the 'consider it done' button. When we entered the room we were happy to have been given a balcony room in the Key West section of the resort. This was wonderfully to our taste with great authentic d\u00e9cor and dark mahogany wooden wardrobe and kingsize bed. The bathroom was very spaceous with nice twin sinks set into marble. Likewise the shower was very open and powerful. An in room fridge was standard and was ideal for milk beverages ; ) We had many early starts because we were visiting different parts of Florida. It was ideal because it allowed us to have cereal for breakfast. This was a much cheaper, faster and healthier option than the expensive (albeit extensive) breakfast buffet on offer at villa de flora. The view out of the balcony was interesting with the lagoon below filled with baby alligators and the peaceful sound of running water. At this point, it may be useful to say that it is quite noisy. It is noisiest at night during the weekend when they have fun light shows and live skating entertainment. During the week it was pretty quiet but the background noise of waterfalls etc may annoy some. The facilities are quite incredible. There are two huge outdoor pools. One of them is ideal for kids complete with a giant concrete squid waterslid. Tanning opportunities are plentiful at the adult pool with many great sun loungers and service for drinks. There was some construction going on around the adult pool and only two of the 4 giant jacuzzis were in action because of this. It didn\u2019t bother us because we did get a good price and the construction was hidden well from view with scenic barriers. Perhaps the best feature of all was the 24 hour pool access. This made it possible to share a romantic night in the jacuzzi. Also on offer were 5 outdoor gazebo style buildings. They were complimentary if you want peace or privacy whilst at the pool. For those wanting to stay in shape during a visit was a small but barely used gym with 6 runners and 6 'sliding' machines. There was also stability balls and a mediocre selection of free weights. Classes were availble but we were disappointed that they charged a modest $7 per class. At that price they should be complimentary. Dining facilities are simply great. Highly recommended was villa de flora a buffet restaurant with all you can eat for $25. The quality of the food was high and the beauty of the restaurant was the cuisine from different countries on different nights. The italian was excellent - really really good. Brilliant salads, tomatoes, roasted peppers, cheeses, breads and desserts. There is a carvery with prime rib and ham for those on the atkins. The deserts were AMAZING. All you can eat Ben and Jerry's is always good, but add heatth bars and you are laughing! Stay away from the brownies but enjoy all the other 20+ varieties of desserts freshly made there! Sunset Sams was based on a 60ft ship inside the atrium and boasted a fair selection of seafood. We never ate their so can\u2019t give a review. As for the the steakhouse, it looked excellent but I think it would be a more special evening if you weren\u2019t staying at the hotel. We opted for Del Frisco's for our extravagant night and were impressed by the awesome steaks. One word about Gaylord hotels is the price of food. With the exception of the Villa De Flora, it is expensive to eat there, they have you where they want you because there are no restaurants within walking distance. This was a big negative for us the fact that the only transport is car. We rented for a few days and looked up osceola taxi cab company for a few other meals outside the hotel.

The desk clerk was very nice and said if I did not mind waiting they would give me one. We said we would and looked around the resort. At 3:00 pm we checked to see how much longer. I had requested Key West area because it was closest to the kids pool. They said it would be ready in half an hour. It was not so they gave us St. Augustine area. The St. Augustine rooms near the St. Augustine B elevator are actually right next to the Key West area which is where they put us. Since they did not have Key West area they took off the $10/night resort fee (I asked if they could take off self parking and instead they took off the more expensive charge). The whole time we were there the staff was really friendly and helpful. My daughter was sick one day so I left a note asking for the linen to be changed on the beds to make sure they would not just make up the beds. They changed them and did turn down service. I also called Old Hickory and asked if I could order soup for my daughter and pick it up. They said they ususally don't, but said they would since she was not feeling well and suggested a type that would be better to settle her stomach. We always had nice big fresh towels and they always replaced the soap, shampoo and lotion even if we had not used all of the rest. The phone did not work the first day and the fan made a clicking noise. Maintenance was there within 5 to 10 minutes of my call and fixed the problems right away. The kids pool was great for my grandaughter. I accidentally left three shirts in the closet with the iron. Lost and Found said they would ship them anyway I preferred to save me money. The only negative things are self parking which is $7 plus tax a night. I saw some people use the Valet parking which is $15/night, and they got people their cars quickly and you could drive right up to the lobby. For self parking they are doing construction so we had to park near the Everglades area. Once we got used to the routine it was a nice little walk to our room. Also you can hear noise from the Florida Festival in your room if you get an Atrium View, but we were usually at the events so it did not bother us. It was quiet the rest of the time and we had a nice view. If you want a quiet room ask for a Florida room which does not have the balcony. It is really pretty inside the hotel with flowers, plants and water falls. My grandaughter loved the alligators and seeing them be fed chicken. The acrobats show on the weekend was great too.

Of course there's the Atrium - makes you think that you are outside. It's very beautiful....I don't recommend eating at their restaurants there though - if you are a budget traveler like I do. They have restaurants close to them ...such as the American Sizzler - buffet for only $8.99 dinner - breakfast is $3.99 -- its a great deal compare to the hotel's $30.00 buffet. By the way, if you like lobster - we found an all-you can eat lobster close to this hotel - it's called Angel's All You Can Eat Lobster and Prime Ribs and Steaks for only $27.00 dinner - cheaper if you eat earlier than 6:00 P.M. Also, they offered spa services but I wouldn't recommend it - again if you are a budget traveler as there are cheaper ones just outside the htoel. My husband and I had a massage at Massage Wellness Center at Kissimmee - and it was wonderful - we only paid $65 - it will cost you $110 at the hotel for the same 60 minutes massage. We tried in-room dining -- it's a great experience - I recommed doing it at least one time. You have to pay extra 3% for service charge - and there's another charge I can't remember. Don't order the pizza - it's like those pizza you buy in a box then popped in the microwave. I do like the buffalo wings - it's a great appetizer. If you arrive late at night and don't feel like eating out - just get an in-room service. They serve fast. Like everyone is saying, the only drawback to this hotel is that they don't include the resort fee to your booking. It's $10.00 a day (water, fitness area, pool area use, etc). If you rent a car - you have to pay for the parking -- again I don't see the point. If other resort can afford their guest to park for free - why not a luxury hotel like them can't do it? Any how, valet parking is $14.00/day (pretty pricey if you are going to do it everyday). I ended up paying an extra $200 at the end of my 7 day vacation - including 1 movie and 1 in-room dining (medium pizza, buffalo wings, and 1 more appetizer I can't remember). This hotel is in great location - especially if you're there for Walt Disney World resort. They provide complimentary shuttle to the theme parks. They do not provide service to Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon, or Blizzard Beach. I noticed that if you are there for the theme park, it's better to probably stay at their resort. I'm thinking of booking the Swan next time we visit - it looks nice from the highway.

Upon reaching our room we were shocked to find out they had inadvertently given us a double room instead of a king room. I decided to walk back down to the front desk and get everything reassigned.

This is not a place I would personally stay for leisure travel, but it was perfect for a conference.

In fact, my first reaction to this kitschy, \u201cHollywood-set\u201d look was quite negative. However, over the days, we found it to be a rather relaxing place for a conference, and we never left the place from our arrival on Sunday until our departure Thursday evening. Walking to & from the convention center every morning & evening through the gardens with the sound of the waterfalls was quite relaxing. We had a room in the St. Augustine building. While the room itself was quite nice, the cleanliness standards leave much to be desired. When we checked into our room on Sunday evening, we found hairpins, bobby pins, elastic hair bands and \u201clarge\u201d pieces of dirt or residue (e.g., food) on the carpet. We asked housekeeping to please vacuum the carpet the next morning. When we checked out on Thursday, those items were still on the floor! The furniture never seemed to be dusted. The back half of the desk and nightstand were very dusty as were all the lamps and the top of the wooden bed frame. The carpet looked as though it is ready for a good shampooing. We ate in all three of the restaurants, and although we do not eat meat, our favorite restaurant was the Old Hickory Steakhouse. Other than a salad and an appetizer, there is no vegetarian food here, but there are several wonderful fish dishes. The highlight of our meals at the Old Hickory was the marvelous cheese course. The fish restaurant, Sunset Jack\u2019s, was a more casual place with good seafood dishes and cute entertainment (mermaid woman, person on stilts making balloon art, magician, musicians). Again, apart from salad, there is nothing on the menu for vegetarians. The quality of the dishes at Sunset Jack\u2019s varies with the chef on duty. One evening our food was so highly black-peppered that I could not eat it. Another time the food was hardly peppered at all. The only place for vegetarians is the Villa Flora, which serves only a Mediterranean-style buffet. It is a great place for big appetites; however, we found the quality of the food here to be less than adequate. (I should note that when we mentioned on Wednesday evening the poor quality of the food and the lower number of choices on the buffet than we saw on Sunday evening during a walk-through, the waitress said that for that week only, they lowered the price for the conference attendees and had limited their number of food items. Likewise, the breakfast buffet was limited for the week to exclude an omelet station). The coffee shop, Planet Java, had decent espresso, sandwiches and salads, but very dry and stale croissants! All in all, the service throughout the resort was excellent and the personnel were all very friendly. Yes, as they have you captured there, you can expect very high prices. In the convention center you could have a glass of iced tea or a 12-oz. soft drink for $2, but a 12-oz. Bottle of Dasani water was $4!! Luckily, you got two free bottles of water a day in your room.

My husband and I stayed from 11/14 to 11/20 in an Emerald Bay room, directly above their piano bar, Auggie's. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will return to the Gaylord Palms, if we every find ourselves in Orlando again. Although all 1400 rooms were booked while we were there it didn't seem crowded or busy. - Service/Staff: Every employee we encountered was friendly and courteous. While at the restaurants were weren't rushed to leave and in one instance encouraged to stay and chat. - Atruim: It's a sight to behold! We spent several nights exploring it. We also watched the alligator feeding, which was quite entertaining. It can get noisy due to the acoustics of the atrium but not loud. - Restaurants: The buffet is well worth $24 for dinner. The food was fresh and well prepared. Sunset Sam's had great food and drinks but was a bit pricey (ex. $13 for one crabcake) but not overly so. The 24 hour cafe is mediocre but convenient. - Resort Fee: We thought this was a great value, since we usually end up paying $10 for internet access at other hotels anyway. At GP the fee includes shuttle service, OJ and water. Also, the parking fee is to be expected as well, and the price consistent with other hotels in the area. - Rooms: Our room and bathroom were big. Ours may have been bigger than most because it was on a corner (looked like it was designed to be wheel-chair accessible). The bed was VERY comfortable. - Pools: We used the pools and hot tubs at night so we had them to ourselves, which I haven't witnessed anywhere else. Also, pools are open 24 hours a day, when they're isn't a private function. - Location: This resort is located in a prime location...very close to Disney Parks, Sea World, Old Town, shopping and restaurants. If you're looking for cheap eats there's dozens of chain restaurants nearby. I also found it very easy to get around the resort area. - Beware: My husband and his co-worker did have a strange experience with a woman selling (one-day only) jewelry in the convention area.

Now, for the people that say it is very expensive to eat and park, they are 100% correct. But, almost EVERY 4-5 star hotel will be just as expensive. I GUARANTEE IT. The maid service wasnt the best, as we had to call for them to bring toilet paper up (I was told they were very short staffed because of the hurricane). The shower curtain is rather bizarre. It is very flimsy and doesnt really cover the entire outline of the tub, so I was often nervous that I was going to flood the bathroom.

Brand-name stores like Ben & Jerry's and Godiva are a great bonus when you have a late-night craving. The Disney store offered ticket sales, and even 1/2-day passes for the parks. Even with a convention, a martial arts tournament, and a wedding at the hotel during our stay, I found that the service was very good. We were always addressed by name and our needs were met in a timely manner. Though the food prices were expensive, particularly at the steak house, all our meals were very good. Even if you paid discounted convention or online rates for this upscale hotel, you have to expect to pay upscale restaurant prices for the meals. If you are looking for affordability, my recommendation is to take the shuttle (or drive) to Citywalk and get the Movie and Meal Deal for 19.95 which includes tax and gratuities. The only disappointment with Gaylord was that we initially booked an atrium view, but got a city-view instead. On the flip-side, we were allowed to check in three hours early and got a late check-out as well. I thought the resort fee of $10 was very reasonable, as my teenagers used the shuttle service to the parks on a few occasions, and they were able to stay connected with friends via the in-room laptops.
