The beach is great, but this resort has 2 beautiful pools that were under remodeling. This wasn't anyone at the front desk's fault, except for the fact that we told Michelle that we went on the site, looked thoroughly, and couldn't find that it said anywhere that they were under remodel for the pools. The problem was that she kept saying that it was on the site before she even checked. She was stubborn and kept saying it was on there without being helpful.

The other things I like about the Makena: The rate is the rate...no add ons for every little thing. If you are comparing to other S. Maui properties, at Makena valet parking and \"the resort\" are included. No resort of valet parking fees. The view from my room....whales jumping - couldn't have been more beautiful! The beach chairs...my favorite beach in the world and nice loungers set up for me....awesome! The LARGE windows and double sliding glass doors so I could have lots of fresh Maui air.

Tips: -There is a washer and dryer available to all guests. $2 per wash and $1.50 per dry and although there is a coin machine for soaps, you can save money bringing your own. -If you can find a package breakfast deal online, do it! The food was amazing. There are always fruits, cereals, omlettes, waffles and pastries available and the meats and other specials change daily. (High chairs available for the little ones.) -If travelling with a baby, they will provide a crib (with sheet and bumper pad) at no extra cost. This was very convenient for us. (Baby items that we couldn't bring and the hotel didn't provide we rented from www.easytravelhi.com and had a good experience with them.) -Children can feed the coi fish at the pool in the morning (just ask the breakfast hostess for a small baggie of fish food). -The golf club house has a restaurant with good food at reasonable prices and is convenient since it is just a couple of minutes up the road.

We had an amazing time. Here is our summary: 1) Hotel - The hotel is nice. Definitely a 4 star hotel. All the staff were amazingly friendly. Big smiles. There is a fitness area but we didnt try it. As other reviewers said the pools are super small. But we did enjoy lounging around the pool during lunch where we ordered food by the pool. The breakfast buffet is okay. Omellette station, fresh fruit, cereal, breads, etc. But honestly after day 4 I was pretty tired of it. Didnt eat at the restaurant during the evenings. 2) Location - This is where the hotel really stands out. There is an amazing beach right in front of the hotel. The snorkeling is amazing. Reefs right off the beach. You can see turtles, eels, amazing colored fish. The beach is not busy at all. Mornings are the best to snorkel. If you are into snorkeling you cant beat this location. You can also drive 10 mins to the Underwater Reserve where the snorkeling is fantastic (the bay at the second parking lot). We also saw lots of whales breaching from the beach. That was pretty cool. Wailea is only 5 mins away and Kihei is 15 mins away. We drove to Kihea a couple nights for dinner. The Coconut Fish Cafe and Cafe 808 (both are reviewed here on tripadvisor) were good. Kahului is about 30 mins away (the city where the airport is). One night we went to the Maui Arts and Cultural Center and saw a ukulele show by Jake Shimabukuro. He was amazing. Do yourself a favor and youtube him and watch it. Another night at the Iao Theater where we saw Grease by local artists. Both were great. On the last day we did drive to Laihana, Kapalua, and Kaanapali to see these other famous areas. All I can say is that I am glad I stayed at the Makena area. Golf - I am an avid golfer. I golfed the Makena course twice. Once with my wife and once as a single. My wife loved the course. The views are amazing. The service is great. The food at the restaurant is really good. I thought the course had amazing potential but needed a lot of tender lovin care. Dont get me wrong I thought the value was good and for most golfers they will enjoy it. But Im a bit of a golf snob.

We stayed in room 328, anything from 330 on would have had an even better view of the ocean, on any floor. There was an entry hall, a spacious closet area with mini fridge and safe underneath. The bathroom had a separate room for toilet area. This is the last resort in that direction on the island and has its own beach area, where very few people come from off the resort. It never felt crowded and was nice and quiet. The pool area is very nice and you can order lunch and sit by the pool or even have your food on the beach. There was free ice water and lemons available all day by the pool, and the workers brought around ice water to us at the pool or at the beach during the day. This was a great idea! We brought our thermal cups and just kept having them refilled with icy cold water all day long. There is a place to rent paddle boards, kayaks, etc right there at the beach. There was no need for us to visit any other beaches on the island as this one was really nice and had everything we needed. The water was great for swimming, paddle boarding etc. We snorkeled off the beach a few times and saw some turtles and fish. There is also a nice golf course at the resort as well. The resort is close to Kihea and many great restaurants and shops. However, it is a bit farther to Lahaina or Kaanapali area, because of its location at the southeast end of the island. It is probably about a 45 minute drive to Lahaina. Our package included a free breakfast daily at the resort and this was a wonderful meal, filled with everything you could want for breakfast, from omelets, to pancakes and french toast, to pastries and fruit. We filled up on breakfast each day! The lunches at the poolside were very tasty as well, with sandwiches or salads. We did not eat supper at the resort.

The Bad - Their much touted Sunday brunch was not nearly as spectacular as the Grand Wailea's brunch down the street. I would recommend there instead. - Pina Coladas & Mai Thais are $10 and there is very little alcohol in them. Lots of filler and pre mix. - No hot tub or steam room which I would think would be expected as part of any resort on the island. - Not on the bus line.

The Ugly - The room price is pretty expensive but as Maui resorts go, I guess that is expected. -The meals will run you about $40-50 per person with an entree and 1 glass of wine or cocktail. - The doors are so stiff and difficult to open that you literally have to set down your packages/bags and push/pull with great force to get them open.

Yes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true; you are a bit away from things, but if you are interested in romance with your loved one, why would you want to be around all of the hustle and bustle of a big, overcrowded resort. For my wife and me, we love this quite hotel, the staff is excellent, from valet (Tommy is great) to the front desk, to housekeeping, the service was great. The beach (which is as private as you get on Maui), is excellent, and one of the greatest assets of the Hotel. It is very secluded; the water is great, at times the waves are perfect, at times the snorkeling is the best. For us, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any better. As stated in some other reviews, if you want the excitement and energy of a crowded resort, the Makena is not for you. The pool area is a bit outdated, but who goes to Maui to lay by a pool (my opinion). We enjoyed the breakfast on most days; we also had one dinner on property, which we thought was great. The food by the pool was very good. The negative about the property, as others have mentioned, is that there is just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd missing. My wife and I could not put our finger on it, but there is a lack of energy at the property; however we love the Makena and will certainly be back.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful oasis and beach!\u201d", "Author": "AlohaMauiGirl", "ReviewID": "UR125246199", "Content": "I have been to Maui 5 times but every time my family has either stayed in Kihei or Kanaapali.

I was excited to see the renovations, beautiful decor, mini fridge in the room, and the beautiful beach! While most beaches on Maui can have rough surf or rocky bottoms, the beach at the hotel is amazing! It is quiet, never crowded, and includes some of the best boogie boarding waves and snorkeling (you can see turtles within minutes of jumping in the water). I also saw many whales from the beach (which distracted me from finishing the Hunger Games triology!). The bed was extremely comfortable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the breakfast buffet was delicious! The only things keeping this resort from being great are having a better pool area, staff being more attentive during breakfast (on our last day a waiter didn't bring us coffee or anything we requested for a looong time..), and having some more dining options at the poolside. One day my husband went to the pool bar to get some food and the staff snapped at him during a busy lunch hour (it seemed like they were understaffed).

Jay picked out a live pencil urchin and Ralph picked out a live spiny sea urchin. Ralph told us to listen to whales as we snorkeled and sure enough we were able to hear the whales high pitched song as we swam. On our way back from 5 caves we stopped to snorkel again. This time the sun came out and we saw a moray eel and then on the surface Ralph pointed out the most beautiful largest sea turtle i ever seen. Not to scare the turtle but curious we started to slowly swim to each other. while swimming ever slowly closely to each other i could hear the whale song in the background and the sun was out in full color! The Turtle made eye contact and swam really really slowly to me as if almost to kiss my mask! I said to myself recognizing All the elements in play that this is what makes Maui Magical!

But boy was I wrong. The Makena is fantastic. Actually, I later found out from my cousin (who lives on Maui) that the hotel is her family's favorite on the island .... they've stayed there \"plenty\" times. The plusses . . . there are many: 1) Very large rooms. We had a king with an ocean view on the fourth floor. I think every room has some view of the ocean, and ours was spectacular. We could see whales out in the distance, folks relaxing on the beach, beautiful sunsets, etc., etc. 2) Very clean rooms. The decor isn't super modern, but it's well cared for. The grohe fixtures were a luxury. 3) The breakfast was fantastic! It was inexplicably included in our reservation. I suppose someone behind my booking was looking out for us. I expected coffee and bagels with a toaster. Rather, it was a full spread of fruits, pastries, oatmeal, cereals, breakfast meats, omelets made to order and more. The location was pleasant too. 4) Wonderful pool! Staff circulated offering water (free) and \"would you like some pineapple?\" (free) or \"would you like some frozen grapes? (free)?\" Awesome! They also had great poolside food and bar . . . and staff took orders and delivered to your chaise. Why move? You're on vacation. 5) The beach was just steps away. Not too crowded and great for swimming. Along side is a hut full of all your beach needs. I bought a t-shirt. Again, my cousin considers this one of the best beaches on Maui. 6) Great spa service. My partner and I got massages in the tents facing the beach. 7 Gay friendly. Apparently there is a gay beach nearby. We didn't go, but I suppose that's an option. Everyone at the resort made us feel very welcome. 7) Fantastic staff. Every person walks by greets you warmly. \"Aloha! Good Morning!\" The concierge helped us with dinner reservations (go to Sansei and Cafe O'Lei), and snorkeling boat tour, and the spa. Waiters seemed naturally very friendly and considerate and made us feel at home. I'm sure there's more. This was really a wonderful hotel for us.

Though nice, it is not ostentatious like the Grand Waliea up the street. It was known as a very high-quality experience without flash. That feeling remains. Here's the 411. As I was told, a few years ago it was bought and that company went out of business. It is now owned by Summit. The are spending money on capital improvements and there is no real sign of strife from the buy-out. The week we were the property was booked solid. The interesting part is there was no long lines or lack of room by the pool or on the beach. In fact there was a lack of crowds everywhere. I really liked that. Easy to get in, easy to get out. Almost zero kids there. I REALLY liked that. It does not seem to attract a lot of families and frankly this adds to the serenity on the property. The room is large enough, and is equipped with a coffeemaker and a fridge. I am a freak about bedding and forgot my pillow from home. The bedding is superb and comfortable. The area: I much prefer the Kihei side of Maui. It rarely rains. It has the best beaches. Kihei is really chill. If you stay here, drive down to the end of the road and hit Big Beach and lava flows near La Perouse. It is the perfect place to watch a sunset. The peace of staying at Makena must be weighed against being another 15 minutes away from the hustle-bustle. You can hit the crappy t-shirt shops in La Haina with a 1 hour drive if you must. But the peace of Makena beckons and you may find yourself actually relaxing. You will be nearby some of the best golfing in the world. They have massages at the beach. We had one and the treatment was fabulous, but it was a little cold due to breezes and that detracted from the experience, so I would only do it on a hot day. Now the Spa at the Grand Wailea may have a step up here with their mega-spa. Check their specials. If you know Bill W. there are a ton of meetings nearby. Get up early and hit the Kihei Morning Serenity at 7am. The people are warm and welcoming. One of my favs. This property is a bargain at the rate they are charging. It is not flash and glitz.

I came with a couple of friends who were attending a convention in Wailea, and chose the hotel mainly considering the distance to the Grand Wailea hotel and the price. Prices are extortionary in Wailea. Having visited the other properties and comparing them to Makena Beach and Golf Resort, I actually felt good about my choice. The Vegas-like Wailea hotels are over the top, crowded, and so overdone you would think the beach is just another prop. Makena on the other hand is much more tranquil, natural, and the beach actually looks like a proper nature-made beach. The thing about Makena is that it could be so much better. The architecture is impressive, the grounds are wonderfull, really well kept, and the inner garden is magnificent. Besides that, the hotels design is fairly below average. There's no ambiance whatsoever, the furniture doesn't match, the huge hall looks terribly void and cold, the lighting is airport like. The recent refurbishment did nothing for it. Service is hit and miss, and while most of the staffers are polite and smiley, the ensemble comes across as amateur and far too easy going. The rooms are huge, but to no great effect, as again, they're not properly furnished. There's the quintessentially american wall-to-wall carpeting, wich I found rather horrid, the colonial furniture, and the shabby bathroom, spruced up recently with granite countertops, but leaving the rest unchanged. The bathtub looked especially pathetic. The beds are comfortable enough for one or two nights, but after a week i started having back pain, as the matrasses are rather soft and have the tendency to cave in the middle. The breakfast is nice enough, though there are a number of crucial items missing, like proper butter or anything resembling ham. All in all, I think there is a lot to improve in this property, but unfortunately it seems the owners want it to be a poor man's Grand Wailea instead of the stilishly relaxed haven it could very well be. I do recomend the property based on it's tranquility and the beach, bearing in mind that the although the hotel doesn't by any means deliver a luxury experience, it manages to be more agreable than it's Wailea counterparts.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jeffersonville, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cA great stay\u201d", "Author": "susanm395", "ReviewID": "UR124228488", "Content": "We are not resort types, but the Makena Beach and Golf Resort was wonderful.

There is a lanai with a table and 2 chairs for sunset watching. We were on the second floor but still had a clear view of the grounds and the ocean. At night, we left the lanai doors open and fell asleep to the sound of the breaking surf. We went to the breakfast buffet every morning before heading out for golf and had a hearty selection of hot and cold items. As we can attest, you can eat breakfast in 15 minutes if you need to, or relax over a leisurely meal. We did both over the 3 days. We didn't have dinner at the hotel as there are many fine restaurants in the nearby Wailea and Kihei neightborhoods. We did stop by the bar on our first evening and left after one drink as it was just a little too quiet. If you don't have a car (or just don't want to drive), the hotel has a shuttle van that will take you to nearby restaurants and golf courses. The selection of golf courses near the hotel is fantastic. There are 3 Wailea courses, the Makena course and the Elleair course in Kihei. All are in top shape and offer slightly different experiences. It's a great way to see some of the best real estate in Maui! And, see whales breaching from some of the higher holes! If you're willing to venture out a little further, there are 4-5 more courses within a 30 minute drive.

I really want the MBGR to succeed cause it's a great place, but I want to keep it a secret because it's a wonderful place to get away. I love that it's isolated and away from the maddening crowds. We're from Maui, and when we want to staycation on the South side, MBGR is our only choice. You arrive at the hotel to free valet parking. How nice is that? I was happy to see that the rooms have been renovated quite nicely since our last visit. The facelift done on the property was well done and much needed. The room we had on the 5th floor looks refreshed and chic. My only complaint is that the entry door to the room was hard to open. Normally, that would be so minor, but it really was difficult to open. Looks fantastic, but I can't imagine an elderly person or a mom with a baby in her arms being able to easily open that door. I'm guessing that it's probably a security thing. They got rid of that big tree that used to be in the middle of hotel which has cut down considerably on the bird noise in the morning. The staff here is still wonderful and accomodating. We spent the day at the pool, hanging out. Our server, Linda, was so nice and efficient. We also played put-put golf, badminton, and shuffleboard. All very fun and a nice break from lying around the pool. Dinner was at the Molokini Bar & Grille. Our friends did the seafood buffet, which they loved. The hubby & I ordered off the menu. It was nice to see that their menu options have been expanded. I'm sure that this in part to the closing of the Japanese restaurant next door. My flat iron steak was delicious, cooked exactly to order. My hubby liked his baby back ribs well enough but wasn't wow'd by them. Next morning, we did a light breakfast at the coffee shop downstairs. We left happy, rested, and wondering when we'll be able to come back again.

We thought the Makena would be as good or better. Wrong. Very very wrong. Initally we were directed to the resturant by a helpful staf member. Once at the desk to check in (with reservations) we were taken to our seats. The overall feeling was that of a sports bar, with tvs hanging from the ceiling area. Once seated, the waiter advised us to simply help ourselves to the buffet. No offer of beverages, nothing. Thinking that the busy tourest season had struck, we wrote it off and continued to the buffet. In fairness,, the food was good with good servers where required. But really messy. Slopped searving spoons beside the trays of food sitting in pools of standing mess. Returning to the table, still no beverage service but the employee that had seated us was seen travellng back and forth to the buffet with armloads of clean dishes. then returning with water for tables. Which we were finally offered. Hurriedly. Thats the last time we saw him. Or anyone else. We completed our meal, waiting for our table to be cleared. Never happened. We returned to the buffet collected some desserts and returned to our table. Clearing the table ourselves, piling dirty dishes on top of each other, we completed our mea. No server. No offer of beverage. No table clearing. Still noting the servers running around in what appeared to be a total uncoordinated fashion, it became obvious no one was in charge.

We've stayed in an ocean side room once, and partial ocean view rooms twice. The ocean side rooms are amazing, but you give up little by having a partial ocean view (i.e., the view is still great). We prefer staying in the south wing as the view from your lanai includes the gardens, palms, Pu'u Olai crater, and the sea. In our previous stays, we didn't mind the decor. Since then, the rooms have been modernized, but the new design took away one of the real pluses, the louvered doors that allow the cross breeze at night and the sound of the ocean. It's unfortunate that is gone as we found it too warm to sleep with the sliding doors open, which was a real perk of this beach-side resort. We tried the breakfast buffet for the first time this trip. There was a very wide selection of fruits and breakfast foods in the buffet, but I felt the quality was average, yet reasonable for the package we purchased. The staff is what has made this resort so amazing in the past. The friendliness of the staff is still above average, and maybe because we stayed only two nights this trip, it didn't seem so much so as previous trips. I mentioned location, that starts with the beach next to the hotel. It's one of the best beaches we've visited on the island and with great snorkeling. As a runner, I appreciate the easy access to Makena Alanui Road, which offers a quiet out-and-back course of up to 8 miles on pavement, or farther if you include some trail running. Shortly after passing Big Beach, the course becomes quite scenic as it runs along the ocean through Ahihi Kinau Natural Preserve, eventually reaching La Perouse Bay. Shorter loops can be found by heading towards Makena Landing and beyond. I've also enjoyed a hike up the Pu'u Olai crater which is an easy walk from the hotel. My wife and I enjoy the relatively remote location, however, you are not isolated. The Shops at Wailea are less than 10 minutes away (accessible by hotel shuttle) and include restaurants and shopping. There are also two very nice restaurants -- with live music -- in the Wailea Gateway Center and a few restaurants at nearby golf courses. We've not visited the hotel restaurants with the exception of the breakfast buffet and the pool-side cafe. We find this resort to be an exceptional value, with the only regret being the loss of the louvered doors.

We got a beautified' room...the beds were so comfortable, new furnishings, big flat screen tv. There is a 'dated' feel in the room and around the hotel. It's the tile in the bathroom and the flooring throughout. The bluish lighting over the entryway was harsh, compared to the soft amber everywhere else. There were some nice watercolors in the room, but more art would really add to the rooms/hotel. But, if it keeps the prices as reasonable as they were, I'm fine with it. We didn't spend much time in the room, anyway! As everyone mentions, the pool area is small with two circular pools. But it has a nice bar and food service. We enjoyed eating by the pool with the resident cats and taking a quick dip. Since we came without children, who needs the pool anyway? We came for the beach and ocean and Maluaka beach is one of the best. The beach, Maluaka, is perfect. We saw turtles every day and the snorkeling is really good...a variety of fish, including humus, eels, trumpetfish and tons of turtles. This is the beginning of whale season, but in Jan/Feb, you will be able to see the whales off the beach (though some visitors we met saw a few breeching 'next door' in Wailea) .Black sand beach is within walking distance and we also took a short drive south to La Perouse Bay and spent some time at 'secret cove'...Just a gorgeous, unspoiled area. Makena is a very quiet area with a lot of natural beauty...it's about a 45 minute drive to Lahaina/Kaanapali. So, depending on what you want to do on Maui, that could be a consideration. Everyone at this resort was kind, friendly, helpful and we loved the beach guys...Leo, Jeff(?), sorry, I can't remember everyone's name. The people staying at the resort were also nice and laid back. Nobody was fighting over lounge chairs (experiences I've had at the Grand Wailea and Hyatt). I guess we also picked a good time of year to visit as there were no crowds anywhere (kids in school! nice break!). We were a little disappointed in the lack of restaurants here. We loved getting the complimentary buffet breakfast every morning. Great omelettes made while you wait! We also loved the Starbucks with almost 'normal' prices (grande latte $4.25 compared to $6.75 at the Grand Wailea). But, while dinner was a decent meal, we did not like the atmosphere..it felt like we were in a wedding reception hall or convention space. Food in Hawaii is expensive, so we ended up trying various restaurants in the area. If we're going to spend that much money, I personally need a nice atmosphere. BUT, service was always good. We did have some problems at arrival. We were unable to get wifi in our first room so they upgraded us to a room with the above mentioned wonderful view. Unfortunately, we still could not get wifi. We were able to use the ethernet and it was $54 for a week. I wanted to complain but my boyfriend didn't want to as we just got there and were tired. We did not have to pay a resort fee, valet charge ($25-50 a day at other resorts), so we didn't push the issue further and we liked our new view much better and were too tired to change rooms again. But it was annoying. If we pay $54 for wifi, we should have gotten wifi. The other thing that really bugged me was the constant playing of Christmas music! I know it is the holiday season, but I come to Hawaii to hear Hawaiian music...with so many wonderful Hawaiian musicians to choose from, I wish they would have been playing Hapa, Izi, Led Kaapana, etc.. So, overall, I highly recommend this resort if you like quiet, beautiful beaches and being surrounded by unspoiled nature. We will definitely come back.

We got a steal on Travelocity and paid NO resort fee ($25 times 10 days is $250!) plus got a free breakfast everyday. Our room was a \"partial\" ocean view (which really we felt was a full ocean view), with a big, comfy King sized bed. We had a toddler with us, and the room was big enough for our luggage, my husband's humungous golf club case, and for her to waddle around with books and toys to her delight. Our lanai was great - it had a small wall before the gate started so I was comofrtable with letting her out and walk around without feeling like she may slip through the bars or get her leg caught. The housekeepers also need mentioning here because by the 10th day, they knew our routine and when to clean our room. Everyday they were in there after breakfast but before our girl's nap. Talk about customer service. They also left us extra towels and bottled water which was a super nice touch. My husband used the safe, which was a \"choose your own combo\" and he loved he didn't have to remember a combo since he chose it. The only thing the room could've used was a microwave. From our room You could hear the ocean, but not the people. It was perfect. ALL of th staff was welcoming, warm, and friendly. When I say ALL I mean the people in the lobby, the housekeepers, the groundskeepers, the bellhops, the concierge, the pool people, the waitors, the people at the beach you rent equipment from... EVERYONE was all smiles there. It was so nice! The breakfast was amazing - eggs, meat, some sides, fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, personalized omlets, etc. They switched it up each day so breakfast didn't get boring. My toddler loved the fresh fruit and mango yogurt! The servers brought your drinks and cleared your plate since it was all-you-can-eat. Normally, $25 a person, we were super glad to be able to roll out of bed and walk down to breakfast each day. The pool was okay - we are hoping they renovate it. Two round pools but not very kid friendly - one smaller one is 4 feet deep and the other round one is 6 feet. We are hoping they turn the 4 foot into a kiddie pool and maybe add a slide or two to the big one, and add a hot tub. They certainly have the room out there! A ton of seating for tanners. The people out there had towels and offered ice water consistently which was a great touch. Also, my mom, sister, and brother and his family were all in Maui at the same time, and it was so great that they could come over to use our pool! This hotel is one of the few that would allow that. We checked the Fairmont, Grand Wailea, Marriott, and a couple others who absolutely would not let visitors come to use their pool! The pool side cafe was more than reasonably priced for the food portions and the convenience. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the club. Our total was $29 after tip. To do a comparison: My brother stayed at the Grand Waila at the same time we were there, and he paid $89 for 3 people to eat, plus two drinks. His food itself was $59. We also tried a Dancing Koi drink, which is an exclusive to this hotel and is award winning. It tastes like heaven and looks like candy. My toddler kept reaching for a drink because she thoght it was a snow cone. Must try if you go! The beach was a skip away from the pool, and again, so convenient and great. You can rent equipment right there, which is what we did, and snorkeled right off the beach. We saw a huge sea turtle and pretty fish! There are chairs out there for you to use, and the sand is so soft! Another thing we loved is their Christmas tree lighting ceremony. The hula dancers came and performed and of course, Santa himself made an appearance. How festive!!! The only things we would've changed: 1) Microwave in the room 2) Plumbing needs some updating (which they're doing now) 3) Would've loved FREE wi-fi 4) Pools Again, these things are small and not a big deal. All in all, we loved it here and can't wait to come back!!!! Best place we've stayed in Hawaii so far, and we've been to Kauai, Big Island, and Maui more than once!

This is especially true if the Makena is running a special like their recent free breakfast buffet and waived resort fee deal. Opinions based on over a dozen Hawaii trips: 1) Island choice: Even though many folks disregard this busy and densely populated option, you may wish to consider Waikiki if you are on a tight budget and/or have school age children because you can eat relatively inexpensively and kids will probably like it. 2) Maui area choice: On Maui, consider Kaananpali area if you have young kids or teenagers because there is more for them to enjoy there (e.g., long safe beach, most hotels have kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pools and water slides). Consider Wailea-Mackena area if you are older adults looking for a less-crowded and upscale venue. 3) Condo vs. hotel choice: We prefer the amenities available at hotels but you may prefer a condo, e.g., if you have a big family and/or want to buy some groceries avoid eating out. 4) Wailea area hotels: Go for the Four Seasons if you like Caesar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace and bragging about how much money you spent. Go for the Grand Wailea if opulence is important and budget is unimportant. The Fairmont Kea Lani is slightly less opulent, usually a little less expensive, and all rooms are relatively large suites. The best natural beaches that are an easy walk from your hotel are at the Renaissance (which has been closed for years) and Makena. Finally, focus on the Makena: We had stayed here three times while it was the Prince and this was our first stay since it had been through all the financial turmoil and is now owned and managed by some complicated combination of entities including Summit Hotels. Overall, we were very pleased with our experience at the Makena. The good-for-us but bad-for-owners news was that it appeared to be less than 50% full so there were no crowds or waiting in lines, and the staff was very courteous and attentive. Summit and whoever is obviously trying hard to refurbish and upgrade this fundamentally nice property. The work appears to be mostly complete. There is still some work going on, but none of it bothered us, with one small exception: They are moving and changing the bar and restaurant configurations. There was (temporarily?) no inside-the-hotel bar where you could actually sit at the bar, order a drink and snacks, and watch the sunset. You could, however, sit at tables near the bar, which are (were?) in the same basic room as the main hotel dining room. As long as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on the main \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Molokini\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dining room, I would rate our experience there as mixed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 entrees, appetizers, and drinks range form fair to good to very good. Prices are a bit less than most Wailea venues but certainly not inexpensive. In case you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware, there are very good restaurants in the Wailea area, but none are inexpensive or even moderate (e.g., dinner entrees average $35). So if nice but expensive evening meals aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your thing, count on driving to Kihei (where there are only a few fast-food and pizza joints, but no nice but inexpensive restaurants of the type you might be used to on the mainland) or staying in a condo with a kitchen (not sure there are any short-term vacation condos in Wailea). The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kiowai\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buffet breakfast was very nice and problem-free, especially since there were no crowds and it was part of a Makena promotional package available while we were there. Lunch items at the pool are good but not cheap. The big advantages of the Makena are the excellent beach, the well-designed structure (I think almost all rooms have at least some view of the ocean), the pretty grounds, the quiet laid-back atmosphere, the lack of pretentiousness, and the good value. Our room looked like it had been recently refurbished, it was nice and fully functional, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it opulent. The pool was clean and uncrowned when we were there, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have things like caves and slides that appeal to kids. At the risk of over-generalizing, I think that while the Makena welcomes families with kids of all ages, this property appeals most to adults who prefer a quiet almost serene venue. For us, we like Maui in general and the Wailia-Makena area in particular. When we were there recently, the Makena was far-and-away the best value in that area, and we enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California City, California", "Title": "\u201cOn the upswing.\u201d", "Author": "wanderlust5532139", "ReviewID": "UR121325071", "Content": "This place is is in the middle of a renovation which explains the bargin we got on it. It was a great value and it seemed like we had the hotel to ourselves compared with other resorts in the area. Our room was partially renovated with a new living area/bedroom but the bathroom was still out of the early 80's. that was not a big deal at all as we were prepared for the really dated appearance seen in some of the pictures on other sites. The pictures from other reviewers and sites did not do the rooms justice at all. When the full renovation is complete this property will shine. We were given a complimentary ocean-view upgrade. We enjoyed the complimentary Escalade service to local attractions and hotels; nice touches which show this resort is aiming for a five-star rating. The only negative I have is the restaraunt. We went for breakfast twice and the first time not one table was cleared or attempted to be cleared during the entire time we ate. It become pretty gross when birds are flying on the table next to you and landing to eat the eggs off the last person's plate. We thought it might have been a fluke, but when we returned a few days later it was the same scenario, only this time the restaraunt's hostess seemed too overwhelmed to even seat people. It seems like such a small issue that could easily be rectified with a few key hirings and an astute manager. This isn't a deal breaker for the hotel, just an FYI. Otherwise, everyone was very friendly and accomodating. Lucky at the pool bar was great, and the massages above the beach were amazing. this should be a great time to enjoy some of the best of the renovation without the full cost of upgrades.

As we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and shown to our room. We found all staff to be very friendly and hospitable and willing to help in any way they could. We were located on the second floor with a view of the park like gardens and pool area as well as Makena bay with Molikini on the horizon. The beach was small but almost exclusive to the resort. The snorkeling, right off the resort, was one of the best in Maui. The fact that you could grab hotel supplied towel(s) and in a minute be on the sands of the beach to lay back on one of the beach chairs or jump in for a quick swim was truly fantastic. We also enjoyed several walks from the resort to Makena Landing, as well as, to the black sand beach by the large cinder cone, south. We were not impressed with the restaurants offerings at the hotel. The buffet offered plenty of very average quality food and at $25 per person was not worth it. The drinks at the pool bar were great but at $8 per, on average, would be very easy to run up a huge tab. We loved our room and it's location however, we were taken aback by the additional and mandatory $25 + tax, per day for extras that frankly, should have been included in the original cost. For example, this additional cost covered the use of an in-room safe and a small fridge, two bottles of water (18 cents each at Costco)daily, a three cup serving of, make yourself, coffee, daily newspaper at the small coffee shop, hotel parking, access to two computers for guests which always seemed to be in use by others, also access to a health club, and valet parking. Valet parking was \"free\" but still expected to be tipped. This service also offered to print out our airline boarding passes but, when I inquired of the concierge I was informed to go print them myself. I have been to several other hotels and resorts where these services were all included. There were several rooms going thru' some major renovations on our floor making for quite a lot of noise from re-tiling, etc. At times the noise made it difficult for us to stay in our room.

The staff were also friendly, but I don't think any of them went out of their way, which was fine since I just wanted to relax. The pool area is very small and most back yard pools are nicer (except the view), so I would hope the hotel has plans to completely remove and replace this with a much larger and more lush pool area that would complement a hotel of this size. Most notably, the rooms leave MUCH to be desired. I think it is very misleading to call any of the rooms \"Beautified\" or \"Renovated\". Although I am sure they are an improvement from what they were when the resort was acquired, they are unacceptable at this price point. Although they don't have wallpaper, popcorn ceilings, or tired linens....the hollow and extremely cheap interior doors and the bathrooms are just disgustingly unappealing. To slap some granite and new fixtures in and call it renovated just isn't right. They need to gut the bathrooms to the studs and replace the interior doors, and after that I would return. Even many hotels that just put in new ceramic tile in an interesting pattern create a warm and inviting space, it doesn't have to be top of the line marble. I also think the granite color they chose is a mistake...it doesn't go with the rooms and it is stark and cold. A beige color marble or granite would be better suited based on everything else going on in the rooms. Waste of money with that in my opinion. They aren't making the necessary investment that they need to in order to create a repeat clientele that has helped many Hawaiin resorts prosper, which is unfortunate since I know the management is trying hard to thrive. If I were involved in managing this property I would do whatever it takes to do the bathrooms right the first time and stop wasting money on these petty bathroom \"beatifications\". If they rip out and replace the tile/tubs/showers now, they will obviously spend more money, but it will dramatically change the feel of the room and create a totally relaxing environment in the room & resort as a whole. I wanted to like this hotel, but it just irks me that they are cheaping out on the remodel, and makes me wonder where else they might be sacrificing (i.e. food quality, quality of cleaning detergent for linens, etc.). A nice bathroom is a big deal for a lot of people, especially after spending so much money to travel to Hawaii, so if you don't care about this or can get a good deal and manage, then go here. I wouldn't say it is a luxury resort, but somewhere in the 3-3.5 star range. Hopefully they will modify their renovation plan for the bathrooms and do the pool, making it more in the 4 star range. They wouldn't have to spend all that much, their relatively moderate point in Wailea would still be attractive, which would be a win-win for guests and management.

Before booking I looked over many of the reviews here and since the majority were positive and since we'd never stayed in the Wailea area before we went for it. The resort, which is on a gorgeous piece of property with it's own spacious and private feeling beach, does seem a bit down on it's heels. The former Maui Prince Hotel, it is in need of updating and seems a bit cold since it all seems to be be painted the same boring color of off white everywhere. Our room, partially updated, is still in serious need of a designer's touch. (Those lamps, Costco?) For example, in the entire room, there is one picture, a small one over the sofa. That being said, it is still a very nice place to stay. Their owners just need to pump some money (likely lots of it) into the infrastructure. Compared to the mega-resorts in Maui, this one needs to catch up. Our room was clean and comfortable and had a great view of the ocean and pool area. The staff is very nice and very willing to please. The dining room crew is great and Lucky out at the pool bar is a treasure. If you go you have to try one of his \"Dancing Koi\" drinks. He won an award in Japan with that drink and my wife, who's really not a drinker, wanted one for breakfast the morning following her first one at pool side. The breakfast buffet is great and more than adequate. We enjoyed the Saturday night Japanese buffet. Yes, the main restaurant is closed for repairs making the open air \"coffee shop\" the main eating venue. It's great for breakfast and lunches but not very elegant at dinner time. We played at the golf course once. Despite a negative review I saw here, we thought it was great. A Robert Trent Jones Jr. design, there are no houses built along the course and the natural use of the landscape available is fantastic. The views of the ocean all the way to Lana'i are great. Lee and Richard at the course were great. The pace was timely, not slow like a lot of resort courses. That cold, damp, fragrant towel when we came off the course was a God send! The afternoon rates are a real value in the area. By the way, the morning before we arrived at the Makena from Kona-Kailua, I noticed a better deal on their website. I called their 800 number and was courteously upgraded to the current offering, which by the way, was a great deal compared to other, fancier Wailea properties. Years ago I stayed at the Kaanapali Hyatt which is a fantastic property. My wife hadn't seen it so we drove there and toured the facility. Major construction going on! Tiny beach, hordes of tourists, golf course wedged between the highway and the resort strip. We were happy to get back to the Makena, where, despite it's flaws was quiet, friendly, beautiful and a great deal to boot! I like that someone at the Makena responds to these reviews too.

The antispetic lobby was anything but welcoming. If I were to stand on one side of the lobby and yell, \"Echo,\" it would have reverberated through the entire floor. A few suggestions, this is Maui, spruce up the lobby with plants, flowers, anything tropical and gorgeous. Add a little music. Perhaps add a small lobby bar. Anything to add a little charm would be a good change. We checked into our room and realized that it did not fit our reservation - it was neither ocean front nor renovated. The following morning we requested a room change to meet our original reservation. They did move us to an ocean front and apparently, a renovated room. I was curious as to what they renovated - perhaps they changed the bed linens and replaced the television sets? Neither of the rooms looked anything like the renovated rooms on the website. The overall feel of the bathroom reminded me of the dank basement we had in the 1970s - the original flimsy wood doors were maintained (throughout the unit), the tiling was old and depressing, and the shower flooded everytime we stepped in. The breakfast buffet was one of two good points. The staff was extremely friendly, really on top of things, and the food was delicious. We found the best views in the hotel to be in the breakfast room. Unfortunately, that was also the lunch and dinner room as the main restaurant was closed. We were told it was a temporary close as it had flooded but from reading other reviews - sounds like the close lasted longer than two weeks. The second of two good points was the beach area - beautiful, pristine, and quiet. It was the perfect place to spend a relaxing late afternoon watching the sunset. We genuinely felt as far from the busier parts of Maui as we were. Yes, we did get a great deal to stay at this hotel, however, it was not enough of a deal. My husband and I are in our mid-30's and wanted a relaxing, semi-luxurious hotel to prepare for a new baby on the way. Makena felt more like a resort for college travelers or people on a very fixed budget (backpackers, etc.) that have few other alternatives. I hate to say it, but in the evenings, the lobby felt like the one from a famous movie in which the main character slips into a deep depression and attempts to hurt his family - yes, you know the one.

We just spent ten days at the resort--it was our second vist there. We will definitely return, and recommend it to all of our fellow SUPers (Stand Up Paddleboarders) and all other travellers to Maui. The staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to meet your requests. The ambience is older, elegant, laid-back Hawaii and does not have the fake Disneyland feel of some of the larger hotels on the island. The gardens are beautiful, the lobby a little sparse but pleasant and open. A few more decorations and flowers would be nice. Renovations were being done while we were there, and we weren't disturbed. Who stays in the room during the day when on Maui anyway? Our room was ocean front, comfortable, nicely furnished, and the view is stunning--you can see the beach, the volcano, the ocean, and other islands. There's so many things to do there--the beach is long and beautiful with very few people during the week. A few more folks were playing on the beach on the weekends, which is to be expected, but wasn't a detraction from the experience. The people working at the beach house are friendly, helpful, informative and lots of fun! There are many activities--we spent most of our days on our SUPs going up and down the coast--it is so beautiful. It's a great beach for swimming, and the snorkeling is awesome--lots of coral, fish, turtles, and dolphins. We heard about the whales that went by, but didn't see them this time. Generally the wind picks up in the afternoon, as it does everywhere in Hawaii, so get up early for water activities. The breakfast was very good, as was dinner--the setting is so pleasant by the pond and gardens. We enjoyed lunch many times at the pool bar & restaurant. Great fish tacos. Make sure you have one of Lucky's \"Dancing Koi\" drinks at the pool bar and watch the sunset. We would suggest having live Hawaiian music at the bar when it reopens, and are glad to hear it will be open-air with ocean view . We love this resort and definitely plan on returning. We do have one concern--because we SUP for so many hours every day, and want to have the option to travel to other beaches with our SUPs, we rent our boards at a surf shop for the entire vacation and bring them to the hotel with us. The staff has very kindly let us keep our boards down by the beach shack. We have heard that management is concerned about this, as there is always a possibility of theft wherever you may be. We understand that this is our responsibility, not the hotel's, and hope we can continue to store our boards there. If in the future, board storage is not allowed, this would be our only issue for not returning. If necessary, the resort should offer a waiver stating that this is the guests' responsibility. Since this sport is growing so fast, and with the X-Terra games being held on the island, this will become a larger market in the future, and hopefully the resort will embrace this. You can't go wrong choosing this resort for your stay on Maui!

Situated near the end of the road at Makena Beach south of the posh Wailea resort area, guests choosing this hotel will find a quiet haven with newly updated rooms, updated lobby, and a staff that embodies the Aloha Spirit. The cavernous yet somewhat sparse lobby sports a newly opened Concierge Desk, and bare areas are filling up with new sofa and chair \"conversation pit\" seating. New management has a \"green\" thumb and has refurbished the furnishings in the rooms to their former glory rather than starting from scratch. Kudos for the conservation efforts. Rooms are pleasant and spacious, with convenient refrigerators (no mini bar...most folks don't use them anyway) and bar area with coffee maker (Starbucks blends) and ice bucket. Beds are comfortable (if a bit soft), with crisp white sheets and cushy pillows, and there's a comfy chair and ottoman along with writing desk, bureau for clothes storage, clock/radio/CD player and flat screen televisions. Lanai's are spacious, so they dwarf the small round table and two chairs situated on them. Heads-up on \"ocean view rooms\", as for some you may have to stand in the corner of your lanai and turn your head to see water, but in fact, they do have views of the ocean. Breakfast is currently served buffet style in the Cafe Kiowai (which also serves as the current dinner restaurant), and it's very plenitful and good quality, with fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, omelet station and made-to-order eggs, waffles, hot dishes including scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, steamed rice, oatmeal, and daily changed selections. The Sunday Brunch is apparently a popular local event. Currently, the only other open establishments for a snack are the Barista 5400 coffee shop (serving Starbucks) in the lobby, or, the poolside snack bar. Speaking of pools...there are two small, perfectly round pools, one 6 feet in depth and the other a \"baby pool\". New lounge chairs and tables grace the concrete decking, and pool attendants bring guests cold lemon infused towels and ice pops throughout the afternoon, which is a nice touch. The draw here is not the pool, but the spectacular stretch of beach just steps away. Here, swimmers and snorkelers, paddlers and divers, will find their own piece of heaven. The area is known as \"Turtle Alley\", so endangered green sea turtles frolic off shore, as well as spinner dolphins, and during the whale season humpback whales come to play. We were fortunate to have seen one of the first whales arriving to the area the first week of November, when one small male humpback was spotted off shore flapping his tail and giving us a show. What a thrill! Back to reality...folks, this is a quiet resort, far from the madness of the throngs on Kaanapali Beach. If you are looking for quiet, this is your place. Great shopping and other dining is a short drive away in the Wailea or Kihei area, so no worries. You will need a car here if you are wanting to explore the island on your own, however, if you are just going to relax and stay put a while, the hotel has on-demand car service to the Shops at Wailea for shopping/dining options. If you are looking for a lively hotel with lots going on, this is not for you. But, if you want quiet and solitude, you'd do well here. There are some great deals going no right now to drum up business, so call your local travel agent for the current promotion and come over to visit the best kept secret on Maui!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottetown, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely and great value\u201d", "Author": "MrsDuckie", "ReviewID": "UR120400782", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for our first 3 nights in Maui.

So things are a bit uneven. This place is the end of the line, literally -- the southernmost hotel in the Wailea/Makena area. It is a big, grand, nicely appointed, but mostly soulless place that conjures a Vegas hotel on the beach. On our arrival mid-day, there was exactly one front desk clerk at a big long check-in counter. But then, there were hardly any people staying in the hotel. This is one of those places that aims to nick you on most everything they can. Resort fee? Sure, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153included items\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are things you would expect to be free most places (e.g. fitness center access). Internet fee on top of that? You bet. About $20 per day, per computer (no sharing). Want to use some snorkeling gear or a paddleboard? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to pay, a lot. Normally there are apparently two restaurants in the hotel. Due to rehab of the main restaurant, only one restaurant (the breakfast/lunch restaurant) was open for dinner. Menu was quite limited and the place looked like, well, a breakfast restaurant. Noticed steam tables in the middle of the dining area and asked about them. Those are for the breakfast buffet. How much? For the full buffet, $25. For cold items only, $20. But she did advise you could order a la carte. We never dined there. There was a pool bar that stayed open until about 6. There was the breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant that was open until 9 or so. After that, there was not one place to have a drink. No bar, no place to gather in the late evening. No doubt the main restaurant and bar will reopen, but what can you say about a place that is open for guests, in a fairly remote area, and shuts down all but one restaurant, leaving their guests with only this option on-site? This is a hotel that clearly decided that when it is low season, they are just going to reduce staff and options and you will just have to deal with it. I was at a meeting, but most are traveling to Maui to stay in a premium property. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice beach in front, but no lifeguards. Typical of Hawaii hotels that advertise their beaches, but then just put signs all over the place saying you could die in the water so be careful. There are refrigerators in the rooms that are just for you (no mini-bar rip-off). This is good, but then there are signs at the pool and elsewhere that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring any food or drink with you. So apparently you just have to stay in your room to consume what is in your fridge. There is a spectacular gym. Perhaps the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in terms of workout machines and free weights. Just one workout mat though for the entire place. Strange. Our room was quite large and beautifully appointed, with a big wide deck, and a number of amenities. Very nice actually. The resort was really very quiet. There were very noisy birds in early morning, but this is a natural area and you expect that. Most people, we found, including ourselves, took the convenient hotel shuttles to restaurants in Wailea, but that was as far north as they would go, and their convenience may have had to do with the lack of guests in the hotel. A 15 minute shuttle ride would take you to an upscale mall and hotel restaurants, like Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris. We found much nicer, local, reasonable restaurants in Kihei, like Cuatro and 808 Bistro. Excellent! But a 20 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 25 minute drive away. One benefit of this location is the beautiful Makena State Beach to the immediate south (you have to drive 5 minutes), with lifeguards, but some rather challenging shorebreak. There is also an incredible drive through a lava field and some great snorkeling south of it, if you are adventurous enough to scamper over rocks into the water on your own, with no lifeguards. Maui is a beautiful place, with many wonderful places to stay and eat. This is a remote resort wherein you are more or less marooned. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the size of a Waikiki hotel, without the nearby dining options. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the location of an exclusive hotel, but without most of the accommodation for the fact that you are somewhat trapped. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more along the lines of, we got you here, now you will pay. If money is no object, you might find it pleasant, but if money is no object, you would not select a place like this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that it is totally unpleasant, just lacking in character or intimacy on an island with hotels that offer much more for the cost.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cCustomer service and a great stay\u201d", "Author": "graciesanborn", "ReviewID": "UR120241041", "Content": "We picked this resort off yahoo travel and got a awesome deal!

On our arrival in the afternoon, we got a nice sea shell lei and then we entered a sparsely decorated reception with no welcome drink and in our case - no one at reception. We asked the concierge to call someone so that we could check in and he told us just to wait. Having just arrived from Oahu where service was an 11 out of 10, we were surprised at the lack of urgency. After about 5 minutes, a lady graced us with her presence and checked us in without an apology or a smile. Not a good start. The hotel was extremely quiet - we felt like the only guests, which can be a good thing, but this was more of a sad quiet. we understand that this is the quieter side of Maui but we landed up leaving everyday to find food and entertainment elsewhere. The hotel has apparently changed hands and was formerly the Maui Prince. It's clearly still struggling to find it's feet. Our room was nice and big and the view was good. There was however a major lack of entertainment and ambience. There's no music, sparse decor and a general lack of friendliness unless you happen to frequent the restaurant or pool area. Food at the pool and restaurant is outstanding and it's a pity that there aren't more people coming to the hotel to eat. We left every night to eat elsewhere where entertainment or live music is generally always included. The food at this hotel is miles better than the Hula Grill's though. The beach here is great and while snorkeling, we even got to see sea turtles on 2 out of 2 occasions. My other complaint however is that at a resort, I don't expect to have to pay $20 a day for a beach umbrella. This makes the choice of visiting other beaches easier as you don't get an umbrella there either. So what incentivises guests to stay here at this resort? Not much really. When the term \"resort\" is used in a name, I expect to not have to travel anywhere else as everything should be at my finger tips at a resort. Not here. During happy hour, california rolls are half price. We and a couple on a table next to us, ordered them and they came out in under 5 minutes. Very good california rolls I may add. When we and the other table both ordered a second round of drinks and sushi, we waited until 15 minutes before the end of happy hour to get it. The impression here was that they didn't want us to take advantage of happy hour and would rather have us stop ordering. In my experience, a place this quiet wants to move as much product as possible to keep the guest at the resort, spending at the resort. In our case, it was an attitude of we don't need your money so spend it elsewhere - which is exactly what we did. Which is sad really as this hotel has so much potential.

The bar at the restaurant was a great deal at happy hour and highly recommended. The salmon appetizer was out of this world and the mai tai's were a great price. The view through the bar to the sunset was amazing. We also went to the restaurant for the Sunday brunch. It was clear that a large effort was made to have cuisine at the highest level and we were overjoyed at the quality. The beach in front of the hotel was pleasant and is was very quiet and relaxing. On top of that there were sea turtles!!! At the rock outcropping just in front of the beach access was a large turtle and it came within two feet of me! Before our trip we had heard about the renovations and there were some hiccups and noises that impacted our stay, but nothing that made us upset. Our room was very clean and we were extremely happy with the service. Next time we return to Maui we will be staying at this resort. Also, it is worth getting an ocean front room.

This was our first time to stay at this property and were pleasantly surprised. And while everyone will have their likes and dislikes, overall it was a beautiful hotel, with an amazing beach and most importantly staffed with hard working employees that wanted to insure everyone had a nice time. Truly, every employee we encountered were kind, gracious and truly happy to see you. The good... Ron, at the front desk, was very accomodating. He even offered my travel partner the option of previewing the rooms before determining which one we would stay in. And although we were not given a free upgrade, we were offered an upgrade to a full ocean view for a nominal fee. This same room/view would have cost two to three times at the other Wailea Properties. And the room was much closer to the ocean, you could even hear the waves at night. And every time we passed the front desk, Ron would personally greet us by name. I noticed he did that with most of the guests. Not many hotels can boost that kind of customer service! The room rate included daily breakfast for two, no resort fee (which includes free valet parking), and the hotel offered free computers/printers. Such the deal! Wish the other hotels would offer the same. The valet folks, were very friendly and provided lots of nice tips for local places to dine. The wait for the car was minimal. There was always someone available to get the car. And they also offered free shuttle service to/from the other Wailea properties, shops, golf courses and dining establishments. The rooms were clean, nice linens, and all offered large balconies. Our room had not been updated, but it was still very nice. Like one reviewer said, he would trade all the granite, marble, fancy bathroom fixtures for this quiet little gem of a hotel. I completely agree! The breakfast buffet was hearty and offered an omelette station, fresh fruits, juices, assorted pastries, breakfast meats, potatoes and cold cereal. Plenty of options to hold you over til a late lunch. Marissa was always smiling, made sure our juice glasses never ran low and provided excellent service. We never felt rushed at breakfast and would usually hang around enjoying the beautiful scenery. The bar offered happy hour drinks and appetizers at a reduced rate. Frank made an excellent Mai Tai. He has been with the hotel for a long time and was a wealth of information. If you enjoy massages, be sure to book an afternoon massage at the beach with Rosalyn or Gailyn, they ROCK!!! What do you get when you combine a cool ocean breeze, outdoor massage and the sounds of the ocean...a little piece of heaven. And, the price is actually very reasonable. No upcharge for being outside either. The highlight of the property is the beach area. The sand is silky soft, the water is crystal clear and there are hardly any visitors to this little piece of paradise. I am almost afraid to mention this because I do not want others to visit this beach. :-) The not so good.... The pool area is not great. But like the pool attendant said, why come all the way to Hawaii to sit by the pool? He's right. It's great for dipping, but nothing beats their beach. Now for the .... ridiculous For some reason, this hotel likes to put a hold on your credit card for the estimated charge of your entire stay. And this hold will stay on your credit card for up to 5 to 7 business days after you check out. Needless to say, I was quite surprised when I got home and found over $2,100 on hold on my credit card. I spoke to Mary Jane, in accounting, and was told \"this is how they do it\" and really had no other explanation. After much discussion, she offered to call the credit card call center to see if they could expediate the release of the credit hold. And while, I realize it was not actually charged to my card, this made no logical sense. Especially since one of the holds (for $1,799) was dated AFTER our check out date. Mary Jane never offered to follow up with me as to the outcome and will continue to monitor my credit card activity in the hopes the release will completed in a timely fashion. She could learn a few things on customer service and follow up. Advice for management.... 1. Get rid of this credit card hold. I travel extensively and this is the first time I have ever had a property do this. Including when I stayed at the neighboring properties...Four Seasons, Fairmont, Grand Wailea and Marriott. 2. Offer free one hour snorkel equipment for guests. While your hourly rental cost is minimal, it would be a nice added feature for guests. 3. Purchase some beach cruisers for guests to check out, free of charge. 4. I don't know if the pool attendant does this, but it would be nice if he/she could offer cold hand towels, fresh fruit, juices, etc, through out the day. It's a minimal expense and the nice touch would go along way for those that chose to be by the pool. And for those guests that are not sure, it might give them incentive to visit the pool. And if they are at the pool area, they will be more likely to purchase refreshments and food. In today's world, where everyone is being nickel and dimed to death, it's the little things that guests remember. 5. Keep the bar by the pool area, open til dark. It would have been so nice to have cocktails out there, but it closes at 5:30pm. And if you need to drum up business, offer early happy hour specials by the pool. 6. Turn the outdoor fountains off that are outside the ocean facing rooms at 9pm. It currently turns off at 3:30am and back on by 7am. When the fountain isn't on, you can actually hear the ocean from your room. And since the ocean is a big reason why we all come to Hawaii, let your guests hear it too.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liberty, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDestination Wedding\u201d", "Author": "Brian H", "ReviewID": "UR118973217", "Content": "The Makena Beach & Golf Resort was very accomidating and a great place for me and my wife to stay.

Probably the best food is poolside- except they stop serving at like 5:30 (before it even gets dark) or something like that (note to new owners- I head so many people complain about this- you are losing some serious business). (Another peeve- why don't the restaurants mention if there are nuts or other common allergens in the food like we do on in the rest of the mainland USA. I am allergic to macademia nuts and ate a cookie and was seriously ill afterwards. Food allergies are a serious thing) The pool is small- it wasn't crowded but neither was the hotel. Also there is not hot tub, which is a bit of a bummer. However the beech is amazing and the snorkling is really great.

My boyfriend and I were debating between this resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. We were pleased with our choice for the price. The pros: - Amazing, friendly, helpful staff - the valets gave us great tips every day on where to go and eat (one even discreetly directed us to a nude beach near the hotel that we'd tried unsuccessfully to find. Yeah Little Beach!), We felt genuinely welcomed by everyone we encountered. - The beach - we drove ALL over Maui and agreed that Makena beach was our favorite. We saw amazing, huge sea turtles while snorkeling and kayaking. We also saw a ton of fish. Beach was quiet/peaceful and the surf was gentle - great for all levels of swimmers. - Good ocean views from all of the rooms - we had one of the \"worst\" rooms in the resort - second furthest from the ocean and could still see the ocean from our balcony and had lovely garden and moutain views. Our room was renovated and we found it satisfactory - bathroom still needs work though. The cons: - There were small, gnat-like bugs in our room. I called the front desk about this and they brushed me off. We also saw some larger bugs. Not sure if it was just our room or a resort-wide problem. For the record, my boyfriend had no problem with this given the tropical environment (they were very tiny bugs) BUT if this is 4 stars, I expect no bugs. - The food: the buffet breakfast was yummy but way overpriced. We paid over $50 for our first breakfast. The next day we went into Kihei and paid $20 for an AMAZING breakfast at Kihei Caffe - very chill and delicious. Did dinner one night at the restaurant and it was terrible and we did breakfast a la carte one day and had the worst omlettes ever. - Too quiet. There is no nightlife or excitement here - it was relaxing, but a bit too slow-paced for us overall. Everything shut down by 10pm. For the price and location, I'm still glad we stayed here versus the Fairmont BUT we did eat there one night and had one of the best meals of our entire trip - tied with Spago at the Four Seasons. That said, the beach at Makena is now one of my favorites and the people at the resort were fantastically warm and helpful.

Everyone we met at the resort (especially Ron at the front desk) was always very friendly and accommodating. They seem to take pride in what they do and the resort itself. While older than the surrounding resorts, this is still a great hotel on Maui. Though it is still very well-kept and the new owners are making some improvements to the rooms and facilities. Here is a quick overview from our visit: Rooms: We were in an updated 5th floor room on the south side of the hotel. The room was clean, well-appointed and the view from the lanai was spectacular. Nice touches in the room included a refrigerator, coded safe for valuables, and a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee (something from a local coffee shop like Maui Coffee Roasters would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been cool too). The shower system is also unique and very convenient. Dining: They've improved the hours of restaurant operation, but I think this is still a weakness for the resort. The lobby's coffee shop is great, but the restaurant and poolside food service could be better for the property. The staffs are friendly and courteous, but there seemed to be some confusion with poolside service procedures and the food offerings are not all that memorable. We attended the Sunday buffet and were pleased with the prime rib and suckling pig (fabulous), but a bit disappointed the creme brulee had vanished from dessert offerings. Pool / Beach: The beach is top-notch, stunningly-beautiful, relatively uncrowded and only 30 yards away. Off the left (south) side of the beach is also a good reef to see fish and even turtles. The resort's beach shack also has friendly folks who can facilitate beach activities as well. If you're more of a \"pool person\", you'll likely be disappointed - the pool is rather small compared to other resorts. Other Facilities: The resort also has good coin-operated laundry facilities. Their workout room is really well-equipped, they had comparable equipment to our Gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gym back home (just newer). It was so nice, we actually felt guilty not using it during our stay. The grounds are also very clean and well-manicured. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the resort, the staff is always friendly and the facility clean and well-kept.

PLEASE read the entire review, and you won't regret it! Negatives: 1. The rooms are outdated, BUT they are clean and the hotel is being renovated! This process should be done by February, according to the staff. 2. The only free internet service is provided by two computers in the lobby, where teenagers spend much of their time, unless you pay a daily fee for internet service in your room. 3. The on-site restaurants were mediocre, BUT Frank, the bartender at Molokini Bar and Grille, served delicious mai-tais and half-off appetizers every day between 5:30 and 6:30. 4. The Starbucks in the lobby (called by another name) doesn't offer the full Starbucks menu. Positives: 1. The staff from arrival to departure was AMAZING, super friendly, and knowledgeable. Upon check-in, we were given a free upgrade to a room with a king-size bed and FULL ocean view (shoutout to Ron). After an issue with smokers in the room above us, the staff graciously offered us another room with the same accommodations. At the poolside bar and cafe, Lucky, the bartender, was extremely enthusiastic and spoke to us like old friends! He mixed up an award winning blended cocktail drink called Dancing Koi and another simply called Lucky Special! Both were delicious. The valet service were also extremely friendly, interested in our daily adventures, and shared some helpful tips (shoutout to Thomas and Ed-something -- sorry!). 2. The private beach was AMAZING. It was never crowded, and we loved the fact that people from other resorts would pay for a seat on a sunset cruise that sat 100 yards away from our beach! That should speak for how beautiful the sunsets were from own secluded beach. The beach activity center also provided a variety of equipment and lessons. The rates were pretty decent, too! If you snorkel about 60 yards away from the shoreline on the north side of the beach, you may find our turtle friend! We also saw lots of tropical fish and beautiful coral reefs. 3. If you're looking for a private getaway hotel, this is the one for you! It is the LAST resort on the southwest side of Maui, just a few miles past the overcrowded Wailea resorts. It's quiet and accommodating, but not too far if you want to do touristy things. Although we didn't use it, Makena also provides a shuttle service to Wailea. TIP -- rent a car and enjoy the scenery and beauty of Maui as you drive from place to place! Overall, we loved staying here. It was quiet, the staff was great, and the price we paid matched! If you're looking for a secluded hotel where you can relax on a private beach and enjoy beautiful sunsets every night... and if you don't mind exploring the island of Maui by driving... stay here and you'll fall in love with this place! Before we landed back home, we were already discussing plans to revisit and watch the whales at sunset!", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201c*****FANTASTIC!****\u201d", "Author": "ssmosley", "ReviewID": "UR116362910", "Content": "My daughter and I had stayed at this place twice back in 2003 when it was called Maui Prince Hotel and i was \u00c2\u00a0delighted to be back here again with my daughter and our friend, Donna. The resort is located in the upscale area of Makena/Wailea amid a beautifully-landscaped grounds. The facilities have undergone a great deal of renovation and upgrades; all rooms are spacious and very tastefully furnished, each with its own lanai, safe deposit box, refrigerator, coffee maker and flat screen TV. Each room has a large bathroom with a separate tub and a shower stall. Beautiful coy ponds and oriental gardens surround the guest rooms. The staff members, from Bell desk to Reception, Concierge and beyond were extremely friendly, accommodating and attentive and made our stay very joyful. This hotel has a beachside swimming pool and private beaches, guest laundry facilities (coin-operated as well as valet) and 4 restaurants. Golfers will feel in heaven on the fairways of the resorts beautiful golf club overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Haleakala dormant volcano. The resort does also offer a complimentary shuttle to Wailea shopping center. A FEW FACTS: 1. They charge a $27.00 a day resort fee payable directly to the resort and that fee includes daily valet parking 2. There's no Free or wireless Internet in the resort, the connection in the rooms comes with a whopping $14.99 fee per 24 hours and is payable to the cable provider via a credit card. There are 2 computers in the lobby for free Internet access but they are available on a first-come, first-served basis. One possibility to get free in-room Internet service is to join their frequent guest program called \"Iprefer\" which is free of charge, but inquire at the resort if that entitles you to free Internet at the time of your stay. 3. If you're using a credit or debit card to cover your incidentals, the resort puts a hold of $100 per each day of your stay on your card/account and the unused portion will be released upon your departure. DINING: This was the only area I was not so enthused about this resort! Compared to the quality, I found the $26.00 for the breakfast buffet, or the $53.00 for the Japanese buffet rather excessive and unjustified. There's a Starbuck's in the lobby that you may want to opt for or one of the many restaurants at Wailea shopping center (2.5 miles/10 minute drive) or in Kihei (roughly 20 minutes away but plenty of great and inexpensive dining places). All in all, we loved our stay at Makena Beach and Golf Resort and would gladly stay there again and recommend it highly to everyone.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201c5-star service - great place to get away from it all!!\u201d", "Author": "jmt1177", "ReviewID": "UR116269612", "Content": "I booked our stay at the Makena through a discount travel site and we were beyond thrilled with the quality of service we received and the accommodations we stayed in - given the price of a lot of the resorts on Maui, it was the best value we had our entire trip.

We did not take advantage of the restaurants on-site or the golf & tennis amenities. We did take an evening stroll on the beach and it was beautiful.

The gift shop in the lobby has a pretty extensive selection of souvenirs, clothing and food/beverages - if you forgot anything, chances are you can pick it up there. You won't be disappointed by the resort's location, either. It's in a quiet part of the island but there is plenty of shopping and some amazing restaurants nearby so you don't have to go far to find things to do.

THE GOOD: The staff was beyond friendly and was very accommodating. The rooms were comfortable and clean. No complaints there. We had an ocean view room which was facing the ocean and also the undeveloped forest like proeprty next door. It was kind of cool because we heard a variety of bird noises all day and night. It felt like we were in the middle of a jungle. Also, the hotel has a little private beach that never got too crowded. They offer board rentals and have chairs and a snack bar outside. THE BAD: The hotel was that the hotel was under construction and we weren't told about it until we got there. The pool was being resurfaced and was closed the whole time we were there. They were renovating the room next door so we heard saws and hammering one of the days which was a bit annoying. I spoke with the manager and she kindly gave us a credit for the normal $25/day resort fees that are usually charged. The other negative is the restaurant in the hotel called Cafe Kiowai. We went down for breakfast and it was a bit ridiculous. The waitress kept pushing the $25 buffet on us. We told her that we just wanted some eggs and coffee. The omelet were about $16 which is expected, but the coffee was $8 for a small or $12 for a large. I asked why they would charge so much when there is a Starbucks in the hotel and she kept saying, \"see its better to get the buffet\".

(We did NOT stay here during this trip, although we did stay here several years ago when it was still the Maui Prince Hotel. We enjoyed that stay very much.) The hotel grounds are gorgeous, and the beach at the hotel is beautiful and pretty empty. The entire experience with the Outrigger Canoe activity was exceptional, largely due to the wonderful staff at check-in and our tour guides. This activity is basically a Hawaiian canoe ride with TWO tour guides on your canoe all to yourself! You can't get a more private tour than this. The staff and tour guides are professional, courteous, and made sure that we felt comfortable from the moment we checked in. While on the canoe, the main guide provided very detailed information on everything that we saw and answered any questions that we had. They explained everything from plants to lava to fruits to fish to Hawaiian history. Our guide even chanted these beautiful Hawaiian chants for us while we rowed, making us feel like we were truly immersed in the Hawaiian culture for just a moment. The best part was seeing a few sea turtles up close when we stopped to snorkel. When I say close I mean I could have reached over and touched it! That was quite a breathtaking experience. Unfortunately I did get seasick towards the middle/end of the trip, so I asked the guides to stop snorkeling and row us back. They were very understanding and once we returned to the beach, they stayed with us until my nausea got better. I think most people are OK with being on the ocean, but for motion-sensitive people, it's better to take your Dramamine beforehand -- no matter how \"calm\" the ocean looks, there is still bobbing!

We love the resort and it's location, primarily because the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. The common areas and our rooms have always been clean. While the resort is a more remote than others, we consider that a plus because the area is quiet. The adjacent Maluaka Beach is one of the best on the island with excellent snorkeling. There are off-site dining and shopping opportunities close by (within 5 minutes) to supplement the on site restaurant choices and all are accessible by the resort's shuttle service. All the activities of Kehei are within a 10 minute drive. We considered doing taxi and taking advantage of the shuttle service, but decided a rental car would be more convenient and cost effective for our stay. The other plus, as a runner, I enjoy starting my morning running along Makena Alanui road, much of which is along the water. There are very few cars early in the morning, the route is shaded until the sun rises over Haleakala, and the shoulder is soft and wide in some spots. While the hotel is a bit dated, it is going through a renovation. We were a little worried that the renovation would impact our stay, but we barely knew the renovation was going on.

Because of false advertisement of policy at the chain resort, we checked out of the chain the next morning . . . things were not looking good. We used our Frommer's Guide to try to find another resort on Maui for our next 6 nights. Frommer's listed this resort, formerly known as Maui Prince as an 2.5 star rating at the end of its list of resort listings. Going down the list and fearing that we were going to have to hotel hop (Kea Lani could put us up for 4 nights), we finally got to the end of the list and this listing. From the moment the reservationist answered our call, everything went \"right.\" Even though she didn't show an availability for 6 nights, understanding our dilemma, she put us on hold to speak with upper management and successfully secured us a room with balcony for the entire 6 nights for around $300 per night which included 24 hr. internet service, resort fee and valet parking (as we found at the chain all of this is very pricey). Given our situation (Maui for 6 nights and no lodging), we left the chain and headed south fearing what shape 2.5 stars meant. When we pulled into the resort, we thought for certain we were at the wrong place . . . it was beautiful, just like you would imagine an Hawaiian resort, the grounds beautifully landscaped. We were greeted at the entrance with leis, the first we had received since arriving in Hawaii. We went to the front desk and Ron greeted us warmly and seemed to know in advance of our prior troubles (my husband was still fuming about the chain) and entertained us with assurances and calm. At 9 a.m. our room was not ready and we certainly understood that since we had made the reservation 30 minutes earlier. In the meantime, Ron encouraged us to have breakfast and use the property while the room was being readied. We were greeted to a changing room with full bath, so that we could use the pool and beach and our valuables were safely locked up for us. The lobby areas were refreshing, breezy and really pretty with great Koi ponds. From the moment we pulled into the resort, our vacation was saved and wonderful, thanks to the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. The room with a giant balcony and oceanview was large and roomy and all amenities (coffee make, mini-frig, hairdryer, safe) were provided Our room was bright, clean and airy. We noticed that the rooms will be being redecorated during 2011, but our accommodations were great, very pleasantly appointed. The layout of the hotel and rooms are great, all the rooms seem to have an oceanview and through your room entrance, a view of the gorgeous mountainside. The gift-shop had everything one needed and was very reasonably priced. They stock sodas, chips, cookies, beer, and even stocked my favorite Merlot. There is also a coffee bar (Starbuck's coffee) with freshly made picnic foods, here the hotel offers a complimentary local newspaper Monday thru Saturday. All service was friendly, expedient and excellent. I ordered room service coffee every morning, breakfast on the balcony and late afternoon cocktails (and the room service staff seemed to anticipate my call). They seemed to know who I was and what I wanted. The food on site was excellent. An extraordinary breakfast buffet was available with inside/outside dining everyday. The Molokini Bar & Grill for the evening was excellent, some of the best food I've eaten and Celia, our waitress, was a sweetheart. The oceanside spa was excellent and had a great massage by well-trained therapist, I melted into nirvana while inhaling a wonderful aroma under a soft ocean breeze. The beach, ah, one of the largest in Maui. Unlike the chain resort with no real beachfront, the Makena Beach & Golf Resort fronted a very big and deep beach. We stayed at the Kea Lani in 2001 and this 5 star at the time fronts a very small beach but big pools - why go to the ocean to sit at a pool; we have a pool at home. And location, location, location: at the very end of Wailea, but this is a good thing too; it is the last resort along resort-row, just above Makena Beach and Oneloa (Big Beach), making it away from the most congested tourist and shopping traffic.

The beach was amazing but could use some new comfy lounge chairs, otherwise we spent a few afternoons tanning, swimming and watching the whales. The food here was excellent in my opinion, wether it was at the poolside for lunch or at the Molokini bar for drinks and dinner. The breakfast buffet was nice with a good selection but it is hit or miss depending on the morning as not every morning did they have someone available at the ommolette station to cook so you had to order from your server so your eggs came out after you were finished your breakfast. The buffet was way to expensive for what was offered ( 25.00 pp). The hotel has a nice sized gift shop with reasonable prices, starbucks for morning coffee, computers in the lobby. The whole resort was kept very clean and tropical. The staff at the valet parking were wonderful, friendly and most helpful. Overall i believe once the room renovations are complete this hotel will be a 5 star resort. The location is nice because it's out of the way, quiet and has the real Hawaii tropical feel i like.

Obviously I was hoping for the GW but was aware of the Makena's great location and the fact that it was on the beach. After reading reviews before we ever got to Maui, I was expecting an outdated hotel with some issues. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Yes, it it older and outdated but it is very clean (at least our room and the public areas were), the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the beach is outstanding. Yeah, the pool is small and the hot tub(s) is/are above-ground, but that was all expected. My only real problem was that the walls are very thin and you can easily hear others around you from your room. My wife and I always travel with ear plugs so that was never a real problem for us. Since we didn't have a rental car we ate dinner at the Molokini bar & grill and it was better than I expected, and they had great live music during dinner. You are still paying Maui prices, however. This resort is going to be fantastic when the renovations are done. The overall layout of the hotel is great and like I've said it's in a nice, secluded location with a great beach.

The Good: Service- 99% of the hotel employees are extremely helpful and want to make your stay pleasant. This includes front desk/housekeeping/valets. The only place the service was bad was at the hotel pool/pool bar. The hotel needs to add more staff to this area. There were only 2 people working 15 dining tables plus all the pool lounge chairs, about 50-80. The were running around doing their best but the were under staffed. Location- We loved how close this resort is Makena Beach. This is the closest resort to the beach. It's also not far from Wailea and the resorts, shops and restaurants of that area. Kihei is also about a 15-20 minute drive. The Bad: Needs to be remodeled- The hotel has a board in the lobby showing you all the updates that are planned. I'm glad to see the resort has this planned.

Having said that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. This was my first trip to Hawaii. We chose the beautiful island of Maui for many reasons, and we chose the Wailea-Makena area for its quiet and secluded location. We chose the Makena Beach and Golf Resort because it is the last resort on the south side, offering a quiet and private feel. We also felt the rates were very reasonable, as we had lots of activities planned and did not expect to spend much time sitting in a hotel while we were on the island of Maui.

Check-in was very easy, and we were in our large room in a matter of minutes. We opened the large patio doors and listened to the ocean, and woke to the most amazing view of whales dancing in the bay!!! We slept with the patio doors open each night, and the ocean lulling us to sleep!! The bed was the most comfortable I have had in a hotel, and house-keeping had our room cleaned early each morning. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food prices to be comparable with other restaurants on the island. The pool bar was entertaining\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. And the specialty drinks were delicious! Because we had a refrigerator in the room, we were able to drive to Safeway and purchase items to have on hand for picnics and excursions. It was a nice amenity. The most amazing part of the entire resort is the beach!!! The feels like a private beach, and the hotel offers great amenities! The guys at the beach house are fabulous!!! They are very knowledgeable, enjoy the water, and watch for guest safety at the same time. We rented kayaks and had the most amazing whale encounter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

The last time we stayed here was in '08 when it was still the \"Maui Prince\". We had a great stay then, and we were hoping that our stay this time under new managment would be just as great. We were not disappointed. We had a little problem with our room when checking in, only because we had requested a double room when making the reservation, and at check-in we were given a king room. We were getting a little upset b/c I clearly booked a double room on my reservation for our comfort, and the front desk clerk was not being extremely helpful. After a few minutes in our King Room, we decided to go back down and re-request the double room we booked. There was another clerk working the desk, and he was most helpful in moving around our reservation and giving us a great double oceanfront room that we had requested. We were satisfied going forward with our room. It was very clean throughout. I did not see one bug in the room the entire time except an occasional mosquito that would come in at times b/c the lanai was open. The room was spacious, and the the beds were wonderful and plush. We ate a couple of times at the Molikini Lounge downstairs. As anywhere in Maui, the food is a little pricey but convenient and very good. The waitresses at the restaurant were so warm and friendly to talk to, we felt like we've been friends forever. The Mai Tai's at both the restaurant and pool are the best to be found on Maui. Lucky the pool bartender was so friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable being there. The guys at the activity hut were so friendly as well and helped get us the proper gear for snorkeling. The beach is one of a kind, and great for swimming and snorkeling. All in all, it was a wonderful stay, and I know it will be even more amazing once the remodel is complete.

Also the balcony was nice - a semi-waterfront room the furniture is older out on the lanai/balcony but the view is GORGEOUS! At the price point this is the most affordable location and gorgeous property (although yes it is looking a bit tired). The few cons were the food was fairly awful; we ate at the pool side bar and it was fine but for dinner tried the more casual of the two restaurants as sushi wasn't what we felt like (there are only two dinner location options). The food was bad - like beyond average - similar to what you would get in a large american chain restaurant or a Kelseys in Canada...the prices are also very high for the basic food. Also the casual restaurant looks like an awful convention room - not sexy, polynesian or hawaiian at all...you can't even really say a sports bar (although there were a few large tv's over the bar). That room REALLY needs an update or image decision! lol Other than the restaurant (our server was very sweet at the restaurant although very nervous - and I worked in the hotel industry for years so I know what newbie nerves are when dealing with guests) and a weird moment at lunch when our waitress at the poolside walked up to us out of nowhere and looked off into space and said \"someones gone in the water\" stating a man was lost - then when I asked someone else it was a misunderstanding between a husband and wife..she was a bit odd... BUT!!!! really you can go elsewhere for dinner there are so many other options and for the price overall the room was spotless, bed so comfy, towels were fluffy and ready to go whenever we needed them I would recommend this place no problem..It's NOT five star but it doesn't claim to be - it's also significantly less expensive than some of the other hotels in Wailea/Makena (the Grand Wailea really starts around $500/night for a basic room if they are even available) so keep in mind that it is reflected in the price point.

WoW I was pissed but what really got me angry was we realized our flight the last day was a late night flight they would not accommodate us they did allow my very Sick mother in law to stay in here room but the manager I spoke with did not seem to really care about our issue he was nickel and dimming to get an extra 50.00 to stay later which is unacceptable considering they charge a 25.00 a day fee for nothing it's a crock fee they slap on cause they can they give you water and free valet and a tiny gym we never used which should be included in my opinion that's like renting a room and charging for sheets on the bed geeshh!!!

When we arrived, we were greeted with a lei made of shells with a warm welcome from everyone we passed at the lobby. We booked our stay through Priceline (a bid) so we were unsure what kind of room and what view we'll be given. To our delightful surprised, we found our room to be spacious, clean, with partial golf course / ocean view. The bedroom area was spacious enough to fit a king size bed, a long sofa with coffee table, a writing desk, and the usual hotel furniture. It also had a real balcony in which you could actually walk about (not the tiny stand-up balcony) complete with a decent size patio set (not the tiny cafe/bistro set) with a couple of benches and drying rack to dry your swim suits. There's a separate area for a double door closet to hang your clothes, a small fridge, and a long marbel counter that held our daily amenities. I also liked the bathroom that had 2 separate showers (a shower stall and bath tub with shower), so both my husband and I could jump into the shower separately at the same time after a hot day at the beach. So with all of those, how could one consider the room small? Our only complain was the bed. We prefer our bed extra firm, and the bed at the hotel was super soft. The staff let my husband tried out 4 different rooms in search of a firmer bed, then offered to put a bed board underneath our bed that solved the problem. The hotel's landscape was absolutely beautiful and meticulously maintained, and the koi garden in the middle of the hotel was really beautiful. I haven't even mentioned the beach yet, which was never crowded and allowed a lot of rooms for everyone to enjoy. Honestly, I didn't understand what some of the posters expected, and to compare this hotel to those at Wailea is like comparing apples and oranges. I paid less than half at this hotel for what I would have paid at the Grand Wailea! The hotel does charge $25 resort fee a day on top of your room charges that covers services such as: self and valet parking, use of gym facility, your daily room amenities, use of 2 computers and a printer at the hotel lobby, etc. I wish it would cover free wireless internet access too.

Myself and my partner found this resort to be perfect for our Hawaii vacation. The resort is really nice and the garden which fills the atrium area of the hotel is beautifully maintained. The birds fill the palm trees each evening and make lots of noise every morning to greet the rising sun. I thought it added to the tropical feel of the islands. The best amenity was the beach right in front of the resort. It is protected on both sides by the lava rock outcroppings which provides more privacy for the hotel guests and offers awesome snorkeling opportunities. The reef is located just a few yards from the shore and very safe for viewing all those beautiful tropical fish. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Although the furniture could use a facelift don't let that discourage you. The rooms are still nice and the lanai, with it's breathtaking views of the ocean and Molokini crater, more than make up for the lack of fancy decor. With sunny skies and warm temps year round who hangs out in their room anyway? The pool area is small but was certainly big enough to accomodate all the guests without feeling cramped. This place has a feeling of Ohana - warm, intimate and local. Thank goodness it is not a mega resort. All the staff (front desk, maids, valets, and shop attendants) were constantly friendly, helpful and always greeted us with smiles and alohas. Foodwise, we really enjoyed the Sunday Brunch with lots of great variety in the seafoods, salads, typical breakfast dishes, rich desserts not to mention the non-stop flowing of champagne. The pool area has a great lunch menu offering a good size portion of food at a decent value by Hawaii standards. Don't miss out on those frosty tropical lava flow drinks from the pool bar. It is sad to know that this place will only become more popular and expensive as the updates to it's appearance are completed. Nonetheless, we plan to return again and again as it is one of the best kept secrets. Thanks Makena staff for sharing your little piece of heaven with us and making our stay memorable.

The southwest coast of Maui is breathtaking and serene. Most of the year the waters are calm due to the prevailing easterly trades, so kayaking and snorkeling in the area are accessible for people of all comfort levels and the lava fields offer some spectacular hiking trails for all skill levels as well. Now for my review of the resort itself, which was impressively bad. I arrived at 9:30 pm on a Friday night and I'm pretty sure there was only one person working in the entire resort. There was a couple checking in before me and I waited while the front desk clerk checked them in, then got their bags, then apparently valet parked their car. 15 minutes later she helped me and was relatively friendly although clearly frazzled. While checking in I was educated about the $25 per day resort charge that was somehow not included in the room rate. I asked if this was an optional charge and was told it was not, that every guest was required to pay the resort fee. If that's the case why not simply add it to the room rate? This was a bad start. I arrived to my room and found it damp with a strong odor of mildew. The room was so humid that everything felt wet, from the carpet to the bed linens to the towels. The room looked as if it had not been updated in decades, as a result I felt like I had walked onto the set of Caddyshack (circa 1980). The wood veneer was peeling off all the furniture, the paint was chipping off the walls and ceiling in the bathroom, and the tv was a 27\" CRT. When I went to plug in my phone charger behind the nightstand, there was literally 1/2 inch of dust buildup along the entire back wall behind the bed. The final offense was when I turned on my computer to do some work only to find out the in room internet costs $16 per day. All of this would be okay if I were staying at a Motel 6 in Lubbock, TX for $39 a night, but this is a place that bills itself as a 4 star resort and charges close to $300 a night for their most basic room. Totally unacceptable. I strongly advise avoiding the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, there are much better options to be found close by.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGood not Great\u201d", "Author": "Matthieu25", "ReviewID": "UR84949398", "Content": "As I like to start out all my reviews I like to state look at the many reviews I've written. I'm pretty well traveled. I commonly stay anywhere between 2-5 star hotels depending on why I'm traveling. Moving on, this is NOT a 4 star hotel. Anyone who thinks this is higher than a 3 needs to travel more. I firmly believe WHEN the hotel was built around 1986 it was on par with any 5 star on the island, but its very clear that reinvestment within the hotel is not the current focus. The housekeeping does a great job, the room was spotless. As other reviews have mentioned the beds are great. Personally I have a Tempur-Pedic and always look forward to getting home, yet this vacation I didnt. The areas that others have mentioned such as the bathrooms, tile everywhere in the hotel, tvs, the fact that they let people sell things in the lobby, the pool area are were the hotel needs the most help. The overall exterior of the hotel is in desperate need of a paint job, its really sad that they have allowed this once grand hotel to fall into the shape it has. The pool area is very small, but finding a chair is never an issue. One thing I found that REALLY cheapened the hotel is the whole \"towel card\" thing. I understand that there are guests that steal but come on this isn't cancun, anyone that can afford Maui I think will bypass taking your towels. The others that have talked about the resort fee, I feel its pretty standard in many resort areas yet in most resorts internet is part of it and here is wasn't. We did not do the buffet, as we are not buffet people but we did eat in the restaurant and we found the service to be VERY subpar and we only did it once. We did go to Stella Blues a few times, and it is wonderful. Also you will need a car, that really is a must. Overall I would return but I now know what to expect. It was our first time in Maui and it was by far one of the best vacations we have been on.

Service staff that waits on you hand and foot and rooms equiped with the most modern ammenities were not important to us, so please keep this in mind when reading our review.... My husband and I stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort for our honeymoon for one week in mid October 2010 - we booked flight and lodging through Orbitz. When we checked in, we were upgraded to an oceanfront room - and man, was it oceanFRONT! The view was amazing....we went to sleep everynight listening to the waves and saw sea turtles from our balcony. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable....the whole room was clean and we appreciated the \"complimentary\" water bottles everyday. (included in $25/day resort fee) We also liked that the resort had a couple computers for you to search the internet for free - their computers don't allow use of flash drives, so you will need to bring your laptop or go to I-Zone in Kihei if you need to download pictures or do work. The resort grounds are beautiful - asian inspired theme and the beach is wonderful. We went in the off season, so we felt like we had the beach to ourselves. We visited some of the resorts in Wailea and even during the off season, they had crowds and screaming kids running everywhere - you won't find any crowds at Makena! It makes for a perfect honeymoon/anniversary get away location. I saw some complaints on here about the small pools and above ground hot tubs....for us it was perfect - during our week long stay there, we were in the pool a total of ONCE and in the hot tubs every evening...never had to share them with anyone!! The restaurants at Makena...as are at every resort in Maui....expensive ($25/person for breakfast) so we had fun exploring the local places for meals. Homemade Cafe in Kihei has delicious Hawaiin donuts ( malasadas ) and Kihei Cafe has great omlettes and pancakes. Some of the other mornings we just ate pop tarts and granola bars from the Safeway. (side note) If you are going to splurge for dinner one night, though, we highly reccommend the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a at the Grand Wailea - super dining experience!! We also liked the Kihei Mall bars and grills - especially the Tiki Lounge. Ka'anapali/Whaler's Village has some great restaurants too. The Makena Resort's golf clubhouse at the top of the hill has a great menu and beautiful view - it's little pricey, but better than the resort restaurants and we were fine splitting one entree. The Molokini Bar and Grill has a good salad that we split and we had fun playing pool while we waited for our food. The staff at the Makena resort are all very nice and courteous - we always felt our questions were answered and we were given good advice for activities in the area. Makena has a catamaran that takes people on snorkeling excursions to Molokini and Turtle Town, as well as sunset cruises. After some research, we found out that Molokini really isn't worth your money for snorkeling, so we booked a trip out of Lahaina to Lanai - totally worth it. (see my other post under Hawaii Ocean Rafting-Lahaina). The whole Makena/Wailea stretch is considered Turtle Town and you see tour boats off the shore all the time...it was great having such wonderful snorkeling spots close by! Although we didn't go on the Makena catamaran, it was still neat to see it go out every morning and I'm sure the sunset cruise is a nice experience. We went to the Makena Luau and paid $40/person for the show only and cocktails tickets. If you are going to see the Luau, we recommend doing it this way - you also get desserts. The show was interesting/ok (just not our thing), so we were happy to not have paid the full price of $110?/person for the dinner and show. Oh, and if you go - buy a lei from the lady making leis - she sells them for $10 - other vendors on the island sell them for $12...not that big of a difference but just a tip! Overall, we LOVED our stay at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort and can't wait to go back. It met all of our needs and we couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon experience. So, if you don't mind staying at a quiet hotel with a gorgeous beach, great views from every room, and great snorkeling, then please consider the Makena Beach and Golf Resort.

The only visible investment made in the hotel was the beds/linens. They are very similar to the Hyatt beds and actually quite comfortable. But overall, the resort is less than stellar. Our airline put us here for two free nights due to oversold flights, and we debated paying to move to a better hotel down the street. If you want a \"budget\" hotel on the beach, then I suppose this hotel would work for you. Keep in mind the word \"budget\" when you set your expectations. Hotel Rooms: Large and spacious with very tired furnishings (except the beds). The King rooms have a pull out couch. The balconies are furnished with the 80's versions of patio furniture. Visibly - the hotel rooms offer nothing more than a place to rest your head. (Wifi is $15 a day). They do have a mini fridge by the way. Beach: The beach is fine. There are lounge chairs you can use to lay out with. There is no beach service for food or drinks. I recommend buying drinks and a cooler to bring with you. This hotel provides towels through a \"towel card program\". Restaurant: They have one of the worst buffet breakfasts I have ever tried. La Quinta and Hyatt Place hotels provide a better quality breakfast free of charge. Makena charges $25 per person for the buffet (and the a' la carte menu is $16-$20 each). Their big item for breakfast was \"make your own waffles\" in those machines kids use in college. Do yourself a favor and take the free shuttle to the Fairmont Hotel, Grand Wailea, or our favorite The Four Seasons for mind blowing food and service (each of those breakfasts are $30-$35 per person and completeley worth it). FOOD AND BEVERAGE at the Makena resort is a HUGE letdown. We ended up taking the free shuttle to Subway for breakfast down at the Shops at Wailea. Overall, I would NEVER recommend this hotel, because I know that for $50-$100 more a night you can upgrade to a much better quality hotel which would greatly impact your travel experience.

We decided to take a peek at the Makena Resort and booked a horseback riding tour at Makena Ranch, which is owned by the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. Following the horseback ride, which was great fun with Rocky as the tour guide, we decided to check out the hotel. After the reviews, we were expecting to see a Motel 6 quality facility. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH! Yes...the facility could use some updating, such as exterior building painting and flat screen TV's. However...those are minor issues, compared to a gorgeous private beach, an attentive and gracious staff, the tropical central garden/koi pond area, the very nice rooms with fabulous views with spacious balconies, the incredibly comfortable beds and pillows, and the beautiful serene gardens with that great secluded Makena feel. We wish we could have stayed longer and are already looking forward to going back. Some of the people who made our stay memorable were: Denise Hoopai, Front Operations Manager, who graciously gave us fourth floor ocean view rooms; Rocky, horseback riding tour guide/paniolo, who made our horseback riding tour great fun; Alan the bellman/driver who was a walking history book of the area; and Thomas the bellman who, as he puts it \"comes to work every day with a smile on my face\" and put a smile on ours. The only negative comment we have about the resort was the $25/day resort fee which we were not expecting after the fees we had already paid to Priceline.com. This fee, although a somewhat minor detail, did not even include free wireless internet access, which is a must in 2010. Internet access is available, but for an added fee. In addition, someone had complained about the bird noise...we found it charming. The first night, at about 5 am, we heard very loud bird noises coming from the front door of our room. We were able to go back to sleep using ear plugs. The next evening, we heard the same sounds around sunset and saw numerous birds camped out on the railings in front of the rooms. We had fun chasing them off with the assistance of some nearby children and the next night,we did not hear any more noises from the birds. We highly recommend the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, but since we only stayed there two nights we did not get a chance to take advantage of the spectacular golf course, beach side massages, and hotel dining that were closed the nights we were there.

We live in an ocean resort on the Atlantic (Maryland), so we are no newcomers to beach/resort hotels (at the high end). As frequent travelers, we rely pretty heavily on the reviews posted here in our decision making. I am barely able to post this review, because I fear, that if word gets out about this hotel, no one will ever be able to get a room here again. So, here goes: If you want a pretty secluded and safe beach, it's here (remember-all beaches are public in HI); if you want a very affordable, decent rate for an ocean-front no frills hotel, it's here; if you want the feel of 'old Hawaii' with all of the Aloha and the Wailea location, it's here; great food--not here, good food, yes, but not great; best sunset lounge that's not on the beach, it's here; big-time, over-the-top nightlife, not here, but good Hawaiian entertainment several nites during the week, it's here; friendly staff--Jay, Kai, Michelle, Amy to name a few--nothing is ever a problem; great bed, clean room with plenty of towels, soap, etc, it's here; if you want lots of kiddie amenities, maybe another choice is wiser; if you want quiet, quiet, quiet, a large hotel and grounds where you have space to wander and relax, this is it. If you need glitz and noise, overworked valets, and stroller races in the lobby (yes, I witnessed this on a walk-through at another hotel that has a \"four\" in its name), then go for all of that at the mouth of Wailea. Makena Beach (formerly the Maui Prince) is a wonderful alternative to the overpriced crowded chaos at the other end of this road.

It continues to be the only resort in Makena, though a bit worn by the passing years, without, apparently, a major update. It sits alone without anything in sight, except for Molikini in the distance, along a pristine, secluded, quiet stretch of beach. The solid construction has stood the test of time, with beautiful wood accents in public spaces, as well as private rooms. The rooms and bathrooms with dressing area are still roomy by today's standards, but the above ground hot tubs are not hotel caliber, and the tv's are old, though I don't go to Hawaii to watch tv. More modern hotels have made use of ocean views, which unfortunately, this hotel did not when it was constructed. When walking into the lobby, one would never know there is an ocean, as it is not visible at all from the lobby. Also, when eating breakfast at Cafe Kiowai or sitting at the pool, one would not know that this hotel sits on the Pacific Ocean. This may not be an issue to some visitors, but I like to go to Hawaii for the beach and ocean, so I missed not having the scenic ocean views that most of the hotels in Hawaii take advantage of. On the other hand, if you like flora and fauna, then you will be in your glory, because the mature gardens are lovely and beautifully maintained, with a waterfall that is perfect for picture taking. The hotel is constructed in a horseshoe, with all the rooms facing the ocean, so at least you can enjoy the beautiful ocean view from your room. Nothing beats waking up to see the beautiful expanse of the Pacific, or being able to watch the sunset over the ocean from your lanai. I had a great night sleep as the beds are queen size, not doubles, and very comfy. What a difference a year makes in service with the new management company. I was hesitant to return since staying last year when the resort was poorly run by Prince Hotels, but got a great rate of $179/night, so decided to try again, and I'm glad we gave the place a second chance. The new management company has made noticeable improvements. To begin with, the staff was much more welcoming and friendly, and aimed to please. I received a welcoming e-mail and personal phone call a few days before we were set to arrive, and another e-mail after we had returned. The staff exuded the Aloha spirit with friendly smiles and hellos, especially Gail at the front desk, and Jay at the beach hut, who both greeted me by name each day. When I requested something, like feather pillows or extra towels, they were brought to the room immediately. There are new, bright lounge chairs at the heated pool, and the new menu on surfboards at the pool grill presented well. The portions were huge, food tasty, and for a resort, I though reasonably priced. The virgin lava flow drinks at the pool bar are devine, and the bartender (sorry, I forgot your name), will bring them to you so you don't have to get out of the pool. Talk about service! Don't forget your float! Another upside to this hotel is that it does not nickel and dime you like many of the other resorts in Wailea. Valet parking is free, there is an empty refrig in the room with two free bottles of water each day, and there are free newspapers in the lobby. There is also a laundry facility on the first floor if needed. My children enjoyed being able to play shuffle board and ping pong, which are available free of charge at the pool. Good deals can be had all over Wailea, since Maui is coming out of a low occupancy spring. We got great early bird dinner specials at old favorite restaurants Joe's and Buzz's Wharf, which I highly recommend. Cheeseburger in Paradise at the Shops at Wailea even had a $5.99 breakfast special! I also recommend Trilogy excursions to snorkel at Molikini. Kai Kanani leaves for Molikini right from the beach in front of the hotel, but when I went on last year, they ran out of food and pushed alcohol usage. I don't go on a snorkel trip in the morning to drink, and don't want my teens to have to subsidize drinkers since this boat does not discount for their age like the Trilogy does. This is probably the most economical choice of hotels on the south shore that has a swimmable beach. I recommend staying here for a quiet, low-key, relaxing stay the way things used to be on Maui before the construction of high dollar hotels and condos. If you desire something ritzier, Wailea is a better choice, or more hopping than the quiet south shore, then go west to Kaanapali. I will definitely return here if I can get a reasonable rate.

It was our wedding trip and I chose it for its position (most of weddings take place in the South) and the fact that it was not in a middle of crowded areas (like Kaanapali or Kihei). I also liked the idea that it is the last hotel in the South's hotel chain. We were a bit scared to find an old old fashioned place, but in the end we are rather satisfied with this choice (believe me, I was more than sorry to spend our second week in Sheraton!). The hotel indeed is a bit outdated and old-fashioned, but the rooms are big and very clean and view even from the partial ocean view rooms is great (we saw the montains, the garded with the pool and the ocean). The terrace is big enough and it is a pleasure to watch the sunset from there! The garden is beautiful and the snorkel is great! Each afternoon you can see 2-5 huge turtles, which come to feed on the rocks just a coupld of meters away from the beach (in the center, you can snorkel with the turtles or just watch their heads popping out from the water every minute :). On the left side of the beach there's a very nice coral, although not so many fish, but the coral is beautiful. Hotel also provides beach chairs and beach is not too crowded (unlike Kaanapali, for example). By the way, you get two beach towels per person in this hotel. Makena/Wailea area is very beatiful, the gardens are wonderful and Aloha spirit is all around you. The food at the beach bar is not bad at all, but I was not the biggegst fan of the staff, they are rather slow and inefficient. Another bar inside the hotel has a nice bar tender and nice views to the ocean, but it's time they clean the windows (oops!), so the view could be nicer. The jappanese restaurant has good food, but too high prices and it is closed on Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays! During our stay the hotel was full with the older generation guests (:DDDD), so sometimes it felt strange to sit in the bar and be surrounded only by pension-age guests, but who cares! The staff is friendly, the only thing I didn't like that at check out they were not able to explain our final bill (we made lots of calls to Europe and sometimes there were diffrent calls with different duration to two different countries and they would cost exactly the same price!!! (e.g. 25.33). The staff was unable and unwilling to investigate why (the only anwer was \"I don't know\".

It's taken some knocks during the economic downturn -- last fall, the owners lost it in foreclosure, and a new management company was installed who's cut staff and services. But it's still my favorite hotel in Hawaii, and I've stayed at some of the best ones --- Grand Wailea, Ritz Kapalua, Four Seasons Kona, etc. Why? To me, the Makena Resort gets me a lot closer to my ideal Hawaiian vacation than the others. That said, it's not for everybody, so here's my criteria: 1) I travel with my wife. We don't have kids. We like quiet and romantic hotels that are not teeming with children. Makena Resort is great for that. 2) I go to Hawaii for isolation and calm, not to be in the midst of hustle & bustle or to sit in traffic. So I love the Makena Resort's location at the south end of Maui. 3) I like simple, clean, comfortable rooms and I don't care about high-end fixtures and amenties. The rooms at the Makena Resort are a little dated -- no, they don't have flat panel TVs. But did I turn on the TV once during the week? No. The beds and bedding are very comfortable, the rooms are super clean, and the views are fantastic. At other hotels, you can easily get stuck with a view of the valet parking lot. Most of the rooms here have ocean views. 4) Admittedly, food options could be better. The sushi restaurant, Zen Zen, is terrific. Unfortunately it's only open Weds-Sat. The breakfast / lunch Cafe Kiowai is only mediocre. But there are good restaurants in Kihei, just up the road. 5) The $15/day resort fee does include free valet parking, but wifi is extra (and expensive). Again, that's a problem if you come to Hawaii to use your laptop, but I don't. 6) Snorkeling is great right off the hotel beach. The hotel is close to Ahihi Bay, a nature preserve and good snorkel spot. The hotel also runs a catamaran that does morning snorkel visits to Molokini which get you there before anyone else. 7) The price is right. We just stayed there a week using a package from Orbitz and it was well under $200 a night. In short, not everyone is going to like the Makena Resort.

They are pretty loud n start 'talking'early. Luckily we were away from them BUT we were above the breakfast restaurant & to be honest it could get a bit noisy early when they are preparing the plates etc. We slept with the windows shut a lot so as not to wake too early. Reception & bell desk were very helpful & always a cheery exchange when passing.Even our maid knew our name by the second day. Still dont know how she worked out which room we had come out of! The hotel has sold off some land and there is construction at the south end of the beach of a club house & 13 housing lots. No houses yet but the club house is underway. Having said that, we didnt find the noise particularly noticible. The beach is lovely. The pool area could do with a little make over. Concrete floor doesnt look too pretty. However, the poolside bar staff cant do enough for you coming around to see if u need a drink while tanning up :) Breakfast was ok, nice aspect but do take the free hotel shuttle up to Wailea to eat there too, if u dont have a car. Wailea shops/ restaurants are about 50 mins walk each way. Overall the hotel is clean but maybe a little tired in places. They are / were up for auction this month & hopefully with a cash injection this place could be fantastic. We'd like to see the pool area revamped. They are aware of the fact it needs a facelift. We;d like to see the restuarants revamped. We ate at the hotel in the evening once. There isnt a lot on the menus of either of the restaurants. A great bar for the evening.

I was thrown off by some of the reviews saying that the room was \"old and outdated\". Guess what, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The room is dated a little but who cares, you're in Hawaii!! Service was wonderful. Our first night we stayed in another room around the north end. It was supposed to be ocean front but it seemed more like an ocean view. Wevoiced our concerns to Ron at the front desk and he obliged our request immediately and had us moved to room 532. Pros: - Had to be one of the most quietest, serene beaches of all the south Maui resorts. We visited the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea... those beaches were a zoo. - The bed was one you can sink in to all day long. Got good rest. - Service. We were addressed by name most of the time. The valet kindly referred to me as \"bruddah\". - Buffet. Though $20 a person, the food was good quality. I loved the fruit crepes and banana macadamia nut pancakes. - Close to Kihei. If you come to Maui you know you need to get a car. Nuff said. It's a short 10 minute drive to Kihei if you want other things to do. This is a non-issue that other reviewers seem to gripe about. It's not that far of a drive. Cons: - My biggest \"complaint\" is the TV... it's 2010, time to upgrade to a flat screen. The rooms being outdated wasn't much of a concern to me whatsoever. - I agree about the pool. I've been in back yards with grander pool. We never hung out there because the beach is literally 60 seconds away. - The $15 a day resort fee. Really? Why? The internet is not free. Movies are not free. Not sure what that covered.

The golf course is about as good as any poorly kept executive course, so if you are going for th egolf, but Tiger Woods on Nintendo and stay at home. Overall, the resort feels is a bit down-on-your-luck. They could try to weed a few beds here and there - they have amazing fully grown specimen trees and such, but totally ruined with weeds and such.

The musicians were talented and the fire dance should not be missed. The golf course is a two-minute walk away and has amazing views of the ocean. There are several interesting beaches a short walk away. We recommend the Irish band at the pub called Mulligan's at one of the Wailea golf courses just a few minutes away by car. The only knock on the resort is probably the pool which is small compared to the pools at the more lavish resorts in nearby Wailea. But the beach is just a few steps away and is beautiful and unspoiled. After our time at the Wailea we spent two days at the Fairmont in Wailea. There is no doubt that the Fairmont is much newer and more luxurious and with more amenities.

On my third visit to the Maui Prentice in November of 2009, I see the most radical transition of all in any of the nonperforming assets in the Prince portfolio. The downgrade from the Aveda bodycare products found in the toilets was a notable first sign of distress. While the replacements are functional, they certainly fail to match the room price. Some things are our relative constant. The quality of the beds for example, these are a static signature of quality that has not changed. They're fluffy and comfortable. The Maui Prince has a problem with vermin. On my first visit I stayed in a very nice suite that contained 1 1/2 bathrooms. While exiting through the fire stairwell, I noticed in an area that was not traveled much by visitors, a lot of rat traps. In this single bathroom suite in my latest visit, the balcony appointed with tropical flowering plumage also contained a black plastic rat trap. The irrigation tube was broken and sprayed water all over the trap. Distracting from the amazing oceanfront view, the reminder of vermin was not the visual cue you should expect at a resort of this reputational caliber. A common theme at this resort is the dysfunctional condition of the in suite refrigerators. Once again, the bottom part of the door was rusty in room 130. Another amenity in need of repair are the residential style pair of hot tubs in the pool area. While functional, they were missing knobs and controls. A moment of humor struck me while I'm misinterpreted a chlorine biscuit for a urinal cake! It was more than the puck shape, it was also the smell of the vulgar disc! Hakone is the in-house restaurant. They were an acceptable choice on the past visits and I made no effort to visit them on this trip. Kehei provides a wonderful amount of food choices from the lowly fast food burger joint to world-class culinary art. The resistance to spending money on resort for food began at the coffee shop. While three dollars for a 16 ounce cup of coffee is all right, the small salads offered for $10 or more expensive than those offered on the aircraft for a full meal upgrade.

We booked the trip through American Airlines Vacations in January, for travel in September. We chose the \u00e2\u20ac\u01534-Star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vacation package, which included 4 nights at the Maui Prince in Makena, and 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. Throughout the time from January to September, I was in contact with various members of the concierge staff at the Maui Prince to plan activities for our stay. They were always so gracious and helpful, and I felt like a valued guest with every communication. Just before our trip, I learned that the Maui Prince was under new management (had become the Makena Resort), and got a little nervous about the reservations, but no worries! Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. We were greeted with shell leis and refreshing cool towels, as well as a very friendly bell staff and front desk attendant who immediately wished us a happy anniversary and gave us an upgrade to our room at no additional charge. We were booked in a partial ocean view room, but got a beautiful ocean view room instead. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top of the line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room, but it was ocean view, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay extra! I cannot give enough praise to the staff, as they were all extremely friendly and helpful, and absolutely exuded the spirit of aloha, from the front desk to the pool bar, to the wait staff in the restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. Fabulous service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always with a warm smile! The beach in front of this hotel is extremely beautiful and uncrowded. It is a small beach, but all the more cozy and private. I might add that this resort is on the southwest coast of Maui, not in the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapli area up north, where it is apparently much more commercial. This resort is about a 30-minute drive from the airport. We were within 10-20 minutes of all the shopping we could ask for, from a Safeway shopping center to the Shops at Wailea, a very upscale shopping complex with stores like Gucci and Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The restaurants at the resort served absolutely incredible food. Be forewarned, everything in Maui is quite pricey, but if you know that before you go, there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too many surprises. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend ordering room service at the resort. One of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must-do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Maui is a drive on the Hana Highway. Start early in the morning, though, because you will want to make several stops, and it will take you at least 4 hours to get to Hana, if there is light traffic. I recommend getting the CD-guided tour at the Shell station near the airport for $20, well worth it. There are some breathtaking views and gorgeous rainforest scenery along the way, and you will definitely want to see the black sand beach. If we had not gotten the CD package, we would have missed it. The Maui Prince/Makena Resort has a luau one night a week, but we were not there on the right night for it, so we went to the Honua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ula Luau at the Marriott just up the road for our anniversary dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it, regardless of where you stay. The food and show are worth every penny of the $100+ per person cost. I would just really like for the staff of the Maui Prince/Makena Resort to know that they made our anniversary trip everything we dreamed it would be - the most wonderful, memorable, romantic trip we have ever taken. I just hope we can go back someday.

Makena Beach is perfect...nice sandy beach, great swimming, snorkeling on either side of the beach (I even saw a giant sea turtle just offshore), free beach chairs and towels for hotel guests, and the ability to rent anything else you might need (umbrellas, recreation equipment). You can go up the stairs to the Pool Bar for a drink or lunch or to use the restrooms. We took at few short excursions to other notable beaches in the area (Black Sand Beach, Big Beach), but ended up just returning to Makena Beach since the amenities made it so comfortable. You can also take a snorkeling cruise to Molokini right from the beach, and it only takes 15 min to the crater! The real selling point for the hotel is its unbelievably wonderful staff. Everyone, from the valet attendants to the cleaning staff, always greeted us with a smile and went out of their way to make sure we had a nice time. Almost every morning, our waitress at the on-site restaurant would give us fish food to feed the many beautiful koi that live in the atrium's pond. When one of the valet guys saw that we were getting our car to go to the beach, he got us some straw mats for the sand and a boogie board to borrow. When my son got sunscreen in his eyes at the pool, the Pool Bar waiter took it upon himself to get him a cool water cloth and even found eyedrops for him while the Pool attendant gave him the ultimate medicine: an ice pop. On the beach, the beach attendants would come by with little treats like cool towels or pineapple. Upon leaving, one of the staff members gave my son a necklace and \"fish\" made out of woven leaves. We had nice conversations with many of the staff and got to learn more about real local life. The list goes on and on... The only thing I will say is that the accommodations, while still perfectly fine, are showing some wear and tear and are certainly nowhere near as glamorous as its Wailea neighbors. But then again, you are not paying Wailea prices! The pools are very simple---no amusement park style slides or chic people-watching here. But we were in Maui primarily for the beach, so this was fine for us. Re: the rooms...on the plus side, the beds are very comfortable, the balconies enclosed for privacy, and the tiled entryway made a nice \"mudroom\" (or sand room?) before you got to the carpeted part of the room. On the down side, our toilet ran constantly (luckily we couldn't hear it in the bedroom), the fixtures and doors were definitely showing age, and the temperature controls were a bit tempermental. But truly these minor irritations paled in comparison to the overall feeling at the hotel which is elegant, friendly and relaxing. It will be interesting to see if the new management will be upgrading some of the hotel's elements. Not all the restaurants were open, as it looks like the new management is trying to figure some things out. The excellent Japanese restaurant Hakone is only open Wed-Sat and the casual cafe restaurant looks like it will be closed for a while. The breakfast buffet is a pretty decent deal for the area ($20 per adult), and while we were there they had a promotion where kids ate free at any of the property restaurants. While we are not golfers, my co-worker who is a golf maniac says that Makena is his favorite golf course on the island. We were there during the off-season, and so the hotel had pretty low occupancy when we were there. We enjoyed never feeling like the place was too crowded, but I'm not sure if this is representative of the hotel during busy season.

We stayed at the resort for 4 days/5 nights from Oct 4th-8th, and it was wonderful!! We have always spent alot of time reviewing hotels in any place that we choose to visit, and so it was a tough decision on where to stay while visiting Maui. We ultimately choose Makena Resort because of a hot deal they had listed on Orbitz, and I am SO glad that we did. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were each greeted with a shell lei and helped over to the front desk to check in. The gal who checked us in was very nice, her name was Michelle I believe, and she helped us out tremendously-you see, even though we prepaid for our entire package, we still had to put up a credit card as part of procedure at the car rental and the hotel, not a big deal until I figured out how much they wanted to hold-$500.00-almost as much as my hotel/car cost me in the first place-well, after my card had already been swiped earlier at the car rental, there was not enough to cover-so Michelle worked some magic and only held the resort fee for us-much appreciation to her-glad I didnt have to dip into my spending money for the trip! Just wanted to point this out in case others have the same problems when checking in-had NO idea it would be so much of a hold, especially when being paid for in advance. After checking in, we settled into our room for a while, and I didnt know quite what to think, I remember seeing pictures of updated rooms on a travel website, and it showed something a tad different than what we received-possibly because of the deal we got-not sure-but let me just say this-the room itself was a very large room, two very nice and comfortable beds with new linens, and it had a HUGE lanai with excellent views of the pool, the luau area, and the ocean-and we were on the first floor-so I can only imagine the views on the upper floors! The pool area seemed a bit small, with one small pool and a small kids pool, and I believe two small hot tubs-didnt matter-never once went to the pool-why the heck would you waste time at a pool when you are that close to the beach???? Now to the real gem in the south Maui area-the beach! Maluaka Beach is the beach fronting the Makena Resort-and let me tell you, I have been to beaches in my old home Southern California, the Mexican Rivieria, the Caribbean, and to my other favorite Makaha beach on the island of Oahu, and not one of those beaches can even compare to Maluaka! Its pretty decent in size, never too crowded, and has the sandiest bottom of any place I have ever seen! There is one side that also offers great snokeling, if you are into snorkeling, I am not-I came for a nice relaxing sandy beach, and I definitely got what I was looking for! I did not eat at any of the restaurants on the property-so I cant judge those-but I did visit the Shops at Wailea-just a short drive north of us, and ate at both Tommy Bahama's and Cheeseburger Island Style-let me just say-Bahama's was a bit pricey, but well worth the money spent-ate there twice as a matter a fact! Cheeseburger Island Style has a huge following among locals and tourist apparently, but I thought it was the nastiest burger I had ever tasted-looked and tasted like the prepacked patties you find in the freezer section at the grocery store-you know-the ones that you try to figure out what kind of meat it REALLY is??? Well, you get my point-my meal at Cheeseburger cost almost the same price as my meal at Tommy Bahama, and I didnt get the food or service that should come with that price-stay away from Cheeseburger!!!! Having said all of that, back to the Makena Resort-check out was seamless, did it from our room before sadly leaving-let me say that this resort and the entire Wailea/Makena area is very quiet and extremely low key, not a whole lot of families staying down here, and it was great-not trying to knock people with kids, I do have a niece and nephew that came with us to Honolulu just before coming to Maui-and they were fairly good, but when you are coming to this area, you are trying to get away from everything about your normal life-including the noise of kids and maybe even some adults who act like children-probably people you work with! My point is, there in not a whole lot of activities for kids-unless you are staying at the mega Grand Wailea with its water slides and mega pools-in this area-so if you are visiting with younger kids who need entertainment, Lahaina and Ka'anapali may be better suited for you.

The tile floors were in need of a deep scrubbing, and we saw areas where the new company was just beginning to paint . The hotel is far, far away from anything. If you are the type of people that don't rent a car and feel that the shuttle or public transit is the way to go, book another hotel closer to the main drag. The shuttle here is good, but the bus system on Maui is sub par - it only runs once an hour. It's nowhere near as good as Oahu's bus system. The walls of the rooms were thin; you could here the next room's hairdryer, but not necessarily voices. When on the balconies, you can hear your neighbors on their balconies perfectly (which made for hilarious eavesdropping.) The bed was VERY comfortable with high quality sheets and towels. Very happy about that. The plumbing can be heard whenever someone next door or above is taking a shower. And our toilet's plumbing seemed to have come loose in the wall, for it was seriously banging around. Room service is above average and courteous.

It's a nice property. However, if you are trying to decide between two Wailea locations that are similarly-priced, you might want to consider another property. I recently stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights (1-6 Sept 2009) because I was attending a conference down the street at the Wailea Marriott. I paid $159/night. At this price, I would say that the stay was nice because the resort feels pretty quiet and the beach is very beautiful. (Note there is also a $15/day + tax resort fee that covers parking and 2 bottles water per day.) However, I would likely not stay here again in the future because the neighboring resorts are a lot nicer. First, let's start with the positives of this place: 1. The staff is very friendly. Everyone--bell staff, front desk personnel, housekeepers, maintenance people--always said hello to me whenever I passed by, and I always felt like they really meant it. That was nice. 2. Despite (supposedly) being near-capacity, the resort always felt empty. I'm not sure why this could be possible, but this place would be ideal for a couple looking for the amenities of a large resort without the usual circus-like feeling that accompanies staying at a large property. 3. The rooms are tastefully decorated, and there are a lot of nice touches throughout: lots of real hangers, comfortable desk & chair, a safe, berber carpet, a separate room for the toilet, and a thermostat that allows the user to chill the room to the lower 60's with the AC. There's even a second door that allows for increased ocean breezes. (You prop the main room door open, and then you shut a second, slatted wood door. This provides some privacy while allowing the ocean breeze to pass through the room.) 4. The beach is beautiful. The hotel provides easy access to the beach out back, and it is a great beach for swimming and snorkeling. We saw several large turtles while snorkeling, and we even saw a beautiful manta ray. (It was the highlight of my trip.) However, there are several reasons why I would not return to this hotel: 1. The birds. If you don't know what a Grey Francolin is, you will be able to identify it's (early morning) call by the time you checkout. Also, every evening hundreds of different birds arrive in the hotel's central courtyard, and they can make quite a racket! 2. The hotel has a strange, has been-like quality to it. The exterior of the building could use a new coat of paint, especially the wood trim. Several of the restaurants appear to be closed, but I wasn't sure if this was seasonal or permanent. (The restaurant by the koi pond did appear to be permanently closed.) I tried to find something to eat at 11.45am on a Tuesday morning, and the pool bar was the only place that was offering any food. This seems a little strange, especially for such a big hotel. 3. While the staff was very friendly, they also seemed to lack a little common sense. Two examples: (1) When I arrived, I was told that my room wasn't ready. When I returned at the posted check-in time, it still wasn't ready. It turned out that the room simply didn't have a bath mat or any hangers, and this is why I wasn't allowed to check in when I initially arrived. The front desk staffer should have allowed me to check in and provided the bath mat and hangers later in the afternoon. (2) When I checked out, there was a $19 charge on my bill that I did not recognize. (It was from the beach rental facility, and I did not rent anything while I was there. The charge was clearly a mistake.) Instead of simply removing the charge, the front desk staffer spent a lot of time calling the rental facility, trying to track down the charge. My sense was that the staffer burned more than $19 in staff resources trying to explain the charge. He should have just removed it without question. 4. There were a lot of little annoyances. The shower head sounded like a dying accordion. Internet access is rather steep at $15/day. They charge an obnoxious rate to use the lobby computers for 15 minutes. The bathroom faucet had a 1 gallon per minute flow limiter on it. (When I consider the amount of water that their golf course consumes, this miserly dribble coming from the bathroom faucet seems asinine.) Finally, the hotel is in foreclosure.

I could not enjoy the Maui breeze becuase my patio was occupied by Gecko's who obviously had reserved that area first. They comment about the birds in the previous review is spot on. It felt like I was in central park. The noise they made was more than anything odd. On top of all that we found out the next day that the property was in foreclosure. Augh mystery solved. Bottom line do nit even think about staying here. If you do stay here and you wonder why it is so quiet, it is probably because you are there by yourself.

Some people in previous TripAdvisor entries complained about the birds. The hotel does have a set of trees and plants in the middle of the hotel/lobby which is nice and where I guess the birds flock to, but I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what people were complaining about since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear or see a lot of birds on the resort, and if I did so what?

The hotel grounds and scenery are wonderful and exceeded our expectations. All staff that we had the pleasure of dealing with was very polite, professional and great.

Having been to Europe, I can't see a reason why an older building would be a problem unless it is falling apart. Well, I was so happily surprised when I arrived at the hotel.

I didn't spend much time at the hotel but everyone I spoke with was super friendly and always wanting to make your stay even nicer. I booked the luau for the first night and it was really wonderful. The food was good - not great. The drinks were good and the entertainment was really excellent. I had coffee at the little cafe and a drink at the Molokini Bar and Grille. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet in the Garden restaurant (I don't remember the name of this restaurant). The waiter was great! My french toast was cold so he had the chef cook up some fresh for me. Also the price wasn't overwhelming. I must admit I did not choose to take advantage of much more of their amenities -- didn't bother with the pool -- why should I when there is a gorgeous ocean a few feet away with amazing sea turtles that swam along side of me. On my last day, I wanted to spend the day in West Maui so I asked if they would store my bags. They did so with no problem and no charge. Tip: If you plan on snorkeling, go into Kehei and rent some gear from Snorkel Bob's or Boss Frogs. Maui Prince's gear is way too expensive. The good: Beautiful grounds, birds, turtles and fish all right at your fingertips, friendly and helpful staff.

They never welcomed us with leis as we saw others being welcomed. The moquitos run rampant there which we never had any problem with riding all over Maui. The floors and rooms were dirty. Obviously, they don't clean daily. The front desk was also rude. No Aloha spirit in this place which we had gotten accustomed to in other parts of the island.

We tried out the hotel restaurant since it' s in the middle of nowhere. The food was mediocre at best with very high prices. The service from wait staff and hostess was also snobby.

We had stayed there 10 years early and wanted to enjoy that part of Maui again. I have read through comments from other travelers and agree with much of what they say. The actual hotel building is dated and needs a freshening up. The white concrete is rather stark and the original design and material selection could have been more attractive, but to me it is no better or worse than the bright white Kea Lani up the street. But we didn't come to the Maui Prince to focus on the exterior of the building. The interior gardens are very pretty, the grounds very nice and the proximity to one of Maui's best and more secluded beaches can't be beat. The lobby area is open and airy and while there is no view of the beach I rather like the simple elegance that it presents. I feel very comfortable at this hotel without the need to wear my designer clothes and show up in my designer car. I had read from another review that there was a damp and moldy smell in their room. This stay we experienced the same. I believe the carpet had been recently shampooed and had not been allowed to dry out. We spoke to the staff at the front desk and they were very accomodating, moving us to another room which was fine. The staff from the front desk, to concierge, to restaurant to those taking care of our room were always very nice and accomodating. We ate at the restaurant twice and were very pleased with the food. The pool area is rather simple and I am sure doesn't compare with some of the resorts in Wailea. There are no water slides or waterfalls, but I would rather enjoy what Mother Nature created. For us the beach is the draw. Coming from Northern California where stepping into the ocean is always a chilling choice, being able to walk right in is a treat. A couple of turtles even came swimming by me one day. We opted one morning to take the Kai Kanani snorkel trip to Molokini. It leaves right from the beach in front of the Maui Prince. A nice trip and something to do once. The crew were very accomodating and what a treat to get off the boat and right up to your shower. The hotel is indeed at the end of the road, one of it's charms. My idea of a vacation is to get away from everyone. We did do our play time, drove to Lahina a couple of times and the ever present need to see Hana, but the majority of our time was spent enjoying each other's company, lying on the beach, swimming, sipping drinks and trying to forget our busy life at home for awhile.

It is shaped like a giant donut, with an open atrium for the hole. The good part of this is that most rooms will have a good view off the lanai. But the downside is that all the public spaces are extremely institutional in feel and quite lacking in charm. There are zero, I mean absolutely no, \"cutouts\" in the donut. So standing in the lobby, there is no view of the ocean, or pool, or anything pretty.... just a view of many floors of the doors to all the rooms, in unvarying, unrelieved concentric array. The poor workers at the front desk! All the beauty of Hawaii, and not a shred of it visible! We found ourselves always going down the fire stairs near our room to exit the building ASAP and be outside as the walk through the lobby was so unappealing. (Also the atrium has a lot, in the bad way, of birds flying around.) The pool is also odd -- a relatively small pool, it is a perfect circle (do I detect a theme here?) of 100% deep end -- over 6' deep of water. There are no stairs down into it, only ladders. There is no getting into this pool slowly or halfway. If you like to kind of hang out in a pool without having to tread water or hang off one of the side walls, this is not the pool for you unless you are at least 6'5\". The beach is not at all visible from the pool, and is a good walk away from the pool. The layout of the grounds is quite odd... there are 2 huge berms (hills, kinda steep in fact) which hide the view of the beach completely until you walk up to the top of the second hill. We found this also to be such a waste of the beauty of Hawaii. You can either sit at the pool, far from the beach, or sit at the (hot!) beach, far from the pool. There are two lovely grassy areas on the berm nearest the ocean, but they don't want you to put beach chairs there even during the day because they have weddings in the evening. We found this hilarious (chairs can be MOVED, duh!) and ignored it. Even if you do this, you are unlikely to have a view of the ocean from your chairs due to the slope of the berm. We stayed here because we were making a tour of all the islands and wanted to try the Wailea area. This is the sister hotel of the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel on the big island, a very lovely hotel indeed, where we have stayed often. The Maui Prince has some similarities, especially in the room layout, but it cannot compare with Hapuna. Both hotels have this neat feature of two front room doors -- one solid and one louvered to let in the breeze. So you can sleep with your glass lanai doors open, using the screened lanai doors in their place, and also use the louvered front room door (instead of closing the regular solid front room door) to have a breeze pass through all night, and hear the sound of the ocean (though often you instead hear the sound of the irrigation system). At the Hapuna, the louvered door is completely screened, to keep critters out. In our room at the Maui Prince, our louvered front door had no screens, so we weren't able to take advantage of this rare and really cool feature. The staff was okay, not up to Hapuna Prince standard. When we drove up, no bellman came to meet us or deal with the car at all (he was there, just didn't bother). So we just went right by him up to the desk to check in. We were surprised not to be offered an upgraded room, given our Prince Preferred membership, our many stays at a sister Prince property, and most especially the fact that the hotel was virtually empty. Hapuna has never failed to upgrade us! As for the location, this is a quiet area (it's the last hotel on this end of Maui) and the beach is very nice. If you plan to eat/do stuff in the immediate area, then it's great. If you plan to see a lot of Maui, expect to do a fair bit of driving (though this is also true of Lahaina side). We weren't deterred by the location, but would not stay here again for the reasons discussed above. If you want to stay in Wailea without staying somewhere snooty, this could be a fine hotel for you, especially if you get a nice ocean view room (better be on a high floor given all the stupid berms). If you are looking for a hotel where you will just happen upon many beautiful bits of scenery while walking through the corridors (as is the happy case at beautiful, well-designed Hapuna), go elsewhere. We ate in the restaurant, and made a dinner out of appetizers and dessert. The food was very good and the service was great. As at Hapuna, the wait staff and housekeeping staff is friendlier than the front desk staff. Again we were stuck by the lack of view from the restaurant. I would love to meet the architect who laid out this hotel and ask him/her why such poor use of the land was made. It is just very strange to build a hotel in such a beautiful setting and block all public-space views of what most people come to Hawaii to see.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta ga", "Title": "\u201cbest vacation ever\u201d", "Author": "cakincltn", "ReviewID": "UR31529844", "Content": "Hotel and staff were spectacular.

Its strange how reviews go in waves for this hotel, you get a few weeks of all 5 star reviews, and then it seems like a few snobs stay, and it goes to 1 star. We stayed at the Maui Prince from May 9 to 16, 2009. We booked through Travelocity, and traveled from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As soon as we arrived at Maui Prince, we knew this would be a wonderful hotel. We really enjoyed the 3 minute drive from the Wailea area to the hotel. We were a little shocked, by the short distance that this hotel is from everything, based on prior reviews. It is a phenomenal drive, with the golf courses on one side, and other nice hotels and ocean views on the other. We actually felt the distances from the Maui Prince were quite reasonable, 3 minutes to the Wailea area, about 10 - 15 minutes to Kihei, and less than 45 minutes to Lahaina. We were very impressed as soon we pulled up. The staff were excellent who welcomed us, they were very friendly, and grabbed our bags right away. The check-in was very seamless, and we were given a beautiful prime ocean-view room on the 5th floor. We found the hotel room to be very clean, very nice and comfortable linens, clean bathrooms and a wonderful lanai. The room was fairly basic, and the furniture was a little date, but honestly, who cares? We thought it was excellent, and we hardly spent anytime in the actual room anyways. We really enjoyed the lanai, and are view of the grounds, the golf course, Molokini, and the ocean. It was excellent to go out onto the Lanai at around 5 o'clock, and watch the sunset, and the occasional wedding going on below. We thought the pool area was okay. We spent a lot of time reading around the pool, and had lunch twice. We thought the food was quite good, a little expensive, but that was expected. We really liked the fact that the pool area was not busy, and cabana's were always available. We really like the fact that the cabana's were free, when you could go to another hotel just down the street at hotels where they are often $200 and up. I think if the pool was a lot fancier like you might see at the Grand Wailea, it would be insanely busy. We really enjoyed the quite atmosphere, and just being able to dip into the pool when we got to hot. We loved the beach. We spent every day of our vacation at the beach. We would often get down early, and get a couple lounge chairs from one of the Hotel Beach hands. They were always friendly, and were always helping guests with the paddleboards, lounge chairs, etc. The beach was absolutely beautiful, with incredibly views of Molokini in the distance. The water is amazing, and the weather was always perfect. It often seems like there is some kind of a wall right over the Maui Prince. As you looked back from the beach towards the hills, you would see big black clouds, but right over the Prince it was always sunny and big blue sky. We never got rained on, the only time was a few sprinkles at the golf course, in the hills. We saw more than a dozen turtles, and they were often right up at the reef a few meters from the shoreline. They were quite remarkable to watch, and we loved when they would poke their little heads up. The snorkeling in the coral to the left of the beach was amazing, and a ton of really cool fish to see. We brought our own snorkel sets that we bought back home at Costco, and they were definately well worth it! I had been on the Makena Golf Courses website before the trip, and really wanted to go golfing, but decided against it. When we checked in, we were given a couple for a \"No Clubs, No Shoes, No Worries Promotion\" for $159USD. We decided to make a tee-time, and check out the course. For $159, we got a round of golf (my wife also came along to caddy for me for $30), brandnew Taylor Made R7 irons and Burner woods, Nike Golf Shoes, and a sleeve of Titleist golf balls. I thought this was a really good deal, and very convenient, for people who are hesitant to bring their golf clubs on vacation. The course was in amazing shape, and we were able to go out just the two of us. Place of play was perfect, and the views of the ocean and Molokini made it all worth it. We definately enjoyed this, and were glad we did this. We loved this hotel, and will definately come back. It is such a shame that it gets such bad reviews from some people. I would often walk through the beautiful lobby, and through the koi ponds, and think to myself, what are people thinking, how can you complain when you are in such a beautiful place. Maybe people have experienced unique situations, but that is no reason to blow it out of proportion. We will be back to the Maui Prince in a heartbeat, and will recommend it to everyone we know. Some of the Restaurants that we visited were as follows, we would recommend them all: -Molokini Lounge (at the Maui Prince Hotel) -Cheeseburger in Paradise (in Wailea and Lahaina) -BJ's Pizzeria (in Lahaina) -David's Shaved Ice Shop in Lahaina (I can't remember the actual name at the moment, but it was really good, I really enjoyed the Halaekala, and my wife always liked something different) -Old Lahaina Luau -Makena Maui Prince Golf Course Clubhouse for Lunch", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities", "Title": "\u201cmade my maui trip a nightmare !!!!\u201d", "Author": "cindy_deh", "ReviewID": "UR31100315", "Content": "If you check out Maui Prince's website, you will find nice photos of their guest rooms, looking new and clean.. well.. don't be fooled like we did !!

It is very easy to describe and the decision to stay there should be simple, as follows... Pros (what I love about the hotel): 1. Staff are excellent, committed, genuine, friendly, with real spirit of aloha. You will feel warmly welcomed and treated. 2. Location is great. It is away from hustle/bustle of Wailea. It feels a world away. It is quiet, even serene. I love to walk to big Makena beach. There is a special feeling to the location that will make you want to keep coming back. 3. Beach is great. Turtles frequent the beach, snorkeling is good, beach is not busy. 4. Parking is low hassle. Valet is free. Self park lot is close to the front entry, easy walking, and it's also free. 5. Public areas of hotel are really special. The gardens and koi pond are mature and beautiful. Lots of koi, which are fully grown. The local Mina birds also use the central courtyard as their roost, which may wake you up at 6am and accompany your cocktails at 6pm, but you will come to love them! 6. Specific parts of the rooms, namely, double doors allow breezes through, and all rooms have at least some ocean view. The rooms all have two sets of doors. On the inside is a louvered door that can be kept closed and locked, but lets you hear the gardens and lets the breezes through your room. The outer door can be closed when you want the A/C. Views: no rooms overlook the parking lot like they do at other hotels, but some of the partial ocean rooms could be considered \"far back.\" Cons (what I wish the hotel would fix!): 1. Rooms need lots of work. You will find the carpets older and a bit scruffy, the bed linens not very high quality (this may have been remedied in recent replacement of soft goods, but I have not stayed since), the furniture is older and a bit dated in style. The bathrooms are dated, with older tile scheme. The wallpaper may be frayed in places. Housekeeping is very good and very consistent, they do their best, but clean old stuff is still old stuff. So, you will walk in the bathrooms and feel it was nice in 1983 and has gone untouched since then, but is very clean. The rooms do have great closet space, nice bar space above the mini fridge, and balconies are good. 2. Pool is a bit small and unimpressive. It works for lounging, and if you do not like a lot of action around the pool, it will please you. It's a simple oval shape. The spa is above ground and not very impressive, but serves its purpose. You can't see the beach from the pool area, due to protective berm, but it's a 1-minute walk between the pool and beach. The pool service is good, drink service and food, by very friendly servers who will remember you on multiple day visits. Overall, if you want a \"lay by the pool\" vacation and know what to expect here, you will not be disappointed in the pool. 3. Restaurant situation. The main restaurant is closed for renovations. Other venues are a bit iffy...breakfast only, Japanese, pool service, room service, bar food. The bar actually serves a nice selection and is a good choice for a \"stay around hotel\" day, if you are not a huge eater. The sunset from the bar, and frequent live entertainment, can't be beat. I hope they will complete the restaurant and reopen it. The staff at the restaurant have been very good on all my visits. In summary, I am quite firm in believing the pros far outweigh the cons. The hotel can fix some things, especially a major room renovation. However, for now, the rates are low, and the hotel's pluses make it a definite must do. As long as you know what to expect here, you will have a memorable time and will not want to leave, and will want to plan your return on the way home!

I loved the Maui Prince best because the beds were BY FAR the most comfortable, with the softest, most luxurious linens, and the best, least obstructed view of the ocean AND no way to see in--so we could keep the screens on the windows with no curtains, to be able to see and hear the ocean from bed. I also have to say that this was the cheapest of the rooms we booked--$175/night on priceline, booked about a week and a half before our stay there. As other reviews have mentioned, EVERY room has an ocean view, and the \"partial\" ocean views here are much better than similarly-described rooms at other hotels. We had two rooms over our stay there, first a standard room with two queen beds and then upgraded to one king bed labeled a \"prime\" room, and I would agree with other reviews that \"prime\" appeared to convey no benefit over the standard room. The price difference would not have been worth it for us. The beach is beautiful and, unlike the other hotels we stayed at, there were plentiful beach and pool chairs any time we were there, as well as a very friendly staffperson (Danilo) who helped move chairs around for folks as needed on the beach. It was quick and easy to get down to the pool or the beach from our room, which was not as true other places (meandering paths at the Hyatt actually made it difficult to get from point A to point B, and locked gates made beach access tricky at the Waipouli in Kauai). We had mostly good luck with the Maui Prince staff, as well, including front desk staff that went out of their way to move us to a room with a king bed rather than two queens, even though we had booked on Priceline. We also had a red-eye flight back home on our last day, so we had all day after we had checked out of our room to hang out on the beach. We could get more beach towels from the pool/beach staff, hang out in lounge chairs on the beach, eat at the pool bar, and even use the hospitality suite at the end of the day to shower and do our final pack before the flight. The one downside to the Maui Prince was that it's way down in Makena past the more expensive properties in Wailea that are all attached with a paved ocean walk (like the one in Kaanapali), so you have to drive to get anywhere. It would have been fun to be on that walkway at the Four Seasons, the Fairmont, or the Marriott. But not worth the price. It's also a long way from the Maui Prince to the airport, to the Kaanapali beaches, Mama's Fish House (not to be missed--our best meal by far on the island), or the drive to Hana. The pools are also a little lame--just plain small circles of water. I think the point is tranquility and serenity, but after the fantasy pools of the other resorts we stayed at, it seemed kind of boring to jump in a small round pool at the Maui Prince. I will say that the bathrooms in both the rooms we had were very oddly configured, with doors coming out of weird places and uneven water temperature in the shower. The bathrooms especially show the age of the property, as newer resorts have much better designed and more spa-like bathrooms. If you want to just hang out by the beach or the pool for a few days, with easy access to several gorgeous beaches for swimming, bodysurfing, or snorkeling, while enjoying beautiful ocean views from your comfortable room, Maui Prince is perfect.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFull of the Aoha spirit\u201d", "Author": "Lassothesun", "ReviewID": "UR26134052", "Content": "We have stayed at the Maui Prince every year in Feb for our anniversary since 05, this time for two weeks 2/12- 2/26 in a Mauka Suite from which we still had an ocean view I am amazed at some of the negative comments by those who say the most lame things imaginable, look the hotel is not new, but is very well maintained, imagine how many hundreds of people have stayed in these rooms, some wall paper could suffer, and sand dunes are there to stop high seas during storms, the staff at the hotel are simply the best and like any building in such constant use it shows it's age, but has aged well, the gardens, beach and location are most excellent, the food at any of the hotel venues is great but of course pricey, how much time do you really want to spend in your room while you are on Maui anyway?, the houskeeping staff are great also, they really do a great job and should not be overlooked, so if you are not going to be so idiotic as to expect an older hotel to be all \"new\" inside, this is for you, if you are a persnickity snobby type you will probably complain that you can't see the ocean while you eat your eggs benedict, maybe those people will be glad to know that prince hotels does not own the hotel for close to two years now, the new owners (Everett Dowling / Morgan Stanley) have gained approval and the hotel will eventually be torn down and a new one built in it's place, along with other homes and some other developments, I hope it does not ruin the area, we will stay at the new Makena Resort, but we will always fondly remember the Maui Prince, it is a very special place.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cTrue Aloha Spirit and awesome beach\u201d", "Author": "islandgirl2004", "ReviewID": "UR26130912", "Content": "Our family returned to the Prince for the 4th time - we were not disappointed.

We went to Maui to get married and to honeymoon. I must say, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were pretty right on. Hotel The Maui Prince was great in that it was pretty secluded and quiet. The rooms were a little out-dated, but they were comfortable for our needs. The beds were nice and comfortable and everything in the room worked and was pretty clean. I would definitely recommend going for an oceanfront room. It was nice to keep the door open and sleep to the ocean (a luxury we don't get here in KY!) One thing I thought was strange was the water fountain in the garden. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept, but all we could hear until 8pm was the water fountain in the koi pond. The fountain didn't really serve a purpose and overshadowed the ocean for a while. Beach The beach was nice. We easily got lounge chairs and our pick of spots. There was even a guy from the hotel walking around making sure everyone had what they needed and offering cups of water. I would recommend taking a short drive south of the hotel to Big Beach state park. It was pretty empty when we were there and was very serene. Staff The staff was ok. It was nothing to rave about, but we didn't really have any problems. There is free valet parking (a tip of course is expected) or you can self park. I would recommend self parking. The parking lot is not far away and you save yourself the money for tips. However, the first day we arrived, the valets pounced on the car and seemed irked that we did not want to take advantage of their services (I was just being dropped off while my husband parked). Food To be honest, we only ate at the hotel once (excluding the luau). We ate at the pool grill after a day at the beach. The food was good, but pricey for what we got. Iwould highly recommend going to the Shops at Wailea for a couple of meals. Longhis was named \"best breakfast in maui\" and we couldn't agree more! Everything is homedmade, the service was great, and the atmosphere was laid back. I was hesitant at first because it looked like a fancy restaurant, but we saw people in everyhting from board shorts, to work out gear to resort wear in there for breakfast. I would also recommend have lunch or dinner at Cheeseburgers island style. Everything is ala carte on the menu. Also, if you're a pop drinker, I would get the bottomless mug. It pays for itself in 2 refills (refills are not free). If you're around any of the restaurants (wailea or lahaina), you can take the cup in for a refill. Each room has a minifridge in it. I would recommend going up to Safeway (on Pi'Ikea near Hilo Hatties) and get some drinks and snacks to keep in the room. It saves money and the hassle of running to a vending mchine.

My husband and I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, and we have to say we love it. For the location, for the people, for the privacy; it's what a tropical hotel should be. Located in Makena, Maui, surrounding hotels cost twice what the Prince does. Go ahead and compare the Grand Wailea, The Four Seasons, or the Fairmont Kai Lani and you'll see the Prince resort's prices are unparalleled. Maluaka Beach is right in front of the property; it's one of the prettiest around. Thomas the bellman remembers us each time we arrive (he's been to our home town before which is why he remembers us). He's such a nice man and is all smiles. Ron at the front desk remembers us when we check in. He's always pleasant to interact with. Tina by the pool remembered us as well, even though we've only seen her one previous year before. The rooms are in need of some attention (and funding) but they've recently updated the linens and fabrics. Though the furniture still needs to be updated, the rooms are comfortable and clean. Each room has a large in-room safe; there is more than enough room to store a laptop. Each room also has a mini fridge large enough to store a box of left-over pizza. The beach is gorgeous. Hotel guests have access to free beach chairs and umbrellas, and the friendly beach staff keep the beach clean. The sand is tan in color, and somewhat fine in texture which makes for crystal clear blueish-green water (meaning that the sand isn't so fine that it's easily stirred up within the waves, resulting in cloudy water). If ever there were a place God would vacation, Maluaka Beach would be it. The water goes out quite a ways at knee-to-waste deep before it's up to your chest (I'm 5'5\"). But the waves aren't harsh; they're quite manageable for teens and adults alike. But I wouldn't leave a toddler to play at the water's edge alone. This is because there is a wee bit of a drop off (about a foot) near the water's edge where the waves break that takes the water's depth from ankle-deep to knee-deep. Add in the waves, and you've got trouble if you leave a toddler to play by themselves too close to the water. There is no lifeguard on duty at this beach, so swim cautiously. However, because of the gorgeous clarity of the water and its relatively shallow depth (25 to 30 feet) snorkeling here is lovely. Turtle Town is around the rocky outcropping to the north from this beach and the little Honus (turtles) can periodically be seen coming into the bay, gracefully floating by. The water is so clear that in the past, my husband and I have been wading waist-deep when a Honu came by and stayed around for 20 seconds giving us a nice close-encounter with 'the locals.' This beach is quite a treat. The Prince Hotel pool does a nice lunch menu with some tasty mahi mahi tacos ($18), flavorful classic Caesar salad with authentic dressing ($12), guacamole dip with chips and salsa ($10), and some wonderful sandwiches ($14 to $18). Alcoholic drinks by the pool range from $5 to $9.50 for the more frou-frou drinks, but all were served with pineapple slices and umbrellas. Iced lemon water is available free of charge as you lounge by the pool. For some inexpensive eats, I recommend going to Cheeseburger Island Style in the Shops at Wailea (3750 Wailea Alanui Dr. toward the back of the shopping center, lower level: Burger $9-$10), or to Amigos in Kahului (333 Dairy Road:Tacos and burritos $5), or to Aroma D'Italia Ristorante (1881 S. Kihei Road, on the corner of Halelani Place and S. Kihei Road:$10 to $15 per entree at dinner). For a real Polynesian experience, stop into Wow-wee Maui Kava Bar in the same shopping center as Amigos for some real Kava. This drink goes back centuries and is a great part of history to experience; but its an acquired taste. If you can afford one, the Prince Hotel has a fantastic masseuse named Rene Ruiz. A 50-minute massage was $90, but well worth it!! She was great; the pressure wasn't too hard, she did a combo of diff massage styles, and I felt so relaxed and tired afterward, a lounge on the beach was all I could manage. The atrium within this hotel is unreal. There are dozens of tropical birds to be seen with thousands of plant species. Their nature trail within the atrium is educational and quite beautiful as well. The koi pond is amazing and stocked with tons of fish you can feed. I recommend feeding them and watching them fight for the food to get some great photos! They almost leap out of the water! If you get a room within the lower numbers (x10 through x20, where 'x' is the floor you're on), you'll be able to see, smell and hear the Luau that occurs on their grounds every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I recommend getting a bottle of wine, and sitting on your huge patio to listen to the luau in the cool evening breeze. Or better yet, buy a ticket to the luau to partake in the awesome food. The kalua pork is from their imu (undergound oven) and is HEAVENLY; so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. The hotel periodically has star gazing parties that can be a lot of fun. The surrounding golf grounds also belong to the hotel, so their parties will take place near a green or hole of the course so you get an unobstructed view of the dark night sky (there is very little light pollution at the Prince Hotel). We were there during the Geminids last year (little meteors) and had quite a show of shooting stars. If you can't tell, I love this hotel and her staff.

If we had been paying full rack rates, I think our scrutiny would have been higher. That in mind, we had a wonderful time and liked the 1980's Hawaiin feel. The bed and the carpets were very comfy. Everyone was very friendly and because the hotel was half empty, it was extremely quiet (except for the birds living in the atrium garden!). The in-room fridge was also a nice extra that allowed us to have snacks, breakfast and drinks on the patio. There definitely are some things that need updating; the jacuzzis near the pool were both sort of broken and our bathroom had a stand-up shower that had been sealed shut in favour of another shower in the bathtub.

Hotel : as stated in previous reviews, this is a bit of an older hotel. However to me, it felt like a classic Hawaiian hotel. Lots of aloha service with minimal fanfare. As you drive up, you're greeting with a shell lei and friendly valet/porter service. Walk thru the doors and you see the lush atrium of the hotel. To the left is the reception desk and to the right is the coffee bar and gift store. There is a concierge desk with helpful information on many of the activities Maui offers. You can also \"rent\" a computer with internet service to check/write emails or print out any documents. Our check in was smooth with a suprise upgrade and a toy bag for our son! Room : was a perfect size for 2 adults and one baby. We requested a crib which was brought to our room immediately upon arrival. There's a nice little bar area next to the bathroom with a small refrigerator. Our bathroom was fine...everything worked and it was clean. There were Neutrogena hair & skin products, plenty towels on hand & a rubber mat for the tub available for the guests. There's also a safe in the closet so you can put any valuables in it during your day at the beach/pool. The view from our lanai was awesome. Palm trees and the ocean, what else can you ask for? The best part of our room was the bed....the minute my head hit the pillow, I was out! I wanted to lug it home with me! Location : pretty much the last hotel in Wailea. If you don't want to eat anything at the hotel, you'll have to drive to The Shops of Wailea or into Kihei town for a meal. It's nice that the hotel is farther away from the hustle & bustle of other hotels though. Service : awesome!!! Everyone who works at this hotel, from valet to pool attendents, were so friendly to us and showed us much aloha. The lady who bussed our table at the breakfast buffet even gave our son some fish food to feed the kois in their pond. The only small complaint would be the pool. One small pool for adults and another smaller pool for the keikis. But it's all minors when there's a beautiful beach just steps away.

Makena is my absolute favorite part of Maui, so we overlooked the fact that this hotel is badly in need of a face lift. This trip we split our time on the island between Makena and Kapalua since we never spend much time in West Maui. This may be why I am so upset with the Maui Prince --- the Deluxe rooms Ritz-Carlton Kapalua were cheaper than our Ocean View room at the Maui Prince. The Prince needs to lower their prices until the hotel is brought into the year 2008. Pros: 1 - LOCATION, LOCATION and LOCATION By far our favorite beach on Maui is the Maui Prince beach. Sea turtles to the left, great spot for bobbingin the ocean without getting pounded by the November ginormous waves. Ahihi Bay marine preserve is 5 minutes away by car, the best spot on Maui to swim in an aquarium. Shops at Wailea a close 10 minutes. Makena and Wailea have less resorts, so you feel like you are in Hawaii. Lahania/Kaanapali area makes you feel like you are on Spring Break. Influx of cruise ship passengers combined with a billion other resort/condo dwellers make for crowded beaches and restaurants in West Maui even in off-season. Was I on Front street or a port in the Carribean? 2- View from our room Great hotel for watching the sunset 3- Very friendly staff Cons: 1- Rennovate or drop your room rate - The bathrooms were worse than I remember. Slippy shower, or maybe I'm just clutsy. 2- No restaurants - I had the choice of Sushi (yuck) or eating room service every night since the hotel closed their Prince Court restaurant. Had to drive to dinner. Breakfast buffet had great food and a large selection for $24 per person. 3- Hotel Pool - Very small - plan on heading to the beach and skip the pool On our next trip to Maui, we will stay in Wailea and skip the West coast.

Well, I can now say that the Maui Prince is a notch above those other two properties in my opinion! First I want to give a big mahalo to Ron at the front desk, who assisted me in upgrading my reservation from a Mauka Suite to an Ocean Front Suite before my arrival. I called him the morning of my check-in date, and he was able to offer me an upgrade at a very resonable rate. For 10 nights, I stayed in the most beautiful suite I have ever stayed in on Maui. The suite itself was very spacious and well decorated. But the highlight was the fact that there were not one...not two...but three lanais from which to enjoy the spectacular views of the Pacific. From room 534 (on the top corner floor of the Wailea wing) there was a 270 degree panoramic view of the West Maui mountains, the Island of Lana'i, the islet of Molokini, the Island of Kaha'olawe and of course the stunningly gorgeous turquoise blue Pacific. Each morning it was a treat having coffee and breakfast on one of the lanais...as we watched the 6:30am departure of the Kai Kanani II take snorkerlers driectly from Maluaka beach in front of the Prince Hotel to Molokini. Some of our days were spent relaxing on the beach in the morning, snorkeling amidst the schools of fish and the occasional green sea turtle, and having lunch under one of the poolside cabanas before returning to the suite for a relaxing afternoon nap. Others days were more action packed: taking a day tour over to Molokai to do the World Famous Mule Ride to Kalaupapa to see the beauty and history of the former leprosy colony; driving the entire loop around the west Maui mountains; driving the Hana Highway and spending one night at the gorgeous Hotel Hana Maui; going to 2 different luaus: the Old Lahaina Luau and the Feast at Lele; or taking in a Vegas-style theatrical production called 'Ulalena in Lahaina. Regardless of what we chose to do, the Maui Price Hotel was the perfect place to return to each evening to absorb the beauty of the sunset over the Pacific. (Check out some of my photos.) And I have to admit that the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The Maui Prince is much more relaxed than the other resorts in Maui at which I have stayed. The entire staff goes out of their way to exude a spirit of aloha which other mega resorts call only dream about. The beach was gloriously uncrowded, since it is shared by no other resort at the current time. The snorkeling directly from Maluaka beach was so incredible that we did not feel the need to go to Molokini. And the room service was so delicious that most nights we just ordered in and relaxed in our spacious 1100 square foot suite while enjoying the sounds of the crashing waves. The pool was perfect. Just large enough to do some laps after swimming in the ocean, but not so large as to be overrun by screaming children...as is the case at some of the other mega resorts in South Maui. The complimentary cabanas were always available; and the poolside service was very friendly and prompt with towels, drinks and food. On our final day, I was granted a late check-out of 6pm since my flight back to the mainland did not depart until 10:40pm. What a superb gesture of customer service on the part of the management of the Maui Prince! Mahalo for that! I can not give enough accolades to the Maui Price Hotel.

Very low key and tranquil...and its built around a beautiful lush courtyard. Our room was large and meticulously clean..and the housekeeping went above and beyond to keep it that way everyday. Lastly the beds were sooooooo comfortable! The room also had a good size empty refrigerator which we were able to put to good use for sodas, and lunch provisions. Given the cost of eating at the hotel, or frankly anywhere on the island; we really appreciated that. What initially drew me to the Maui Prince was the beach. And it didn't disappoint. Excellent!!!......clean, and never croweded, Best of all, the snorkeling was good; and even though we drove to some much touted snorkeling spots on the island; frankly there there was no need to. We saw several turtles, and a great variety of fish. My only complaint was they start coming to pick up and lock down the beach lounge chairs too early in my opinion. Also, its very expensive to rent an umbrella ($15/day - better to bring your own) Lastly, if you have a pineapple you wish to enjoy, bring a knife!!! I was stupefied when we called for a knife and were told it would cost $5 for them to cut up our pineapple for us. This was the only moment that slightly soured our stay.

So we tought it would be ok, except when we got there...everything was amazing! First of all, I want to adress the issue of the decor. I know hotels in the States really focus on the rooms, while for us it's more about the overall experience. The rooms aren't new, but the furniture and design are very, very classy and eternal. If remodernised now, it would end up looking just like the other hotels. This one has an elegant soul. The whole layout of the hotel is wonderful. There's the spacious terraced lobby overlooking the internal garden and the koi carp pond, also the other hotel grounds were the most beautiful tropical garden there could be. The beach in front of it is also beautiful. The views of Molokini (specially sunset and sunrise) are quite something. It's a resort, but since we went there in September after Labor day, it wasn't crowded at all. That was also noted by other reviews. Since the sheer size of the hotel, we would never really grasp the number of people staying at the time. However, when we went to the morning yoga session on the lawn overlooking the beach, it was almost like having a private instructor. The staff in general was great, helped us with planning all our other activites in Maui. About the location, yes, it fells amazingly secluded since it's the last hotel in south Makena, close to some great looking beaches (Big Beach, Small Beach, La Perouse Bay is also nearby). But if you have a rental car, and you probably want to have it for you trip to Maui, you can reach Wailea in minutes, than take the highway bypassing Kihei and from there on to the other attractions of the island. We felt that if we were to stay in Kaanapali, the drive to the other sights would have been much longer, since the road to Lahaina isn't as fast as the highway close to Kihei. Just one caveat, the shack next to the beach renting snorkling gear & other equippment is overpriced. There are many great restaurants in Maui, so we didn't eat at our hotel up to our last night when we just ordered room service. We were again surprised, the food was very good and the menu quite imaginative (for a room service menu). The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey.

The construction activity is limited to weekdays during business hours, but if you plan to relax on the beach or in a south-sdie room during this time, you will hear some of the noise.

My best friend and I traveled to Maui in support of a friend who was running his first triathlon at age 54. The Maui Prince was a great venue and the staff could not have done a better job making this event happen without a hitch. My hubby and I usually rent oceanfront condos when we visit the various Hawaiian islands, which I still prefer, but this hotel has literally thought of everything to make ones stay here enjoyable. Shore snorkeling, excursion and catamaran pickup right on the beach, yoga classes right on the beach, and attention to details like having a coffee, pastry, and smoothie kiosk right in the lobby that opens at 6 am for early risers like me. Ever heard of a hotel having free valet parking? You call down to the valet desk and ask for your car, leave your room, and by the time you've walked to the lobby the attendants have the car waiting for you out front, with the top down, a/c on, and music playing. We used the coffee machine and refrigerator extensively. Wine cooled along with cheese and meats for our pre-dinner drink and appetizers every night at sunset on the very substantial lanai outside our oceanfront room #130. I had pre-ordered a bottle of Charles LeFere champagne to be chilling in a bucket of ice for our arrival which we enjoyed very much. The room size amazed me! It was one of the roomiest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in at a fraction of the usual price. The grounds were beautiful and the pool and surrounding area was nice. Breakfast options: 1. For budget eaters, grab a coffee and freshly baked tropical fruit bread from the kiosk mentioned before and head to the beach for a surreal early morning experience. That's where I am as I'm writing this review. I'm the only person on the beach and I am near tears at the absolute serenity I feel here. 2. For an average breakfast, go to Cafe Kiowai to order ala carte or eat at their bountiful buffet. Beautiful surroundings overlooking koi ponds and waterfalls, which is what the center of the hotel consists of. Amazing! 3. For a splurge, eat their champagne brunch on Sunday morning. Great food and very good champagne , the same Charles LeFere we had before was served along with a very nice musical group to entertain all the diners. Expensive and fabulous! Worth every penny.

For the last 2 days my husband and I thought it would be nice to see another side of the island so we trusted the travel agent in picking the Maui Prince. BAD IDEA! We arrive to a hotel that is absolutely dead! They immediately checked us in, and she proceeded to give us our room when I told her that we were a honeymoon couple and if there were any upgrades possible (note that Pleasant Holidays has a thing they print out on our check in slip that says please give guests one free upgrade as they are honeymoon couple). She seemed irritated, and was gone for 10 minutes before she told us she would upgrade us from a partial oceanview room to a full oceanview room. Fine I guess, however, the Sheraton Maui upgraded us from same type room all the way up to an oceanview suite and there hotel was packed versus the empty Maui Prince, so I didn't get the logic, but I'm not going to complain on a free upgrade. We get in the room and you can barely see the ocean! It has a weird odor in it, the tv is so small you can barely lay on the bed and watch it, and there wre only 2 drawers for clothes- mind you we had tons of clothes so we just kept them in our bags. We ended up eating dinner out of the hotel at The Grand Wailea at HumuHumu, which I suggest to everyone!!!!

Which is fine, that is what we had paid at Sheraton (actualyl we didn't, our package at Sheraton gave us breakfast for 2 free all 6 days, GREAT!) First of all, waitress was extremely rude, and she served no purpose at this hotel. There was a machine inside for Orange Juice and coffee, with the smallest glasses I have ever seen, so you basically serve yourself. The food was fine, nothign like the Sheraton, but there were maybe 5 other people dining at 9 in the morning, I thought that was odd and showed us how slow the hotel was. We went to the store to get me some cold medice and figured since the maid was in the room next to ours when we left, she would have cleaned the room up by the time we got back. WRONG! We came back about an hour later, so maid in sight, and the room hadn't been touched. I just wanted to lay down so my husband was kind and made the bed and cleaned up the room for us. Finally by 3 (serveral hours later) I called the housecleaning department to bring us up some towels. 4 rolls around, NO MAID! I finally went downtwains to front desk and told them about them not cleaning our room and she said that was really weird and asked if we had a do not disturb sign on and I said no we hadn't, we had just been forgotten. She said she would send some towels up right away. Within 15 minutes towels for finally broughten up, with no offer to clean teh room. I just couldn't believe it! We ended up giong down to the pool so I coudl lay in the sun and nap and hopefully the heat would help my cold. Yet again, NO ONE ELSE AROUND! I have never seen a pool so empty in Maui in my life. I geuss its great if you don't want a lot of noise, but at the same token, I'm not understanding why we weren't offered a better room considered we spent over $400 on the room we already had. The next day we got up early and left and decided to never stay there again! Its a great hotel if you like really quiet, but for us, we like quiet, but the option to go to a nice bar with people around for background noise. This hotel was sucha huge letdown, we just laughed it off and told our families of our trials at the hotel.

The service at the front desk was mediocre at best. We were not offered the cool towels as was touted as a part of the \"Prince Pleasures.\" We stayed in an oceanfront room that was spacious, clean, fresh smelling, and offered an incredible view of the ocean. Yes, the room was outdated but had none of the mold or insects that I had read about. There was no turn down service (I guess you have to request it) which was a surprise considering the cost of the room. There was water for us that was replenished seemingly at the whim of the housekeepers. When enquiring about this at the front desk we were informed that there was a $3 charge per bottle. However, the next day there was more water. We ate at all three restaurants with the only disappointment being Cafe Kiowai. Not only was it incredibly expensive; it just wasn't very good with service at a minimum. The other places were amazing offering a different type of buffet nightly. The pool staff and service was just amazing. The food was great and the wait staff very attentive. They continually supplied fresh, cold water as well as fresh pineapple and cool, damp towels. The sandwiches there were large enough for two to share and they would split them for without being asked. We had a beachfront massage our first morning. The therapists were amazing, the surroundings were incredible. It was probably the best massage I have ever had. Later in the week, however, I had arranged for a couples massage. When arriving to a small room by the workout facilities we had to wait about 15 minutes outside. Literally outside on a bench. We were then informed that they didn't \"do\" couples massages and when I told them that I had arranged this through the concierege weeks before I was told that the concierege are all Japanese and didn't understand what I was asking. We settled for massages that were possibly the lamest massage I had ever had. Really poor service. Overall, the place was relaxing with the beautiful gardens that I had read about. The beach was amazing with sea turtles just a few feet from the shore. The snorkeling was great once you knew where to go. We took the sunset cruise and highly recommend that. The night that we went out was a light group. The staff was awesome and tripped over themselves to give us individualized service. Really wonderful!

We were glad we chose the prince though, because you're in hawaii....how much time do you really want to spend in a hotel room? The staff was friendly enough. Seashell leis, cold towels when we got there. The housekeeping kept our room nice & we got a lot of towels from them. The pool was fine, small, but that kept it from being a kid zone. Never had troubles getting spots under the canopies & the drinks were good (though pricey). Hottubs were fine as well. It worked out well for us though. We got on the top floor & had a garden view, but when your view overlooks a lush golf course & a mountain, it's still not bad, so I didnt miss that we couldnt really see the ocean. It's a short walk anyway. The hotel room was slightly dated...could use an upgrade, but it wasnt bad. our shower had a leak in the faucet on the first day, but was fixed by the 2nd. There's a mini fridge in the room that you can use & they give you 2 bottles of water at the beginning. The room safe was free & handy to have. The AC worked fine, though we mostly had our door open w/ the screens because the weather was so nice. Bed was nice & soft, felt great. The tv was kinda lame, but then again, we didnt watch too much. They had internet hookups in the room (for ethernet ports), & I had thought it would be free, but it was about $40 for the week. Our room was on the south side of the hotel & overlooked the garden area where they held the Luaus. THAT got reallllly old after awhile & we were glad we never paid to go to it...we just got a bottle of wine & sat on our lanai & watched. Saved $80 each & we could go inside when it got too cheesy. Instead we went on a dinner cruise & had a great time. We also went on the early morning snorkeling trip from our beach on the Kai Kanaii. The staff there were excellent & it was a great trip, esp since we just walked right out of our room for it. We had breakfast once at the hotel buffet, but only once, as it was $25/person & we felt that was a little overpriced. The birds seem to fly around all over Maui & hop around on tables, so guard your food well...even with good wait staff, they'll take advantage. The beach at our hotel was fantastic...mostly sand & very secluded most of the time. on our snorkel trip we were about 200 ft out from the beach & swam with huge seaturtles (it's one of the 'turtle towns'). About 1/2 mile to the south is a great black sand beach where you can see the turtles from the shore. We never swam there as the water was too rough when we went. Big beach to the south is great too, very classic. Snorkeling around south maui is excellent. We rented equipment at Maui Dive shop (a heck of a lot cheaper than the hotel) & went to as many beaches as we could.

There was only one lady checking in a family of 3, who received hot towels. After waiting about 10 minutes, she finally got to me. She didn't offer me any hot towel, and instead said I have a partial-ocean view. I asked for an upgrade, as it was clear the hotel was far from booked. She said none were available, but, she would put me on a wait-list. My wife and I proceeded to the lounge and were one of 6 guests in the entire place. The staff was friendly, but, without any guests, the place was less than lively. Next day we waited for the concierge who was talking to the same family of 3 I saw the day before. She never acknowledged me waiting, or, said \"I will be with you shortly...\" My wife and I took turns waiting. After the concierge was done, instead of talking to my wife, she picked up a cell phone and started chatting. My wife walked away frustrated, and I came over. I heard the concierge say \"I gotta go...\" and proceeded to help me. This place is nice, but, definitely not the same caliber staff or facilities of the Marriott or Four Seasons just up the street. We ate dinner at these two places instead because it was like a ghost town at the Prince. There is litle help at the restaurant too, and we sat and watched a dozen birds tear apart all the food left on the tables because there is no wait staff to clean up. The poor hostess has to do it all. When we left our room service tray in the hall after lunch, it was still there the next day. The beach is great and not having many people there was the best part. I think if the hotel focuses a little more on training it's staff to be more professional and attentive to guests waiting, it would go a long way. The front desk never did call me for the wait-list as promised, and I could see at night all the empty rooms. We also never received any champagne or fruit like other guests. Just don't tell me our rate is for the best available room but not give it to us. For those of you looking to celebrate a wedding or anniversary, I suggest you think twice about the Prince because you will not be excited when you get here. Granted, it's a good value, but, I felt like I let my wife down coming here instead of spending just a little more to enjoy a truly 1st class resort, which the Prince is not. I never saw a manager once, and I'm not sure there is one. Walking into the lobby you see about 3 or 4 staff - and that is all. A little attention to staining the dried-out wood room doors, and replacing all the small white tiles with something a little larger and more updated, along with a visable manager, whould go a long way.

This was our second visit to a Prince hotel (the first being in Honolulu, which is a great hotel). The Maui Prince staff was great and the grounds were wonderfully landscaped (probably our favorite thing about the Prince). The room we stayed in was dated and looked as if it had not been remodeled since the 1980's, however it was well taken care of and very clean. We were given one of the lower rooms since we booked through Priceline; we did get a great rate which was $1000 less than any other hotel in Wailea so having out-dated carpet and furniture in the room was really fine. (Wailea is the place to stay in Maui). The bed on the other hand was horrible, I had to put pillows under the edge of the bed because it gave no support and I felt as if I was going to roll off of it. In addition to this. We were told when we booked the hotel that we would have a partial ocean view from some corner our balcony, which was true. My wife and I just pulled the table and chairs to the corner of the balcony that had the ocean view and had breakfast from there every morning. Even just looking out of the window from the room was amazing; the grounds are very well taken care of with palm trees everywhere and flowering trees as well (I have no idea there names, but they are great). One note regarding what is in the room, they have a dorm fridge that is for use by the occupant, which is great. Microwaves are extra however, we just brought a hotshot and had Oatmeal in the mornings. The area around the Prince (Wailea) is considerably more beautiful than Lahina and Kehei. It is very much an upper end area with the Prince located at the southern most region (maybe two miles from any other hotel). I would also highly recommend just making a walk on the beach/greenway south to Little Beach. It was simple yet one of my highlights of the trip. There are many tidal pools in the outcropping along with Black Crabs and other sea life in the pools themselves. There are also a couple of small black sand beaches along the way. Please be careful going into the water in front of the Prince!! When we arrived we were not informed of a swell that was occurring. The first time we got in the water the first time it was pretty calm however a lot of sand was in the water. We saw turtles off to the left near a rocky out cropping, however again it was murky and hard to see and around 10am the ocean became rough and were told to come back earlier in the morning when it would be more calm. So we came back around 7am the day before we left and got into the water as we normally would, right after we got out there and put our flippers on, several 5 to 6 foot waves began to hit us. This threw both of us about pretty severly. My wife ended up going to a local doctor for several cuts and abrasions (this was just from the sand on the beach!!) along with a huge burse on her hip, and twisted muscles in her leg. There is another beach called Ulea or something like that further north that is suppose to be much calmer and have more fish (we only saw a few the first day we went out). Just as a tip for eating out in the area, we ate at two very outstanding restaurants, the first is called the SeaWatch restaurant, which is located at a golf course near there and has unbelievable views and great food along with very good service (breakfast was about $10-$12 per person dinner was a lot more, $20-40 per person). The second was at Big Wave cafe in Kehei. This is not a fancy place as it is in a strip mall. However since they have 2 for 1 pricing from 5 - 6:30 PM, it did not really matter. I had macadamia nut crusted Mahi-Mahi (normally $24) and my wife had a steak (normally $22). Both meals came with salads and bread. Everything here came to around $35 after the tip!!! The road to Hana is beautiful but long, you will see shirts that read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I survived the road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there is a reason for these, it is nerve racking. I would highly suggest if you do it, get a hotel down there, then drive back the next day and see it all over. We left around 7am and got back at the prince around 11pm (there is a lot to see along the road which is the point to going). Also, I have personally seen the signs, you cannot get all the way around the south side of the island, and earthquake in 2006 took out several bridges. Overall we really did like the hotel, even if it was not as nice as the one in Honolulu. This is our third island to visit (Oahu and Kauai) and like most people you develop a favorite. We both loved Maui; however it is not lush and green like Oahu and Kauai.

The \"Sunset Cruise\" offered at the hotel is simply not very good and far too expensive. The \"pupus\" are stingy with little variety and the drinks, although plentiful, are poorly made.

IF....you WANT....a tropical experience that matches you life-long dreams, The Maui Prince is the place to stay! Our first time after a forever plane trip we drove...and drove...and drove..in the dark night over tiny banked roads until we came to the Southern end of the Island, then passed all the commercial standard hotels. We thought we must have gone too far as we suddenly we in the utter dark, with only tropical plants along the road, then suddenly...we crested a hill....and there was our Shangri-La! A tropical oasis....with soft glowing lights by the ocean. We drove up, tired, but happy, and we greeted by the most wonderful valets, kind, helpful, and genuinely happy to see us. We were led to the front desk where we gratefully accepted their warm, moist washclothes. We heard our first \"Mahalos\" from a beautiful lei-draped hostess, then were led to our rooms. To our amazement, there was no roof over the main hotel plaza....it doesn't rain in Southern Maui. The aroma of tropical plants was spectacular. We were led to our wonderful room that had two doors....an outter shuttered door you could leave open to let the tropical breezes waft through and an inner security door. We noticed the constant theme of whales over everything, so asked if you Really saw whales, or was that a rare occurrance..the bellhop casually walked to the large lanai (balcony) and said, well, there is a pod swimming below now...and we saw an entire family of whales swimming by!! The bed was huge, comfortable, and magnificent. The hotel had provided a huge basket of UNBELIEVABLY fresh, ripe tropical fruit. For our first breakfast, we ordered breakfast in bed. To our amazement, they brought in a real table, put in real linen, real siverware, a fresh orchid centerpiece, and our first taste of genuine fresh-brewed, genuine Kona Coffee, as we sat in our bed, Lanai door opened, and watched the sunrise. We were in paradise! They even brought a copy of the daily newspaper. To our surprise a little while later, there was a knock, and the manager and our assigned ?server/hostess/beautiful Hawaiin Maiden Tami..for the week was there with the manager, bringing our young daughter a complimentary stuffed animal, Maui the Whale! That morning we went to the beach for the first time and experienced Nirvana....we were the only ones there for a mile of perfect white sand beach, warm water, and perfect medium waves. To my amazement, whales would swim by just hundreds of yards away. We took the hotel Catamaran trip...something you MUST NOT miss! We sailed to a sunken volcano that was flush with tropical fish. On our voyage, then suddenly took down the sail, and said..look to the side. A gigantic whale appeared inched from the side of the catamaran, and lazily rolled to it's side to eye us, then over the next hour, swum beneath our Catamaran and eyed us from literally inches away, one with nature. What an experience! The next morning we tried the breakfast buffet, and we dazzled. How can I describe perfection? A warm, magnificent morning, warm, tropical breezes, sitting at a table on the edge of a large Koi pond FILLED with enormous Koi....who would jump out of the water willingly for a tossed piece of bread. The breakfast was magnificent...buffet style....with a selection of both American and Japanese fare. You'd sit back, nibbling on a piece of toast, imbibing the perfect Kona coffee, feeding the Koi, and feel the strings of work come off as you went into a dreamlike state. That afternoon we drove to the very close- by neighborhood hills and we stunned at the incredible display of flowers and the aromas of tropical paradise. One evening we took the incredibly-long journey to the \"tourist\" Western End of the Island with all the huge crowded resorts to go to the Swan Court. It was fun....live Swans literally strolling between the tables as you watched the sunset. We felt SORRY for the poor people paying three times as much to be jammed into the crowed commercial hotels. One day we took the Haleakela Volcano Sunrise tour.....picked up at the hotel before dawn, driven to the top of the FREEZING cold Volcano to witness your own personal sunrise, then ride bikes downhill for an hour without pedaling, going from freezing to tropical. We went to the world-reknowned Japanese-Sushi restaurant in the hotel...very traditional Japanese with bare wood tables...but the most incredible Sushi you will ever experience. Ivan was our Sushi chef...ask for him. The manager was so delightful...take the time to talk to him. TAKE THE TIME.....to have the best drink of your life....take the shuttle to the very close golf course 19th green, order the best Mai Tai of your life...then sit in the tropical splendor as the warm tropical breezes blow as you overlook the impossibly-green greens....that slope downwards from your vantage point to the crashing surf....with pods of whales swimming by! The golf course itself is unusual...a tiny fringe of green surrounded by volcanic rock with impossibly-perfect oceanic views. The only negative?....a teeny Motel 6 cold circular pool.

At the Sheraton, we saw a sea wall in building 6 off our balcony with just room for two chairs and a small table and the ocean with no beach. Yes the room at the Sheraton was fresher with a bigger bathroom but the hotel was more crowded and I felt that I could have been at any beach. The bed at the Prince was a winner. At the Prince, there was still a feeling of old Hawaii and relaxation. As a bonus, I could step out of my room at sunrise and see it over Haleakala framed by the huge garden atrium with waterfalls and a stream. At the Prince the beach lounge chairs and pool cabanas and valet parking were complimentary. The Sheraton charged for all three amenities. A lounge chair rental on the beach was $10.00. We did enjoy the luau at the Sheraton with prime seating at ring side for just an extra $10.00 with Maui Adventures. The Sheraton told me prime seating was sold out.

They were mixed. We booked anyway. I was scared about finding a dirty and outdated room. We were afraid of construction noise. I was aware that others had said the staff was rude. We wondered if we should pay more to stay at the Grand Wilea or the Ritz. But, we took a chance on the Maui Prince, and we are so glad we did. We made our decision based on the properties seclusion, the small pool (no kids) and the beach. Why stay somewhere with a huge pool that could pass as a waterpark when you arent bringing the kids, and an amazing beach 20 yards from our room? First, check in was a breeze. We were greeted with a shell lei and a cold lemon washcloth to wipe away the grime from the plane. We booked an oceanview room, and were upgraded to oceanview prime. Our view was amazing. Room 523. Ask for it. There were rooms with better views, but they must have been the suites. We could see the palm-lined beach, the hotel grounds, molokini crater, and sunsets. Secondly, as other reviews have stated, there is construction near the hotel. We could see it, and hear it occasionally. What we did hear was quickly drowned out by the ocean and the birds. It was not a problem by any means. We found the staff to be outstanding. We arrived with a positive attitude, and left with a better one. We were polite and happy, and sure enough, the staff treated us the same way. When I made a request for housekeeping to bring us new robes, they were knocking on our door within 5 minutes. Room service was prompt and friendly. The activities desk handled all of our plans such as the luau and the sunset cruise. We reccomend any trip on the catamaran that leaves from the beach. The staff has alot of personality, and they dont skimp on the rum! Billy at the beach shack is very cool, and he knew us by name the first day. He can reserve you a beach cabana. The beach was windy, and that cabana saved our day. Also, not described anywhere, there is yoga by the ocean every morning at 7. And, pay the ten dollars to upgrade your seating at the luau. We had to wait in line, but we ate first and had fantastic seats for the show. Bring your money, the arts and crafts are impossible not to buy. They will also sell you a photo of your party for $20. Not worth it, but I bought it anyway, and wish I hadnt. We left the hotel once, to get our marraige license. We even got married on the hotel beach. Which, by the way, is very private. We sat near a couple that were staying at the Four Seasons. They came to our beach because it was less crowded, better snorkeling, and larger. That says alot. We watched whales breaching off shore, turtles swimming, and sunsets. At times, we were the only ones on the beach. And the hotel was booked. I cant say enough about the Maui Prince.

On the other hand: \u00c2\u00b7 An ocean view room means you can see the ocean from some far corner of your lanai. (Our view was so bad the bellhop apologized for it and showed me where to stand to see the ocean.) You may face the more unattractive edges of the property from a lower floor. This is explained on the website, but I never found it when I booked my room. (I looked!) Had I known what I was getting, I either would have paid extra to up-grade or looked elsewhere, as this was the most expensive hotel on my itinerary and I was expecting a place where I could see the ocean. \u00c2\u00b7 Apparently they have very few king rooms. The vast majority of rooms have two full-size beds, not even queen beds. \u00c2\u00b7 Internet access is $10 a day. \u00c2\u00b7 The hotel is NOT located right on the beach. From an environmental perspective, I appreciate this. However, this distance from the ocean means lower-level rooms and the restaurants do NOT have a view of the beach, although lower oceanfront rooms do have lovely views of the ocean through swaying palms. Nor is there a beach bar. Again, not a bad thing, just something to know \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if you have a weakness for beachside cocktails at the end of the day :-) Nothing is cheap at the Prince, but there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many extra charges either.

I didn't realize what I was getting and was very disappointed with the lack of view (you could see the ocean from one tiny corner of our lanai) and the fact there was nowhere else on the property to relax with a drink and enjoy the scenery. However, when I finally got really frustrated (near the end of our stay) and complained that the website needs to be clearer on what sort of view the rooms have, I was upgraded for our final night to an oceanfront room with a lovely view. Despite some of the other reviews here, I felt the management does want to please their guests. However, I also have to admit that I acknowledged that I intended to review the property here and that may be what prompted the upgrade.

If you are here for the resort, not to really experience Hawaii (but rather to be among other tourists in a place that would look perfectly at home in a -possibly gated-Florida vacation development) go north to the other resorts of the South Shore. If you like classic elegance with a bit of charming wear and tear, and a feel of being in the environment versus disneyland, you may really enjoy the Maui Prince. Driving past the other resorts of the South Shore, I was crossing my fingers, hoping we had not made a terrible mistake. We passed the highly manicured overbuilt resorts one by one, then drove a little further. With a sigh of relief we pulled into the drive to the hotel-surrounded by greenery, allowed to grow a bit on its own so that you have the sense of being in the woods, away from it all. And then we walked into the lobby and caught our breath! Designed as a large open square around a lovely Japanese- influenced garden, the hotel transports you to another place the minute you step into the lobby. The room we had was \"partial ocean\" and yes it was only partial (staff got a bit crabby when we asked about that) but from our lanai(balcony) we also saw lush plants and the island of Lanai'i outlined in the distance. The rattan furniture may not be brand new, but does give a welcoming, island feel to the rooms (as compared to say the Sheraton rooms which gave lip service to Hawaii but really could have been a hotel room in Vegas...) As to food, this was our one complaint/word of advice- avoid buying the overpriced hotel food. We went to the Court restaurant and were turned away due to my husbands t-shirt and accepted the redirect to the next door lounge (it was our first night and we were starving) which served the same food and was really only separated by an open doorway. The food was fine, not that great and came in small over-priced portions. This experience was to hold true for most of our trip- avoid hotel food and find something in the community. In this case I suggest taking the short drive to Kihei- look up stuff in Fodor's, Frommers, Lonely Planet or this site and forget hotel food. The coffee cart in the lobby is fine for breakfast (they have fresh fruit as well as pastries). The pool and beach. Okay the pool is small and just round (sorry again no Disney action here) and I could not do laps- but the ocean is great for that here and again we all really liked the pool. (yes I was surprised by the hot tubs but they are right next to the lovely gardens so who cares?) And the blue tiles, the canopied cabanas, the gorgeous gardens, just felt charming and cosy, and a lot more personal than some huge lot of over-manicured lawns etc. The beach is wonderful- great swimming when we were there plus lovely views of Molikini, Kaho'olawe island and West Maui. Not too big or crowded. And you can always head to Makena State Park and go to Big Beach- one of the best beaches on our trip. We brought a 12 year old who also liked it here, especially the beach. (there were other kids around as well) If I had it to do over, I'd definitely skip the Sheraton and the whole Ka'anapali thing and extend our stay at the Maui Prince.

At $400 a night, I expected at least a 4 star experience. What we got wasn't even close. First of all, don't be fooled by the intentionally misleading \"ocean view prime\" room. I specifically asked my travel agent for an ocean view, and he understandably thought I was getting one by booking \"ocean view prime.\" Turns out we were on the 2nd floor looking at the pool and could barely see the ocean over the trees (if we stood on the deck and looked to the right). I complained, and they told me I wanted \"ocean front\" which would cost $90 extra per night. After checking, they told me they had none available. They offered to move me up a couple floors facing the same pool. That helped a little, but definitely not what I bargained for. And the front desk guy was getting impatient with me, as if I was asking too much. So we went down to the pool to get some food. The pool, by the way, is a joke. Its a small circle of a pool. Nothing you would expect at a nice resort. And here is the best part . . . there are two hot tubs next to the pool that are the above-ground kind you would buy at Sears. At a Holiday Inn I wouldn't complain. But for $400 a night, gimme a break! After sitting for 15 minutes at the pool bar, someone finally came by and asked if we were being helped. We asked how the $18 shrimp cocktail was. We were told not to get it. The shrimp was purchased pre-cooked and came in a bag, and wasn't worth the money. I appreciated the honesty, but I would rather pay $18 for quality. The next morning we went to the overpriced breakfast buffet. Its very basic. The cream cheese was actually covered in mold. My wife pointed this out and they replaced it, but again, no attention to detail. After 2 nights at the hotel, we decided to move over to the Four Seasons which was only slightly more expensive. When I checked out of the Maui Prince they told me they were still going to charge me for the 3rd night as a \"penalty\" for early check out, and the $100 credit I received for incidentals for a 3-night stay wouldn't apply. Smoke was coming out of my ears at this point. The desk clerk told me all this without even checking with a manager. She told me she would have the manager call my cell phone. An hour later, the desk clerk (not the manager) called me back and told me she spoke with the manager and the decision was final. This time I insisted on speaking with the manager. The manager told me she was going to charge me the 3rd night because my problem with the \"ocean view prime\" room was my travel agen't fault, not theirs. My travel agent, according to the manager, should have known better. I got her to give up on shafting me out of the $100 credit for incidentals, but not the $400/night penalty charge. I know there are a number of positive reviews on this message board. I am baffled to see that. Something tells me the folks who write nice reviews work for the hotel. At the Four Seasons, the staff is intensely focused on making sure guests are happy at all times. I felt like the opposite was true at the Maui Prince. A few other notes: -- The hotel is clearly early 80s vintage, and is in desperate need of a facelift. -- We had to ask 3 times to get a crib. -- There were some \"salty dogs\" at the pool bar who were clearly not guests and were there as friends of the bartender. They were loud and cussed a lot. That just added to our wonderful experience eating pool side. - The Four Seasons, the Grand Wailea and the Fairmont are all right near the Prince, and are all much nicer without having to pay much more.", "Date": "February 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cwalk to makena beach\u201d", "Author": "SeattleBabyboomer", "ReviewID": "UR13654250", "Content": "This is the baby boomers delight!!!

Our expectations for the Maui Prince were based somewhat on two stays we've had at Mexican resorts in the Caribbean over the past 10 years. Both of those occasions were very good experiences, marked with polite, responsive, and respectful service throughout our stay and from all levels. This in turn was the kind of service we expected at the Maui Prince, and certainly for the price. But at one time or another we were disappointed -- from the front desk, to the on-site restaurants, to personnel at the pool and beach, to the valet. If the service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t generally indifferent, it was outright rude and disrespectful. The first night at check-in, our dates of stay were incorrect by the hotel system. First the clerk said that we would have to pay for an extra night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay because of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We produced travel documents showing the correct dates to which the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcun-empowered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clerk said we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to talk to a manager-- who had gone home for the evening. We got it resolved the next day, but there was no genuine apology for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistake or any effort to make up for it (just indifference). We didn't want to have to spend our time resolving problems like that. Next, the on site restaurants were never open at convenient times, some closing at 5:00 PM (which is about dinner time where we come from). So one late afternoon, my wife went to the pool to get something for dinner, and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; yet other people were still eating and drinking. As she walked away she checked the time on her cell phone and saw that it was 4:45 PM. She went back and showed the time. They took her order, but again, there was no genuine apology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just indifference. Then at the beach, a beautiful beach by the way, there is a snorkel boat that leaves and returns every few hours. For anyone who is around the beach for any length of time, never mind a few days, the boat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity is readily obvious and its visits and departures are no big deal; it moves at a snail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pace. For overblown safety reasons, we suppose, the people who charter it feel the need to shout about to people to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be on the lookout for the boat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you Understand!?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just walking down the beach; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to shout at us; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disruptive to an otherwise quiet beach. And whatever happened to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excuse Me, Please, and Thank You\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as opposed to barking Commands at bystanders and strollers who are paying to vacation at the beach?? Finally, the Valet; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just plain rude; barking commands to people like at a boot camp, instead of treating people like they are vacationing at a high-priced resort. The rest of this review is to affirm what is stated in many other reviews: the bathrooms in particular are run-down and in serious need of refurbishing. Our bathroom was really dirty (cob webs under the sink counter, old dark-colored dirty water marks across the ceiling that looked to be from years of accumulation, mold in the showers, peeling wall paper and some gross, rusting metal at the overhead fire sprinkler. For the price, this is a 2/5 or 3/5 hotel at best. Plus keep in mind, you get indifferent and rude service too!

My options were all in the stratospheric price range for a resort, so I bid a relatively low price and ended up at the Maui Prince. After reading the reviews in Tripadvisor, I became concerned, but the reality is mostly good, which I will now report upon: First, the good -- this slice of paradise (Wailea-Makena) is tops on Maui because of the awesome views, spectacular landscaping, low humidity, relatively low traffic, and minimal commercial shlock to mar the beauty. When you arrive at the Maui Prince (about 30 minutes from the airport at Kuhului) you say \"wow.\" The property is literally the last hotel on the road wedged between the Pacific and the mountain. Even the parking lot is beautiful and the place is very quiet. As for the dreaded construction noise reported upon by other reviewers, we did not hear any even though we could see the construction site about 1000 yards away. All we ever heard was the surf and the birds that wake you up in the morning. The beach is terrific, the open air lobby/atrium is very attractive, and the grounds are well-maintained. Our room was large with a mini-fridge, bath and separate shower, good beds and a clever interior louvered door arrangement that allows one to shut off the AC, open the sliding glass doors (close the screen doors!) and enjoy cross ventilation. One real pleasant surprise: in the lobby is the Cappuccino Cafe, which has to be the biggest food bargain on Maui. Good coffee, first rate pastries, pleasant staff and all at rock-bottom prices. Forget the $30 breakfasts for two elsewhere -- $7 for two here. OK, it comes in plastic and paper, but buy it and park yourself in comfy chairs in the lobby and enjoy your savings. Now for the bad (really semi-bad): the pool is relatively small and round with no shallow area, so it's not as functional as other resorts. However, the pool area is nice with cabanas (for those of us who are sun-averse), good chaise lounges and umbrellas, and food/bar service. Our room AC was dysfunctional even after a maintenance staff visit. The thermostat and fan had minds of their own. The good news -- we shut it off and were actually more comfy. Final negative -- the linens were not top-notch and the blankets were really heavy. Would I stay here again? At $200/night versus $500/night for other Wailea resorts -- absolutely.

My wife and I just got back from a five day Honeymoon stay at the Prince and have only GREAT things to say about our experience. Let's start from the beginning. The front desk and lobby are absolutely GORGEOUS. The entire Lobby area is an open air atrium with a koy pond, waterfall and beautiful garden. We were met at the front entrance by a very attentive valet, received a seashell lei, and were pleasently directed to the front desk. At registration we were informed that we had been upgraded to a full ocean view room (Thank's Expedia!) Our room was just off the elevator. Very convienent. Our room (418) was perfect in every way. Very large, spotlessly clean, huge bathroom with a seperate toilet area, refrigerator with FREE bottled water, soft robes, fantastic view of the Ocean, pool and golf course. No matter what words I write, they can't begin to accurately describe how wonderful our stay was. Please take the Molokini Snorkel Trip that is sold in the first floor office. At first I thought that the price tag was a bit steep (114.00), but the Catermaran picks you up right in front of the activity hut and the crew of the ship are friendly, knowledgable and funny. I saw none of the problems that some other reviewers complained about. The room was large, NOT outdated and exceptionally clean. The pool has plenty of lounge chairs, a full service bar and very personable bar tenders. No, the pool is not HUGE, but it was never even close to full capacity. If you need some type of extravagant pool, stay out of Hawaii and go to Orlando instead! The nice thing about having a \"normal\" size pool is.....NO KIDS! The management sent us up a very nice bottle of Champaign for our Honeymoon stay. The coffee in the coffee shop is $2.00 for a large size. The food in all the restaurants is well above average.

For context, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Prince several times previously, most recently in 2002. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also stayed at the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons a few times each; we have also stayed in Kaanapali (Westin) a few times. We chose the Prince for this stay (despite the mixed reviews) because we love the location and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very special to us and because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard the hotel was going to be demolished/renovated and we wanted to say goodbye. (I asked the desk staff\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey say the decision whether to renovate and upscale or demolish and build new will be made in the 2010 timeframe. Until then, it will continue to be managed by Prince Hotels.) Our room was deluxe ocean view on the 5th floor. The view of Pu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u Ola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i, Molokini, and the Pacific was spectacular. With the lanai doors open a crack, the sound of the surf lulled us back to sleep in the morning; the sound of birdcalls reminds us that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here in Makena again. We originally booked via the hotel for about $330 for a deluxe oceanview room. Then in December, we got a Prince Preferred email for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winter escape\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at $290 (same room) including a $100 resort credit. The Makena area is our favorite part of Maui. On the drive from the airport, we saw how much has changed and been added in the way of new shopping centers, stores, housing, vacation rentals. Wailea, although lovely, felt more like Scottsdale to me than Hawaii, despite the palm trees (they have them in AZ also). Once we were down on the lower road, there was no view of the sea, just gorgeous gated properties. We gave a sigh of relief and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relaxing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the Maui stay began as we crossed into Makena. For now, at least, there is still kiawe along the road, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet. Although the outside of the structure show a few signs of wear (could use a repainting) the inside is clean and fresh after renovations. The hotel was built in the 1980s and has a minimalist, Japanese sensibility. The rooms are functional but not ornate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno over-the-top marble baths, no luxurious furniture. The furniture is simple bamboo and light wood, Hawaii-style. The king bed was very comfortable, carpets fresh, paint spotless, bathroom immaculate. It does have the Japanese hand-held shower, which many find annoying; I actually find it convenient. Housekeeping once a day was thorough. The empty fridge had complimentary bottled water, replenished daily (a must in this hot and sunny area). There is construction at the south (Pu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u Ola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i) side of the property. They did not work on the weekend; weekdays they start around 8 am. It was not overwhelmingly loud. We were away from the hotel for the afternoon, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to what it would have been like if I wanted to doze by the pool. The pool area has shade (umbrellas, cabanas) and a pool bar/restaurant. We did not use them. We also did not dine at Hakone because it was only open for buffet night while we were there (we love the sushi made by Chef Ivan, but the trip timing did not work in our favor this time. The breakfast buffet was $23 and had a wide assortment of items hot and cold, American and Japanese. The mac nut waffles were excellent; service was friendly and efficient. The only downer was the very grubby/mildewed green plastic placemats in the outdoor seating. They have to get rid of those (to be balanced, my spouse did not notice!). All in all, it was a lovely and quiet stay in our favorite area of Maui. I think the Prince would be my recommendation for someone who wants a South Maui base of operations in a hotel with lovely grounds and a great beach, and where Maui (not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destination resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is where he/she wants to be. It would also be a possibility for a repeat visitor who has experienced all the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attractions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is tired of Kaanapali and the drive to and from the West Maui lodgings.

For context, we ate at Capische? one night (see my review) and at Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the other two (reviews forthcoming).

During the evening the only choice is their high end restaurant, which appearred not to get much activity. For breakfast if you wanted buffet you are at the right spot, however, if you just wanted something light you are out of luck. So you need to go into town which is a 15-20 minute drive. Our biggest gripe was our unfortnate timing with a World Championship competion being held at the hotel during our entire stay. They let us know at arrival that it will be noisy with loudspeakers, helicopters, celebrations etc, I just wish they would of told us when I was making my reservation!", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWe enjoyed our stay!!\u201d", "Author": "SebaMed", "ReviewID": "UR10438018", "Content": "My fiance and I recently came back from our 3-island Hawaiian trip. Maui was our last stop where we stayed 4 days and 3 nights. We booked the Prince Hotel in Makena based on tripadvisor reviews and ranks. The hotel was located in Makena which is pretty much the last stop on South Maui. Very isolated. But a wonderful and relaxing place. We arrived into Maui from the Big Island late afternoon and after driving about 30 minutes from the Kahuilui airport, we were greeted with shell leis and nice cold damp cloths to refresh our hands and faces. We proceeded to chill by the pool which is decent size. Pool side service was awesome. Great burgers. The beach was less than 5 minutes away. The Makena beach was a very nice beach but not great for snorkeling. Great sunset view. The front desk was always friendly. Our room wasn't exactly ocean view - as the hotel boasts that every room is an ocean view. We were facing the grounds which turned out in our favor since one night, we were treated to a free viewing of the hawaiian luau show (it occurs every Tues/Thurs only). The room was spacious. A plus for getting free two bottles of water each day in our room. The toilet is a separate room adjacent to the bathroom which was nice. We DEFINITELY did not encounter any construction noise during our stay there. Other pluses: after exploring Maui each day, a spin at the whirlpool hottub by the pool was nice (closes at 10PM daily); we also ate one night at Hakone inside the hotel (awesome sushi/sashimi place). If you're looking for a nice place to relax in Maui, the Maui Prince Hotel is great for the price you're paying (moderate $$). Also in terms of location, it may seem far but it's only an additional 30 minutes to Kahuilui (the central hub to where you want to go: ie. Lahaiina, Hana, Halealuka crater)", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Surprise in South Maui\u201d", "Author": "rad21", "ReviewID": "UR10289116", "Content": "We spent 5 nights at the Maui Prince from Oct. 14-Oct. 19 and we loved it. We were a bit concerned after reading some of the negative reviews but we decided to give it a try. For the past few years we stayed at the Kea Lani but the prices have become outrageous so we booked the Maui Prince. The room we had at the Prince was larger than the room we had at the Four Seasons some years back but smaller than the suites at the Kea Lani but at half the price with an ocean view, we were satisfied. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by name and I still don't know how they knew us by name since we arrived in a rental car. The entire staff was very friendly and Thomas, the bellman, was so helpful with restaurant tips and other suggestions that helped to make our stay so pleasant. Since we are snorkelers, the beach at the Maui prince was great and right by \"Turtle Town\" so there were plenty of turtles to be seen. The beach at the Prince is far better for snorkeling that the Kea Lani or Four Seasons. The furniture in the rooms was dated a bit but our room had new carpeting and fresh paint and we loved the large patio with the drying racks for our wet gear. The bathroom was dated but I loved the removable hand spray in the shower to rinse my scuba gear and the water pressure was fine. There was a safe in the closet and plenty of counter space for toiletries, etc. right outside the bathroom. We also liked the dual front doors with the tiled entry hall so you can open the patio door and close the louvered front door and still get the trade wind breezes, we did not need to use the A/C at night at all. Yes there is some construction noise on the south side of the hotel, so request the North wing if that bothers you. Since we spent most of the day out of the room, the noise was a minor inconvenience. We really loved the gardens and flowers/fauna on the bottom level along with the waterfall and koi pond. There were plants, flowers and trees we have never seen anywhere before and it made for some great photos. The Maui Prince has much more of a 'hawaiian flavor\" than the Kea Lani or Four Seasons does. The pool was small but we never use the pool when we go on vacations, we use the beach/ocean. We tried the breakfast buffet and it was reasonably priced and had a nice variety of foods to choose from. I did some scuba diving with Shaka Divers and Doug sure knows the reefs around South Maui, I highly recommend Shaka Divers for some fun, safe diving. For great inexpensive lunches we went to Jawz Fish Tacos in Kihei. It was so good, we ate there 3 times. Fresh grilled Mahi Mahi, Ahi or Ono with cabbage, seasoned rice, sauce and a great selection of salsas and sauces, it was delicious, fast and inexpensive! For dinner we went to Roy's in Kihei, (excellent seafood, no view), Pacific'o in Lahaina (great food, great oceanfront setting) and Tommy Bahama's in Wailea (excellent fish, live mellow music). Oh and you must stop at Lappert's for ice cream or coconut sorbet. Overall we had a great trip and would recommend the Maui Prince in Makena for a great, reasonably priced hotel in the South Maui area. I think that Makena will be the next growth area since Wailea is getting overbuilt and already high priced.

We had already been to the Prince property on the Big Island (Hapuna Prince, where we were married), and were so pleased with that experience, I expected the same type of accommodations and experience at the Maui Prince... I was wrong. Saying the rooms are dated is an UNDERSTATMENT. The bathrooms are atrocious. Shower-tubs with shower curtains, cheap early 80's beige tiles, and those horrible removable shower heads that offer no pressure whatsoever. They boast ocean-views from every room... that is true, except we had to lean ALL THE WAY over our Lanai to see the Ocean... what we saw were primarily trees. The grounds of the hotel were nice, and the ponds were lovely to look at; but since you really don't want to spend too much time IN the common areas of the hotel, it doesn't make for much of a difference. While the beach was decent (snorkeling was just okay; you have to swim out pretty far to see anything of interest), the pool was horrible. I think our pool at home was larger. As far as the clubhouse is concerned, it is not within easy walking distance... you need to take a shuttle. The food there was greasy and unappealing. The hotel restaurants were okay, but given the price, I would have expected more (yes, I know food is expensive on the Islands, but you are better off going to the shops at Wailea for food). Soup was delivered cold, and service was slow. Yes, there is considerable construction noise. The plus side of not having a room with a better ocean view was that we were further from the construction site, but when on the beach, you hear it... all day long. There is no mention of that when making your reservations. Also, our room backed into their service delivery alley. So, at night and in the morning, you can hear the trash being picked up and taken away (also, bottle breaking, vehicles backing up, etc.) While I was not their on business, I did need to use a computer to check in for our return flight home; no business center. Only two computer terminals for the whole hotel, and they charge you a ridiculous $15.00 for 8 min of use; the printer didn't even work, and the concierge was clueless as to how to fix it. Staff were relatively friendly, but when complaints were made, all that we received were apologies... no action. In hindsight, I would have much rather stayed in Kaanapali or somewhere else in Wailea. I consider this property to be an embarrassment to the Prince name. My recommendation is for the Hapuna Prince on the Big Island, but to avoid the Maui Prince all together; you will find your money better spent at another location.

The hotel is nice in many ways. The atrium has a beautiful fishpond and lovely little waterfall. The grounds are beautiful, with golf courses and walking paths nicely laid out and very convenient. The rooms are big and have a lovely view of the grounds and ocean from nearly every room (see attached photo of the view from my room on the first floor). Very good customer service as well, all of the staff were very helpful, knowledgeable and polite. The beach here is beautiful and as some have already mentioned offers decent snorkeling at times. Beds are very comfortable and the soundproofing is good (did not hear a peep from the folks in the next rooms). There are a few downsides as well. The decor in the rooms is very dated and not very well maintained. All of the furniture looked like it had been around and was used and abused quite a bit. The swimming pool is small and can get a bit crowded. The restaurants are very expensive for what they serve, you are much better off going into Kihei to find food. The last thing is the location, this is as far as you can go South other than Mekana Beach Park (Big Beach), or the long road to la Perouse Bay. So, if you plan on venturing up Haleakela or driving out to Hana, or golfing at Kapalua, or going to a luau in Lahaina you have a mighty long drive. Of course, if you plan your day trips, and manage to take a change of clothes with you, you can work around that problem to some degree. Bottom line, if you do not mind not having the very nicest touches to your room, but appreciate the nice layout and extra space, and if you do not mind driving a bit to get around (or you want the seclusion), then this is a great place. I would probably go back if I had the time to spend just chillin' on the beach. This would also be a great place if you just wanted to hang out and play golf for a few days.

We'd read some less than complimentary things about the Maui Prince prior to the trip and I'll admit I had some concerns but we were going with her parents and took advantage of the hotels two rooms for the price of one special which brought the cost per room down around $225/night per room. At that price its by far the cheapest hotel in Wailea. When we arrived at the hotel we were very pleasantly surprised. The greeting was very similar to that at the Hapuna Beach. The cold towels are refreshing after spending hours on the plane and then juggling luggage and carryons thru the airport and rental cars. We had arrived early before main checkin but that gave us time to put in our request for a room on the 2nd floor. We were hungry so we headed to the pool bar and had a drink and a snack while we waited for our rooms to be ready. They called our cell phone later to let us know our rooms were ready and we were pleased with them both. We'd read that the rooms were a bit smaller as you went higher and later on we were able to confirm that by looking into a couple. Its not a huge difference but it was enough to be noticable. As you go higher you're trading off a little room size and distance to the ocean for a slightly better view. I didn't think it would be worthwhile since I like to be able to hear the ocean and we appreciated the extra square footage since we were there for a full week. We had \"oceanview prime\" rooms (#236 & 238 non-adjoining). From there we had a great view to the beach and could watch the snorkel boat coming and going each morning and afternoon. and a fantastic view out to Molokini. The rooms were very pleasant. I'll admit the decor may be slightly dated but it didn't detract from our ability to enjoy anything and we found it comfortable. Why come all the way to Maui if you're going to sit in your hotel room?? At sunset the more distant islands came more into view and the sunsets were stunning. I've posted a few pics of the rooms and the view. The hotel pools were nice and pleasantly warm. The bar at the pool was nice and we spent a good bit of time out there during the trip. Getting to know the bartenders is a great way to get info on the things to do or not do. Lucky (yes that's his name) the bartender was a wealth of info and was very helpful. He also pours a great mai tai!!! The beach was great and the snorkeling right there was good. There's a reef that runs off the left side of the beach and goes out quite a way. It has lots of little reef fish and the occasional turtle pops up as well...all for free right there at the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants much other than one lunch/snack and one breakfast. The buffet breakfast was excellent and on par with what we had at the Hapuna last year and quite reasonable, though I wouldn't shell out the $50 for the Sunday brunch. To us, breakfast just isn't worth that much. I will also say that I thought the prices for dinner at the hotel restaurants were quite high, averaging $50 per person before drinks and tip. Instead we drove into Wailea or Kihei for dinner most nights. My mother in law from Texas particularly liked Fred's Mexican Cafe in Kihei. The complimentary valet parking was very handy. My wife's father is an avid SCUBA diver and he arranged a dive trip almost every day that we were there. Being able to just drive up and unload the car at the front and have someone else park was very nice and well worth the couple of bucks per trip in tips. The hotel staff was excellent. I'd called and let them know in advance that this trip was for our anniverary and my wife's birthday. When we came back to the hotel on our 2nd night they had given us a complimentary bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries. It was a very nice touch! For my wife's birthday I called the concierage and arrange for some flowers to be delivered. It was all taken care of and delivered by the hotel staff on her birthday evening. Again...very nicely done! Overall I'd say the hotel is very nice, the staff was great and the location is fantastic. I wouldn't pay $450/night for it, but in relation to the prices at the other nearby hotels that's actually not insanely out of sight. If you're looking for a hotel that's comparable to the Fairmont or the Grand Wailea then this isn't the hotel for you. If you're looking for a nice, quality hotel with resort style amenities this is a good place without having to pay $500-$800/per night.

Champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries were delivered to our room on the first night of our stay (this was part of a package that we had signed up for when booking the room). I have read the many comments on this website about dated rooms. While I agree that the decor was not in the \"modern\" style, I felt that the rooms and all areas of the hotel were decorated tastefully and, more importantly, everything was very clean and well-kept. Cleanliness and friendly service are much more important to me than modern decor. Our room had a lovely view of the ocean (I have posted a picture to illustrate). We loved having kona coffee (provided by the hotel) on our lanai every morning. The room also included a small refrigerator and a safe. We found both of these amenities very useful. The bathroom was not a huge modern hotel bathroom, but it was very clean and thoroughly functional. We had no complaints. We also liked the fact that there was a door separating the toilet from the main bathroom area. I have read the complaints about the pool (again, picture has been posted). I have to agree with the reviewers who have commented that they come to Hawaii for the beaches and not the pools. I feel the same way. But although the pool is small, again, the pool and surrounding areas were very clean and well kept. We lounged in one of the cabanas for a bit one afternoon and had a very quiet and relaxing time. The beach at the Maui Prince could not be beat though (picture has been posted). The beach is lovely and, perhaps because it is further away from the main resort areas, it is not a high traffic area. Most of the time we found that there were only a handful of people on the beach and at times we had the whole beach to ourselves. If you like your beaches crowded and busy, this is not the place for you. But if you like a nice quiet beach where you can lay out, relax, and listen to the sound of the waves, you will love this place. We also found some other nice secluded beaches very near the Maui Prince, as well as a couple of great snorkeling spots, thanks to our Lonely Planet guidebook. My only slight complaints about the Maui Prince involve dining. First, at least the week that we were there, the 2 restaurants onsite seemed to have really irregular hours. In fact, a couple of the days they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even open at all. The bar food was alright, but nothing special. And since the Maui Prince is at least a short drive from other dining options, it would be nice if they offered a few more in-house options. Second, the bird situation at the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet itself is fantastic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food is great (I still salivate remembering the Belgian waffle bar). The setting is lovely with most seating being outdoors overlooking nicely landscaped ponds. However, the number of birds that stalk this dining area at times bordered on the comical. And at times it made me think about bird flu. These birds are not shy of people at all. Above all, do not leave your food unattended to go back for a refill on juice. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you the number of times I saw someone go back to the buffet for something only to watch at least 1 or 2 birds pounce on that person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plate the moment they left the table. Overall, we absolutely loved our experience at the Maui Prince. It was fantastic value for money.

Overall the reviews here really helped, as there were no surprises when we got to the Maui Prince last week. The hotel is dated, and the pool area is somewhat bleak (no problem getting a chair or even a free cabana here) -- but the beach is fantastic and the hotel staff really excellent (they couldn't be nicer). And our room was always very clean. We did a lot of snorkeling there last week, and saw turtles every day we went out and great fish, right from the hotel beach. The snorkel boats stop there (one leaves from there), but it's an easy swim out to where the boats and kayaks stop to see the turtles. I think this is one of the best hotel snorkel spots on the island -- it's not as crowded as Black Rock at the Sheraton in Kanapali, and much prettier. I like to be on the beach in Hawaii, as I feel we don't have to fly to Hawaii to sit by a pool. So the state of the pool didn't bother me. If you're looking for lots of activity, with people sitting elbow to elbow on beach chairs jammed around a busy pool which you have to fight for early in the day, like so many of the hotels in Hawaii, this isn't the place. As for restaurants, I read some recommendations here for Matteo's, which we loved. It was well priced, delicious Italian food -- so good, we went there twice. I also read recommendations for Da Kitchen, and went there -- and thought it was horrible; loud, greasy and disgusting.

I guess that the experience at the site is uneven. Unlike the previous poster, our room was immaculate. No smells, no mildew, which is a deal breaker for me.

The property certainly needs updating and I hope that the new owners have some plans in place to bring it into *this* century. That said, our room was spotless. Our housekeeper even left us a thank you note every day for her tip. That was a first! We stayed in room 560 which was an upgraded ocean view room (we were here on a Priceline booking). The lanai was huge and had a beautiful view of the palm trees, the ocean, and the coastline of west Maui. I joined the Prince Preferred Club and called ahead to request a king bed, and not only did we receive an upgrade, they even sent up a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. It was a nice touch. The staff on a whole was outstanding. They made us feel like welcome guests. The best feature of the Price was their outdoor property. The grounds are lovely, and their beach access is wonderful. I can't comment on the pools because we never used them. The snorkeling off of the beach was pretty good (not quite as good as the snorkeling off of Black Rock), and we enjoyed the Molokini sail on the Kai Kanani that left right from the beach. That was a huge timesaver to leave from the beach instead of one of the harbors. The Kai Kanani also took us to a place about 100 yards off the beach where we saw about 8 turtles. It would be a bit of a swim, but is doable from the beach in front of the Prince. They had a shuttle that took us up to the Shops at Wailea. It was efficient and free. Valet parking was also efficient and free. All that you have to do is tip the staff as opposed to the Hilton which charged $16.50 for valet and $9.50 for self parking!

One of our favorite parts of our stay was the beach, beautiful, and calm enough to swim in without being worried about being hit by a huge wave. The turtles in this area were wonderful to see, however we did have to snorkel out rather far, so I suggest wearing one of the little \"snorkel floaters\" you can rent. I would suggest renting snorkel gear elsewhere. The snorkel gear at Maui Prince is good quality, however it is VERY overpriced, it hurts me to remember that I paid that much!

I think the overall vibe I got from reading the many TripAdvisor reviews about this place before going to Maui is dead-on: the vast majority of people will love the Maui Prince but there will be a minority of guests who will feel somewhat disappointed with the actual rooms. But before I get to that, let me start from the beginning - you're greeted at check-in with a lemon-scented cold face towel by the front desk staff. After sitting on an airplane, sweating through baggage claim and getting the rental car, nothing puts you in the \"Aloha\" spirit faster. The front desk were able to accomodate our request for an early check-in without a problem. They even called us while we were eating lunch to let us know our room was ready. I thought that was a bit of extra effort on the staff's part to make things more convenient for us. That kind of consideration from the staff was evident throughout our stay. Every single hotel employee we encountered was friendly, cheerful, helpful and professional. Obviously this hotel puts a premium on customer service and satisfaction. I liked how the Maui Prince provided plenty of amenities without \"nickel & diming\" you for them - ie they provide a free shuttle van to and from the hotel and the Wailea area. There's free internet access in the lobby. Water bottles in the room fridge that they'll replendish daily for us. Free valet parking - although we used the self parking lot since it was only another 100 yards from the front of the hotel. There's also a decent sized convenience store in the hotel lobby area with plenty of gift ideas, sundry items, snack food and drinks (yes, alcohol too). Prices were quite reasonable. The hotel beach was quite nice - and there's excellent snorkeling right off the shore. If you're really into snorkeling, there's plenty of excellent places in nearby Makena Beach and La Perouse Bay. We did a sea kayak / snorkel trip one morning and snorkeled in 3 different spots, all pretty much within half a mile of the hotel's property. Lots of sea turtles! (We used Maui Eco Tours, and would highly recommend them!) If you are a golfer, the hotel's two 18 hole courses are among the best in Maui. The North course is more up in the hills than the South course, which hugs the coastline. The North is narrower, and tougher to play if you're not accurate with your tee shots, but the payoff for playing that course is a view on many holes that is mind-blowing - 180 degrees panoramic views of the ocean, Kahoolawe, Molokini crater, and Lanai. Absolutely beautiful setting. Just remember that every putt breaks towards the ocean, no matter what your eyes are telling you! The South course has the same view, but not from an elevated viewpoint. Also a beautiful course. The 15th is beautiful par-3 that you play towards the ocean, and the 16th plays right along the ocean. I also played at Wailea Gold Course, and while Wailea's pro shop and SeaWatch restaurant blows away the Makena clubhouse and proshop, I much preferred the Makena golf courses for their overall conditioning, challenge and greens. Final note on golf - if you've ever played in Maui, you've probably been hammered by the trade winds that kick up in the afternoon. Playing in Makena / Wailea is different since Haleakala blocks much of the wind. Forget Kaanapali and $300 rounds @ Kapalua - play golf in south Maui! After reading some reviews, we tried the sunday brunch @ the Prince Court in the Maui Prince. Pricey @ $43 pp, but it was delicious! I recommend it. Didn't eat anywhere else in the hotel. As for the rooms, we stayed on the third floor, on the south side as some other reviewers suggested. The room was plenty big for us, although the little coffee table area felt somewhat squeezed in between the bed and the balcony. I believe the 1st and 2nd floors have a bigger floorplan, so they probably don't have that problem. I guess the decor can be viewed as outdated, but we found our room to be very clean, and designed with a simple, uncluttered aesthetic. The common hotel grounds are quite lovely with koi ponds and large well manicured grass areas to walk around in. Finally, the location of the Maui Prince deserves some comment. It is literally the last hotel on the southern part of Maui. The mega-resorts and shopping in Wailea are not even a 5 minute drive away, but once you're out by the Maui Prince, it's wonderfully peaceful, serene and quiet. There are no other hotels or condos in sight. Just nature, with the sound of the surf crashing in the background. If you want glitz, posh luxury, a hopping pool-scene, and night life, then Makena & Maui Prince is not for you. If you want a resort setting without any attitude (besides friendly), and if you like being \"outdoorsy\" (playing in the ocean, snorkeling, kayaking, golf) vs just lounging by a pool, then the Maui Prince is for you.

We liked them so well we also went on the 4th of July sunset cruise to Lahaina to watch the fireworks - cocktails and appetizers, but very family oriented. The pools are small, but with the beach, we didn't even go to them! There is a great mini-golf course with real grass and fairways. There is shuffleboard and volleyball - plenty to keep my active teenager happy. There are kayaks to rent on the beach too. Lots of people were doing that. We had one meal at the hotel which was average. There are lots of great restaurants in the Wailea/Kihei area and there is a shuttle from the hotel. Best of all, the hotel is peaceful....not a lot of noise and chaos...just what we wanted for our tropical vacation...don't miss this oasis in South Maui!", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Londonderry, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AllisonNNH", "ReviewID": "UR8054519", "Content": "My family was recently stranded in Wailea due to the wildfires near Lahaina.

It is the best kept secret on the Ilse of Maui. First off, the beach is fantastic: big, soft sand, good snorkling both to the right and left, and, most importantly, IT IS BASICALLY ONLY USED BY GUESTS OF THE MAUI PRINCE! That final point is the biggest point if you are looking to get away from crowds as part of your reason for going to Hawaii. Also, the resort is the closest to Molokini Crater (where we snorkeled with turtles, sharks and a variety of colorful fish). Next, there are a variety of restaurants on the property, so there is no need to drive into Wailea or Kihei for food. Yes, the food is pricey, probably right up there with the Four Seasons, Kea Lani, or Fairmont in terms of cost. It is good quality, however, and Hawaii in general is like eating in Manhattan, price-wise, let's be honest. As for the rooms, we had a suite at the far end of the hotel, not really an ocean view, but you still hear it all night, plus you get the bird songs (and, unfortunately, a punctual rooster). The hotel does need some love, i.e. bucks, in terms of exterior paint and interior decoration, both in the lobby and in the rooms. It is well kept, but no matter how clean you keep 20 year-old tile and furniture, it is still going to show wear and tear. Let me emphasize again, that it is CLEAN, but the owners do need to fork over the cash and do some basic updating. For example, the \"gym\" facility needs to be scrapped and a new out-building, perhaps near the croquet court, constructed of some 2000 feet to hold the current and new exercise equipment. The Prince sits at a real disadvantage to the \"Big Four\" (\"Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Fairmount, and the Marriott) in terms of appealling to more fitness conscious clietel (and, take note, Owner: those folks pay UP and a good portion of your current clientel is dying off). If they can't scrape up the $750,000-$1,000,000 for such facility, then they need to sell to someone else. That said, we would highly recommend this resort to those couples and families looking for a restful, interesting (on-site, pretty good luau, salt water swimming pools, etc.), and quiet vacation, this is the place. Our beef with the alternative Big Four is that its like being in Beverly Hills or the Upper East Side: lots of people, super pricey, very noisy, a lot of SEE AND BE SEEN (particularly at Spago at the Four Seasons), and a lot of people who go the Big Four just to tell their friends they went to the Big Four. We actually want to go someplace to go there, not impress others. We get enough fake boobs, spray on tan, swell fellas, snotty kids, etc. where we live, so we wanted something a little different.

Our first was two years ago on our honeymoon. We had such a great previous trip there, so we decided to return. 1) Location - it is the best. You don't get the bad traffic or cramped feel from staying in Kaanapali. It's close to everything you'd want - cheaper food in Kihei, five minutes from Big Beach in Makena and a 10 minute drive from La Perouse Bay in South Makena. 2) Snorkeling and the beach in front of the hotel - amazing. You don't have to fight to get a chair on the beach or covered seating in the pool area. There is great snorkeling right in front of the hotel. The beach is truly one of the best I've been on in Maui - and I've been to a lot of them all over the island. We did the Kai Kanani snorkel trip to Molokini directly from the hotel. Molokini wasn't that great but when we stopped on the way back for \"so-called turtle town\" - it was amazing! We swam with five turtles and had a great time. It was priced very well and we ddin't have to make the drive to Ma'alea. 3) peace and quiet at the hotel. We rarely heard our neighbors. The Lanai/balcony was great. 4) service was wonderful. The staff here are very warm and friendly, very hospitable. On our way in, we were in Room 210 on the second floor w/ partial oceanview. It was really \"partial\" on the oceanview, but it was a large room and bathroom. We were upgraded on the second night to Room 317 - but actually secretly wished to go back to Room 210. The reasons? I think the rooms get smaller as you go higher (you'll notice this on the outside of the buildings). Also, the bed was MUCH better in 210 than in 317. The one negative thing I have to say is that we just felt like our hotel room was DAMP the whole time. We just felt really soggy in our bedroom. All hotel rooms in the tropics are going to have a certain level of humidity (your books will get a little wrinkled) but this was very extreme. It was very odd. This was my tenth trip to Hawaii, and I haven't experienced this level of dampness before. -If you book at the Prince, in sum, I'd recommend you join the Prince Preferred membership for free and get a nice discount on room rates and golf. And don't be so quick to shy away from the first or second floor as it probably means bigger rooms. (I think all rooms will hear the luau, it's not so bad, eh?) The room we stayed in for the remaining six nights ont he 3rd floor was MUCH smaller than on the 2nd. We didn't bother to move beacuse we just plain didn't want to. I recommend this hotel if you can get it for about $230 or less. I really wouldn't pay more than that to stay here. The furniture is very outdated. I hear they just got a new owner and perhaps some other things will change soon. Room service is great but the extras they charge are pretty high. --In maui, I also recommend the Westin Kaanapali Villas although the beach is a lot less inviting.

This was our first trip to Hawaii. We stayed in an Oceanview Room with the Romance Package. Overall, the Maui Prince gives you exactly what you want out of Maui. The hotel is located way south on Maui, south of Kihei. It's a 20 minute trip from the airport, so it's not exactly a hike. This location really gives it value. The area is beautiful and natural. The only negative to the location is that you need to rent a car. Unavoidable based on where the Prince is. However, the Shops at Wailea and Kihei town are not far and will provide what you need. We chose the Romance Package. This is a great deal and perfect for a honeymoon. With it, you get free breakfast, replenished bottled water daily (why isn't this standard everywhere?), an oceanview room, free rental car (almost, you must pay tax), chocolate covered strawberries and champagne, and a $100 food credit. Not a bad deal for $420 a night, considering what you're getting. (Works out to -$60 for car, which you'll need, -$30 for breakfast, -$25/day for food credit, so it's really only $315/night). First, the room itself was nice, well-kept, but outdated. Everything about it screamed the 80s. Everything was in nice condition but the decor needs a revamp. I'd say no less than 5 years from now they should get cracking. Other than that, there was nothing to complain about. The balcony was gigantic and the view, even oceanview, was stunning and completely private. The room was large and spacious, way more than 2 people would need. The bathroom was large, with a doored off toilet, shower, and tub with shower. We stayed on the second floor, but we probably could have gotten a slightly better view a floor or two up. It was very nice leaving the balcony doors open while we slept. You heard nothing but the ocean. Quite a change from Waikiki! The hotel itself is unique - I don't think you'll see a design like this any time soon. It was mostly open air, with a large patio area with amazing landscaping and a giant pond full of Koi (after breakfast, spend a $1 and feed the koi! Well worth it). Again, the outdated look rears its head, but it's not something that will take away from your stay. Although we chose this hotel in part due to it having room service, we did not use it. We did try the Molokini Lounge which was good, and of course the breakfast buffet which was impressive. The sheer volume of options was quite nice as was the rotating menu options. We never ate at the hotel otherwise during our stay. We highly recommend doing an intro scuba dive. The instructors there are top notch (ask for Kris or Scuba Steve, lol) and the reef at the turtle cleaning station is amazing. Worth the cost for sure. You will see some amazing things. This is the only activity we took part in (having to pass on Haleakala), but the activity desk was more than helpful. The beach is not perfect but still untouched and beautiful. Our main problem with it isn't really related to the beach itself, but the windy conditions we found ourselves in. It may be the west Maui coast, or just weather related, but it got extremely windy each day we went to the beach. The ocean became too choppy to snorkel in on your own and you just got thrown around. We had to push our scuba to early the next day and miss Haleakala because the scuba would have been rough in the wind.

I then pulled the coverlet of the second be and there were tiny black specks and another but smaller, perhaps a baby bed bug.

When I asked if there had been previous complaints, the front desk person told us no and had the nerves to say that we probably let the bugs in when we opened the door. Uh, we just arrived, less than 10 minutes and the bugs were UNDER the coverlet. And advised us that they just recently had their pest control updated. Then come to find out, their rates only cover for 2 adults per room. There was three of us and advise us of a $60 per night room for the additional person. They finally agreed they would place some airline employees in a king room and give us the double room. I feel as if they are going to charge $350+ a night, they should have been more accommodating, especially since it is their fault. There was an excessive amount of cob webs and bugs stuck near the base of the headboard and between the bed and the nightstand that I was hardly able to get any sleep.

I live in New York City, I have traveled the world and stayed at dozens of hotels. and am pretty demanding and a pain in the [---] at times with the details, I expect the best from myself and others.. so I really want you to know the background of our unreal and amazing experience at the prince. Currently we are in the grand Hyatt in kauai, a 5 star hotel with everything and all the whistles...and it is good here.. but my heart longs for the Maui Prince. Let me tell you why... My wife and I got married in Maui last week, and wanted a place for everyone to stay that was not too expensive or too lux, like the other Walea resorts, BUT not too shabby either. We visited Maui in August and i think we were expecting a Hawaii of the past like when I last visited in 1997.. but alas Maui was more crowed then I thought and it took some getting used to. The Mui Prince however WAS chill and relaxed...once past most of the other hotels we were the only car there... I guess because i was expecting perfection and empty sand beaches .. it took me a while to get the feel of the island.. we stayed at the prince in august when we were scouting the island for our wedding.. they upgraded our room to an ocean prime and we had a good time.. we visited the fairmont and all the other resorts and were jealous ( for some stupid reason) .. gold and marble and amazing pools and services.. or so we thought.. no one would show us any rooms and the service was stuffy. but the prince was 300 a night for ocean views and the others 600 for mountain and parking lot views .. so you may ask.. if the prince was just ok and at first you were not wowed why did you go back? well when we went back home, we just said.. let's go for it.. i told people the pool was not the best and the rooms were not \" perfect ( slightly faded pictures as the sun shines bright in every room).. we were looking forward to coming back to maui but honestly a little hesitant to stay at the prince... i mistook the chilled attitude there for lack of concern but actually it is concern .. they just give you a touch more privacy and are not always saying a somewhat fake Aloha every 5 seconds like were we are now at the \" grand\" hyatt. Fast forward / rewind to last week, and let me just say the amazing things we found about the Prince the second time around. Makena.. the area around the prince is amazing.. it is at the end of the road, and our 36 guests loved it.. hikes on almost empty beaches.. whales breaching off shore.. sea turtles every day off the beach.. the snorkle sail boats leaving directly from beach.. everything! just a quiet simple understated clean and luxury stay. If you are looking for a 5 star resort with all the bells and whistles the prince was not that.. but the kind service and friendlyness of the valets to the amazing secluded property.. it just worked.. we had the ping pong and volleyball all to ourselves outside and the beach was so amazing that people from other hotels came to our beach! We stayed for 6 nights and they upgraded us to an ocean front suite as a thank you... Cindi Rosetti was a pleasure to deal with in the Reservations department at the hotel. To give you an idea of how kind and thoughtful they are there.. RON.. my dear Ron.. he was the nicest person i may have ever met. My wife left her wedding dress in our room my mistake.. uh oh! and Ron packed it up and ups'd it the next day to us in NYC.. above and beyond that Ron also returned my father in law's tux to a shop near the airport as we had an early flight and the store was not open.. really what service and what a guy! beyond that everyone was nice.. not this stuffy.. hello mr -------, but a real hello in the morning and even asking me if i was relaxed and ok with my wedding coming up. So I am here to always talk about the Prince and what they did for us.. how kind they were and how above and beyond they went. I am leaving so much out.. but from the quietness of Makena, but still being close to everything, to the on the beach feel and the sound of the waves all night long, to the birds in the courtyard all coming home to sleep at night.. I will never forget.. The hotel was just bought out and i hope so much they just make small changes.. maybe redo some bathrooms... update some stuff here and there.. but the feel of this resort should not be changed.. it is sort of this modern ( 1970's ) japanese hawaiian feel...you don't need a bigger pool as the ocean 20 yards away was one of the best in my life.. the breakfast buffet is great ... they even have japanese breakfast that my wife ( she is japanese) loved. and there is also wonderful food in the prince court. some last things .. the rooms on the lower floors are bigger and the non ocean front rooms were also bigger too! sort of the reverse of what i thought.. try to get a room ( about half) that the door overlooks the courtyard.. that way an amazing breeze comes through ...and you here the birds more ?( a good and bad thing!) the property is amazing.. if you want a lux resort this is not for you.. but if you are young at heart and enjoy a resort fitting into the surroundings and blending in with nature.. it is AWESOME I applaud the Prince for being the highlight of our wedding ( we got married up country and had a lovely time in Maui) and it really deserves my full praise.

Our room was an oceanfront and I believe it was room 333 and had a lanai. One negative about the room was the bathroom and the shower head looked real cheap. The air condition did work good so that helps since it was so very humid. We did have breakfast at their buffet which was acceptable at Cafe Kiowai. The cafe at the pool was good too. The pool is nothing great at all so just go to the beach. There is a bar that stays open to like 10pm or 11pm so you can unwind. I feel there were more positives than negatives staying here. Would I stay again probably not only because I'm active person and work out a lot so I eat 4 or 5 times a day and it gets expensive not having a kitchen around. The little fitness room was sufficient to get the basics done. It's relatively new equipment not some 70's nautilus multi-station. Good cardio equipment and towels and water supplied there. Few tips for people getting married there not using Maui Prince grounds. Have someone reserve a spot in the morning by bathrooms at the Makena beach since it's open to the public and is first come first serve. It gets really really hot and you will be sweating so dress light. I was fortunate to save a spot that we wanted since there was 2 other weddings going on at the same time. Wheeew.

Because of the earthquake, our annual destination hotel closed. We thought this would be a good time to try another island. We also thought that we would be safe trying the Mauna Kea's sister hotel, The Maui Prince. We had a fabulous trip but I thought a few comments might help others. First of all, the hotel is very clean and peacefully located far enough away from the commercial centers to enjoy the peace of Hawaii. However, it is still close enough to get to other restaurants and shopping. Other reviewers have mentioned that the hotel is run-down. This is true. It is quiet and clean but the price per room was close to the internet price at the Four Seasons a few doors down. We dined at The Four Seasons and we all agreed we wished we had reserved our rooms at this beautiful property. The staff at the Maui Prince, with a few exceptions, seemed angry. At lunch by the pool one day, one of the ladies in my party asked for Swiss cheese instead of Pepper Jack Cheese on a sandwich. The waitress sighed angrily. I laughed and said \"I guess this isn't Burger King\". She snapped, \"It just makes it hard on the cook.\" I know this seems minor but the pervasive attitude was as if we were the unwelcome and uninvited relatives disrupting everyone's schedules. At least we were able to laugh consistently and have a good time. We heard that this hotel was just bought out by another group so possibly there are job security questions floating around. Who knows? It is a far cry from the rich tradition of the Mauna Kea where the employees appeared to own the place reflected in their pride of service. Also to note, the Maui Prince is set away from the beach so enjoying the beach is an effort. Don't pick the bfast buffet package unless it makes extreme financial sense. Actually the package ended up costing a little bit more based on menu prices rather than buying your own bfast. The food quality at this hotel is excellent, the property is clean, and the location is good nonetheless we will not return to the Maui Prince because there are nicer properties in the same price range and sure to be staffs with more pleasant attitudes.

There is a Maui Prince somewhere that has poor service, surly staff, slummy bathrooms and is over-priced and over-rated, but the Maui Prince in my universe is really rather good. I have stayed there on 5 occasions in 5 years, and while I have noticed a degradation in the room decor etc, the overall ambience remains good, and the service and attention from the staff if anything has improved. On my 1st morning, I went to the Cappochino Corner cafe to buy supplies for my breakfast on the lanai, and Evelyn who was serving immediately said Welcome back!. It had been 12 months (to the day) since I had last been at the Prince, and there must have been 1,000's of customers through the cafe since then. Perhaps as a Brit I stand out a bit, but I don't have 2 heads or wear a crown or anything, and she still remembered me. That's good. The room was look inga bit faded, the furniture a bit scratched. Bed comfortable, no scratchy sheets, and the maid kept the room Impeccable. I did not resort to hiding bits of dirt on the floor to see if they had been cleaned (as I've read others do). The luau on the lawn is pretty appalling it has to be said. I heard from my room the same jokes as last year, and I would certainly recommend anybody to give this a total miss. Eating in the hotel is expensive, but they'll run in the shuttle down to Wailea where there are good places to eat. A car is really essential though. Despite the hotel being full, the beach and pool-deck were invariably almost empty. Imagine that in Europe, where if you have not reserved your sunbed by dumping a towel on it by 30 mins after sunrise then you'll never get one! There had been a big storm the week before, and half the beach had been lost to the ocean (along with beach cabanas and chairs), so the beach was narrower and steeper than before. But it is beautiful, and the wonderful big beach and even-more wonderful little beach are 10 mins away in the car. Negatives: . rooms are a bit run-down, but still comfortable and Clean . eating is expensive . noise does travel - remember Meg Ryan in the deli scene from When Harry Met Sally? --- well I heard pretty convincing Meg Ryan impersonations on 3 out of my last 4 mornings (starting about 0630) through the open lanai doors, and from the room below. Positives: . staff . views from lanai . gardens . the sun going down behind Molokini . quiet pool area/beach . always seemed to be staff cleaning and sweeping While I was staying, it was announced that the property had been sold for $575M. I expect big changes to occur (the now-needed refurbishment), but perhaps an upping of the room-rate to match.

Our favorite part was when we went towards the end of the island, found a nearly hidden trail and hiked out over lava to a private snorkeling spot. I believe it's called the \"Aquarium\" in Maui Revealed. We were the only two people there and it was the most incredible snorkeling. Take your water shoes for climbing in and out over the lava fields, but be prepared to feel like your snorkeling in your own private aquarium.

Spent first week in January in Kauai renting a condo in Princeville. Incredibly beautiful place but some bad luck weather days made rainly moments and doing things challenging to say the least. By the time I got to Maui for second week was craving sun and hotel amenities. Friend recommended the Maui Prince as she and her family were renting a condo at the Makena Surf and we wanted to be near each other. She did say it was a throw back to the 70's but cool. All hotel photos and reviews talked to that as well. Best review however was the person who said, ask what you want from a hotel - glitz or taste. This hotel and its grounds are quite beautiful and grand and in its heyday was probably nicer than some of the pricey joints in Wailea ie. Four Seasons, Fairmont, Grand Wailea. I booked directly with the Prince and got a great rate of $259USD per night. The others were at least $400+. For the time we spent in the room I couldn't really justify spending that kind of money. Also eating in Maui isn't the cheapest either. Unless you know of and seek the local joints its pretty much food courts or expensive places. Did find a great pizza place in Wailea across from Shops at Wailea - order at the counter etc. And don't miss Mama's Fish House in Pa'ia (45min from Maui Prince). Go for lunch as it's right on the beach - what a view. What an incredible meal - best fish I have ever had. And service was excellent. Tab for 2 was $200 but worth every penny. Service was great. People friendly. Room wasn't made up till about 3/4pm each day but oh well could work around that. Rooms were a good size. Furnishings bit 5-0 but think of it as 'retro digs'. Few ants in the bathroom but room plenty big for everyone. Got upgraded to an ocean view and could see whales from the balcony in the mornings. Restaurants were a bit pricey but Mai Tai's at the Molokini lounge fun and a great first night thing to do. Had lunch at the Four Seasons once - which then makes the Prince eats seem good value. Friend used the spa services which are Aveda and enjoyed it. Pool area is very nice. Lots of loungers and some cabanas. There are 2 salt water pools small and smaller but with the beach right there and max 1-2 people in the pool at a time it was fine. Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Prince.

My second visit to Hawaii, but my family & husband's first time. The Maui Prince is located at the very southern tip of the island and is the last hotel on this side of the island. The grounds are beautiful, and are great to just stroll around on during the day or night. The beach is pretty secluded since you're at the end of the island, and is really clean, but the water can get pretty rough at the end of the day. It's also right outside your door, which is great. The pool left something to be desired and is the major downfall of the Maui Prince. It's pretty small and was really cold. There were plans for 2 additional pools, but City ordinances on how close pools could be to the ocean took that out of the plan. The rooms were nice, but nothing spectacular or over the top. It's a great value for Maui, and you don't spend much time in the room itself, so no big deal. We also ate in the upscale restaurant @ the Maui Prince and everyone really enjoyed themselves. But, know that pretty much everything closes by about 10pm in Maui, so dinner reservations aren't usually taken after 9pm. We're from Chicago, so that's a bit strange to us - it was nice to actually HAVE to relax and get a good night's sleep though! As for other activities, we snorkeled with the \"4 Winds\" ship and went to Molokini & Turtle Town. It is a popular place to go for boats & tourists, but everyone had fun (about $70 per person). My brothers went deep sea fishing, and after waiting an hour for the boat captain, they headed out...and didn't catch anything ($150 per person) for 7 hours. We also did the Road to Hana - I've done this twice now and can recommend a couple of things: rent a Jeep, go early (leave your hotel around 6-7am), and get the tape offered at the gas station on your way ($10 and really helpful). One of the best parts of our trip was biking down Haleakala and ending at the Maui Winery. Aloha Bicycle Tours (---) was recommended to us - and well worth it. Not as easy as they make it sound, but a really great experience for all of us. Mention their website and it's $99, otherwise it's $120 per person. The owners, Marc & Karen, were fantastic.

What a wonderful experience! We came in from Miami, Florida after a one night lay over in Las Vegas, this allowed us some relief from the usual jet lag affecting those of us from the East Coast. Upon arrival we picked up a Jeep Wrangler at the rental station right in the airport. Using the maps provided by the rental company we easily found our way to the Hotel (about a 30 minute drive). Upon arrival at the hotel I mentioned to the clerk that we had been planning this trip for 32 years, and were finally there, so we would really appreciate a room with a nice view. She was very accomodating and changed our room from the 2nd to the 5th floor. We had a perfect view of the mountain, the golf course and the ocean, including a distant view of the island of Molokoi right from our balcony! The Hotel is very well kept, and the staff is quite friendly and accomodating. Unfortunately, the restaurants are very expensive, but the food is delicious. After our first night's dinner - a $175 experience - and next morning's buffett breakfast - $80 for 2 - we decided to seek alternative restaurants in Kihei, only a 10 minute drive away. We stopped at the local Supermarket and purchased breakfast foods, snacks, bottled water, beer and soda, which we kept in the room's refrigerator. The Hotel Luau at $80 per person was very nice. We attended the regular Luau and were treated to a nice show, typical food buffett, and quite an entertaining show. The hotel also hosts a huge Luau twice a week for Cruise passengers on the grounds, which turned out to be right outside our balcony, so we got to see the show again for free! We took long drives around the Island of Maui. Our first day we took a drive to the West side of the Island towards Lahaina, and just kept goint around the coast all the way around the North side ending up back at the Airport. What a great drive! My husband and I enjoyed this drive even more than the much touted Drive to Hanna - (that is not to say that going to Hanna and the required stop to the Black sand beach - is not a wonderful trip also) but the drive up the North Coast through very winding narrow roads is worth every heart stopping turn!

The room service was very good, and the menu extensive- we found the best room service cheeseburger on the island! Of course we ordered the sashimi too! And in the morning the buffet breakfast was great. We didn't get a chance to eat at either of the acclaimed restaurants that The Prince boasts, because we didn't call for a reservation early enough. So be sure to not wait to make your reservations. The hotel is a bit older, so the furniture & fixtures are getting a bit dated, but everything was in fine working order & overall the hotel was very clean & in great shape. The service was fabulous as well- everyone had true Aloha Spirit. The hotel is in a great private location & has it's own uncrowded beaches, as well as activity counters, covered beach loungers & one of the best snorkling spots on the South Side of Maui.

Notwithstanding the price, we found the property as a whole to continue to be very dated and desperately in need of a face lift.

The funny part is that my in-laws stayed at the Prince 20 years ago for their honeymoon (second for each) and constantly rave about how wonderful the hotel was. The reality is that absolutely nothing has changed since their stay, for better and for worse.

This was part of a three week tour that my husband and I were on to celebrate his 50th birthday (this was not acknowledged by the hotel despite them being aware of this). We had just left The Omni Hotel in San Francisco, which was outstanding ,and had booked seven nights at the Maui Prince. First impressions were positive, the reception area and the grounds were impressive. Unfortunately the room and in particular the bathroom area was slightly disappointing. Despite this if I am honest my husband and I settled in quickly and we began to appreciate what the hotel had to offer. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, the grounds are magnificent, the beach was first class and the restaurants good value. The household staff cleaned the rooms every day to a high standard and all the toiletries were renewed as was the complimentary coffee and water. There is a fridge and a separate area within the room for you to prepare food if you choose to do so. If you are staying at this hotel you do require a car as it is too far from the nearest resort. We survived the road to Hana which is an experience in itself. We left our hotel at 7.00am and arrived in Hana at 09.30am. The journey is spectacular however Hana is very disappointing - there is nothing there apart from a few houses, some art galleries and a hotel. There are no places to eat so have breakfast or lunch before you go. Would we go back to the Maui Prince? At this stage I don't think so but that does not mean that we did not enjoy our stay or appreciate the hotels finer points of which there are many. If you want a relaxing quiet holiday then this is the place for you.If the hotel is modernised then I would not hesitate to return.

We thought the hotel was great. We arrived at night and were greeted immediately by the very friendly staff. As a matter of fact, the staff was always great! Our bags were brought up immediately as well. Our room was # 527, great room. Overlooking the beach, but private enough. The room was good, no complaints. The bathroom was spacious and in good condition. The grounds are beautiful, full of greenery and flowers. Very well maintained. The beach is pretty and roomy enough not to feel crowded. The hotel is the last hotel on the stretch of road. It is a drive to get to restaurants and such, but in Maui, riding around with the top down is what you want to do. See the island, if you don't rent a car and drive around the island you are definately missing out. At night there is not much to see, but the weather is always pleasant. We ventured out to find restaurants. We drove to the West side one day, which was fun with the winding roads. We drove all of the way around the west side which went through little villages like up in the mountains. There is a gallery in the middle of nowhere that you MUST stop and visit. We did Mt. Haleakala one day, and tried to drive to Hana one day. However our drive to Hana was cut short, b/c we did not want to be late for the luau. Do the Luau!!!!!!! It is a treat, I thought. I was a 1st timer to the islands and had a great time. Book your tickets for the luau right when you get there, b/c they do get full. That is the luau that you want to see. And get there early though, the later you are the further back you will be seated. Great Luau!!! We booked ours with someone at the hotel, but went to the luau at another hotel, the Prince luau had been cancelled due to weather. I would suggest booking through the hotel, the guy knew what he was talking about. Everything he said was exactly how it was. And you won't be risking having to go to a time share seminar that other places entice you to do. We had 1 breakfast buffet at the hotel, we sat outside, it was nice, but expensive for breakfast. The Prince was great for our stay. And for the price it was great. If you are going to Maui to stay in the hotel, stay somewhere like the Four Seasons.

Believe me, a consultation with the manager and head of security can put a dampner on your trip. (But that's another story.) Our room was comfortable and clean but not luxurious so if marble baths are important to you, find another place. We liked the private lanai with a view. This property is up for sale so hopefully the new owners will make some refurbishing choices in the rooms and bathrooms. Food here was pricey but good. There are plenty of other good restaurants in nearby Wailea or 10 minutes away in Kihei for the more budget-minded. Check out the panoramic view from the golf clubhouse and sit on the beach at night with a canopy of stars overhead and the sound of the surf. Romantic! Maybe you'll see a shooting star like we did. The luaus were constant throughout the visit but they wind up early. If you just want to watch the show walk up the pool path and stand in back to see the Samoan fire dancers. ( Entertainment in the hotel lounge was sedate & not our style.) People seemed to be enjoying the beach and pool, but if this beach isn't enough, gorgeous Big Beach is just down the road. BTW our Entertainment card was accepted w/o question in the Prince Court and Hakone restaurants. If you have a need to see and be seen or are high energy, this place may not be for you. But if you, like us, like a hotel with a Hawaiian feel right on the beach with a relaxing environment, it's wonderful.

We had just come to the island from a very peaceful resort with no TV's or phones which was wonderful, but it was great to have the more typical resort amenities at the Maui Prince. The hotel has a wonderful lobby and open-air feeling in the courtyard, and the beaches in Wailea are the best. Though the resort is right next to the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea, you can't really access the other resorts from the beach. All are essentially private. We were attracted to the Maui Prince by the reviews, the amenities, and also by the romance package. We got a great rate, including a convertible, a $100 food voucher to be used at one of the hotel restaurants, and champagne & chocolates delivered by room service. We were upgraded from an Ocean View room to a Prime Ocean View room at check-in. I'm not sure of the difference, but the views were admittedly incredible...and also very private. Noone around or even below could see into your room from the outside. The Maui Prince is also right next to a small island, Molokini, which is Maui's best for snorkelers. There is a great 35-person snorkeling trip that leaves from the Maui Prince (very convenient) which takes you to Molokini on a sailboat, includes breakfast, lunch, then unlimited beer/mai-tais. They make an extra stop so you can swim with the big turtles that swim just off the beach. A great trip and a good deal. Much better than the 200-person cattledriver ships that also go to the same spot. It is very nice to have a car on Maui. The pool is nice, but not incredible - I may have gotten restless if I didn't have a car after a couple days. We took an evening drive to Lahaina (great spot on the western coast), then took a day on the road to Hana. Do this drive, but don't do the full circle on the dirt road at the end - it's not worth it and is actually longer than circling back, like you're \"supposed to\".

Do NOT stay here if you want to relax on your lanai without listening to this lounge singer for 3 hours!! Since we had $100 credit as part of the \"Romance Package\", we planned to have a nice dinner on Saturday night at the restaurant with an ocean view, and we looked forward to watching the sunset as we ate dinner. However, we were rudely told that the large section of the restaurant with the only good views of the ocean was closed for dinner on Sat. night because it was reserved for the Sunday brunch. Are you joking??!! That was what we thought a lot of the time, when staff were constantly telling us \"no\" to normal requests. I was even told that they didn't have bread at the restaurant pool to have with my salad. This hotel is far from anything, so not only are you in a crappy hotel, but you are far from anything decent.

After staying at the Hapuna Beach Prince hotel on the Big Island, we had high expectations of the Maui Prince Hotel. However, our expectations were not met. When we checked in at the front desk, we asked about a room upgrade since we were on our honeymoon, and we were told that the hotel normally does complimentary upgrades but they did not have anything available since the hotel was booked. That was fine with us, so we went to our room. We got off the elevator and there was our room, right in front of the elevator. Not a good location at all. We opened the door and found our roomm in really bad condition. It was equivalent to a run-down Jersey shore motel, except 3 times the price. Our lanai was extremely dirty (see picture), the carpet was ripped in spots, shower was not clean, and the decor was extremely outdated. The showerhead was like nothing I have ever seen. Our view, which was partial oceanview, was mostly of the roof of some building. Now, we do not complain about things, it has to be VERY bad for my husband or I to speak up and complain about something, and this was bad enough for us to go down to the front desk and let them know how unhappy we were. We could not stay in a room like that for the next 7 nights of our honeymoon. We were told that they might have an oceanfront view room available, that the people who were possibly going to stay in it hadn't called back yet, so that we might be able to stay in that room for an extra $80 a night. They said we could check out that room. So, we went down, got the key, and headed up to that room. It was the same type of room, dirty and outdated, the only difference was a gorgeous view off of the lanai. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really concerned about the view, so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend $80 more a night for this! We went back down to the front desk, and I asked about the complimentary upgrade we were at first told we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get. Now that this room was available, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this be a free upgrade. We were given some -- story about how since they were booked up it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be given to us for free. So basically we were lied too, told one thing, then another. I just became angrier and angrier. I asked to speak to the manager, I needed some answers. An assistant manager came out to talk to us. She offered us the oceanview room at $60 more a night. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want that. We already paid so much to stay here, and the oceanview room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in any better condition. I felt trapped, and I could feel the tears coming. We were also told before by the man at the desk that if we wanted to leave and cancel our room that they need 72 hours advanced notice or we get charged for the rooms. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 nights, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste 3 nights there! I asked the manager about this and she said she would waive that policy for us if we found somewhere else to stay, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want us to be trapped on our honeymoon somewhere we were unhappy. So, we went back up to our room and started calling around to other resorts to see if we could be accommodated. My husband was set that he wanted the Four Seasons, and he called and they did have rooms available, just not for the current night, but for the rest of our 6 nights. We got prices, and it would be about $80 more a night for a mountainview room there. So, we booked it. We told the hotel we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay the night and cancelled our other nights. We walked around to check out the rest of the Maui Prince. The nicest part of the hotel was their courtyard in the center. It is a garden like setting, with a very nice waterfall and gorgeous koi pond. We checked out the pool, unimpressive. We went down to their beach, nice beach, but beat up beach chairs and umbrellas. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a shame!

While this may be slightly true, the rooms aren't nearly as bad as some guests seem to make it. The room was exceptionally clean and the dual sliding doors to the lanai are wonderful for letting that tropical breeze flow in. I can't understand why some people seem to dislike the hotel in any way. The service here was exceptional.

There were plenty of chairs and towels were provided for guests. There was also a bar that served lunches in the afternoons. On several occassions we were sharing snorkeling stories with people on the beach who drove over from the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and the Fairmont.

Probably gained a few pounds because it was all so good. 4) Fun ... we enjoyed a day snorkeling with reservations in house and departure right there from the beach at the hotel.

The bathrooms are big offering a shower and a tub and the toilet is separate and has a door to close it off to the rest of the bathroom. Nice size refrigerator as we stayed elsewhere in maui where you could not fit anything into those fridges. I have never had a problem with the check-in although we never arrive before 300PM because they do tell you check in time is 300PM and not just the prince, but every hotel. The hotel business is complex and it's not that they are trying to scam you, but there are procedures and way of assigning rooms and the maids can only clean so fast with all those rooms. I think the hotel is great and the price is good. The pool tiles were being fixed when we were there so they have taken care of that. The luau was going on when we were there too and it was fun to watch. It doesn't go til late and it depends which room you have whether you can really see and hear it. Most people are usually out and about and don't get back til after it's done anyway. sometimes you have to revert to the term you get what you pay for and at the prince I think you get what you pay for and then some. If you want to pay double the price to stay at resorts in that same area then go for it. I don't think people should expect to get a room on the four seasons level for the price they are paying which really isn't much compared to other hotels in the area. The remote controls in our rooms which we have had a total of 3 different rooms so far were never attached to the tv. There is a game controller attached to the tv stand, but the remote was not. The restaurant we ate at was the breakfast buffet at cafe kiowai and we liked it every time. They do allow children 5 and under to eat free. My son is 4 and thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast. I don't think that 20.00 is asking to much to pay for an all you can eat buffet stocked with meats, eggs, fruits, salad, rice, pastries, cereal, yogurt , omlet station, waffles, and even more. If we had to pay for him to eat we would have done so as he enjoys eating there. If the menu states a price for cold breakfast and a price for hot breakfast then you pay for what you take.

The pool area was small, but it was usually almost empty (the hotel was 100% full my first weekend, but nobody was around the pool). The beach was never crowded.

I have read adverse comments about the bathrooms --- seemed fine to me, I've suffered many much worse. I've read some complaints about the sheets --- mine were soft and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room furniture was fine, and the lighting tastefully done (but a dim light on the lanai would have been a nice touch) This year there were finally electronic key-cards -- on my previous visits we had to lug around a great big brass key. Nice touches - the big blue beach towels, the bathrobes, bottles of water replenished each day, a little box of chocolates on my bed on the last night, more towels than I knew what to do with in the bathroom. Although I was on the side overlooking the lawn where the rather cheesy \"luau\" is performed, the view over to the Pu'uola'i cinder cone is magnificent, and in any case the \"luau\" was generally over by 2030. I did not eat in the restaurents --- highly overpriced, but made my own breakfast brought from Wailea (and the lobby coffee shop), and enjoyed it on the lanai each morning. The coffee shop staff knew my usual order, and always called me my name. This is a 500 room hotel, but the staff give a personal service. The remoteness of the site is one of its appeals, if it is bright lights and clubs then go to Kihei (or don't come to Maui!) You need a car to get around, but one of the major highlights of my trip was a glass of wine on the lanai last thing at night, followed by a walk along the beach under the stars. Magical. I went to sleep each night with the lanai doors fully open, with the crash of the surf on the beach. Downsides ? Only a few. (1) There was a cockerell somewhere in the grounds that gave me an unwelcome early morning wake-up call (about 0400) each day. I would have to shut the doors to drown out the noise, and spend the next 20 minutes plotting the demise of that cockerell until sleep returned! (2) On my previous visits, the hotel had very nice Prince Hotels scented soaps and shampoos. This year it was standard packaged \"Neutrogena\" stuff which reminds me of chain budget hotels. (3) My room was close right next to one of the lift lobbies, and there was a rather loud and irritating \"boing boing\" everytime the lift (sorry, that's a British term, I mean the elevator) arrived at my floor. (4) And my last two evenings on the lanai with some wine and listening to the Pacific waves were spoiled by the people in the room above with their TV on far too loud.

The other main reason we loved the Prince was the proximity to the beach. While the other large resorts were set back 100 yards from the beach or more, the Prince is right there. We laughed with other guests about our experience of sleeping with the sliding doors wide open to the sound of crashing waves. Lovely. The biggest downside is probably that the rooms themselves fall somewhere between 3-star and 4-star. If a super luxury room is what you want, you might be dissapointed with the Prince. We cared less about that than the proximity to the beach. Also, the hotel was apparently nearly at capacity when we were there, but it sure felt like there weren't that many people around. There are several very nice restaurants at the Prince. As with all eating out on Maui, it is pricey! It wasn't a problem for us, but there is a louao (bad spelling, sorry) 3 or 4 nights per week. There is one side of the Prince that faces the event--the drums might bother you. However, avoid this problem by reserving a room away from that side of the hotel. The Prince is about a 5 minute drive past all of the other resorts toward the lava field. This results in the wonderful seclusion of the hotel. There is an amazing koi pond and the grounds are wonderfully maintained. If you want to go to the other resorts, the Prince offers complimentary transportation to any of the resorts on Wailea. What else...one of the snorkel services to Molokini leaves right off the Prince beach. The lava fields are about a 15 minute drive away--they will eat your shoes up, so be careful! We rented from Snorkel Bob's--found the equipment to be good at a good prince. We found what we think is the best snorkeling on the island (according to some locals). If you head about 10 minutes from the Prince toward the lava fields, the little road goes around a cove with houses. I think it's called the fishbowl or something like that (the aquarium?). It looks like NOTHING from the road. But when you wade in, you are greeted by hundreds of fish! We preferred this spot to Molokini. If we return to Maui, we will probably return to the Prince. The rooms are a little older and less luxurious than the other 5 star resorts on Wailea. But the seclusion and hearing the waves from your room and the turtles on the beach daily left us feeling completely satisfied with our choice.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cA Prince It Is\u201d", "Author": "RebelMuse", "ReviewID": "UR4366531", "Content": "Went to Maui for my wedding and honeymoon.

We only stayed here one night. We were previously at the nearby Marriott for 8 days and were able to extend our trip by one night, so we went through Priceline again. When \"Maui Prince\" came up on Priceline, I cried tears of both laughter and horror because we'd been to the Prince a few days prior for brunch and wondered why--at similar prices to other, nicer resorts--anyone would stay there. The old brown room doors face the lobby and look like a prison. No windows on that side. Although it's open air, the property still manages to be stinky and as another reviewer wrote, smell of mildew. We walked into our nonsmoking room which smelled of years of smoking through a rickety, banged up wooden door. The bedspread looked like a small animal got a hold of it and gnawed for a few hours. The bed was very uncomfortable, and the room was spacious in a creepy way. The TV remote is connected to the tv, so a wire dangles in front of it while viewing. No, I don't go to a resort to watch a tv, but something so outmoded should not be in a room that's over $39.99/night. We were in the room about 20 min. when someone walked in, unanounced/no knocking, and shouted \"ALOHAAAAA\" and offered us snacks. Very random and strange, I found it amusing but would not have had I been asleep or undressed! The bathroom was unreal. It cracked me up...yellowed plastic shower curtain hooks, crazy, dated pseudo-tropical decor, and it even had one of those old Clairol make-up mirrors, where you switch the \"lighting\" to office, night, etc. Drumroll... it was BROKEN, so basically there was just a clunky piece of discolored plastic taking up counter space. The toilet is literally in a closet attached to the bathroom. The bathroom sink made a very loud howling noise everytime we turned it on for 2-3 minutes. The restaurants are not attractive. We ate at Prince Court, which was below average food and very pricey. No cheaper than Grand Wailea, which is nuts when you're sitting on old vinyl and an atmosphere barely above IHOP. The pool bar is a tiny hut and very limited. Again, no cheaper than any other resorts. The pool is round and small with extremely limited poolside service. The pool towels I got for the beach smelled smoky. One plus--the beach is really wonderful! Very close to the property and peaceful. While lying on the beach, I was thinking that Prince really should market itself as a lower-priced option and charge less, or do some serious renovation, but with the amount of money it would take to bring it even close to modern, I can't imagine the rates could still compete with other properties. Please note: I am someone who is not particularly uptight and I love kitsch. I thought I might actually be amused to make it through one night. Nope. I left feeling exhausted and dirty.

Our room (#249) featured all the telltale signs of a hotel awaiting remodel: unsightly scuff marks on the walls, chipped and scratched closet doors, discolored bathroom tile, etc. Staff keeps the facilities clean enough, but the problems that exist are beyond the scope of chambermaids. (Although one note about those maids: At the beginning of our stay, I spied a dead insect under the desk while plugging in my Blackberry adapter. When I unplugged the adapter six days later, the bug was still there. I suppose at that point I could have disposed of the thing, but I wasn't in the most charitable mood by then.) 2) Restaurant prices are sky-high all over Maui, but the Prince deserves a special booby prize for its daily breakfast buffet. My wife and I, with our six-year-old daughter in tow, made the mistake of eating there several times (I know, we were asking for trouble, but it's a 10-minute drive to any resort in Wailea, which isn't necessarily what we felt like doing at 8 in the morning). The total charge was $60, which seemed awfully high considering a spread that was OK but certainly not spectacular by resort standards. But what really steamed me was the dual pricing scheme for \"hot\" and \"cold\" breakfasts, especially for kids. Our daughter picked at some cereal and fruit, which kept her on the \"cold\" side priced at $8. But when she sipped a bit of miso soup, the price suddenly climbed to $12 -- for the \"hot\" breakfast. I complained first to the waiter and then to Scott, the assistant manager, who listened sympathetically, said my feedback was important -- and then did absolutely nothing except invite me to join the Prince's loyalty program. Memo to management: If I'm going to pay you $23 per adult for a mediocre buffet, do you mind if my kid eats for free? Or would you prefer that families go somewhere else? (NB: Hapuna Beach Prince, the Maui Prince's sister property on the Big Island, has a superior buffet -- that's included in the room price!) 3) Service is uneven throughout the hotel. One day, we searched in vain for someone, anyone, to offer service by the pool. The towel kiosk was vacant. To order drinks, my wife had to retrieve a waitress from the restaurant inside the hotel (\"We're understaffed,\" the hostess complained.) Scott, the assistant manager, promises that the hotel recently hired a new food & beverage manager who will help prevent such miscues. But this person will have his hands full: during our second dinner at the Prince Court, the hotel's signature fine-dining restaurant, we alerted our server, as the appetizers were arriving, that we still had no napkins. She looked at our laps and said: \"Oh, that's not good, is it?\" No, at these prices, it sure isn't. 4) One seemingly minor point that actually seriously hampers enjoyment of the resort: The property is very poorly illuminated. Apparently to save money, management has installed only path lights on the cobblestone walk tracing the perimeter of the resort. The tall palms on the property cry out for low-angle floods but remain shrouded in darkness. As a result, at night the grounds seem uninviting and even a little scary. Most folks wouldn't feel safe walking around alone outside the main building or parking lot -- it's just too dark. Assistant manager Scott offered two reasons for the lack of light: 1) Maui has codes restricting bright lights (someone should tell that to the Grand Wailea, which is lit up like a Christmas tree) and 2) the hotel needs to upgrade its electrical service. Whatever the case, the hotel needs to lighten up. Don't get me wrong: The Maui Prince has many virtues, including a prime beach location, proximity to many activities, and relatively reasonable room rates. Once we got outside our room and enjoyed what the island had to offer, we had a blast. But the resort itself was a major disappointment -- and unless management gets on the ball, we won't go back.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect place for our 35th anniversary\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4307382", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights at the Maui Prince to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and it was the perfect choice.

The best snorkeling on this part of the island is right off of this beach, some turtles and as many fish as any guided trip, a lot of tour boats anchor off of this beach for their trips. We did take a kayak tour which left just 2 blocks from the hotel at Makena landing. I would recommend this over a boat tour any time, less people more activity and saw plenty of sea turtles. We did not eat breakfast or dinner at the hotel but did have lunch by the pool a couple of times, good burgers, big enough for us to split, usually grabbed a burrito or pastry from the snack bar for breakfast on the way out for daily activities. The breakfast buffet for $24.00 per person seemed overpriced for bacon and eggs. The dinner menu is pricy also but no more so than any upscale restaurant on the island.

Both of us loved this resort. The positives: The beach is absolutely FANTASTIC. The snorkeling is as good as anywhere I have snorkeled off a beach in Hawaii. A resident family of sea turtles, lots of gorgeous fish and volcanic rock outcrops (to the left side) are all present. We actually saw snorkel companies docking out to the left side of the beach to bring people in to snorkel. I suggest getting out early before the mid-day swells roll in. It is also a great swimming beach. I could not stay out of the water. Not to mention it is a gorgeous stretch with views of Molikini in the distance. Not crowded either. The landscaping of the Resort is simply gorgeous. There is a huge Koi garden within the lobby with waterfalls and paths. The exterior of the resort is also very nice. Very classy and impressive. Nice rooms. We had a partial ocean view that was as good as a direct ocean view. The room was very large, updated and had a large balcony. The exterior gardens were a nice view with the ocean backdrop. The Weather. This is a very dry, sun-soaked portion of the Island. Lucky for us we were just leaving Kaanapali where it was starting to rain and it continued to rain there for four straight days (showers). We did not have one drop of rain at the Prince when the majority of the island was getting hit with storms. If you like the sun, this is the place to get some on an awesome beach. A few negatives: We thought the hotel services were a bit expensive. From the breakfast to lounge it just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem worth the prices. The entertainment in the lounge was great, it was the food and drink prices were a bit steep for the quality. The onsite restaurant selections were not our favorites either and they carried hefty prices with the limited selection. This is just our preference though, if there was an Italian restaurant onsite we would have been happier. This Resort is off the beaten path a bit. However, this is both good and bad. Unlike nearby Wailea and Kaanapali, there is no beachside path that leads you to other resorts and beach spots. You need to get in your car and drive to get anywhere. When you are out having drinks on vacation, this is not a good proposition for a drive back to your hotel. Plus, the fact that my wife and I did not like the restaurant(s) onsite, we had to drive out to get the dinners we desired. This location does have an advantage though if you are craving more privacy and the micro-climate of the area keeps it sunny most of the time. The excluded beach would not be as nice if you had the hordes tracking in off a path like at Kaanapali. I guess I have mixed feelings. If you are a pool lover, this one may disappoint. Personally I love the Ocean, but on days with bad surf the limited pool size may disappoint some. It is very small. However the surf was fine for all five days we were there. There is a poolside bar though that made great drinks. Overall my wife and I would return to the Prince.

We did a luau down the road in Wailea which was fun, the snorkeling trip to Molokini, and a Sunset cocktail cruise which was beautiful. I would recommend doing a cocktail cruise instead of an actual dinner cruise because it's less expensive & they serve you a very adequate light dinner with all cocktails included, & besides, you are going for the sunset and not the food anyway.

Much as every day was something special, I have to admit, my favorite part (especially for a fraidy-cat like me) was learning to scuba dive. I cannot recommend it enough! I could not have asked for a better instructor than Teresa, who, while we were there, got promoted to top scuba instructor and for good reason. I don't imagine you'd find someone more patient, clear and friendly to teach scuba as Teresa. We just LOVED her. But you want to know about the hotel. We had the pleasure of having our balcony overlooking the luau grounds, so every once in a while, we'd buy a six-pack and sit out on our balcony and watch the luau. It never got boring and I learned to hula to the Huki Lau. Although the best luau is the Old Lahaina Luau (awesome!!), it's nice to watch off your lanai. You can go snorkeling right off the beach (and scuba-ing) with plenty to see and a Honu (green sea turtle) now and then. The rooms are clean and cool, hotel employees are friendly, bell service were incredibly helpful. We only had a little problem with the wireless service, but it was fixed the next afternoon. The bar by the pool had excellent drinks, food and service. Arnold (bartender) even snuck me an extra slice of pineapple in my drink now and then. The best part was, although we had put a lot of stuff on our room tab (3 scuba dives, a few meals and LOTS of drinks), when we checked out, the tab was about half of what I'd expected to pay. Long story short, if you're going to Maui, stay at the Maui Prince.

All the staff at the Maui Prince were always very friendly and very helpful in regards to tourist activities. The koi ponds and Japanese gardens are beautifully manicured and great if kids want to purchase fish food. The beach fronting the property is nice and calm, great for snorkeling (most of the fish hang around the rocks/coral). I wish that I would have taken more advantage of it!

We visited other hotels and decided that the Prince provides an excellent atmosphere especially for the price that we paid for the room.

We arrived in Maui around 10:30 AM, and learned that the drive from Kahuluai Airport is approximately 40 minutes away. Of course, it wouldn't be the same if we didn't get lost for a brief moment, so when we add a trip to the market, it took us about an hour. You'll know when you arrive in Makena. The lawns are immaculate, the palm trees tall, the golf courses just perfect! As we drove up to the hotel to Valet parking it didn't take long to be greeted with a great big smile, Aloha!, and lei made of small ivory shells that they so graciously placed around our necks. Paradise, we're finally here! They are eager to get our luggage and make sure we don't lift a finger and direct us to the lobby. As we check in at the hotel desk, we again were greeted with Aloha!, and the very polite young lady apologized that our room wasn't ready. She immediately asked if we had eaten lunch and recommended a great place to eat. We chose to use this time to check out the hotel and beach. She smiled and handed us a couple of warm, damp, face towels, with a scent of lemon, to help us relax from our long flight. The lobby and hotel are in the shape of a horseshoe with approximately five floors, with the center of the horseshoe being the garden, with lush green trees, shiny foliage, flowers and plants. The beautiful koi garden is located on the floor just below the main lobby. The garden is perfectly manicured. For you golfers, there are two great golf courses! We check into our room a couple hours after we arrived and while it isn't a suite, it was average size and it was comfortable. By all means it wasn't small. The ocean view was perfect and could be seen from the whole bedroom, not just a corner of it. The lanai was a good size and had a table and a couple chairs to sit on to take in the view. I can do 6 days of this. Not bad. They provide bath robes, a safe, hair dryer, iron and T.V. You can ask for a VCR, but we didn't find a need for it. Although housekeeping has regular schedules and we were often in and out as is everyone else, we found it worked best if we'd call housekeeping to let them know when we'd be out of the room. They never seemed to mind our busy schedules at all. They also replenish your ice and coffee and never hesitated to get us more towels when we asked. For you coffee drinkers, the coffee stays hot! We didn't plan our vacation to be a busy one and really planned on getting some well needed R&R. This was definitely the place! Day 2 we took in a Luau. The Maui Prince offers their very own, comes with a buffet, and overlooks the ocean. I recommend to purchase premium seating because they'll take in a few hundred people in one show. If you didn't bring a camera to the Luau, they'll take pictures of you and your guest with one or two of their show performers and sell them for around $20 bucks at the end of the show. You get a 5x7, a couple 3x5's, and a calendar to insert your 5x7 picture in. You also get a chance to buy some crafts that are being made right there! The buffet was great, people were great, and it was an overall fabulous experience! And a small tip, pardon the pun, if you order room service, the tip is included on your receipt, so be careful not to double tip. Or if you're just feeling very generous, good for you! We spent most of our time at the Resort and snorkeled every day - well almost. This was my first snorkeling experience, so I got to practice a day at the beach before taking on a snorkeling trip to Molokini. I'm glad I did. So for anyone who has never snorkeled before, I recommend to practice on the beach first. It makes for a more pleasant experience if you decide to take a snorkeling trip. The 3rd day we took the Catamarin Snorkeling trip to Molokini. We took the 6:15 early bird special and our guides were very nice people who made our trip great! For this adventure, we got to snorkel in 300 ft of water! The guides were especially excited and told us that we weren't going to their usual spot, but instead, we were going to snorkel in 300 ft. of water and this was about a 1 in 500 trips opportunity. But, then again, they could be saying that to all of their patrons and we wouldn't know any difference! When we got to Molokini, we believed him! It seemed like we hadn't been there for too long before we got a 15 minute warning from our guide before we had to swim back to the boat. Could it be we were having too much fun? I will definitely recommend to buy the 4 hr. trip. We paid for the 2 hr. trip and it went too fast. You may want to make reservations for activities when you arrive. I found that you actually get better discounts from the advertising coupon books they have in the hotel and at shopping centers. Anway, I thought it was really nice of the guides to offer to snap pictures of you and or of anything you ask, just before the trip comes to an end. So if you're not a diver, he or she will get you some really cool pictures! And if you're really lucky, you may just get to swim with a small shark, which was really an experience! OK, I didn't actually see it, as much as I tried, but the guide did take pictures with a snorkelers camera and atleast I can say I swam with it! How many people get to swim with a shark anyway? The fish were beautiful and of many colors - yes, just like in the ads! I'll truly never forget this experience. It will be with me for a lifetime! On day 4, we were snorkeling at the hotel beach and heard rumors that the turtles were out, so we got to swim with a HUGE turtle and that just added to the fun we had! All that snorkeling gets you really hungry! Even though we didn't get to stay for the Sunday Brunch, I hear it is outstanding. We did enjoy breakfast buffet every morning for about $50-60 for two people. You don't have to order buffet, but you're on vacation so why not. You must try the waffles and fresh whipping cream with strawberries! Oh my gosh, my mouth is watering just thinking of it! The koi pond is immaculate and just beautiful! You even get to feed the koi fish with food they sell there. Friday was Prime Rib and seafood day at the Prince Court, and we were not dissappointed. The cost for two people - $100 bucks or more, so plan on paying more if you drink more than a couple drinks. As with all of the restaurants there, they are pricey, but there are choices elsewhere if you don't mind driving. If you take a short drive you can find some other places to eat at, other hotels, and road side meals on wheels type of food. The Maui Prince has a conveniently located activities center right at the beach and everything you need to have great fun! From kayak rentals, boogie boards, cabanas, snorkeling equipment, cameras, etc. The prices, I thought, were pretty reasonable and you can rent by the 1/2 day or full day and if I'm not mistaken by the hour. As for beaches, we found the hotel beach to be very convenient. There are, however, several other beaches to choose from within driving distance too. Big Beach is right next door as are some others. We chose to spend most of our time at Makena Beach. A big plus is their beach activities center that has everything you'll need right at your fingertips. And they will gladly charge anything you rent or buy to your room. You can even review your bill on their channel on t.v.! Don't take any outside beverages to the beach though, you're not allowed to. There is a bar and beverage near the pool area, not necessarily on the beach, where you can purchase drinks. If you forget beach towels, don't worry if you're at the hotel beach. Next to the bar/drinks area, you can pick up a couple warm beach towels on the way to and from the beach for free! A Hotel amenity. There's also a convenient outdoor overhead shower to rinse off. One last thing, take some time to drive to Hana. We made it to Hana on Friday, but didn't really have alot of time to take in the whole drive. But we did get to swim in Twin Falls!

I loved it and if I ever go back to Maui, that is where I will stay. The Maui Prince is located in a very quiet, almost secluded part of Maui (literally--at the end of the road). It is so much better than the crowded areas in Kihei (unless you like that kind of thing). I felt waited on hand over foot the whole time I was there--from the free valet parking, to room service, to the excellent restaurants in the hotel. You can sit by the pool much of the day and order drinks, lunch and refreshment without ever getting out or your chair. I will admit, I have not been a guest at the really expensive resorts, so I do not know how they compare, but if you are looking for a less expensive (for Maui standards) place to stay and still be pampered, this is the place. I even got a massage for a decent price on very short notice (outstanding!). Also, I cannot say enough about the grounds at the Maui Prince--absolutely beautiful, especially if you want to be surrounded by what makes Hawaii unique--its flora and fauna. There is opportunity for hiking and walking, and Big Beach is right down the road (a great Maui beach, again, away from the crowds in other popular parts of the island). The Maui Prince has its very own beach (not crowded at all) with a beach kiosk where you can rent just about any equipment you would like. The snorkeling right off the beach (and for miles on either side) was excellent--as good as the so-called \"best\" sites on the island. Also, just blocks down the road is Makena Landing--another great place to snorkel and kayak. Several other reviewers had negative comments about the rooms. Evidently, something had changed, because when I was there in July 2005, the rooms were wonderful. I had only a partial ocean view (and I could see the ocean from my balcony), but the grounds outside my window were beautiful. I ate breakfast on the balcony (full table and chairs on the balcony with sliding glass doors) every morning listening to the birds and enjoying the morning air. Another nice feature of the room was that you could completely open up the room to the outside air from the front and back with the air conditioner off (automatically turned off when sliding doors are opened). I honestly cannot think of a negative thing to say about the Maui Prince.

It's true that there are turtles and good snorkeling right on the beach at the hotel and the beach is nicer than at many nearby hotels. I found the employees there very nice and eager to please, the hotel very well kept, and the location fabulous. A much quieter place than the larger resort hotels up the road and that was just fine by us as we did not have our kids with us. If we had, we may have opted for one of the larger hotels with more activities although I think they do offer some kind of kids club. I took a horseback ride at Mendes Ranch and we took the Kai Kanai to Molokini, both worthwhile trips that were arranged by the activities desk at the hotel. Some reviewers complained about scratchy sheets, but I didn't notice that at all. In fact, they had a really substantial nice quilted bedspread that I would have liked to bring home. The food is expensive at all the hotels and restaurants so hit one of the grocery stores in Kihei and stock up your room fridge. Even locals, however, seem to think that the Prince Court Restaurant offers very good food. We ate at 5 Palms up the road from the hotel and while it was as expensive as most others in Wailea, the atmosphere was great and the coconut shrimp were to die for (request an outside seat.) You should pick up a copy of \"Maui Revealed\" at your local bookstore. Great insights and honest info about activities and restaurants on the island although I didn't necessarily agree 100 percent with everything the authors said. Old Lahaina Luau was better than the cheesy one offered at the hotel although more expensive. Also try to include a trip to the Aquarium in Maui. At $19 not unreasonable, very well done though small, and they have a nice restaurant and huge gift shop. The Pacific Whale Foundation has a gift shop in the same location and if you are going to spend money on tee shirts or other souvenirs, why not put your money toward a good cause at the same time? Call ahead and find out when they are feeding the fish. They had a diver with a two way in her mask so she could take questions while swimming with and feeding the rays and other tank inhabitants. Have fun on Maui! It's fabulous! We would certainly stay at the Maui Prince again. You probably need a car if you plan to stay there although I understand that the hotel has an on-demand van that will take you to most places nearby.

We have no complaints regarding housekeeping or the room- very spacious and clean. We did not go to the pool, but as others have said we didn't need to with the beautiful, uncrowded beach right there. We saw fish and turtles each time we snorkeled. The grounds are well kept and staff was very helpful. Dining is very expensive and we recommend going into Kihei for a good, well priced meal. Check out Kmart in Kahului for cheaper snorkel gear too. The Tiki Bar, in Kihei, is a nice place to grab a bite to eat/drink for the afternoon. It is located on the right hand side of the road if you are leaving the Makena/Wailea area. We walked through many other hotels in Wailea(Fairmont Kea Lani, Grand Wailea, Renaissance Wailea) and decided we had chosen the right hotel for us. It was far from crowded and quite a bit cheaper in price to stay. We paid under $350 per night and joined the Prince Preferred Club for a couple extra perks. If you want a more \"touristy\" and ritzy, busy hotel, try one of the others we toured. We have toured the road to Hana before, and did it again, we loved it. If you go all the way to the Sacred Pools, bring a change of clothes for swimming, go early in the morning (7'ish), expect about a half day+ there and back. Lahaina was busy as usual, but worth visiting and shopping. We booked our helicopter tour through Boss Frog's and saved a couple hundred dollars. We flew with Air Maui for the 60-65 minute Deluxe Circle Island Tour and loved it. Haleakala is also worth driving up to check out. If you stock your fridge with drinks or food, get it from Star Market or the ABC stores. The Shops at Wailea are nice, some pricey.

It is not perfect, but it is extremely affordable lodging in South Maui, while maintaining a great atmosphere. We had some noticeable, but very minor complaints about the hotel, but we would gladly return. First, we booked this hotel through a local travel agent. Our cost was extremely low in comparison with other reviewers, and considering our vacation was during the height of the tourist season, I think you should seek deals on this hotel before purchasing the rack rate, but then again if you are on this site, you probably already are doing so. Our arrival was uneventful, with the staff's greeting and front desk very cordial and our service was very efficient. One great benefit over other hotels, free valet parking (compare at $18/day for neighboring hotels). Our room was nice, the view was gorgeous, and we could watch the luau from our lanai. (Others have complained that this was too loud, but either I was extremely tired and didn't notice, or it isn't too loud). The facilities are very relaxing, without much ado. For example, the pool is very plain, but we never got in the pool (why when you have a gorgeous beach right nearby). The beach was a highlight, the snorkeling was great every day, and the turtles would come right up next to us, almost frightening you as often we were just playing in the surf when they swam by. You do not need to pay for a professional tour if you are adventuresome, we paid for a local kayak tour and ended up snorkeling right off our own beach. In fact, one boat leaves from the beach every morning. However, we did manage to compile a few complaints. Remember however, that these complaints will not prohibit us from returning to the hotel, but could factor in our decision if the price were increased... 1. Facilities - While they were adequate, the restaurants seemed a bit pricey for the area, we definitely took advantage of the cafe as it is more affordable. 2. Location - It is called the \"Last Resort\" for a reason, as it is the last resort on South Maui, but it is worth the drive if you want to relax. If you are going to be in Lahaina each night for the nightlife, this hotel is not recommended. 3. Bedsheets - We were thinking to ourselves that the sheets were scratchy when we read another person's review that confirmed it was not just us. A small thing, but when you get a little too much sun, the hotel could help you out by using better sheets. (These were poorer than many motels I have stayed at). 4. Housekeeping We had a problem communicating with our housekeeper, who unfortunately came whenever we were in our room and did not understand our instructions as to when we would be back (one day after 4.5 hours on the beach, we came back and our room was still undone and we had to leave again to get the room cleaned) Nevertheless, we found our stay enjoyable and we are very relaxed and refreshed after our stay at the hotel. I recommend this hotel for those persons wanting to stay on a beach, but hoping to avoid the high priced resorts nearby.

What a great hotel. We arrived Sunday night aboout 8pm. We got a very friendly greeting with a nice cool towel. Check-In was very smooth. We had an Ocean View Prime room that was wonderful. Very clean, not at all outdated as some previous posters had mentioned. No smells. The bed was very comfortable. Loved the make-up mirror and the stool to sit on in the bathroom. Great touch as well as the hamper for dirty towels. Toilet had its own room which is a nice touch. Plenty of hot water and water pressure. Housekeeeping was fabulous. Our room was cleaned most days by 12 noon. Always got fresh towles and the room was cleaned very well, especially the bathroom. Our view was spectacular. We were on the 4th floor with the ocean to the right, pool directly below us and looking out over the 17th hole of the golf course. Yes, this was the side the luaus were on but we were only in our room 1 night when the luau was going on so it really didn't bother us and we enjoyed hearing the music. They have a special luau for cruise ship passengers Monday and Fridays. The regular luaus I believe are Tues and Thurs. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We really didn't ask them for much but the few times we needed directions or times for driving they were pretty much right on. Eating at the hotel was pretty expensive. We made reservations Friday night for the seafood and prime rib buffet at the Prince Court. The Entertainment book has discounts for both the Prince Court and Hakone. The buffet was $43 per person and in my opinion although the food was good it was definately not worth the money, even with the Entertainment discount. We pretty much stuck to local resturants in Kihei for breakfast and dinner. We thought the breakfast prices were ridiculous. Although there is a small coffee shop in the lobby with coffee, danish, fruit and juice. The price there were not too bad. We did have lunch at the golf course 2 days and the food was very good, the service was great and the prices were very reasonable. About $10 for sandwiches and fries and one day a stirfry plate that was very delicious. We also bought cheese and crackers and fruit and kept them in the fridge for afternoon snacks. Drinks were very expensive-Don't bother-Go to the local ABC store or Safeway and by your own. We did have lunch one day at the pool as we were on the beach and didn't feel like getting cleaned up to go into town. Lunch for 2 was about $41-We paid for the convenience. Sodas were in a small cup and $2.75 ea. Again, we bought our own and water and kept them in the room fridge and took them to the beach with us. Beach was fabulous. Plenty of chairs and room. Never felt very crowded even on the weekends. Also very clean. Snorkeling off the hotel beach was amazing. Saw a bunches of turtles, tons of fish and beautiful reefs. Rent your equipment in Kihei town from either Snorkel Bobs or Boss Frogs. Will save you a lot of money and they have great equipment-Very modern and not worn. Hotel snorkel equipment was $15 per day per person. We rent for a week equipment for each of us and I had a prescription mask plus we had flotation belts and total cost was $70 with coupon from Entertainment Book. We booked the early morning snorkel trip to the Molikini Crater. Save your money. Snorkeling right off the beach was so much better. Although if you must, definately book early morning. We were the only boat there and by the time we were getting ready to leave, there had to be a min of 10 boats pulling in. The hotel had a nice mix of people. A lot of honeymooners, quite a few older couples and older families. There were a few families with kids but they definately were not over running the place. One of the reasons we picked this hotel was we figured there would be less kids as the pool is nothing to write home about and it is very secluded so we figured the appeal would be for a more adult crowd. And that did seem to be the case. Parking was plentiful. We always parked our own-Never used valet although they seemed to be very efficent and no one seemed to wait very long for their cars. The weather was wonderful. After the first night we left the sliding doors open and used the louvered door in front to let breezes in. It was great hearing the ocean and the waterfalls from the courtyard. We never heard much noise from other guests. Remember the hotel is secluded-There are shutttles into Wailea and to the golf course. We rented a jeep and just drove ourselves. Everything is pretty conveninet from the hotel although again you do have to drive. Kihei is a 5- 10 min drive. Wailea is just up the road-maybe 5 minutes. We went to Lahaina and it was 45 mins to an hour depending on traffic. Airport was about 30 min drive. My husband played golf one morning. Rates are very resonable for hotel guest. He had a blast. The course is beautiful and well kept. Spa services were good. The spa is nothing great or grand. I had a facial and massage and both therapists were good. Basically it was 2 rooms-Nothing very fancy at all. I would definately recommend the hotel, especially for couples. It is very romantic.

Just off the beach the snorkelling was excellent with a few turtle encounters. Photo of beach attached. We took our own snorkelling equipment but the hotel's beach hut also rented it cheaply. They also provided free towels for the beach and pool which saved us getting ours wet. The hotel's restaurants were rather expensive - $30-40 for a main meal in the restaurant and likewise in the Japanese restaurant. We often ate in the lounge where for approx $13 you could get great burgers and pizza and watch the sunset. We went to Mulligan's Irish pub just up the road on the hotel's free shuttle bus. We really loved this pub, it had the best sunset views, wonderful flavoursome, well-presented food (slightly small portions but fantastic prices) and really friendly staff. The hotel's cleaners could have put in a bit more effort. It was ok but not sparkling like it could have been. We didn't get the daily bottled water as per the other reviews. There wasn't much to do in the evenings, no where to walk or bar-like environment. Not the best place if you're looking for lively nightlife, but for relaxing its great. This proved a really tranquil resort, aided by the Japanese garden atmosphere, outside breakfast dining, lots of waterfalls and ponds. We didn't need a car as the excusions we went on (organised by the hotel's activities rep) included transport from the hotel. We came away completely refreshed and wishing we were back there. I'd recommend going there.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livingston, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA Very Pleasant Experience!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3704138", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a ten night stay at the Maui Prince. This was our fourth trip to Maui (previously to the Kaanapali area) and we decided to stay in the Kihei/Wailea area for a change of pace. After doing some research and reading the reviews on this website, we settled on the Prince. We are very happy that we did! I thought that the room was fairly large and well layed out. There was a seperate closet/dressing/coffee area and the toilet was seperate from the shower area. The hotel supplied some nice amenities for a four star hotel. There was a lighted makeup mirror and a nice bench to sit on to apply makeup or do your hair. There was also a towel basket for used towels. Everyone receives a welcome basket filled with goodies and bottled water. Every day the coffee (no limit) and bottled water was replenished. One of the services that I have not seen mentioned is the shuttle service that the hotel provides. We never had to take the car out when we went to dinner in Kihei or Wailea. They will drive you in a private car or their shuttle bus to your destination. When you are dropped off, you are given a card with the telephone number to call for pick-up. The hotel has an agreement with all of the area hotels, restaurants, and shops because no matter where we went, the people were happy to call for us to be picked up. We never waited more than a few minutes. I also have to commend the valet service. We never had to wait for our car. I think that the employees are trained to learn your name when you check in because after each encounter (valet, concierge, restaurant, etc.) we never had to say our name more than once. Maid service was outstanding. Every morning I would call housekeeping when we left for breakfast, and when we came back the room was always made up. There are three sides to the hotel. The middle section is ocean front and the two side sections are ocean view. One side section has a view of the pool and the other side is mountains and ocean. If you want quiet, stay on the mountain side. The Prince hosts four luaus a week and the luau garden is on the pool side of the hotel. Friday nights, they host the people from the new mega cruise ship (about 1500 guests). You can walk over and watch the entertainment, but if you are on the pool side, you will have to listen to the drums in your room for hours four times a week. When we checked in, the girl at the desk suggested the mountain side because we were staying for ten nights - and she said that the luau drums can get on your nerves after that period of time. We were happy that we made that decision. There are five stories to the hotel rooms. We were on the third floor (room #352) and had a huge lanai. I also want to mention that the lanais are very private. You cannot see another person on their lanai and no one can see you. When I looked up at the lanai above, the bottom looked about two feet shorter. I asked about it and I was right, floors four and five have smaller lanais. I also want to mention that we never heard all of the birds chirping that people have written about. It may have been the location. The beach is outstanding! We do not snorkel, but we were still able to watch the huge sea turtles from the shore. The water is so clear that you could see them swimming and bobbing their heads above water. The people that were snorkeling said that they had amazing experiences. The hotel rents umbrellas for $15 a day, cabannas for $25 a day or $15 for a half day. Beach chairs are free and so are unlimited towels. We didn't use the pool, but it was a very pretty round pool. There are no slides, etc. and it was never crowded. We could have had a poolside cabanna (there is no charge) at just about any time. One thing that I have not seen mentioned is that the beach access is a fairly steep incline - both up and down. Any person that has a mobility issue could have a real problem. We did go to visit the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and Fairmont Kea Lani Hotels. They are indeed magnificent properties! They are also very busy and the beach chairs remind me of those on a cruise ship. They are elbow to elbow, as are all of the cabannas. You cannot walk between them. The same goes for all of the areas around their very elaborate pools. The beach areas are not nearly as nice or as large as the Prince - and far more crowded and very, very noisy. If you want to read a good book on the beach or at the pool, the Prince is for you. If you have small children, you may want to consider a hotel other than the Prince because it does not have all of the slides, etc. that you will find elsewhere. I was looking for a quiet resort away from the children and after visiting the other hotels, I was happy that I stayed at the Prince. I have read reviews that try to compare the Prince to these other hotels, but you can't. They are in a totally different category. You will pay two to three times the rate that you are paying at the Prince. We joined the Prince Preferred (which is free) and booked directly through the hotel. We took the lowest rate that included breakfast (we rented a car on our own through National). We calculated the rate that included the car and found that it was cheaper to do it this way. The Prince Preferred gave us a few little extras which you can check on their website. We even got a gift bag when we checked out. We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning, which was excellent. We never had to stand in any lines whatsoever and the hotel was at 85% occupancy. We never had to wait for an elevator, there were never any lines at the concierge desk, valet desk, main desk, etc. For some reason, this hotel just seems empty (although it was not). We did not have the Sunday brunch, but we did eat at Prince Court for dinner twice and Hakone once and they were both excellent. We bought the Hawaii Entertainment book for $9.95 (they are reduced at this time of the year) and the Prince Court and Hakone were both in there. I took my New Jersey card (they are not marked, just to see if it worked) and I had no problem using it when we ate the second time at Prince Court. You just have to make sure that #22 is not scratched off from your card). This is a very quiet property with no noise and very few children. If you are looking for a lot of activity, this is not the hotel for you. The concierge recommended wonderful restaurants in Kihei and the Wailea area. We had outstanding sunset dinners and didn't have to drive to the restaurants. They drove us and picked us up. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife, then you are better off in the Kaanapali area. It is a good ride to get to that area from the Prince and not very easy in the dark. We have stayed at the Sheritan Maui once and the Westin Maui twice. The Maui Prince was a nice change from all of the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip - Average Hotel\u201d", "Author": "traveling-politico", "ReviewID": "UR3691696", "Content": "We just returned from a seven night stay at the Maui Prince Hotel.

The food is great at all the restaurants, but WAY overpriced. The room service is cheaper than the cafe which I found a bit strange. There are two reasons why we would not stay at the Maui Prince again: the birds and the linens. There is an open court yard in the middle of the resort and EVERY morning at 5:30 am on the dot they would wake us out of a dead sleep. They would go on for hours so we finally had to get earplugs to sleep! Also, the linens were terrible. I am not even a thread-count snob, but the sheets were so scratchy and did not breathe.

Saw 5 turtles while snorkeling. Water/waves get choppy in the afternoon making snorkeling not so good. Pool area is kinda lame, but why spend all day in the pool?...you can do that back at home....the beach is where it's at. Room service is quick and the front desk is very courteous.

The Kai Kanai (sp?) is Prince's boat that picks up passengers right on the beach to go snorkeling Molikini crater that is only 20 minutes away. Very nice trip with crystal clear water...70 foot visibility. However, Molikini is somewhat overrated as the corral isn't overly abundant and the fish count isn't that high either...we saw a white tipped reef shark and that was worth the trip for us. Take the early morning $45 trip to save some money...it's worth it. Overall, I was very, very pleased with the Maui Prince. The gardens and grounds are beautiful...plenty of free parking.

The room was better than your standard room with a vanity area, a safe, a mini fridge and a HUGE lanai with an ocean view. Housekeeping kept our room spotless everyday. The tub was small which was disappointing but it wasn't that big of a deal. The pool area was small, but never crowded and we always were able to get one of their 6 cabanas.

Fantastic beach, nice pool (so what if it's a bit small?), beautiful setting, wonderful wildlife (birds, turtles, deer) etc. etc. 10/10. We had a very nice room at the lobby level (#154). It opened towards the courtyard in rear of the hotel, where the birds congregate in the trees every morning and evening to socialize. They will probably wake you up the first time you hear them go, but you'll get used to it. If you want a more quiet room then ask for something near the front of the hotel. Of course the Lanai was nice, overlooking the gardens and west Maui in the distance. 9/10. The staff were fantastic - from the bell desk to the reception and especially Leila at the pool: 10/10. Free valet parking is superb! 10/10. Beach activities were great - my son also earned to Scuba dive and I had a refresher dive with the turtles! 9/10 Although the Luau is held in the grounds, there are probably better ones on the island than the one at the prince. The setting is great but the entertainment can be a bit cheesy. The food is only so-so and at $75 it's not cheap. The upside is that you can drink as much as you want and not worry about driving back afterwards! Overall 7/10 for the Luau. Room service is pretty good, considering the prices for food elsewhere in the hotel. I'd recommend stopping at Safeway in Pi'ilani (just off hiway 31) to get some supplies - drinks, salads etc. , then have a picnic on the beach (or in your room!). 8/10 for room service The Friday Seafood & Prime Rib Buffet was very good - it's worth not eating much for the whole day to make sure you have room for everything! More shrimp as well as crab and lobster would give it a higher score than my 8/10. The breakfast buffet is excellent too; it's great sitting outside with all the birds (Mynas, Night Herons etc.) by the Koi pool, and the meal will keep you satisfied the whole day. 10/10. You will need a car if you really want freedom, otherwise you can use the free shuttle to the nearby Wailea resort shops. Our overall score is a good 9.5/10 (it would be 10/10 if the prices were lower, but then that's Maui for you...).

There was a mini fridge which was great for cold drinks and sandwiches and salad. The snorkeling at the private beach right near the hotel was AMAZING!

Since we didn't know the island at all, I relied heavily on the reviews here and booked the Maui Prince because it seemed like the most mellow of the Wailaia resorts. It is. In a really good way. One of the most common things said about the MP is that it doesn't feel crowded, even when it's full. And that is very true. We visited most of the big resorts on the Southern side of the island and truth be told, most reminded me of the Fountainbleu in Miami Beach - or of a cruise ship... kids screaming at the water-park-like pools, overpriced gift shops, TONS of activities and only the most Disney-fied version of \"Hawiian\" culture - luaus, tiki torches, leis, etc. The Prince has a bit of that, but the volume knob is on five, instead of ten. What the other resorts had that the Prince didn't, which is key for my husband and I, is a place to sit outside to enjoy the sunset and cocktail hour. Our room was \"partial\" ocean view, so you'd have to sort of stand on the ledge and lean over the balcony to check out the sunset... hard to do with a drink in hand. And the cocktail lounge is inside (and sort of tacky) AND (if anyone from the hotel reads reviews - PLEASE change this) they stop serving drinks at the pool bar at 5PM. Why?!?! Why would you do that? Just extend the hours to 7:30 during the summer - no biggie! Luckily, we found the bar at Ferraro's (at the Four Seasons) was the perfect alternative - drinking mango margaritas and munching on antipasti. Sigh. As far as updating, I feel like the MP has simply fallen behind in some basic ways. They realized they needed a gym, so they emptied out a guest room and threw in some treadmills and freeweights. Suggestion 1: build a real gym. Other hotels have jacuzzi's attached to the pools, the MP has a couple of port-a-spa's a side deck somewhere. Suggestion 2: build an in-ground jacuzzi (that's a bit more comfy to sit in). Other hotels have a place to sit outside and enjoy the sun setting behind Lanai. Suggestion 3: build a patio over the breakfast area on the ground floor (there are too many birds around to enjoy an outdoor breakfast anyhow), and bust out the outer wall of the Molokini lounge - to create more of an indoor/outdoor feel.

The grounds at the Prince are gorgeous and well kept and the beach is just past the garden in the front. The Prince Court is one of the best dining experiences you'll ever have. Not only is the food exquisite, but the matrodee, Gio, will make your evening special. The restaurant overlooks the garden, the beach and one of the best views of Lanai for a romantic sunset dinner. The rooms aren't huge but it's plenty of room for newlyweds! They're very nicely decorated. My advice, PLAN A LONGER TRIP! Ours wasn't long enough and we're dying to get back!

We found a great deal on the hotel's Web site ($199/night) and we took it. We can't afford to stay at hotels like the Four Seasons and are comparing this hotel to other moderately-priced properties we have stayed at in the past, not to the luxury category. Overall, we were very pleased with the entire experience. The hotel is located on a great beach that has good swimming and snorkeling. Access to the beach is just across a golf cart path, not a busy street. It was very convenient for all those trips back to the room for things I forgot. I read the other comments about the room being dated, and we didn't really notice this. The decor in our room was light/white and pleasant. The doors were a little beat-up, and a darker wood, but we didn't mind. We liked the option of air conditioning or opening the screened sliding doors. Our room was spacious with a view of the mountain, some trees and a bit of the ocean. We liked the nice, private lanai. In general, the room was very comfortable, peaceful and relaxing. Service was a bit uneven. Most of the staff was very pleasant. The valets may have been a bit miffed that we preferred to self-park our car in the lot, rather than have them do it. On the other hand, the waiter at the Prince Court was very gracious about our use of the Entertainment discount. Maid service was great on some days, lacking on others. The room was reasonably clean when we arrived. The pool is a plain circle - no waterfalls or anything. We didn't use it. The grounds are lovely with lots of interesting plants. We liked the open courtyard on the way to our room, rather than a closed-in hallway. One nice surprise was that they didn't \"nickel and dime\" us. Each day they dropped off some bottled water. The room safe was free. Parking was free (self-park or valet). We especially appreciated the very reasonably priced take-out lunch counter.

The beach is the best part of this hotel....it's decent size and not crowded at all. You'll find sea turtles on the south end of the beach, make sure you bring an underwater camera! Snorkels at the hotel are expensive, $15 per day. Stop by Snorkel Bobs or Boss Frog's for a weekly rental for $30 and a $7 ticket to Molokini on the Quicksilver. The hotel itself needs to be refreshed, but I overlooked that because the staff was so wonderful on our stay. Nothing that a coat of paint couldn't cure. The rooms were great, little outdated, but very clean. This comes from a VERY picky person that needs a clean hotel. They also had a refridgerator which we kept stocked with a case of bottled water from Safeway in Kihei. Pool is very small, but there is no need to use it when the beach is right there. We went there once when it was too windy on the beach. Didn't eat at the hotel restaurants, but did order room service once...TIP--Do not order the pizza....ick.

I had previously saw it on Expedia and thought it looked very pretty, and for the price in that area of town thought it was a deal. We were supposed to stay two days in Maui and both days were booked at the Four Seasons. At last minute, I started to feel bad about paying $700 for a two night stay and decided to make it one night at the Four Seasons and one night somewhere else so I decided to enlist Priceline in that help. I knew we wanted to remain in the Waliea area so I put in the price of $150 for a resort hotel and it took it. When it came up the Maui Prince, I thought \"What a great deal for a nice resort!\" Looking on their website you can see that their rooms go up to $300 and $400 so I figured it must be decent. We passed the Four Seasons on our way there since it's only 2 miles apart and I knew that I had probably made a mistake. The Four Seasons looked so nice and classy and upon getting to this hotel, it looked just ok. My husband who is never one to complain just said that I was going to complain about anything I could because I wanted to be at the Four Seasons. When we got there, the receptionist was very nice and let us check in about 2 hours early. We got a room on the fifth floor that faced the golf course. Upon entering the hotel we definitely noticed that the decor was old. As many previous responses have said, the bathrooms had the kind of shower heads that you use to water your dog. Still my husband wasn't sure that it was a bad place so we changed and headed out to the pool. The pool is a little small and round. We decided to bypass this because the 10 people that were laying there were all staring when we walked by and no one was in the pool. So we decided to go out to the beach. The beach is an ok area and ok in size. There were only 20 people or so out there so we were able to get a chair. The bar attendant on that day was Lucky, and he was excellent bartender and very funny. One of the girls that was waitressing was talking about how they were going to close early because they weren't busy and hadn't been all week. The more we go to talking to her, the more she told us all the things that were wrong with the hotel. She also stated that if they did not redo some of the decor and pool, they would not be able to keep up with the other hotels in that area. We went out later that night and upon getting back, we pulled back the sheets to go to bed. There was a long black hair on the pillow. Both my husband and I have blonde hair so it wasn't either of ours. Upon pulling back the covers, there were 3 more hairs, one more long hair and two small short hairs, not the kind out of your head! So, I picked up one of the pillows to get the sheets off the bed and a cockroach came walking out from underneath the pillow. At that point my husband was unhappy and decided to call the front desk. They were very nice and changed our room, but we had to pack everything up at 12:00 midnight and move down 7 rooms. It was at that point, that my husband decided the hotel was not a \"Resort\" but more a dump that needed updating. I am the first to admit that I am very picky, and the decor doesn't bother some people, but when there is someone else's hair on your sheets and pillows that is something to be picky about. First thing I did when we changed rooms was call the Four Seasons to see when we could come over. The receptionist stated that we were guests when Saturday morning hit and that the spa opened at 6:00 am and the pool opened at 7:00 am, and we were welcome to come over anytime after 6:00 am to leave our luggage and change in the spa and swim. Needless to say that we got dressed and headed over there about 10:00 am without even going back to Maui Prince to swim or lay on the beach. Once we checked in with the Four Seasons, the met us with real lei's and allowed us to not only swim at that time, but even let us do an early check-in at 10:30 am!! The normal check-in is at 3:00pm. My husband has decided that if we go back, it is worth our money to save and stay at the Four Seasons the whole time.

But then my husband went down to the desk to see if we could upgrade. They were SO accomodating. The desk lady gave us about five different keys to different rooms so that we could pick which one we liked. We found the PERFECT room (#533)!!! Incredible ocean/beach view.

We ordered room service and had them set the table outside with table cloth and everything for the sunset. They brought us a complimentary bottle of champaign (it was out 8th anniversary trip). Then a couple of days later we came back to the room after a day of adventures to find a beautiful vase full of goreous flowers with a card from the lady at the front desk. The weather was perfect for snorkeling right on the beach at the hotel. The best ocean swimming I have ever done. The pool was small, but who cares when you have such a wonderful beach just 30 seconds away. They installed two new hot tubs while we were there, so here's no more problems with the jaccuzzi. Yes, the decor is a little dated, and they could do a few things to improve on the ambiance (like adding tiki torches in front of the property or lighting at night in their beautiful garden area). Also, the Japanese Restaurant's Monday night buffet is way over priced for what you get ($44.00 per person). That is the only reason I give this hotel an above average rating instead of excellent.

An oceanview room doesn't mean \"full oceanview\", just that you can see some of it. I wonder what the Partial Oceanview category meant, does someone have to hang by their belt to see the Pacific? The room was noisy because it was located in the elevator foyer and the building design meant voice echos from anyone who uses the elevators (avoid those rooms). The radio and alarm clock did not work for what seems since the 90's and the most interesting was that the shower was nothing more than a short rubber hose that you wash dogs with. It was funny at first to hear the adventure my 6'3\" boyfriend had trying to wash anything above his chest with a 5'5\" length of hose. The next morning we were put on waitlist for one of the few rooms that had a western height shower. Nothing was available for the entire week.

It is not a super deluxe resort with gadgets and tons of activities, but a serene spot to unwind. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Each room has a mini refrigerator stocked with bottled water, a coffee maker and a basket of goodies complete with coffee, chips and biscotti. The bathroom offers a tub with handheld shower, a separate shower stall, hairdryer, lighted make-up mirror and various Prince label toiletries.

There is always a friendly smile and a warm welcome from the staff...this includes store personnel, valets, housekeepers, massage therapists and everyone else in between. Cafe Kiowai serves a very good, if slightly pricey breakfast. The Prince Court Restaurant has an absolutely fabulous Sunday Brunch. The shuttle that takes you to the golf courses can also take you to other Wailea resorts or the Shops at Wailea for dinner or shopping. The resort is definitely not for someone looking for lots of action; it is for someone looking for a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of touristy Maui. I guess the laid back feeling here is perfect for unwinding. The lush gardens and koi ponds have a tranquil quality and ambience.

The hotel is very nice, beautiful grounds, excellent beach, helpful staff. Rooms are adequate, clean, and come with free safe, coffee, fridge. The pool is plenty big enough for this hotel. We spent a lot of time down there lounging around and there was never a time when even half of the chairs were filled. No people fighting for spots by putting towels down at 6:00 am. In fact we are sun wimps and they have cabanas around the outside of the pool area for free. We never had any trouble getting one of those either. The trip to Molokini was great. Largest Koi I've ever seen in their pond. The golf courses at Makena are very nice (played 3 rounds) and I heard comments from others in my foursomes that they were in much better shape and better views than the 3 Wailea courses. Believe that stuff about putts breaking toward the water! Those that talked about bugs in other reviews are right, you are in Hawaii and it is a tropical environment. There are wierd bugs from time to time. We saw some great walking sticks, green grasshoppers, beetles, etc. Only saw one bug in our room, but hey, they tell you to leave your slider closed to avoid that. They must have read that comment a while back about cobwebs, because I saw them cleaning walls and cielings with brooms during the entire trip. I paid for a Prime Ocean view room and at first they put us on the 2nd floor. I was a little dissapointed and asked the front desk if there was something higher up. They promptly moved me to a 5th (top) floor room with an excellent view. I appreciated their help with that. One negative thing shows my cheapness. We had our house on the market and it sold during our vacation. Had to send faxes back and forth to sign the papers. They allowed received faxes for free, but charge $3 a page to transmit?? Cost me $45 with taxes for a 15 page fax? Also they charged $8 for 15 minutes on the internet. You can do better in Kehei at the internet cafe. Other things of note about the Prince: The store is great with many grocery items you can purchase to have breakfast in your room, etc. It is only a couple miles from the Wailea shops mall, 5-8 miles from Kehei where there are many restaurants, stores, etc. The long haul is up to Lahaina and Kaanapali, but it really only takes 30-40 minutes, so it wasn't that bad. Haleakala was great, do it the first morning you get there and the 3:00 am rise time will not bother you with the time difference. Snorkeling from the beach in front of the hotel will yield great fun with Sea Turtles. Over all this was a wonderful vacation. I don't like those places that are crowded and over glitzed to the point that they want to charge you $400 a night per room to pay for all the glitz. If you want to sleep with the stars, go up the road to the Fairmont Kea Lani. They will charge you a lot for nothing except the room is decorated fancier and you may see a celeb now and then.

The beach was gorgeous, with great swimming and snorkeling and even a few days of great waves for jumping. Many excursion boats to Molokini also make a stop near the Maui Prince hotel beach area because the snorkeling is so great. We saw loads of sea turtles in the coves right near the hotel beach. The pool, while on the small side, was perfectly adequate for our kids, ages 17 and 10. They also enjoyed the hot tubs! You cannot even see another resort from the Maui Prince Hotel. The setting alone was worth the trip. The hotel feels very secluded and is a peaceful, quiet place, even when fully booked as it was while we were there. The other resorts in the area (Fairmont Kea Lani, Grand Wailea) have more of a waterpark feel to them, with crowds and noise and hassles. None of that at the Maui Prince.

I have to agree with some of the reviews that say the resort is outdated -- it has a little bit of a 70s time warp feel to it. It reminds me of the Contemporary Resort at Disney World in that it used to be very sleek and modern but now it's just a retro concrete building. However, the grounds are lovely and lush and overall we liked the look and feel of the resort. Somebody mentioned that there were lots of cobwebs but I beg to differ. There are lots of webs -- but most of them contain living spiders and that's to be expected when the atrium and grounds are so full of live plants and flowers. It's not as if there are ugly webs around from a lack of cleaning. As for the note card about bugs: ours said they had little flying gnats that didn't bite but were small enough to fit through the screening on the lanai doors and recommended that you keep the glass door shut if you wanted to avoid them. The only bugs we saw on our stay were spiders and a praying mantis. Nothing gross like roaches. The real selling part of the Prince for us was the proximity to the beach. It's just steps away from the hotel, it's beautiful, and it's nearly empty most of the time. Plus the hotel provides free full sized lounge chairs and towels. You can swim and snorkel right from the beach and we saw plenty of sea turtles swimming just off shore around the rocks. The views of Molokini, Koholawe, and West Maui are beautiful too. The activity hut is close by and the restrooms and pool bar are close enough to walk to when you need a quick refreshment. If you're a swimmer, it's possible to snorkel over to Little Beach and maybe even Big Beach if you're feeling ambitious. They are both easily reached by car -- about a 5 minute drive from the hotel. We also really enjoyed the services of the Kai Kanani catamaran that left right from the beach at the Price. We went on the snorkel trip to Molokini and on a whale watching cruise and both were awesome. The staff was very personable and I can't even tell you how convenient it is to hop on the boat right at the beach...or being able to flop on a lounge chair the second you return from your trip. Molokini was virtually deserted when we visited with Kai Kanani because it's so close to the Prince (maybe 20 minutes by boat). Our only problem overall was with the restaurants. It was hard to get a reservation some nights and one day the only place open was the Japanese restaurant and that was expensive and not exactly our cup of tea. However, the breakfast buffet was great and the hotel is quite close to Wailea where there are many places to eat and also only about 15 minutes from Kihei where there are even more places to eat (and some less expensive places too!). I'd have to admit that the TV set was pretty lame too -- old and with weak reception. But honestly, I didn't come to Hawaii to watch TV so after looking at it on the first day I kind of laughed at it, shut the cabinet and didn't give it another thought. The bottom line: if you're the type of person who loves the beach and the ocean and you're looking for a quiet vacation, you you probably can't pick a better place than the Maui Prince.

The beach hut is a rip off - about $20 a day to hire snorkel and fins - you can go to a shop at the shops at waliea and you pay less than that for a full weeks hire! The sunbeds are free on the beach but if you want a cabana which is basically a bit of cloth providing some shade you have to pay ?15 a day - i though this was scandalous - nobody uses them. I complained to the hotel as we have a 6 month old baby so the beach was off limits to us alot of the day as there was no shade - the hotel said its a separate company (yet you can charge hire eqpt to your room...)

We arrived to a complementary valet, an exceedingly pleasant staff, shell leis and refreshing cool cloths, and were shown to our great room (207) with a king size bed, private balcony with a view of the ocean and golf course, and a bathroom suite with separate shower and bathtubs. There was also an area with a small fridge, a cofeee maker, and the complementary gift basket. The room was more than adequate, but certainly not ultra-crazy-luxury hotel style.We did manage to take a peek at the other area resorts in Wailea, e.g. Grand Wailea, Outrigger Mariott Mailea; while they certainly had fancier decor and an insane amount of fountains and pools, nothing came close to the authentic yet thoughtfully assembled ambience of the Maui Prince, with its breathtaking inner courtyard with colorful koi fish, waterfalls, and Hawaiian birds amidst a mini-tropical-forest.The beach was extraordinary. Clear waters, and calmer toward after mid-day, with fantastic snorkeling with myriad colorful tropical fish off mostly to the left side of the beach near the coral, and even two giant sea turtles near a coral formation toward the center of the beach. And, despite staying for over a week, we had nearly perfect weather on every single day, save for a one or two cloudy nights when we didn't see all the stars there were to offer. There is also a beach activities counter, which rents out various things, and also where you get and return complimentary fresh beach towels. The snorkel rentals, however, can get excessive -- you might be well-advised to stop by one of the stores in Kihei and grab snorkeling gear or a boogie board if you're so inclined, and staying in town for more than a couple of days. We actually bought an inflatable raft that I ripped to shreds against the coral when I brought it to La Perouse bay to go snorkeling (see below).If you go, definitely take advantage of the 6:45 am - 8:45 am Molokini boat / snorkeling trip ($39/person,needs reservations). We saw whales on our way back, and were the only ones at the underwater crater for the time we were snorkeling there --- and the boat leaves right from the hotel's beach! Something to think about doing your first or second day there, while you're still jetlagged.The pools were smaller than the ridiculously titanic ones of the Grand Wailea, but we found them more than adequate, believe it or not. The pool area is done nicely, with one larger deeper 5'-6' pool, and another shallower 3-4' pool, and then two hot tubs in another area, surrounded by well-maintained and beautiful gardens, and a less-than-20-seconds walk to the beach.There were also a few activities that we tried poolside, which were a nice change of pace -- mostly weaving crafts. There's also a free Tennis machine clinic on Tuesday morning at the Makena Tennis/Golf club down the street that we tried out which was great. The hotel also provides shuffleboard, badminton, bocce, putting green equipment, and croquet for free -- which was fun at times after snorkeling to exhaustion at the beach.We ate at all the hotel restaurants. Prince Court Sunday brunch was excellent (I'd say worth the $40 or so) with an outstanding assortment of both local and standard brunch cuisine. Likewise, we tried the Japanese buffet at Hakone on Monday night (again $40 or so), which was also excellent -- although we had hoped there would be more prepared sushi than sashimi! We also liked the breakfast offerings at Cafe Kiowai -- the breakfast buffet is fantastic. In sum, there is definitely a Japanese-influence on the cuisine at the Prince, which we definitely appreciated. Molokini Lounge was okay, but largely underpopulated -- in reality, it's sort of an extension off of the area where the Prince Court restaurant sits.I'm not quite sure what the reviewer who mentioned a musty-smelling room with a turn dial was talking about. We had a well-appointed room with modern equipment (we even reviewed our charges and checked-out through the set-top box), and there was no musty smell.Also regarding an earlier review about the funky smell in room 446, our room definitely didn't have anything like that. Our experiences with the staff were that they bent over backwards to address anything that we might have questions or issues about. I was overly concerned about what would happen if the in-room safe ran out of battery power for the digital lock, and they sent a guy over in less than 10 minutes to check it out and explain the emergency unlock master key access.Otherwise, regardless of where you stay, I'd highly recommend the snorkeling down the road a bit in Makena in La Perouse bay. If you continue on the road past the Maui Prince Hotel and drive until you pass the lava fields, there's a trail before the paved road ends off to the right that leads through a brief lava field to some coves with OUTSTANDING snorkeling, probably better than Molokini at the time we went -- one family we ran into even saw a dolphin in one of the coves at about 7:30 a.m. (before we showed up).Dining can also be pricey, but we still enjoyed restaurants such as the Seawatch, Longhi's (at the Shops at Wailea), Roy's (up the highway about 15 mins), and Sansei over in Kihei (also about 15-20 mins away). If we had to do it over, we probably would've skipped the nearby Lu'au at the Outrigger Marriott, though, unless there was a better deal on it. After phenomenal food at the above restaurants, the Lu'au food seemed pretty unimpressive, though the show was interesting (epecially the fire-knife part at the end).The concierges cater to both Japanese and American tourists, and are bilingual. As such, though, there was so much literature around and people at the resort who had done and seen different things that we had a good idea of what to see & do (e.g. Hana Highway, Haleakala crater, etc.)In all, the resort is definitely out-of-the-way -- plan on an extra 30-45 minute drive to get to Kahalui to begin any of your expeditions to Hana or Haleakala, or even to Lahaina. But for those shunning the at-times gaudy grandeur of the other Wailea resorts, and craving a more peaceful, serene, and arguably authentic but still luxury experience, check out the Maui Prince. That being said, if you want the high-end ultra-luxury experience with waterslides and miles of brass-railing, I'd tend to look toward the other Wailea resorts first, but be prepared to pay more for those hotels.", "Date": "February 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTruely Hawaiian Experience!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1662158", "Content": "I was really worried that we had made a mistake staying at the Makena Prince based on the reviews but we are really happy we did! What a great Resort! The staff are fantastic... very hospitable, welcoming and friendly. You really get the Aloha spirit here. Prince staff want you to enjoy your vacation and do there best to ensure it! Architecturally this hotel is unique. The property, 1800 acres had a great beach, beautiful grounds and warm inviting restaurants. Big Beach next door is one of the best beaches we have visited in all Hawaii. The court yard, for lack of better description was awesome... water falls, koi pond, miner birds and forested... you really know that you are on a south sea isle when staying here. The other hotels that we visited: Kea Lani, Four Seasons, Grand Wailea are all beautiful especially the Four Seasons (incredible property) but you could be sitting anywhere in the southern U.S.. At the Prince you know you are away from the continential U.S. and will truly have a Hawaiian Experience. Yes the pool is small but is is quiet and uncrowded unlike the other high end resorts. Very few kids? We joined Prince Preferred and were upgraded from Partial Ocean View to Ocean View. It was perfect for whale watching! It is really hard to get a poor view (less than 5%) at this hotel given its design with all rooms facing toward the ocean. If you can get a room ending in the 20s to low 30s they have a view of some of the most spectacular sunsets -- amazingly everyone stops to take them in and shortly thereafter continue with drinks and dinner. Yes the rooms are dated... but very comfortable and clean. Just think of them as Top Notch for the 80s. This hotel allows you to really relax and slow down... each night returning is like heading to your island home. Recommend Seawatch for Breakfast at Wailea Emerald and Gold Golf Club -- the view is extraordinary and the price a little easier on the wallet. Sansei in Kihei and Sarentos (ocean front) just on the edge of Wailea and Kihei are also worthwhile. In Kaanapali, we enjoyed Peter Merriman's Hula Grill! Our best meal for food was definitely David Paul's... on par with the best restaurants of San Francisco, New York and Toronto! Great place to even grab a seat at the bar and be entertained by the staff. Do not miss the Whale Watching and the Maui Ocean Center (especially if you are not a scuba diver)! These 45 tonne mammals leave you awestruck!

I was a little worried about our choice after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly releaved. Our room was large, a comfy king size bed, a large lanai with table and chairs with a great view of the golf course and ocean, and a large bathroom with the MOST amazing high-pressure shower, a frig, and a complimentary gift basket upon our arrival. The decor was just ok in my opinion, but I only slept in my room. The beach is excellent, the pools were small, but there was never more than two people in it at a time. The gardens were gorgeous and the staff very friendly. Down the street there was some amazing snorkeling near La Perouse Bay. Prince Court food was great and I too used the Entertainment book coupon. Sunday brunch at Prince Court is reknowned on the island. I snuck in at the Grand Wailea and I was so happy I didn't spend thousands more to stay there. While the lobby is gorgeous (if not a little too extravagant, most looked weird walking around with beach attire in such a palace) The Grand has an over 18 pool (the only relatively quiet part outside). The other pool is a theme park/slide that is so crowded with kids and families. I didn't understand why people just didn't go to Disney. It was fun for the day, but even their beach is crowded - not my idea of an island paradise. I liked Makena because it is convenient to go to Kahului with Walmart and Costco (we stocked up on food, boogie boards and snorkel gear) but it was a drive (45 minutes to an hour) to Lahaina. Met Locals (living in Maui for 8 years) and they think most tourists are better off in Ka'anapali. It really is beautiful there and more convenient, but not as secluded as Makenna (but if you want secluded go to Kauai) I also stopped in the Kapalua Bay Hotel in Kapalua. It is truly beautiful, everything I liked about Maui Prince, it has, only a little more upscale. Very Quiet, nice pool. Anyway, from what the locals say, Maui Prince has a reputation for being a \"hawaiian\" resort. That's a compliment and you can't go wrong!!!!

The first days we were there were very rainy, but it didn't detract from the beauty of the area. The concierge was very helpful and went out of their way to help guests find activities. We really enjoyed the secluded feeling of being at Prince, and felt that it was close enough to Kihei and Lahaina for any shopping or off resort dining we wanted. Our room was a good size, and kept very clean by the maid. The bed was very comfortable, and there were extra pillows to be had. The food at the resot is amazing, but pricey. The Seafood Buffet at the Prince Court was worth the cost! To save money, we ordered an Entertainment Book for Hawaii online and brought it with us. The 2004 edition has 2-1 coupons for both Hakone and the Prince Court. Actually by using our Entertainment book at the resort and elsewhere on the island, we saved appx. $170, so we ate well, and didn't have to hurt so bad when the credit card bills came in. Complimentary Valet was awesome! The service at Hakone was superb, but Prince Court was a little snooty. I guess they didn't like the coupon book! :) Really, overall, we loved everything about the place, and would not complain about anything.
