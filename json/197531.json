The location of the hotel is excellent, it's less than 2 minutes away from the famed Faubourg Saint Honore stretch of shops. One word of caution though: we had dinner at the restaurant Les Collections on our first night in as we were tired and did not want to venture out. However, the selection of items on the menu is extremely limited and the main course which I ordered which was fish was extremely undercooked and had to be sent back to the kitchen to cook further.When it came out, there was a slight improvement, but it still was not very good. The gym, while adequate with elliptical trainer and 2 treadmills, has no free weights.

Although the staff were very kind and pleasant, we had a few little issues during our stay and although they were minor, I expected more from this type of hotel (and the price). Even though check in is at 2, our room wasn't ready and we had to wait in the lobby for almost an hour. It was a little annoying as we had been up since early morning and were traveling with a tired baby. Once our room was ready, we expected our luggage to be brought up (they had stored it for us when we arrived at 9 am) but it never arrived. My husband called but after waiting 45 minutes for it to come, he finally went down himself and brought it up. Also, for two nights our coffee wasn't restocked by the housekeeping and my husband again had to go down to the lobby and inquire about it. We also were given a free drink & chocolate for their bar with no explanation about time requirements etc. When we tried to redeem the offer, they refused because we didn't come between 3-6 pm. It was our last night and I find it silly that they couldn't honor two free hot chocolates. I've stayed at other hotels that were more reasonably priced and who pay more attention to the details. We also requested a club card, which we never received from the front desk, but decided it's best because we probably won't be staying in another Sofitel hotel. On a positive note, the location was great for our purpose as we walked everywhere with a baby and stroller.

The hotel is situated on Rus Boissy D'Anglais which is generally closed to through traffic and, as a result provides an extremely quiet location for its guests. It is close (on top of?) one of the great shopping areas in Paris and is also 1/2 block from the Place De la Concorde and the Champs Elysee. It was quite easy to get anywhere you wished to go. The rooms were well appointed. One of our rooms looked out into the lovely courtyard of the hotel the others faced the street. The rooms all featured large windows that made the rooms bright and the windows all opened to allow us to take advantage of the abnormally warm Parisian breezes. If I had a concern about the rooms at all it would be that the rooms with two twin beds were a bit small but, I suppose that is one of the constraints one finds in a hotel located in an older building. Small or not, we loved the rooms. The beds were incredibly comfortable as well. The hotel features a fantastic restaurant for breakfast and the bar, called Bar30 was warm and inviting.

We waited about 20 minutes for our food and after asking twice finally received it. As they were out of asparagus I changed my order to a bacon omelette.

We were told we had to wait till the next morning to speak to the hotel manager which is unacceptable. They carried out a technical test on the room door showing that only two chamber maids had entered the room proving that the hotel staff were to blame.

So, you're patting yourself on the back for your discovery, and forgive the room its better days as you settle in. OK, so maybe it's seen much better days. Like days when you could make out the original pattern of the carpet. Or even maybe swing a cat. The sheets are nice, the beds comfy, the showers work, but it's all ok cos again, you tell yourself, this isn't a big deal - after all, you're paying \u20ac300, when across the road they're paying three times that. So you head downstairs and make a booking with the concierge for dinner making sure and sure again that he understands you don't want anything traditionally 'touristy'. So he nods and winks and smiles and shrugs and calls and then bundles you into a cab to a restaurant with the word \"Parisienne\" in the name and although you have your suspicions, you give him the benefit of the doubt, only noticing on your exit (as your stomach threatens to empty) that the locals are shooting you looks of the deepest, most intense pity. So you complain to the concierge and he apologises and assures you it won't happen again. But why doesn't Sir and Madam go for a drink at the bar? A drink which (when it arrives after half an hour), you're sharing with a doormouse. When you complain about aforementioned doormouse, the waiter shrugs his shoulders (in that unique Parisian way) and announces that of course he is here - the bar is too pleasant and warm for him not to be! So, exhausted, you head off to bed. Oh yes, that very nice bed. And then you wake up (to a cleaning lady entering your room unannounced) and decide on a bite for breakfast. Wow (you think), how many staff there appear to be here! So you sit, and you order a coffee and wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. For thirty minutes until a cold cafetierre finally arrives. But you also ordered a four minute egg and that takes an extra ten minutes (total: forty), having been boiled for all of four seconds. So you send back your raw egg to one of the dozens of headless staff (who turns out to be the general manager) and wait. To get another egg. Cooked for another four seconds. When you show the damning evidence to the general manager, she shrugs (again, in that Parisian way) and says it's not her fault if her cook can't cook.

The rate was 590 euros ($850) for the first 2 nights and 680 euros ($985) for the second two. So you can imagine what I was expecting, and you can equally imagine my reaction when I arrived exhausted from Beijing and was shown to what I can only describe as a garret on the top floor. The door off the corridor opened into a literally closet-size room containing a desk and one tiny armchair -- no more because there was no room for another piece of furniture. This was the \"separate living room.\" A steep, uncarpeted stairway led to a small, low-ceilinged bedroom in the attic which contained another miniature armchair in addition to a double bed. That was it: my Prestige Suite with 1 separate living room for an average rate of $920 per night. I called Reception to register the obvious complaint, and was told by the distinctly unapologetic receptionist that there were no other suites available. I insisted, referring to the description and the photo on the website. I was told that someone from Guest Relations would call. I stood by the phone waiting for ten minutes. Then someone from Guest Relations did call and told me (without explanation) that I was being moved to another room. The new room turned out to be a suite as per the website. So the message here is that should you choose to stay at this hotel, be prepared to be shown a room which bears no resemblance to what you are paying for, and hope that your complaint will be as successful as mine was. Because we are talking serious money here. Leaving aside that problem, is it still worth the money? Not if you're expecting the five-star attention to detail which is consistent with the price. The housekeeping stands out as being of particularly poor quality. Used to finding your toiletries in the bathroom neatly arranged on a linen cloth? Not here. The two small bottles of water supplied each day were not provided on one day, even though the paper coasters for them were left in place on the bedside table. The vase of flowers was removed on Day 3 and never reappeared. The opened, empty boxes in which laundry had been returned were not removed for two days running until I pointedly placed them on top of one of the wastebaskets. The laundry pick-up on one day did not occur until I called a second time, nearly two hours later. Speaking of laundry, one shirt costs $19 and there is no option to have it on a hangar (in other words, it comes back in a box, pre-creased). Oh, and once you have used the laundry list that was in the closet when you checked in, it will never be replaced so you have to call and ask for another one every time you use the service. This hotel's main advantage is its location on the same street as the US embassy, since this means the street is closed except to abutters and therefore there's no traffic noise. Aside from that, it's pretty much your typical hotel in Paris, with scary elevators, malfunctioning Internet, weird phone, and that $12 can of Diet Coke in the no-we-don't-trust-you electronic minibar.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cPleasurable stay in a very central location.\u201d", "Author": "stewartmackie", "ReviewID": "UR45571768", "Content": "We stayed here for a three night break for our anniversary in September 2009.

We booked the hotel room about 2 months in advance, so we got the early-booking-rate for a luxury room with queen bed. The room was definitely small, but it worked. It wasn't quite the standard you would expect when paying so much but it was ok. All the staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful. We got the concierge to prebook taxis for us several times. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, much due to the price of 32 euro pr person. That was no problem, for there are several boulangeries, coffeshops and pattiseries nearby. We had breakfast at Ladure in Rue Royal/place de la Madeleine, Delices de Manon in Rue st. Honore among other places. One evening we were so tired we didn't want to go out for dinner so we ordered room service at the hotel instead. We ordered Caesar salad, french onion soup and club sandwich. The food was really good for being room service, and there were a lot of food. We felt very safe at the hotel. The street is guarded by two policemen at each end due to the American embassy being there. The policemen have to open the street especially for cars to drive in. In the hotel elevator you have to present your key card to make the elevator go up. There also is a safe in the hotel room for which you set your own 4 digit code. The maid comes twice a day. In the morning, and in the afternoon to make the bed ready for the night. They change towels both times if you want to. We got 2 bottles of Evian water every day. There are Hermes amenities in the bathroom. They were too perfumed for my taste. If you wanted wifi you had to pay extra. We wanted to get online on wifi from both ipod touch and blackberry, so we payed 9 euro for 24 hours. The location is absolutely perfect. The street is parallel to Rue Royal and it crosses Rue st. Honore. The hotel is just a few meters from Place de Concorde. You have metro stations near by both at Place de concorde and at Place de madeleine. If you mostly want to stay in the more \"fancy\" parts of Paris you hardly ever have to use the metro at all, only for your own convenience if you don't want to walk so much. We walked to Place de Opera (were the Garnier opera is), we walked to Printemps and Galeries Lafayette, we walked to Louvre and the Orangerie. You can also walk to Musee D'Orsay. We took the metro to The arc de thriumph and walked down Champs Elysee to Place de Concord. If you are a gourmet, place de Madeleine is a great place. You have Laduree, Fouchon, plenty of caviar bars and deli's. You should also visit the gourmet-department at Galeries Lafayette. Rue royal, Rue st. Honore and Rue du Faubourg st. honore is shopping heaven. You find almost every fancy designer boutique there is. Cartier, Hermes, Bottega Veneta, Gucci amongst others are just a few meters away from the hotel. One evening we had dinner at the hotel at the end of the street, Hotel de Crillon. This is a 5 star traditional luxury hotel. We ate in their no. 2 restaurant l'obelisque. Traditional french cuisine that was superb (even without michelin stars). We haven't seen the rooms at Hotel de Crillon, but our conclusion is that if you can afford it - then choose the Crillon.

The suites are at least double the 30sqm advertised area of the Deluxe Room we had booked. The hotel\u2019s location is perfect, as described by other contributors, on a police guarded, closed street just off Place de La Concorde and we had no problem arranging taxis through the concierge and the doorman. The Louvre, Tuilleries, Musee D\u2019Orsay are all an easy walk as are L\u2019Opera, Printemps and Galleries Lafayette and there are numerous top end fashion stores nearby if you are feel like splashing cash or simply window shopping as well as wine and gourmet stores. Few things in Paris can be considered cheap although sometimes paying a little bit more seems to get you better service than the sometimes surly approach tourists come to expect from bistros and bars. I am extremely pleased that we paid a little extra and chose the Sofitel which turned out to be well worth it. The standard of accommodation and service was excellent. All of the staff we dealt with at the front desk, housekeeping, in the bar and restaurant worked hard, were friendly and courteous and efficient. The only minor negative was that breakfast was extremely busy. On our first morning we had to wait for a table though not for long, and again tables were quickly cleared and people were seated as soon as possible. There was an army of waitstaff at breakfast and it was quite a ballet to get to the buffet without colliding with a waiter. However, that said, whilst the staff whirled round the room everything seemed to get done and requests for more coffee, juice were all met with a courteous and efficient response and a smile. On the second day we were seated in the bar which is decorated more for evening (my partner said it was like having breakfast in a bordello) but was quieter than the breakfast room. The buffet selection (as other contributors have noted) was smaller than one might expect - but there was sufficient and it was replenished. One other point to note was that the bathroom shelf was slightly wobbly and the hand held shower hose leaked - there was also a fixed head shower so we mostly used that. This might have been more of an issue if we had paid full rack rate for the room. Generally I felt that the impressive hotel staff ran a very tight ship. On top of this the location is superb and the comfort just right and I loved every second of our stay. I would definitely chose the hotel for my next trip to Paris although I do feel we were particularly well looked after on this occasion.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cSad Decline\u201d", "Author": "FlashSydney", "ReviewID": "UR22404904", "Content": "I stayed here 7 years ago and had fond memories of the property. Sadly, the present reality doesn't measure up. Nothing has been done to upgrade the hotel during that time and they are resting on their magnificent location - the absolute centre of Paris. Like others, I found the breakfast left a lot to be desired. There are too few places if more than a fraction of the hotel guests turn up at normal breakfast time. The staff are surly, I think, partly because of this. The buffet was lean considering the price charged. It was carefully contructed to look as if there was more than there was, but eggs weren't replenished, the juices weren't fresh and there was a tiny quantity of pastries and bread. Another member rightly fingered the coffee as undrinkable. To expand further, it is bitter, stewed and lukewarm. The rooms are small for the money and the photos on the web site use a fish-eye lens to make them look larger - an alcove actually looks like a corridor and so on. This hotel is masterful at nickel and diming. An hour's use of the Internet costs 20 euros - outrageous. On no account order room service - a teabag costs 7 euros, half a bowl of soup 14 euros and when I ordered the caesar salad it turned out to me a small slice of warmed over chicken breast on 10 ( I counted) strips, not leaves, of lettuce for 17 euros. The staff are perfunctory - except for the porters who are genuinely pleasant. This is a four star hotel no matter what claims it makes to being a luxury property. When it says that rooms measure 20 square metres - the bathroom is included. On the bright side - the sheets are crisp and impeccable, there are Hermes toiletries in the bathroom and, of course, the location is superb. What I feel has happened since my first visit is that the cost-cutters have been at work and it shows. There are far better hotels to stay in for a memorable and enjoyable visit to Paris than this one for the price.

I wrote them to ask for it, an amazing e-mail, and then i called them, using my terrible french (perhaps this is why I didn't get what I asked for..and someone could say that my english is terrible too)..nothing doing: we had a very little room at the first floor and when I asked the receptionist why she told me that the category was the same, luxury room, and none told her that we had another room last year, more, she couldn't find what room number we had so..take or leave..room taken (nice but in 20 square meteres you can't do any movement if you're not a perfect couple dancers) ..the concierge was a perfect help for me and my wife, I called him from Italy to book two restaurant, he called me back after few minutes to confirm he managed everything for us, I asked him to check if our fly was confirmed and he answered me in real time..these are the little things that make the difference..just as the breakfast, huge and with a very multiple choices..the cleaness of the room and the products in the bathroom by Hermes..but do you want to know one thing?

For those who enjoy walking, the Musee Du Louvre, Jardin Des Tuileries, Place De Concorde, Notre Dame, Musee D\u2019Orsay, the Champs Elysees and our favorite breakfast pastry shop Aux Delices De Manonare (400 rue Saint-Honore, try the most delicious Palmiers in Paris) are all within walking distance of the hotel (within 10 minutes by foot). 2- Hotel- This is a boutique style hotel. Not very large but not ultra small either. Don\u2019t expect to see large groups of people hanging in the lobby. The lobby is elegant, with plants, fresh flowers and a small library. The staff was also very nice, spoke excellent English and was very helpful. We were even greeted by the hotel manager which was somewhat of a surprise. The rooms were well appointed but small. Not closet size, not too small, but small nevertheless. The all marble bath was beautiful, with a heated fog-free mirror, Grohe faucets, and a daily supply of Hermes bath and beauty products. Our room had a small balcony with opening French doors (of course) that overlooked Rue Boissy d\u2019Anglas - which gave the room a larger feel. The room was nicely decorated and had a 32\u201d LCD TV (although the English language programming content wasn\u2019t very great). Another nicety was the fact that the hotel was on a closed street with police at both ends. This made it very secure and quiet. We can only imagine that those staying in other hotels whose rooms faced a busy street heard a great deal of loud traffic noise. The Unforeseen: 1- Laundry service prices. Typically when traveling we like to send out all of our slacks, dress shirts and jackets to be pressed. Upon arrival we pulled the laundry order sheet from the closet to fill it out and were surprised at the prices. Since the hotel does not supply an iron you\u2019re either stuck with the exorbitant laundry costs or you just have to wear you clothes with some wrinkles. Our advice: buy a travel iron if you want your clothes to look neat. 2- Taxi service from hotel. Taxis can be hard to come by in Paris . Since the hotel is adjacent to the American embassy the street is closed to vehicular traffic except for those vehicles permitted to enter by the police. So when we needed a taxi to take us to dinner we asked at the front desk earlier in the day. We gave them a specific time and had them call us when the taxi arrived. If you do this make sure that you\u2019re at the front door when the taxi pulls up. It seems that the meter starts running when the taxi is hailed by the bellman at the end of the street. The several minutes it took to receive the phone call, grab our things, wait for the elevator and proceed to the cab cost almost 10 euro\u2019s. That\u2019s about $16 dollars before the cab left the curb! TIP: just walk to the end of the street to the taxi stand at the Hotel de Crillion where the cabs are always waiting (there\u2019s also a metro stop there as well). 3- Internet prices. Having carried a laptop across Europe to download photos at the end of each day we always had the desire to connect to the Internet to check e-mail, weather, reservations, etc. We found the cost however to be somewhat excessive. (9 euro\u2019s/2 hours or 16 euro\u2019s/day). I will admit that we\u2019re somewhat spoiled by the free Wi-Fi that we have all over the United States . Conclusion- The Le Faubourg was everything that we expected from a Parisian hotel in this price range (corporate rate of 311 Euro\u2019s/night for a deluxe room). It was slightly American in its appointments but still possessed a great deal of French charm. The location is excellent, the staff perfect and the rooms very nice. We would stay there again and recommend this to anyone who\u2019s looking for a centrally located, quiet boutique style hotel in Paris . We want to say one other thing about Paris . Having arrived there with all of our preconceived notions of Parisians who did not care for Americans we must go on the record as saying that everyone we met was nice to us. When dared to eat in restaurants with French only menus they offered to help us. When a sudden thunderstorm hit, our cab driver (who did not speak a word of English) tried to find us an umbrella to keep our evening attire from getting soaked and ruining our dinner in the Eiffel Tower . The simple thing to remember is that a little French goes a long way, even if you only learn how to say \u201cS\u2019il vous plait, parlez-vous anglais?\u201d , excuse me, do you speak English!", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cNice enough, expensive, sloppy room change\u201d", "Author": "Happy_on_the_road", "ReviewID": "UR17377128", "Content": "I am writing from my room here right now.

My husband and her successfully checked into the hotel but when he arrived at our room there was a pervading smell of glue. When he complained to reception he immediately had our room changed without problem (the hotel were laying a new carpet) which was the source of the smell. Our room was nice small by American standards but large by European. It was very classic without being oppressive. We looked out onto the internal courtyard. It had all you would expect safe, satellite TV, mini bar etc. The shower was fabulous and very powerful and we had bathrobes and slippers provided. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in; I usually don\u2019t sleep well when away but had no such problems here. Unfortunately my flight from Southampton was considerably delayed so I had to abandon plans to meet with everyone at the hotel and instead met at the restaurant we had pre-booked. We went to Au Bon Accuiel (check out the forums) which was fabulous but unfortunately returning to the hotel I forgot I had left my case in the taxi which drove away. The receptionist was amazing she contacted the restaurant to get the details of the firm which they had called for us contacted the company and within 10 mins the taxi driver arrived back with my case refusing all offers of cash for returning. The location of the hotel is brilliant it is right next to the American Embassy so the street is closed to traffic other than that cleared by the police at either end. It is opposite the Crillion which has a taxi rank and is also the stop for one of the hop on hop off bus companies. It is only 2 mins walk to the Place de la Concorde and a similar walk in the opposite direction takes you to the likes of Chanel, Dior and Hermes. Breakfast is a buffet affair the waiting staff are superb and remember where you sat and what you ordered each day. You can also order omelettes etc at no additional expense. The only drawback I would mention is the cost to drink in the bar. However if you do drink there try the cocktails the measures are huge so good value for money. There is a nice little bar down the street which closes at 6pm though. We did not see any other little bars locally to while away the time.

It is not cheap and you are paying for one thing above all else - the location. It is on a narrow street between the Rue Faubourg St Honore and the Place de la Concorde - there can be very few better sites for a hotel. The presence of the American Embassy at the end of the street means that access is guarded. One ot two taxi drivers had a distinct preference to drop us off at the end of the street rather than go through the security checkpoint (dodgy papers perhaps) but we're concerned with about 50 yards here and unless it's lashing down with rain that's no big deal. The upside is that there is no way anyone is going to get mugged near this hotel!! As another reviwer remarked, the security arrangements mean that there are not really any passing taxis. But we simply asked the concierge to arrange one in advance when we went out each evening and on every occasion the taxi was there early - no complaints at all. This is prime Parisian real estate and the one thing you are not going to get here is acres of space in your room. You are paying for location not square feet (or metres). But the room was well equipped as was the bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable. No real issues with noise but in the summer if you had windows open the Buddha Bar opposite might be a problem if you are sensitive to this sort of thing. As ever the usual value for money argument exists over breakfast. The Cafe des Ambassades down the street is a lot better value - try the freshly squeezed orange juice. It's not open on Sundays though. Staff were excellent. The only 2 small drawbacks were a malfunctioning TV (soon fixed) and no non-perfumed soap available (my wife is allergic to perfume and had run out of her own supply of non-perfumed.

We arrived to the hotel around 10:00 am and a room was made available by 11:00 am even though check-in was not until later that afternoon. All staff spoke very competent English and some spoke Spanish. All staff were very professional. Our trip was for pleasure so I cannot speak for the hotel's business amenities, although it did seem to be populated by many more business guests than tourists. The only reason I can think of why there are fewer tourists is that the hotel does not show up on many guidebooks of Paris; however, the hotel is ideally situated for the tourist. Consider, the hotel is: 1) 1 block from Concorde Metro station which has 3 lines (looking at the Metro map, I could not find a station that was better situated with respect to lines accessing major tourist sites), 2) surrounded by the highest-end stores, e.g. Hermes. 3) practically across the street from one of the top luxury hotels--The Crillon. 4) a 5-minute walk to the Champs Elysees. 5) a 5-minute walk to the Tuileries gardens. 6) 15 minutes from hotel entrance to Louvre entrance via line 1 of Metro. 7) 20 minutes via metro to Marais (again from hotel and metro line 1) 8) 15 minutes to Arc de Triomphe. 9) Less than 30 minutes to Notre Dame (and in the other direction) Eiffel Tower. These spots would be closer if they themselves were closer to a metro station but each requires about a 10 to 15 minute walk from the nearest metro stop, Cite for Notre Dame and Ecole Militaire for Eiffel Tower. 10) Montparnasse is even accessible within 15 minutes via line 12. I will add that the hotel was spotless--both public areas and our room. The bathroom was very nice--marble, stainless steel, anti-fog mirror, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable. Yes, the room was smaller than our bedroom at home in the US, but it was large enough to hold all 2 suitcases, 1 bookbag, and a laptop computer without us triping all over our stuff--makes me realize how much extra room we probably don't need in our own bedroom.

However, apart from the fabulous selection of Hermes toiletries, we didn't find anything \"present-like\" (even water, which we should have had under the Privelidge card scheme). What we did find was a very decent sized room (Junior suite = bed plus sofa and chair, with separate loo!) with exceptional decor. We also found rubbish in the bathroom bin from the previous occupants - although housekeeping did remove it at our request...without apology. The infamous Sofitel \"MyBed system\" was a complete let down - whereas the same \"system\" in the Sofitel New York was as soft and comfortable as a cloud, at Le Faubourg was so hard it caused painful joints after 3 nights of (broken) sleep. This was in addition to the bin and recycling lorries arriving in Rue Boissy d'Anglas at 6.30am promptly and noisily EVERY MORNING and returning regularly until about 8.30am. Nothing like the sound of smashing wine bottles to jerk you awake in your very expensive hotel room. Do not ignore advice to request a room that does not overlook the street, even high floors, as the double glazing is truly inadequate!! The Buddha Bar is reputedly quite noisy at peak times (weekends, late evenings) although we never heard anything - but we wouldn't recommend eating there, as on the occasion that we did, we were treated to the sight of mice scurrying around on the floor. Breakfasts at Le Faubourg were great, but we've had very similar at the excellent (and inexpensive) Mercure Tour Eifffel for half the price.

One thing about this hotel is that you can remain quite isolated if you so desire - the elevators are controlled by key cards (great for security) and are next to the entrance, meaning you never have to make contact with any of the hotel staff (even the doorman, as the doors are automatic!). Frankly, for the price of the hotel, we expect a little more personal attention.

I would stay there again and again.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Paris hotel\u201d", "Author": "visitorxyz", "ReviewID": "UR8127399", "Content": "This was the perfect hotel experience in Paris. Great location, fantastically comfortable bed. Clean, quiet, bright. Located very close to the sights of Paris, near excellent shopping (cartier chanel viever all within 50 yards!) Cafe's nearby. I chose it based on positive reviews given on this site and wholeheartedly agree with them. No snooty too cool for school attitudes, just helpful efficient service and concierges (added a note to my email booking asking them to book a dinner table for me in town, which they did immediately) We were due to leave the hotel on the day of a big national holiday not realising the size of the crowds that would be in the area: the day before the hotel made a point of alerting us to that and arranging a taxi to be waiting for us in plenty of time for the trip to the airport. Room service was excellent. Highly recommended: Hotel Crillon location, considerably lower prices.
