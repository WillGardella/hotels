The hotel is located very close to the arc de triumphe, air France bus stop and CDG Etoile metro station. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. the breakfasts had the basics and was ok for 12\u20ac. We stayed in a club twin room which was small but very clean. The beds were very comfortable and bathroom clean and modern (with a pretty good hair dryer).

Hotel kept our two luggages during our short trip for 4 days with no problem. This was our first time in this hotel and I was relied on TripAdvisor again to choose this hotel and it was wonderful. I have been in some other hotels in Paris already but this hotel absolutely is the best 3 star according to my experience. Staff: Really friendly & helpful staff with overall warm atmosphere. All of them good in English and also some other languages. Location: Perfect location to be comfortable during your stay in Paris.Metro, RER, Air France Shuttle (Line 2), Taxi Station are in just 3 min walk. Too many different restaurants are closed by include Mac Donald & Quick which serves until 2 AM! Rooms:We were in Junior suite and then upgrade complementary by hotel on our one night stay to Deluxe suite.Both of them are really clean and enough space for 3 to 4 people.Deluxe suite is two room with bigger bathroom.Only the floor carpet is old and I believe it should replace. Beds are comfortable and bigger in Deluxe suite.Wifi is free in rooms which is really Hi-speed and my son enjoy it a lot with his iPad! There is a safe & minibar & Coffee maker in the rooms. Only issue about the rooms is that they are not sound proof.As suites are located in the wings of the building with no common wall with other rooms, we just have some noise in our room which is sometimes disturbed us specially during morning. Breakfast: It is limited but acceptable for 3 star hotel specially for children with different types of cereals and serve till noon even in your room. It is free for kids under 12.

The best part of this hotel is the location, it is located minutes from \"Arc de Triomphe\", 20 min to Eiffel tower and Louvre. We loved walking and stopping off at cafe's and various street vendors for crepes etc. My daughter and I walked around the area and shopped on the famouse Champs Elyses.

Our rooms (which were standard double rooms) were tiny, like the smallest I've ever stayed in, but immaculately clean, with a flat-screen TV with English and French channels, a minibar, spare pillows etc, a safe... everything you need for a short stay. If staying for a bit longer, I would recommend a larger, more expensive room over the standard room, as it's so small and could get a bit much over more than a few nights. Our only minor complaint would be the noise - it was SO noisy. All 4 of us were woken up one morning by two men fighting on the street and screaming at each other, and the other morning by roaring motorbikes and cars. The windows just didn't block any noise out at all. The walls are also very thin and we did hear the couple next to us becoming, ahem, 'amorous'... but hey, Paris is the city of love;) In terms of local restaurants, we had dinner at Le Hide and the food was good, but not amazing.

Room and bathroom good enough; only negative: the carpet was ugly and a little spotted, over a a little irregular ground (minors problems). Hotel is very clean. The wi-fi is wonderful even in your room. The lift is too small, for 3 persons without bags.

Our room was not large, so we knew to keep it organized. Our room had a cute balcony with a tiny table and chairs squeezed onto it, not usable in December. But the door was nice to let in fresh air. Our room also had a window, so natural light could be plentiful. The lined curtains also kept the room dark when you wanted it. The bathroom was small--one person limit--but water pressure in the shower was fine. The wifi worked well & was never a problem. We ate the breakfast a couple of times and thought it was plentiful. Yes, the elevator is small, but we thought it typical of a small European hotel. We seldom had to wait for it. The TV was fine--mostly French stations but also BBC & CNN. Our room was always cleaned very timely & throughly. The only complaint I have is the walls are thin, which I had read in other reviews. This was only a problem two nights when we were awakened by the couple in the next room \"being intimate.\" They were surely right on the other side of the wall from our bed as we could hear every single movement and utterance.

I booked this hotel based upon the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. It was quite the contrary. This hotel was similar to a hostel, we were very disappointed. TripAdvisor got it wrong! * CHECKIN: We entered the hotel lobby the receptionist said \"Bonjour, what is your last name\" and that was it. She then showed us to the lift and said \"you are on 5\". I am not big on small talk but I was at least expecting a briefing on the hotel, breakfast, wifi, etc but that did not happen. We were not informed of any of that. * THE ROOM (First Impression): After reaching our room, I thought I may have booked the wrong hotel, so I double checked from my iPhone, yes this is the same place: Royal Magda Etoile, 7 Rue Troyon, Paris. The room had a very bad, very strong damp/mold smell. Room size was 10 foot by 10 foot. The room small (even by Paris standards). The carpet was badly stained, very worn. The room was so dirty, that I had to lay towels on the floor to avoid walking on the badly stained carpet. The bathroom was clean but small. ISSUES: * Our room (on 5th floor) had a very bad damp smell which made me sick; it smells like cancerous 'black mold'. I called the reception desk (Dec 28 approx 20:00) the man said they couldn't change my room. The next day I talked to daytime reception & explained the terrible smell. They told me to open the window. They said they were fully booked & there is nothing they could do. * I called reception (Dec 28 @22:00) for an extra blanket & they told me to come down to reception to get it. I asked if he can send it up & he said \"no, you have to come down and get it\". I had to go all the way down to reception in my PJ's, how embarrassing. * I spoke to 'Sacre' both times, he was not friendly. * No wash rags, had to wash my body with full size towel. * AC did not work. VERY LOUD: * The building was very loud. I could literally hear the people next door going to the bathroom and talking. I had to sleep with my iPod on. The building next door was under construction and the building on the other side is a night club. OVERALL: Both my wife & I were sadly disappointed. We travel a few times per year on vacation & stay at various chain & boutique hotels across the world. I can honestly say that this hotel is the WORST HOTEL I have ever stayed at. I have stayed at other boutique hotels in Paris (hotel Elysees Regencia is great) and the Royal Magda was terrible. If you would stay at a Hostel, than you should stay here. If you think hostels are disgusting, than you would think this hotel is disgusting.

The lady checking us in was welcoming and very informative. Location: Great location just a few minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is located in a small side road so it benefits from quietness and privacy, yet the side road opens out onto major thoroughfares so it's easy to eat out locally as there are a selection of restaurants within a short walk. The Metro station is nearby at the Arc de Triomphe and there is a Taxi rank up on the main road. The area felt safe and at no time were we concerned for our safety. Check-in: The check-in process ran smoothly, with our booking being accurate. We'd booked two rooms, a double and a twin and these were exactly what had been reserved. Our details were correct and the facilities of the hotel were clearly explained to us. Rooms: We'd booked two club rooms, as these have a little extra space. I'd been told rooms in Paris can be on the small side, but these were both more than adequate with none of the 'croom-cupboard' feeling that some hotel rooms can have. There was enough space to easily have several people in the room. Everything was clean and tidy, and the beds were very comfortable with none of the saggness that can affect older beds. The bathrooms both had a bath with a shower over and there was plentiful hot water and toiletries. Breakfast: On a couple of days we ate in the hotel. Breakwast was of the continental type and there was a selection of pastries, cereals, yoghurts, fruit, cold meats and cheese. Staff were attentive in ensuring nothing ran out. The bread and pastries were lovely and fresh and it was easy to have a very satisfying breakfast to set you up for the day. Check-out: Continuing with the overall experience at the hotel, this was accurate, friendly and professional. They asked specifically if we'd enjoyed our stay and seemed actually interested in the response rather than it just being for effect. They also booked a taxi for us and this was done correctly too. Overall: This hotel could teach many a major chain about customer service. Without fail every member of staff was friendly and very professional in their roles. It was a great combination of high end hotel quality with small friendly customer service.

I think the hotel has gotten very busy, but it does not seem that way and we never had to wait for assistance or at breakfast. We never felt rushed either. A \"Do Not Disturb\" sign is not necessary. The housekeepers are almost invisible, (no taps on the door) but the room gets cleaned no matter how late you leave or how early you return. On our recent visit, it was hot in Paris, and our room was comfortably cool thanks to the AC. The location is convenient, but this is not a tourist area. You are close to the Metro and the museum cluster along the Seine is a direct trip on line 1. With a little exploring, we have found a variety of nice places to eat, a laundromat and a superb market area all within five minutes walk. The place has charm. We love the spiral staircase with the leopard skin pattern on the rugs. It is basically a small hotel with a nice mix of clientele. It has no gym and no computer stations, but there is a little iPad in the lobby. The WiFi works. There are ways to get your boarding passes printed with help from the desk. You cannot go into the garden which is a bummer. The rooms are small with small closets, but we do not feel cramped. In our favorite room, the bed is up against the wall on two sides. Reading lights are adequate and there are enough plugs to charge the cell and laptops without unplugging the lights, etc. The boiler blew at the end of our trip last year. Obviously fixed now, and the hot water is hot. Our shower leaked a bit. That was not a problem for us since the puddle stayed in the corner. Hope they fix it, though. Little kids will have no diversions. The hotel works because the staff are dedicated. Change that, or get too many rowdy guests, and there would be problems due to the size and intimacy of the place.

The hotel was in a perfect location for us, just around the corner from the Arch de Triomph which also just happens to be a major stopping point for several Metro Lines making it very easy to get around the city. NOTE \u2013 when leaving the station, look for exit # 4 Wagram! We found the best way to get to and from the airport was via Super Shuttle or the AirFrance Shuttle, if you only have an overnight bag then take the Metro, but do note you will need to transfer trains and there are lots of stairs and we did not find an escalator. The hotel is located on a small side street, about the size of an alley, which is not listed on many maps. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of everything and the street is active with local bars and a playhouse located directly across the street and as such there is city noise, but we did not find this to be an issue we live in the city (Chicago, NY, LA\u2026). Also, the windows are double sealed which blocks out just about all the noise. If you are looking for a hotel where you will wake each morning to the sounds of chirping birds and crickets you should not be looking for a hotel in Paris. Check-in \u2013 Again, the hotel is small and so is the lobby. As I mentioned we stayed at the hotel on 3 separate occasions during the length of our stay, we were in rooms 112, 312, and 612. We booked club double rooms and were there for 1-night, 4-nights, and 1-night respectively. Check-in went smoothly all three times, on our first visit arriving for the US, our rooms were not ready (we were early), but the hotel offered to stow our bags, offered coffee and a snack and then we went for a walk. When we returned our rooms were ready and we took the small elevator to our room. I have read peoples negative comments about the size of the elevator and it is true it is very small, about enough room for 1-person and 2-bags. So you take turns, there is no reason why everyone needs to get to the room at the same time. Relax folks you are on vacation and things run a little different in Europe than they do in the US. The elevator was reliable and in working order for our entire stay. I have been in other similar sized hotels that did not have an elevator, so the shear fact that there is one was a plus for us\u2026 On our return visit there were 12 of us check-in taking 7-rooms, we lined people up outside so as to not overwhelm the lobby, the check-in process or the elevator. All our rooms were ready and the check-in went very smoothly. On our final return it was just the two of us and again we had no issues checking-in. The rooms \u2013 112, 312, 612. As I stated earlier, we booked club twin rooms for me personally and several other type rooms, including club double, standard double and single rooms. I will not speak for the other rooms, just the rooms I personally stayed in. Rooms 112 and 312 are identical to each other. The room has 2 twin beds which are pushed up to each other with a night stand on either side. There is a small desk, fridge, coffee machine, very small safe (not big enough for an average size lap top, but maybe an ipad), and a place to hang some clothes. There was room to put out 2 large suite cases, but you will be bumping into them\u2026 The rooms had double doors, which blocked out noise from the corridor and as I said earlier the windows are sound blocking. You can also close the shutters for added noise reduction. The rooms are small, but about average for a European hotel. The rooms are not designed to be spend any quality time. It is a room to get a good night sleep and a nap in the afternoon. Really you should be out seeing the sights of Paris and not spending it in your room\u2026 If you want a large room so you can spend the day in it then you should check your self into an American style hotel. Bathroom \u2013 is very small. Only one person can be in the bathroom at one time (and do you really want to be in the bathroom when there is someone else in there\u2026? OK, maybe when you are trying to get ready for dinner...) There is a small sink, toilet and a small tub with a hand held shower on a pole. As is typical in European hotels there is no shower curtain, but a \u00be glass divider and yes water gets everywhere\u2026 One note the ventilation system did not work very well and the room gets very steamy when taking a shower. Room \u2013 612 \u2013 On our final return to Paris for one night, we were put into room 612. As I noted I booked club twin rooms for myself and this is the only room that I would have complained about, but I did not. We were only there for the one night, but this room is even smaller than the other 2 rooms 112 and 312. I am not saying I should have received any special treatment, but I was the organizer for the group and booked 60+ hotel nights during the month of September. It would have been nice to maybe have one of the rooms I previously stayed in or maybe even an upgrade, the hotel was not fully booked. Again, I did not complain we were already in our room and it is on the 6th floor. If we were going to be there longer or when we go back, I will ask for a different room. Checking-out \u2013 was just as easy as check-in, but I did book as a group so things are a little different for us. Front desk \u2013 was exceptional they answered all our questions and were able to get us last minute reservations for a group of 14 in some exceptional restaurants. I and I think everyone in our group would stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Londonderry", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris\u201d", "Author": "LesMLondonderry Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR119100478", "Content": "This was my third time to stay in the Royal Magda Etoile and yet again everything was perfect.

The lady behind the desk informed us that we had infact been upgraded for free to a suite and that we could come back from our sightseeing and check in to our room later. We did this later in the afternoon, the suite was lovely and so was the complimentary champagne and nibbles. A great surprise! The suite consisted of a living area, large bathroom with shower and bath and a large bedroom and big bed. Everything was perfect for the occasion. The hotel recomended a restaurant very close to the Hotel, and it turned out to be a fanatstic recomendation at Le Hide.

Positives: 1) Service was excellent...helpful before the trip...pleasant welcome on arrival...extremely fast check-in...helpful during the stay (good restaurant tips)...fast check-out. Every request was greeted with a smile. Left chocolates in the room to celebrate the New Year (nice touch). 2) Location...2mins from metro (& start of Champs Elysee). 3) Clean...rooms, while small, were clean. Fresh towels every day as needed. 4) Breakfast...simple but satisfactory. Fresh pastries, bread, etc. Warm welcome. Negatives 1) Not really a negative as value was excellent...but as this is a small (family run?) hotel, the rooms are small (as is the breakfast area). But since we spent very little time there, this was no issue (& it was clean). 2) Rooms have no sound insulation, so you can hear any early morning risers or any vans that might pass by the hotel (if you have a room facing the street).

I was really looking forward to our stay here, especially after reading the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor but I have to say that we were extremely underwhelmed and disappointed in our stay here (which is sad because Tripadvisor had always given us the best tips/advice!). First off, we probably had the world's fastest check-in totaling approximately 3 minutes (if even that). We said hi, gave them our name and they handed us a key, pointed to the lift and that was it. Not even a friendly \"How are you\" or \"Is there anything else we can help you with?\" After riding the world's smallest elevator and placing our bags down, we went back downstairs and inquired about places for lunch. Surprisingly, the staff at the desk just shrugged their shoulders and said \"I dont know.\" In fact, throughout the next three days at the hotel we received ZERO assistance in any type of planning as far as suggestions on places to eat and transportation options (trains vs walking vs taxi) when we inquired how to get to popular destinations such as the Lourve and Versailles. They weren't rude or mean about the process - just very unhelpful. And it wasn't just one staff member who was unhelpful, we probably came across 4-5 different staff members who were equally useless in suggesting and assisting us while touring Paris. It was also disappointing to have WiFi access only in the lobby and not in the rooms. In addition, the internet access was spotty and frequently the box/router had to be reset by a staff member so we could use it. Also, I read some reviews that people received a complimentary bottle of champagne upon their arrival. Needless to say, we DID NOT even though we got engaged in Paris and the first person we ended up telling was the person at the concierge desk who just said \"Oh, congrats - you should buy some champagne\" and promptly handed us a bottle that ended up costing us ~48euros. On a positive note: each staff member spoke English and the room was very clean and comfortable. Yes, it was a tad on the smaller side but not too uncomfortably small. Also, I had emailed ahead of time about the room and they responded promptly to all my emails and included useful photos and information.

Staff at the hotel were pleasant and were willing to speak English or French. Breakfast was simple but filling. Room service meals were available but didn't take advantage of this. These must have been brought in from another catering facility as the hotel didn't seem to serve evening meals in the breakfast area. The number of restaurants and eateries within spitting distance meant it wasn't an issue anyway. All in all a fine and convenient location from which to base a 4 day trip to Paris.

The room is facing inner yard, so we had no sound issues. The staff was polite and helpful, and we had no special incidents requiring any special action (xept perhaps when the missy managed to lock the safe, we had to get some help to reset it :) We booked on-line, so we had a 3 nights, pay for 2 deal. The price reduction from 'normal rates' also helps increasing the score for this hotel, Im not sure I would have payed the 'top' price. Location is great, we walked to Eifel tower in about 20 mins, and we walked to louvre in about 40 mins (5 mins on metro btw). Main metro line is 1 min walk from hotel, and so are the airport buses. Just remember that bus fare is NOT included in metro tickets, even if we where told so in the metro-information boot (and they made us buy a 20 Eur ticket). So we had to take the metro/train back to the airport (3 train changes). I would reccomend taking the bus (around 11 Eur per person) or prvate car (55 eur). Before we left, I read some negative reviews, mostly stating that the rooms are small (By looking at the floor plan, I guess the normal rooms can be a bit small, so if you intend spending a lot of time in the room you might opt for the bigger rooms), the elevator was small (it is a bit small, who cares), and that your luggage is not carried to the room for you. If the later is impoprtant, I think you need to try some hotels in another price-segment. I don't think its very common in europe. Personaly, I prefere carry my own bags anyway. We had breakfast in the room one of the days, and it was a regular breakfast. Some bread, croisants, cofee, youghurt, jam and cheese. The last days we had 6 hrs from checkout to plane departure, and we could leave the luggage at the hotel. So to conclude: perfectly fine hotel, clean, good location, and nothing negative. Normaly I might give a 'good' rating, but extra reward for the complimentary champagne offered for our aniversary trip.

The front of house staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful and all spoke English perfectly. There was also free wifi in the lobby but on request, my husband was given a network cable to use in the room - free of charge. We were also able to leave our luggage in the hotel after we checked out (12pm checkout) as our flight wasn't til late in the evening - no problem at all. A few people have commented that this hotel isn't central, I would disagree heartily as the metro is 2 mins away and is only a few stops from all the major tourist attractions, what more do you want! There are lots of lovely bars and restaurants in the area and strangely the ones we frequented had no tourists and seemed to be filled with Parisiens which made it all that more enjoyable, the prices were no more expensive than other areas we had visited. What helped also, was the amazing deal we got, so if you want a clean, central, friendly hotel with nice breakfast, then this is it. We'll definitely return and recommend to all our friends and family who are planning a trip to Paris.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cWe will always go back...\u201d", "Author": "sweptawayy", "ReviewID": "UR82260976", "Content": "I cannot say enough.

The hotel is extremely well located - close to a central metro station with connections to several main lines as well as the open top bus tours which are good for a first day intro to the city. The rooms are a bit on the small side but this is more than compensated for by the excellent value of hotel - superb considering its location. as someone mentioned earlier, it can get noisy on saturday nights as the partiers next door stand outside to smoke. The crowd hangs out there until the morning and so when you leave there is still a bit of a rowdy crowd. they are mostly harmless though. also try the restaurant next door, Le Petite Gourmand. A bit pricey, but a Parisian restaurant experience is not to be missed. the manager is very friendly and the food excellent. To save some money, there is a cafeteria style restaurant with a 10 euro prix fix menu at the corner of Wagram and Troyon, across from the McDonalds I believe. the food is decent but good value - a must for paris. The Air France Shuttle is only a few minutes walk away which is huge time and cost saver - this means the airport is only about an hour away.

There were some problems during our stay, on the final evening the hot water went off. The staff dealt with this well, we got free breakfast (which despite other reports is good value for 12 euros).

Also on final night was woken up by TV from room next door, rang reception and this was sorted quickly (if you are noisy, its one warning and your out, great!!). Would definitely return and recommend to others. Tried the restaurant next door 'Le Bouchon Gourmand'. The owner very friendly and attentive but does not disguise the fact that its overpriced for the service and quality of food. Mind you for UK travellers Paris has never been more expensive due to exchange rate....8-10 euros for a standard drink (thats about 8-10 sterling even in the cheaper places away from Arc etc). Did the Bateaux Mouches river cruise from Pont D'Alma. Ok not cheap at about 200 euros for two but actually good value with excellent food.

As other reviewers mentioned, one very tiny elevator did take us awhile to check in/out, however, due to the size of this hotel, we were just glad they at least had one. We did not find many elevators/escalators or ramps in Paris, and climbed a ton of steps. It is not just the food that keeps them thinner. Rooms are similar to a cruise ship (just the bed, small narrow desk and small bath) however as with a cruise ship, they utilized space well (cut out shelves in wall for remote control, shelves in bathroom, due to pedastal sink). Shower was one the cleanest I have been in. Although smaller, great pressure and removable head, which came in handy to heat massage sore feet. Beds were harder than we are used to in US, but also found that in London. Only issue was no air conditioning. Asked about it at the front desk and they said it was just on heat, due to the time of the year, however, it was too hot with windows closed, so we opened them for awhile prior to going to sleep, then closed due to noise. Hotel offered us a free drink for our special occasion, which we really appreciated. They also called for a taxi that would fit all our bags and 4 of us, since most taxis are the size of mini coopers. We took the metro to it from CDG, however, it was really hard getting in various trains and up many, many stairs with luggage so took their recommendation to take a taxi to the Euro train instead. We were glad we did because the Euro train, is not in the best part of town (beggars, packed with people, etc). We just wish we would have figured that out prior to buying a 5 day metro pass (only option is 3 or 5 days). Taxi was $32 but extra for bags and people. The metro pass is still the best way to go though for unlimited RER (train) and metro. Took RER out to Versailles and loved it. As you exit metro for the hotel, you turn and see the Arch De Triumph with Eiffel Tower in background (spectaculor). Hotel is on a quieter side street. M&M Cafe, just down the road had eggs, ham, bread, juice and hot drink for $9 euro so opted for that over hotel $12 buffet since it looked like a lot of croissants.

After reading the previous reviews I know we were in for a treat. Myself and my partner were celebrating our anniversary. I emailed the hotel before traveling and informed them of our special occasion. They advised that we would get an upgraded room if there was one available on our arrival - which to my delight there was. We arrived at the hotel early in the morning - about 10am and we got to check in straight away, we got shown to our room and upon arrival we were greeted by a bottle of champagne and some nibbles - exactly what I needed after my Ryanair flight!!!!! I drank the champers as my boyf is not keen and we walked to the Eiffel Tower from the hotel. It is only a 10 minute walk along beautiful tree lined streets. The Arc De Triomphe is a mere 3 minute walk from the hotel with a metro located there. The metro is very easily navigated. I must commend the staff in the hotel, they were at all times friendly, curtious and helpful. The room in the hotel was a good size - granted it was an upgrade, I have a feeling that the 'normal' rooms may have been a little tight but it is a city centre hotel in fairness. The shower was good however the WC was in a separate room to the WHB and bath/shower but it did not bother us. On the Friday night we went for food and drinks and when we got back to the hotel the concierge offered us a night cap - must appreciated!! He was very friendly, gave us advise on the best things to do in the city and when I forgot my coat, he brought it straight up to my room.

The bedroom was ample big enough with a flat screen TV and comfy bed. The living area had a desk, TV and sofa bed in. Ideal for a quick chill out between day and night-time exploration of the city. Not sure if it goes throughout the hotel but we had free Wi-Fi access in the room. The rooms were wonderfully clean and the hotel oozes original Parisien features - so much nicer than staying in a sterile chain hotel. The staff are great - were very helpful in guiding us to buy museum passes, show bookings etc. Their English is excellent but they did indulge us as we tried to speak French. I had forewarned them that I had booked as a surprise for my husband's birthday and on arrival there was a complimentary bottle of Champagne in the room, a really lovely gesture. And they even wished him happy birthday as we set out for an evening out. We didn't have breakfast there. It's 12 euros each for continental and there are LOTS of small cafes and croissanteries within a 100 yard radius where you can enjoy the same for half the price whilst watching the world (and crazy traffic) go by. The location is brilliant - it's a 2 minute walk to the Metro (Charles de Gaulle de Etoile) and the Arc de Triomphe. You can see the Eiffel Tower from the top of the street. We were there when France and Algeria got through their stages at the football - the Arc was crazy with hundreds, if not thousands, of fans singing, letting off fireworks etc. and the traffic was grid-locked. We made an early retreat from the city that night and enjoyed a bottle of wine in the room. The double glazing is superb - once the windows were closed you wouldn't have known what was going on a hundred yards away. A couple of money-saving tips - at the top of the street on the opposite side of Ave Wagram is a wine shop - lots of choice starting at 3 euros a bottle so if you're on a budget or don't want to shell out hotel/ bar prices (20-30 euros for run of the mill wine) then pay a visit here. Check out the \"Formules\" at the restaurants and bars, especially at lunchtime. You can get a 2 or 3 course meal for 10-20 euros per person. Don't bother with taxis or transfer coaches - you can buy a ticket for the train & metro to get you to the hotel for 8.5 euros. The ticket machines at the airports take cards and are easy to use or you can queue for the ticket office. Take the train from CDG on RER B (blue line), change at Chatelet for the metro and the hotel is 2 minutes from the metro station, exit 4 - Av. Wagram Looking at the traffic, especially around the Arc & Champs-Ellyses it's probably much quicker too. if you're going to check out more than 3 or 4 main sights then consider getting a museum pass which can be bought in the FNAC department store- the hotel staff will give you directions. It gives you access to most of the main monuments and museums (louvre, musee d'orsay, musee de rodin, arc de triomphe, notre dame crypts, egouts de paris etc.) and stops you having to queue for tickets at most places.

My single bed was very comfortable and I enjoyed a good night's sleep --except when my feet ached from too much sightseeing. The shower was a bit small but I quickly got used to it, especially because the bathroom itself was very clean, comfortable and newly remodeled, with a built-in hairdryer, razor good plumbing and good water-pressure.

The breakfast was also top notch, providing a non-fuss high quality buffett. Location was also extremly convient, as it was away from the more central hustle and bustle of Paris city centre so quiet at nights and being within walking distance of the metro which provided easy access to the Effiel Tower and Louvre. I would fully recomend this hotel to couples looking for a quiet get-away. I would like to thank all the staff and management for their hospitality during our stay", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Parisian hideaway\u201d", "Author": "Jaypsea", "ReviewID": "UR23207435", "Content": "Unless you're blessed with an exceptionally large wallet you shouldn't go to Paris and expect very large, modern and quiet hotel rooms in the 'right area'.

Upon arrival into the beautifully appointed lobby area, we were greeted by a charming and friendly receptionist. This theme continued throughout our stay, and the male receptionist who was on late at night was especially helpful - he helped us find a restaurant and then checked us in for our flight home on his computer. What service! Our room was small and cosy, but we were not in Paris to sit around in a hotel anyway, so it was ideal. The decor was modern, the room clean and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size, and was also very clean. The shower was worth particulate mention, as it was very powerful and the water was very hot. Breakfast was expensive at \u20ac12 for a simple buffet, so we didn't sample that - there are plenty of cafes and other places to get a bite nearby. The location in general is excellent, being just a short walk from the Charles de Gaulle-Etoile Metro & RER station, which is under the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is down a quiet side street off Ave de Wagram, so there is little road noise and what little noise there is outside is kept out by the double-glazed windows. One local tip we would give is to try the bistro \"Le Hide\" (www.lehide.fr) just around the corner on Rue du General Lanrezac. We had 2 courses each and 50cl of vin blanc for \u20ac66, and it was one of the best meals we've had. Like the hotel, the bistro is something of a hidden gem.

What we were looking for was something reasonably priced, but as we were only there from Friday to Monday was ideally located for the sights, open top tour bus stop, easy eats, and offered a straightforward way of getting to Disneyland Paris and Gare du Nord. This hotel ticked all the boxes. Just a hundred or so yards from an exit of Charles de Gaulles Etoile station this provided us with a minimum of fuss at the start and end of our days. (Buy a Paris Visite ticket before you go to give you full access to central Paris transport). Booking directly with the hotel via e-mail was so easy - immediate replies to questions and to the booking. When we arrived it was obvious why - there was always a member of staff around the reception desk ready to say hello or to wish you a nice day, or to answer any questions you might have. One thing stuck in my mind - a small thing perhaps, but underlined the care that the staff of this small hotel takes. All tables were busy for breakfast one morning, so we waited around the corner in the reception area. Every couple of minutes the receptionist popped round to check if a table had become free, until shortly they showed us to a free table. This attention really makes a difference - we felt welcome throughout our stay. The hotel is situated near the Champs Elysees and a couple of hundred yards away from the Arc de Triomphe. Walk 50 yards up the street and you can see the Arc and the Eiffel Tower sits in the distance. Open top bus tours (we went for L'Open Tour and weren't disappointed) stop within a few hundred yards. Disneyland Paris is 45 minutes away on the RER that runs directly from Charles de Gaulle Etoile station, so catch that 1 hour before park opening and you'll be knocking on the door of the park at just the right time. Be aware that you will need to ensure you have tickets for the right zones to get to Disney. We bought 1-3 Paris Visite tickets and separate tickets to get to Disney. (We used www.allofrance.co.uk for our tickets so that we didn't waste time when we got there). The rooms we stayed in were small but clean. I was particularly pleased with the bathroom. During our stay I didn't once find anything I could fault regarding the cleanliness. Breakfast, as already mentioned, was simple and at \u20ac12 a little expensive but spend a little time over your muesli and yoghurt, croissants, bread, cheese and meats, fruit and coffees while deciding on your plan for the day and it was wholly worthwhile. Across the side street was a sandwich shop that made sandwiches and salads to order, and McDonalds was 50 yards away from the hotel - one night we took it back to our room as we didn't have the energy to dine out. The Italian restaurant at the end of the road and across the street was very good, and because of the location there were many other eateries to choose from. All in all, I left with the satisfaction that I had managed to pick out a winning hotel from the many, many hotels on offer in Paris. Suffice to say that a similar trip in years to come will be much easier as I'll simply book again!

We had no problems with anything therefore had relatively few dealings with them, but they were always extremely friendly and welcoming. Breakfast isn't included in the room price but serves the best cup of tea in Paris (and believe us we've had some horrors in other hotels). Criticisms?

Rooms smallish by North American standard but excellent by Paris standard !! Furnishing simple but adequate. Bed very comfortable. Nice spacious bathroom with good water pressure. No tea/coffee in room but they provided us with a kettle. Minibar expensive as usual. We kept milk in the fridge for our children and no one objected. Location is superb. It took us 20 minutes and 13 euros by taxi from Gare-du-Nord, travelling on a Saturday afternoon. CDG Etoile is 5 minutes walk. 47 minutes to Disneyland by RER. Jardin d'Acclimatation was just 20 minutes walk and we had much more fun there compared to the sugar coated commercialism of Disneyland. Strongly recommended if you have young children. Breakfast slightly pricey and we ate for first two days only. Plenty of eateries within easy reach including McDonald, Quick and Hippopotamus . There is a branch of Monoprix supermarket very close for grocery and other stuff. All the staff were very friendly with special thanks to Aurelle and Yohann. My only gripe is that soundproofing is less than satisfactory and on the first night my sleep was badly affected by 2 little girls running in the corridoor between 2 rooms. This restarted again next night around midnight and this time I had to speak to their guardians politely but firmly and thankfully it stopped. The familes moved away subsequently and I had reasonably peaceful nights afterwards although we could hear our upstairs neighbours from time to time.

We were very pleased with our 6-night stay at Royal Magda Etoile Hotel during the last week of June. Sidebar: We took the Air France bus shuttle from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Arc de Triomphe. Extremely rough baggage handling by Air France shuttle bus staff, resulted in the zipper of our suitcase being badly damaged, despite the suitcase being in perfect condition after overnight travel from Toronto, Canada, to Paris, with stopovers in Montreal, Munich and Rome, on various airlines. This damage rendered the suitcase not being able to be properly closed, as the slider was completely removed from the teeth of zipper. While this may not seem like the end of the world to readers, this was not a good start to our trip, given that we were traveling elsewhere in Europe, the week following. The hotel is a very short walk from Air France bus shuttle stop. We were greeted at reception desk by Yohan, who was very helpful. Upon learning about our misfortune, he summoned help to repair the zipper on our suitcase. Sassy (hotel maintenance) immediately repaired the zipper, in the area right beside the lobby. One would never have known that it was ever broken. When offered a small token of our appreciation, Sassy very graciously declined, saying it was his pleasure to help. The hotel\u2019s owner, Mr. Destouches, happened to be in the lobby at the time, so we made sure that Sassy\u2019s service was duly recognized. Upon our insistence, Sassy very reluctantly accepted our envelope. As well, I had brought my laptop on our trip. Without hesitation, Yohan offered to lend an Internet cable and voltage converter for our entire stay. From the time of our arrival at the hotel, to after check-in, the staff at this hotel, turned our unfortunate start (though not related to the hotel whatsoever), into a positive. For this, we were thankful. Other staff (Juliet, head housekeeper) was helpful. Soukri, at reception in evening, always welcomed us with a warm smile and conversation at the end of our busy day. The location of this hotel is ideal. Everything is within a very short walking distance - Metro station, from which one can travel virtually everywhere in Paris; Arc de Triomphe; restaurants; caf\u00e9s; retail, convenience and grocery stores; and coin laundry (thanks for the local map and directions, Yohan). Our room was small (which we knew beforehand from reading reviews), but a great value. It was tastefully decorated and modern, in very good condition, very clean, and air conditioning worked. Our bed was comfortable. The desk allowed for use of our laptop, and free in-room Internet connection worked perfectly. We bought an international phone card externally, and used the in room phone, which worked well to make calls to Canada. We made good use of in-room safe, as well.

I believe that all the suites face the rear courtyard which is quiter. The hotel and rooms were very clean and nicely renovated. The bathrooms were very nice. There is a small elevator to bring up the suitcases when checking in or checking out. Otherwise we used the stairs. As is common to most Paris hotels in this category, the walls are thin. We expected this and came prepared with earplugs. Without earplugs, we were able to hear people talking in other rooms and doors opening and closing in the hallways late into the night. With earplugs it was no problem at all. We definitely recommend bringing earplugs. The front desk staff were all very helpful and pleasant. They all spoke excellent english, and did not seem to mind speaking english instead of french. \"Lily\" was especially nice to us, and made us feel very welcome. She gave us good information regarding which restaurants in the area were good with children, and the location of grocery stores. She provided us with a kettle, cups, plates, and some utensils, so we were able to make instant coffee and tea in the rooms, and prepare snacks for the kids. They allowed us to use the fridge to hold our own drinks and food, rather than using it as a minibar. This made the hotel much more functional for us. We were able to bring in breakfast and save a lot of money. Instead we spent money on eating out for dinner. The location of the hotel was very good. It was a very close walk to Arc de Triomphe and the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Metro Station (Wagram exit). It was also a very short walk to the Air France shuttle stop on Ave Carnot, which took us to CDG Airport at the end of our stay. You can take this shuttle irrespective of what airline you are flying with. The streets in the area seem pretty safe, although it is important to use common sense. We did see some homeless people on Ave de Wagram, as well as youth hanging out into the night. Pickpockets are present in most tourist areas, so consider using a money belt and avoid taking out your wallet on streets and metro.

The hotel is a good choice as long as you understand that in Paris, price tends to be determined by size. Your first clue to the dimensions of your room should be the elevator, which is big enough for one person plus a suitcase OR 2 people.

Everything in the room is fine; the bed was decent, the bathroom was tiny but modern and clean, and there was a flat-screen TV and even a mini-bar. However, for most Americans, the size of the room is about what you would expect from a walk-in closet, so if you are a large person you may be in for some severe claustrophobia.

It was eventually working by the third (& last night). If this is an issue for you, before you book check with the hotel that the air conditioning is fully operational. The second point is more concerning. I was travelling with my two children (aged 14 & 8 years) & we were therefore in bed by 10.30pm. However most other residents were getting ready to go out at that time & were returning to the hotel between midnight & 3am. I know because I could hear every last noise they made. The hotel does not appear to have considered sound insulation whilst refurbishing the property. Consequently you hear every door being slammed shut & double-locked, footsteps above you sound like a herd of elephants and- believe me- you can hear just about everything when an adjacent bathroom is being used.......& I mean everything!!!

It is the little touches like this that make all the difference. The hotel, although quite small, was immaculate, and the rooms were spotless. All the staff were friendly and were always there to assist if needs be. The location was even better than we were led to believe, with the Arc De Triomphe on the doorstep along with all manner of shops, bars and restaurants. We also spent a day at Disney, and were very fortunate to also find that the metro stop by the hotel is a direct line to the park (about 40 minutes) but makes it extremely easy to get there and back if you are heading up that way. Paris is a great city to walk round, and the Eiffel Tower is around 35/40 minutes walk away, and the Louvre around 50 minutes straight down the Champs D'elysees. All in all, we can thoroughly recommended this hotel and would definitely stay there when we next venture into Paris. Although eating and drinking is often very expensive in the city, the Eurostar return trip via Ebbsfleet only cost \u00a359 per couple with a promotion, so there is really no excuse not to explore this great place!", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location!!

Though I could imagine the room could be a bit cozy for two people. The rooms were very clean - but unfortunately no view except into the inner courtyard.

The young man couldn't have been more unfriendly. If he ever smiled I was never to see it during my stay - and he certainly made a guest feel that they were a nuisance. I had hoped he was just working weekends but my heart sank when I saw his face at the desk. He was most unhelpful about nice bistros in the area and you could feel his impatience in having to answer questions. Fortunately, he was joined a few days later by Eualie (I hope I got her name right she deserves it) who is extremely friendly and helpful. Her colleagues at night were also lovely and friendly - one man from Morocco (who was on most of my stay) and the other from Algiers. They wre happy to chat and be helpful.

First off, our room had a lingering smoked-in smell that lasted for the first 2-3 days of our week-long stay. Hotel staff were inconsistent in service attitude and certainly not as friendly as one might expect in such an intimate setting. One dark-haired youth veered on rude in his attitude, even though we were just asking about the most mundane question (directions for this one restaurant) and the encounter was unpleasant enough that I studiously avoided him for the rest of the stay. My advice is to only ask reception questions when there was either a girl on duty (she was super friendly and that *almost* but not quite made up for the insolent rude young guy) and a middle-aged gentlemen.

We booked it after reading the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor, thinking it would be an impeccable experience. The many 5.0 ratings are convincing, yet a bit misleading. First off, the location is truly terrific. Having been to Paris many times, I can attest to the fact that the Magda Etoile is in a great location to see the city. It is around the corner form the 1 line, which crosses Paris horizontally and takes you pretty much everywhere. The stop is called Charles de Gaulle-Etoile. From the hotel it's about a minute on foot. Now for the buts... The hotel is small, one could say intimate, and rooms are not very large. They are very very clean, but our room had clearly been smoked in. The smoke smell was quite intense and if you're very sensitive, you'd be mad, I guarantee it. The bath towels we used after showering, upon arrival, smelled strongly of smoke. I called reception and we received new ones, but I will admit that it skeeved us out that we had the previous guests bath towels on the shelf... he/she didn't use them, but still... Then, the front desk. The girls were great, helpful and pleasant. But one scraggly, skinny dude we asked to make a reservation for us couldn't have been more arrogant. When we asked him to call a well-known restaurant to see if we could get a table, he insisted it was a \"chain\" and that there was another one nearby, which we should just walk to. I knew for a fact that wasn't the case, so when I asked him to find the one I meant in St. Germain, he asked if I had the telephone number...like as in \"call them yourself\". I said i could look it up online, but that I was hoping he could make the call, since my French is rudimentary and sometimes it helps when a hotel calls. He sighed...he made me wait...then he said he would call back...and didn't. When my husband went downstairs and asked him, he seemed put out and said he hadn't had \"time yet\" to find the number, along with the roll of the eye. In short, he was a jerk. It kind of colored our view of the rest of the staff, perhaps unfairly. The breakfast was ok, but at 12 euros per person not exactly good.

In the bathroom there is no screen or curtain to prevent water splashing on the ground surface. It was no problem for my disabled wife when she took a bath, but when I took a shower, standing upright, I could not prevent that a lot of water came on the ground surface. 2.

After eating lunch at The Jules Verne (Eiffel Tower) we popped in here for an \"easy\" dinner, it was in fact one of our best meals we had in all our travels (ouch!), a very good Chinese. The ladies and gentlemen at reception, all very helpful and professional. All very sweet to our girls. A calming influence on the whole hotel. The most amazing thing that I was delighted with, after being to Paris a handful of times prior. The Magda was quiet at night. Silent. One night some teenagers left there window open and were chatting......the noise did travel, but they were soon told to close their window and make good use of the A/C. I rated this hotel with the full five stars, because I found absolutely no fault in it. I thought it was a steal at the cost, a terrific find (thanks to Trip advisor), a perfect solution to enjoying Paris to it fullest!

I booked this hotel because of all the positive reviews I read on Tripadvisor but my experience has left me somewh\\t perplexed! Yes the hotel is spotlessly clean and the location is perfect but the Reception Staff ( Flore in particular) could not have been more unfriendly and unhelpful. The cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very friendly and polite and the gentleman on the reception desk at night was very helpful and obliging. The first problem arose when I asked Flore if she could suggest a restauramnt in the Pont Neuf area as we were gong on the Seine Cruise that evening and it departed from that area. I was amazed when her answer was \"no\" she did not know any restaurants in that area! Normally we would check out the net for restaurants but because I was led to believe that she was so helpful to other guests I decided to ask her. We eventually found our own restautant on the net! When we returned that evening I asked Flore if I could take a jug of iced water up to our room. She replied by asking me if I knew there was water in the minibar. Yes I did know but it was a jug of fresh water that I wanted and not bottled water as we had been drinking fresh water in the restaurants since we arrive. She returned with a litre bottle of water and said she would put it on our bill! She kept to her word and we were charged 3Euro on check out! The following evening I asked the night porter for the same jug of iced water and he duly obliged without hesitation! We are not loud or demanding customers and therefore I could not understand the indifference which we experienced. I have never felt so unwelcome in a hotel before and unfortunately although Paris was wonderful this experience has somewhat spoilt the memory. I was very angry when I returned home to discover my daughters were equally upset at our experience as they had arranged the trip for us to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had emailed the hotel to tell them this and to ask them if they could ensure that the trip was a good one. They recieved a reply from Yohan stating that they looked forward to welcoming us and would do their best to make our stay a pleasent one!!!!!! I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone in the future and when I return to Paris I am positive I will find an equally clean hotel with an equally good location but with a welcome! Just a few suggestions for anyone travelling to Paris. If you are taking a Seine Cruise the Vedettes du Pont Neuf are excellent and very good value. Two really good restaurants are Chez Clement (a chain of about 12 restaurants in various areas in Paris. We went twice to the one on the Champs Elysses and found excellend value and great food and if using the open top bus the Bus Rouge is great but the Open Bus (yellow one) is a bit dearer but stops in more places of interest to let passengers off.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "tfitzp", "ReviewID": "UR8240521", "Content": "Like most other people on this site, we booked this hotel on the strength of the comments made by previous travellers - and like them were very happy with the choice we made.

We stayed at the Magda Etoile based upon Tripadvisor reviews. We have been to Paris two other times, staying at the Relais Christine, and the Lutetia. I must say right off that I was a little disappointed after the 'rave' reviews on Tripadvisor. The Royal Magda is indeed a very nice Hotel, but it is not a \"top ten', or even 'top 20' hotel, unless you are a budget traveller. The rooms were very nice, and the bathrooms suitably large by European standards. The location is excellent, with many small typically Parisian restaurants nearby, and of course proximity to the Metro a great 'plus'. The 'service staff', particularly the cleaning crew, and the Breakfast staff are the nicest and most enthusiastic that I have ever met, in my many travels. However, the front desk is a 'hit and miss'. We had some issues with our daughters room, including a 'toilette' red light that blinked off and on every 2 seconds or so. This not only produced a noticeable light effect, (seen through the bedroom window), but also was responisble for a 'clicking' noise. When we brought this to the attention of the 'female' concierge, we were told to 'just close the door'. This was not an acceptable solution. In addition, when the in-room safe was not working, when brought to the attention of the same female concierge, on 2 separate days, nothing was done to fix the problem. It required a more 'forceful' interaction on the day prior to our departure to get a response. Having said this, all of the other individuals we encountered were more than helpful, and very nice.

We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, however, we enjoyed having their coffee in the morning for 3.5euros when we get up in the early morning (jetlag) as we realized most local restaurants are closed until 8~9am. Their coffee is more \"American\" style with generous portion as compared to all other hotels/restaurants we've visited during our entire trip. The coffee that we had in our room was served in a tray with a cup and a single-serving pot that was nice and hot. One day, we left our room around 8am for breakfast across the street and returned a little before 9am. As we walk toward our room, we noticed our door was open for room cleaning. Since we needed to get ready for our plan for the day, we were going to ask her to leave the room as is, but she said the room is already cleaned and she was just getting ready to leave. As we went inside the room, I could not believe how efficiently she had cleaned and organized the room! I mean, when we left, our room was a complete mess - shoes, socks, shirts, books, coins, sunglasses, candy wraps all over the place - as we were going to clean up ourselves after coming back from our breakfast. She managed to fold our clothes, stack books, arrange shoes, neatly put sunglasses and coins on the table, etc. As embarassing as it was, she did an amazing job and we were extremely impressed. In-room refrigerator was very convenient. We put some cheese and wine that we had bought from the nearby supermarket. The available English TV channels were CNN International and BBC World, but six other hotels we stayed during our France trip had only CNN if any, and it really didn't matter to us anyway because after a long day of exploring, we were dead tired and went to bed early right after coming back from dinner. Overall, we enjoyed staying at Royal Magda Etoile and definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for affordable, friendly , English-fluent hotel with convenient Metro access .", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Region of Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Canadianseh101", "ReviewID": "UR7817793", "Content": "We stayed at the Royal Magda for 3 nights at the beginning of June and I must say it was even better than I had expected.

I have to be honest...when I read all of the wonderful reviews, I thought this would be one of the best hotels in Europe. Having stayed there, it is a great value, but nothing to write home about. I'm still scratching my head that the Royal Magda won a \"Traveler's Choice\" award. Rooms: We switched rooms midway through the stay, to get a higher, quieter room. The street noise from the first floor is definitely noticeable, and the hotel is very old - you will know exactly when the folks above you are up and about. The rooms were small, as we expected, and there was a very heavy smell of smoke. (Not a big surprise in Paris) The bathroom was very clean, yet the shower had a door that only extended 1/2 way, so the bathroom kept getting soaked. Not a big deal, just not expected in such a highly rated hotel. Location: Fantastic. Two blocks from the Charles de Gaulle Etoile station, on the metro. A stone's throw from the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe. This was the best feature of the hotel, in our opinion. Customer Service: Johan and Flor were very friendly and accommodating. The night desk clerk was somewhat pushy and unfriendly. We wanted directions to a laundrette, and all he'd tell us was how to use their (expensive) cleaning service. Extras: We opted out of the 12 euro/day breakfast, as there were way to many brasseries in the local area. The lift was small, but worked great when lugging us up to the fifth floor. Oh, and the TV carried two English stations: BBC and CNN. It would've been great to have a non-news English station, for winding down at bedtime. Finally, I noticed in many of the other reviews for the Royal Magda, the reviewers had been given a free upgrade to a Junior Suite. I'm almost curious if this didn't skew the reviews, slightly. We weren't upgraded, so maybe our experience was a bit different than others. I'd recommend the Royal Magda for budget travelers looking for a clean hotel for a good price. I just can't give this hotel the rave reviews that everyone else has.

Our journey began in Atlanta with a flight to Paris through Boston. We arrived in Paris after a cramped Air France flight where I wore the seat in front of me in my lap for six hours. Exhausted, we arrived at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. and was advised (not surprisingly) that our junior suite was not ready. I asked if we could leave our bags at the desk while we wait for the room. To our delight, Flore upgraded us to a suite and checked us in immediately. We went to sleep until noon and then had a full restful day in Paris. Without this gesture, we would have been tired throughout the day. A class act from this hotel. The hotel is absolutely spotless - not a crumb any place we looked. The furnishings are nice and comfortable. The bathroom and shower were great and I only made a tiny mess. The location is a quick walk from the AirFrance Bus stop and a stone's throw from the Arc de Triumphe. The hotel arranged dinner reservations for us at Cafe de L'Homme with a great view of the Eiffel tower at dusk. Outside the restaurant is the absolute best view of the Eiffel Tower. How about some Travelduck (Le Travelduck) tips for you? 1. Take the AirFrance Bus from CDG to the Arc de Triumphe stop. I suggest you 'Google Earth' the hotel location. You will see the AirFrance buses and know your exact route to the hotel from the bus. Follow that tip and you will not get lost. If you are flying Delta from Atlanta or Boston, the bus stop at CDG is right outside baggage claim. Cost is 20 euro rt per person. 2. Cafe de L'Homme was great but not all tables have an Eiffel Tower view. It was raining so we could not sit outside and there are only about 2-3 tables right near the window. I guess my wife and I were not chic enough to get one of those tables but it was still a great dinner. 3. Take the boat rides down the Seine River - save some walking and enjoy the ride. 4. Get to the Eiffel Tower very early (like 8:30 a.m.) if you want to go to the top. Lines are very long! 5. Enjoy a nice crepe during your stay in Paris. Be careful because the crepes are very hot when handed to you. The rude guy making my crepe (he told me to zip it after I repeated my order) shoved the crepe in my hand and made me spill my coffee. I left it there (bad duck). 6. If you have a five hour layover in chilly Boston (like us), do not drag your wife all over the city searching for a crabcake sandwich. It will make a rough start to your trip - lucky we were going to Paris which ended the bad mood quick! Have a great stay at the Royal Magda and in Paris. I highly recommend it.

Firstly, it is in a wonderful spot - very close to the metro and you could throw a 'euro' and hit 'The Arc'. Of course it is very, very, very touristy....but then we were tourists after all..although sometimes I had difficulty finding a french person amongst the throngs of Americans and Japanese...could be a turn-off to some. The staff were lovely - so helpful, the rooms were lovely and well-appointed(and not a bad size - I've had smaller in New York). The breakfast was also worth it - for us anyway. Yes 12 euro sounds alot (we had to convert to Australian dollars - so it is a PAINFUL process) but it was worth every cent...my husband putaway 3 coffees, cereal and 4-5 pastries every morning which would have set us back alot more than 12 euros on the street. The breakie is on until midday (and they don't seem to mind if you slip back later in the morning for another cup of coffee) and they will deliver it to your room if so desired. My only criticism (and it is a bit sad) is that the only english speaking channel was CBS (or some other American cable news program) - they had 2 great movie channels.. dubbed into French. Just one movie channel - even with subtitles would've been nice.

It also doesn't hurt that when you emerge from the metro station the first thing you see is the Arc du Triomphe! Very nice. One complaint that I have is that one of the staff talked us out of going to the Moulin Rouge in favour of the Lido. The Lido show was absolutely terrible - I've subsequently heard that the Moulin Rouge is much better - and we couldn't help but wonder if the recommendation was based on pocketing a larger \"referral fee\" from Lido when she booked our tickets. It was a fairly big issue to us, because the Lido show cost us 200 Euros, for an embarrasingly amaturish and tedious evening. We expected better advice from the hotel staff.

Our time in Paris would have not been half as amazing had it not been for the marvellous service we received in the hotel. Johan was beyond helpful and got us a table in a wonderful restaurant overlooking the Seineand Eiffel Tower, when we stepped out of the taxi Johan had called for us we were beneath the Eiffel Tower that was sparkling with lights and lasers, it truly took our breath away and we would never have known to go here or been able to get a table ourselves. Johan offered to get tickets for a show but we didn't have long in Paris and they were quite expensive so we decided to leave it for another time. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. This isn't a super trendy stylish hotel but it's was perfect for our intimate weekend away. Breakfast was lovely,not a bacon and eggs type affair but most importantly for me good quality coffee served in nice pots and a selection of cheeses, pastries, cereal and dried fruit/yogurt. We only ate breakfast in the hotel but when we came home from our meal we had cocktails in the bar with snacks and talked to the lovely night concierge who made our drinks and was really friendly and interesting. Much to our embarassment and inspite of the fact I studied French til A-Level and was once quite good at it we were beyond appauling when it came to speaking French, thankfully we were put to shame by the impeccable English spoken by Johan and his colleague on the night shift and pretty much every person we came into contact with. Nobody lived up to the snooty Parisian stereotype we were so hoping not to encounter on our first venture over the Channel. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe and we found the location to be ideal for getting to pretty much everywhere by foot, we only needed transport to and from the airport and for me in my stilettos on our big night out, other than that we walked everywhere. Our return flight was not until late in the evening and we were able to leave our luggage safe all day whilst we saw more of Paris which was a weight off our minds and shoulders. We both agreed that the service we received was without a doubt the best, and most personalised service we have ever received in a hotel. Without Johan's advice and help we could have ended up having a very different experience so we really do owe the success of our trip to him as he made my partner's birthday such a memorable one in many ways.

The room itself was reasonably sized (it was one of the larger rooms) with a decent bathroom. Desk, table and a few chairs, along with aircon. Bathroom had a shower in a bathtub. Minibar prices reasonable compared to those in bars and restaurants (shocking!). I am docking one star though because there was intermittent machinery noise (lift or boiler?) throughout the night at the back of the hotel. This was not especially loud but, as I a light sleeper, I had to buy earplugs after the first night. There were no other disturbances.

I had never used Trip Advisor before and based on the reviews I read, I canceled reservations at another hotel and booked 2 rooms at the Royal Magda. I'm so glad that I did! This hotel is a gem and is wonderfully located. We were able to walk everywhere. This was very nice considering the logistics of traveling with 6 people, 4 being teenagers. Even a taxi ride is not as simple as it seems. The hotel is exactly as described. Very clean, comfortable and well appointed. The rooms we had were a 2 room suite with a double bed, a dresser, 2 nightstands and a flat screen television on the wall in one room. The second room of this suite had a fold out sofa, a table, 2 chairs, desk and chair, mini fridge, television and a closet area. The bathroom was large enough with plenty of towels, a robe and VERY GOOD water pressure. The 2nd room was a double with two twin beds, a closet area, desk and chair, flat screen television and two nightstands. The bathroom was smaller but very nice and appointed just the same as the other. Like I said, there were 6 of us, we had 7 larger suitcases and we all fit quite well into the rooms. The walls are indeed thin as everyone mentioned in the reviews, so we were happy to be on the end of a wing. I was worried the kids would be too loud for the other guests. I hope they were not. We were there from Dec 22 - 25. When we returned to our rooms on the evening of the 24th, we found a Christmas card signed by all of the staff and a gift in each room.

We stayed from the day after Christmas until New Year's Eve and enjoyed every minute. We just really cannot say enough about their incredibly gracious staff, especially Kais and the darling little blond girl at the front desk. Everyone, down to the cleaning staff, were incredibly friendly and helpful and I certainly hope the management recognizes what gems they have in their staff! We arrived well before check-in time, but our rooms were available and ready to be occupied, this was such a treat considering the long overnight flight we had just arrived from. The location is outstanding, so convenient to the Metro, restaurants, shopping, the Arc... it goes on and on! We found the continental breakfast to be the perfect start to our day, and although many commented on the price, we found it worth the convenience. It's also nice they serve breakfast until noon. The staff in the dining room were wonderful. We also enjoyed late night drinks in the comfortable chairs in the lobby (Merci, Kais!) after we returned from dinner on several evenings. The rooms were spotless, and the cleaning staff did a fabulous job, even straightening up our luggage and kid's various odds and ends they had left around the room. We had a suite, which was more than spacious (and we are Americans who are used to LARGE rooms) for our family of four (kids ages 7 and 12), my mother and brother and his wife each had standard double rooms. Only smaill inconvenience was the occasional disco music from the restaurant next door on a couple of evenings that disturbed my mother and brother, who had rooms adjacent to their walls. Nothing too terrible, and didn't go on too late into the night. They also arranged a car to take us back to the airport, and he was terrific! When he couldn't pull right up to the curb because of so much traffic, he parked in the garage, took all our luggage in for us (7 bags, plus some!) and made sure he got us directly to the correct check-in area. All in all, a terrific experience and we will recommend you to all!!! Thank you so much for helping to make this such a wonderful memory for our family!

The excellent service began before our arrival,with Yohan confirming our booking and also helping out with information about getting there, local attractions and eating out. The hotel was easy to get to as it is very near to the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Yohan suggested taking the AirFrance bus from CDG airport instead of the Metro as it avoids having to change stations whilst carting luggage around. We took his advice both ways! The front of the hotel is probably the best looking out of all the buildings on this side street and the reception area of the hotel is very pleasant. The double room we booked was suprisingly large, very quiet and clean. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but again, it was very clean with modern decor. The toilet was separate and again rather small but adequate. The only staff we encountered were Yohan and the gentleman on reception in the evening (we never got his name!). Both spoke excellent english and were very helpful. On the first evening we were directed to a great brasserie a couple of streets away on Ave. De La Grande Armee (the SCS La Grande Armee). Although it may seem a bit pricey to some at 100 euros for two people, the meals were great. As a side note, if you plan to go to this brasserie, brush up on your french food as we had a bit of difficulty with the menu! On the subject of food, the hotel does do meals as there is a menu in the room, although we never did get to try it. We found breakfasts to be adequate for self service Continental style fayre. There was a nice touch on Christmas Day when we arrived back at the hotel to find a Christmas card and chocolates from the staff. Also, Yohan was very helpful in keeping our luggage for a few hours after we checked out as we had some time to kill whilst waiting for our flight. Overall, our experience of this hotel has been one of a pleasant surprise. We didn't quite know what to expect with various tales of small rooms being the norm in Paris. We actually downgraded from a four star hotel to this three star hotel after finding all the positive reviews from TripAdvisor. One of the key benefits is the location, being very close to the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs de Elysees (for big name shops such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier, and D&G) and a metro station only 5 minutes away. We will definitely come here again!

A basic selection, but items are fresh. - The room was nicely sized and clean. Our room overlooked the street. Noise was not a problem except for the trash truck in the morning one time during the week. There is a theatre across the street, but the noise was not excessive. Actually, you may find a little more noise from your neighbors as the walls seem to be a little thin. - The shower was prone to leaking on the floor if you angled the spout a bit high. The soap is rather small so we ended up buying some at L'Occitane nearby. Bathroom lacks a facecloth. - There are 2 supermarkets nearby. A small one just around the corner at the end of the street and a bit more upscale one (Monoprix) at the next square. - No alarm clock in the room. - Safebox in the room. - Yes, the elevator is small and new. Just enough for two people. - We used a shared shuttle van to the airport (42E for two people). Professional and door to door service. Airport Connection is the name of the company. - Reasonable selection of restaurants nearby. There are 2 safety items that i was a little concerned about. - Lack of fire detector in the room. All other areas seemed to have detectors and fire safety equipment. - The door does not lock automatically upon entry or exit. In fact, you need to lock yourself in the room. In an emergency, it might be difficult to find your key and then get the door unlocked. You will find there are two doors to the room. The inner one does not lock. Whenever we were in the room, we left our key in the door. Overall, i enjoyed my stay in this hotel and would recommend it without hesitation. Service and location are two key points of this hotel.

He also upgraded us at no extra cost to a Junior Suite room which we found to be very nice, clean and spacious.

Breakfast was an additional 12 Euros per person but we preferred to venture out to find small cafes for breakfast instead, purely because we wanted to get out of the hotel quickly in the mornings to do our sightseeing.
