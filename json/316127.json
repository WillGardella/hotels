We enjoyed visits to the Yacht Club and Beach Club across the lake from the Boardwalk. I would encourage any reader who is thinking of visiting WDW to stay at this fine hotel.

The room was very nice. We enjoyed the beach cottage theme and the layout of the villa was interesting and functional. The room featured a small kitchen, living room, bedroom and a large bathroom with a shower, toilet and sink in one room and a separate whirlpool bath, walk-in closet and vanity in another. You could even open some shutters and watch the bedroom TV while soaking, something my kids thought was a great novelty. We also found the room to be clean and well kept. The only exception was the two pretzel sticks we found when we pulled out the couch to recover an item that fell behind. The resort itself was great. The main pool had a circus theme with a huge water slide shaped like an old roller coaster and poolside bar that looked like a carousel. There was also a \"community center\" with games for the kids. On the Boardwalk you find a variety of restaurants, shops and activities. One of my main complaints about Walt Disney World is the sheer size of the place. This makes transportation around the various parks and attractions an important consideration. The Epcot resorts (including the Boardwalk, Beach Club, Yacht Club, Swan and Dolphin) all share a great central location. Epcot was a short walk, Hollywood a short boat ride and it was only a quick bus trip to most everywhere else with the exception of the Magic Kingdom which was best reached by catching the Monorail from Epcot (on the opposite side of the park). Service at the hotel was as excellent. Help was there whenever you needed it without being under foot. To be fair however, our trip went so smoothly we never really put them to the test. If I was disappointed with any aspect of our stay it was the food. We had hoped that with all of the choices around the resort we could find something better than mass produced theme park dining. Perhaps, if we had been on the ball enough to book reservations weeks in advance (and spent upwards of $70 a plate), we could have, but by the time we were there our choices were limited.

As the Magic Express bus drives you up to the property the Boardwalk opens up before you. They did a wonderful job of creating the feel of a turn-of-the-century Atlantic City or Coney Island. The entrance and lobby are gorgeous - be sure to look up when you enter the hotel lobby and check out the amazing carousel-themed lighting fixture. We were all incredibly pleased with our room. Having a kitchen and washer and dryer was a great benefit. We have stayed at the budget Disney properties in the past and weren't used to having these amenities. Now that we've experienced the joys of in-room laundry and being able to prepare quick meals in our room, as well as to make a morning pot of coffee before you even jump in the shower I don't know if we will be able to go back to staying at the budget hotels again! We loved all of the evening entertainment on the Boardwalk, as well as having the option of having a quiet pool in addition to the main pool. But our favorite feature was how quickly we could walk to Epcot from the Boardwalk. As other reviews stated, Epcot is about a 5 minute walk away, and Hollywood Studios is about a 10-15 minute walk. You can also hop on a boat to get to either park, which will take more time but comes in handy for tired feet.

The Villa's provide a great \"home away from home\" with a full kitchen (1BR), King bed, family room and balcony. The Boardwalk view rooms offer a great view of the Boardwalk, the Beach Club and the \"high\" fireworks at Epcot. There are several rooms with mostly enclosed balconies which we try to stay away from because they make the rooms dark (less sunlight coming in) and you have to stand to watch anything from the balcony. The restaurants and shops on the Boardwalk are good and between the Boardwalk area, the Yacht and Beach Club and the Swan and Dolphin, you have plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance. The Clown pool was a big hit with our kids with their waterslide and the carousel pool bar is a favorite for the adults! Try the Captains Mai Tai!

When we check in our rooms were side by side, not connecting. Couldn't do anything for me, so sorry. We went to my daughter's villa first, it was fine. My husband and I walked into our room and the odor of mildew was overwhelming, it was late, we were tired, we went to bed. Next morning I left the maid a note about the odor and we left. Got back to the rooms at 6 and my daughters room was fine, the maid had missed ours, hadn't even been in the door. Called and had clean towels brought to us for the next morning and we went left to go swimming. Next day left another note, when we came back the maind had been there and the dishwasher was running, it ran for another hour before I finally turned it off and called maintenance to report it. My husband got in the shower and cold water was pouring out of the light above him, the clothes in the dryer had to be put through 4 times to get dry, called maintenance again and was told they would be fixed. My duaghter's room was fine, I am so glad that the children were not in our room and we had a wonderful time despite all of this. When my husband was agin doused with cold water during his shower he went to the desk and complained. They were not very helpful, he finally spoke to a manager and they gave him a $200 credit. For what we were paying for the room I don't really think that was enought but \"it is what it is\". So, beware, your room can be perfectly fine....or not. Please know that we have been to Disney and stayed on the property over a dozen times and we will be returning. The property is getting a little old and it was our first times at the Boardwalk, we love the Beach Club and it actually has a better pool for older children, Boardwalk pool is clown theamed and a bit young for us but both are very nice. The grandchildren are at an age that they love Epcot the most and this is a perfect location. When younger we always stayed at the Contemporary Resort and have stayed at Port Orleans and the Wilderness Lodge also but find the constant busses difficult. Had our room not had so many glitches we wouldn't have had a problem with staying here, just be aware that while most of the rooms are fine there are some that are feeling their age and you may be getting one of them.

A great time to visit WDW, it's the off-season and crowds were low. Weather was intermittent, with some days on the 70's and others in the 50's. Dress in layers. The Boardwalk was not our first choice, so I was a little hesitant, but it turned out great. We rented a one-bedroom villa. My wife and I stayed in the king bedroom and our two daughters (age 5 and 8) shared the pull-out sofa in the living room. The room was clean and in good condition. The bathroom was large, with toilet, sink, and shower and there's a separate room w/ whirlpool tub, sink and closet. The kitchen is compact, but had a full-size fridge, stove, microwave and dishwasher. There's a washer/dryer in the room. Because we were not timeshare owners, you get daily maid service. All utensils were provided, plus dishwasher soap, dish soap, and laundry detergent. There's also a safe in the room (free). Didn't use wifi. We used Garden Grocer to deliver groceries for breakfast, and the delivery was waiting for us when we arrived. The room has a small balcony and overlooked the pool area. Even though the pool is open at night, we didn't have any noise issues - probably due to the cold weather. On those days when it was warm enough we used the pool. My kids loved it; just the right size for them. There's both a regular pool and a kiddie pool, plus a large slide. If you are looking for more, stay at another resort or hit the water parks. There's also a snack bar and family restroom. Towels were plentiful. The decor of the resort is lovely, I felt like I was walking onto the set of \"Boardwalk Empire\". We ate at two of the restaurants, Big River Grill and Kouzzina. Both had good food, prices were typical for Disney. Tip: Don't sit outside at Big River - lots of seagulls who don't have any fear of tourists. The location was the best part - it's part of the \"Epcot Resorts\" - you can walk to Epcot (a bit long for little kids) and Hollywood Studios (even longer), but the best way to both is by boat. A very quick and leisurely trip. You arrive at the back entrance of Epcot, close to the World Showcase, which is perfect for dinner. Transport to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom is by bus - about 30 and 45 minutes, respectively. Not as nice, but it gets you there. If you are worried about staying at a timeshare, don't. There's no high-pressure sales. In fact, except for the timeshare sales desk in the lobby, you wouldn't know you were in the timeshare section. Disney has a good reputation for being very low-key about timeshare sales.

One room had a large jacuzzi tub & sink/vanity, and the other room had a pedestal sink, toilet, & large shower with a wonderful shower head. We found this split worked great...someone could have privacy while showering and everyone else could still get ready in the other bathroom! There was a fold-out couch in the living room that was very comfortable. Our room was on the 1st floor and we had a group of ducks that visited our patio every morning, looking in the window to see if we could feed them any bread :) The BEST part about the hotel though is the proximity to EPCOT.

No wait in long lines...the bag security check point was quick and then you're in! The walk to EPCOT is beautiful and you feel like you're \"in the park\" the entire time you're staying at Boardwalk...the Disney magic is never gone. I also loved that you didn't have to deal with parking to go to EPCOT. You just took a quick beautiful stroll down the boardwalk & over a small bridge. There is also a boat that will take you to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios which was fun (and if you're paying for parking at the parks, it will save you money!)

The closet has a safe, and of course a nice patio deck so you can take in the sights depending on the view usually I get a boardwalk or pool view.

One of the drawbacks of all the WDW resorts is the fact that they have no wireless (just an ethernet port that costs $10 a day to use).

We had a nice one bedroom that overlooked the path to Hollywood Studios. Our bathroom had a maintenance issue; the shower stalls have a light fixture in the ceiling and when the people upstairs took a shower, the water leaked through it into our bathroom. I left the light off in the shower for the rest of our visit and notified housekeeping. I suspect some corners were cut when the resort was built. Other than that, the villa was extremely pleasant with the usual friendly Disney service. My past gripes had to do with the lack of wireless, and I'm glad that's taken care of, but it would also be nice to have a wider selection of TV stations and less of the endless Disney infomercials on channel after channel.

The Boardwalk is nice and you could walk a lap in about 20 minutes, my suggestions are the Japanese Resturant in the Swan Hotel (5 minute walk), Fuego for Drinks in Downtown Disney (cigar bar) and most of the food in Epcot.

The problems were the hot tub was never above lukewarm nor was the pool heated. The room also had a few minor problems, especially with the door knobs. The boat service is extremely slow.

That was one drawback, it was a 30 minute bus ride to the magic kingdom. To and From.. Most days, we would just start at the epcot spend a few hours there then monorail it over to the MK, then take the bus ride home.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8 Same thing with the Animal kingdom.. the boardwalk would be the last stop on the loop (swan/dolphin/yacht club/beach club then boardwalk. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Another negative was the bed... must be a disney thing since the past 3 trips we've been on, the beds sink in the middle.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8 (Polynesian, saratoga, now boardwalk) So a recap.. awesome location since 2 parks are within walking distance... the other 2 parks are a 30 min bus ride.. awesome hotel with a lot of amenities.

We could see the high fireworks from our balcony. We were a 10 min walk to Epcot and maybe a 12 min walk to Hollywood studios. This was the perfect location since most of our time was spent at the food and wine festival in Epcot. One con for us was it was not easy to refill your refillable mug since their is no quick service location in the resort. You have to bring your mug to the pool bar or various locations on the boardwalk or a lounge in the resort. However, they cannot fill your mug for sanitary reasons so they fill a paper cup and you can pour it into your mug. Location can also be a key element. Our room was super convenient to everything but if you are at the far end of one of the halls, it can be a walk. There are no restaurants in the resort but many right down on the boardwalk itself. The resort is beautiful and the quiet pools are soooo quiet. Our room was very quiet but if you have a room right on the boardwalk, I imagine it could be noisy at times.

'11 The disney feeling, took us over, right from the arrival at the Orlando airport, and the excitement for this disney vacations had already begun, even before we stepped up the receptionist desk at the board walk villas. on arrival, i had requested the receptionist, to give us the best possible location, and that, if by any chance, an upgrade to the one bedroom villa was possible ( it was going to be my son's eighth birthday celebration ). My son was already on a roll, as he was given the first time at disney badge, and a happy birthday badge. AND following which, wow!!! .we got the upgrade, almost in an instant...and that too, with a very very warm smile. The location of the room, was fabulous_ with the corner of the balcony, facing the board walkway on one side, and the riverway on the other. This, no doubt a most generous gesture by the hotel management, pumped up our adrenalin, and i was sure my family would have a time of life, this vacation. starting with the location of the hotel, i would say, this is in the most lively neighborhood in disney world. Everything so convenient!!! The hotel services _ the room services, the concierge, and almost all the departments, were efficient and warm. The one bedroom Villa, itself was so well equipped, with practically all the gadgets for washing laundry or cooking food, if required, for a longer stay. The dining plan was a convenient blessing in itself, which was already on the special offer, for our trip timings. The fastpass is also a most required thing, which comes in free, with the disney guests. I was not sure of the free wifi in the rooms, as i had tried to look up the possibility, before our arrival, but there again !!! complimentary wifi was on the house, for our entire stay. nearly everything was perfect...I suppose a very rare piece of luck for sure, And the memories, surely unforgettable, will stay for a long long time to come. AND before we realized, the end of our stay was near. Indeed, we were a little heart broken that everything good has to end sometime. Infact the standard of hospitality and the guest relationship was so high, that i am sure, it would be difficult for us, to find the same level of disney hospitality, ever again in any non disney vacations in the future. My son, looks forward to a similar vacation at disney world, once again, and i don't blame him. AND probably, with luck, we might repeat the same experience, on our next trip, and will surely be with the same hotel, for sure. The Javeri family.

The staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times. The rooms were large and spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers without falling over each other, with large enough kitchenette area and fridge, even though we only had a studio on this occassion. The whole resort is beautifully presented and decorated and you really feel as if you have stepped back into the 1930's era as the atmosphere is so real. One of the highlights for me was each morning waking up to have the view of the Epcot ball and to sit on our balcony with a cup of tea and listen to the old style music being softly played around the boardwalk. Wonderful. The pool was also brilliant, particularly for young children. As ours are now teenagers we preferred to use the 2 quieter pools which were large and more peaceful. The boat service to Epcot and Studios was regular and never too crowded. However, Epcot is within 5 mins walking and this involves a lovely stroll around the lake. The only negative that i could say is that i don't think there are enough laundry facilities and people being people can be very inconsiderate when using these, i.e as soon as you turn your back, chucking your clothes out of machines and putting theirs in!! This practice caused a few heated words in the laundry room. This isn't an issue for people staying in the 1 bedroom apartments as they have their own washer/dryer and i wouldn't allow it to stop me from returning.

In retrospect I should have gone back to reception and asked if perhaps we could have waited a while to see if another room would become available. So really it's not Disney's fault at my disappointment. We'd just checked out of a Castle View Club Level room at the Grand Floridian, so the decor of the room left something to be desired, but to be honest any room would have paled in comparison (and so it should as my 3 nights at the Floridian - including 1 free night - cost more than my 11 nights at the BW). The room was a good size, and the kitchen and bathroom areas were the best appointed of the 3 DVC resorts we have stayed in (the others being Animal Kingdon, Jambo House and Bay Lake Tower) The ability to walk to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios was really great, and we enjoyed our time spent at the quiet pool. We'd love to stay in the same area again, but would probably pay the extra to stay at the Boardwalk Inn or the Beach Club as opposed to staying in the Boardwalk Villas, we just like that extra bit of luxury in our room.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGets better everytime we stay\u201d", "Author": "maureendavies55", "ReviewID": "UR118065443", "Content": "i,ve been a member of the disney vacation club since 1993 and i have stayed in the Boardwalkvillas many times.I have just returned from a 14 night stay in a 2 bedroom villa and again had a wonderful holiday ,the accomadation is outstanding and the location is fabulous.My husband and i took friends with us who had never visited america and they fell in love with the Boardwalk the location is excellant for first time visitors .The disney staff are so welcoming and helpfull you really do feel you are at home at this property .", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntersville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but out-dated\u201d", "Author": "ASD_specialist", "ReviewID": "UR118036084", "Content": "The location was very convenient to the parks.

One Villa was ready, the other would be ready at 4 PM as promised. We were told it was \"next to the other one\". At 4 PM we were told there was an engineering problem with the room, and directed to another room, on another floor, in another section of the hotel. Upon arriving we were mortified to find another family already in the room, the bellman apologized and we all backed out. The front desk then told us in rapid succession: Our original room was given away earlier to another family prior to 4 PM; Disney Boardwalk's policy is to double book rooms; Disney cannot promise to fulfill any requests made in the online reservation; there was still an engineering problem with the room. After some prodding the cast members stuck with the engineering story. When we suggested that we all take a walk to the room, knock on the door and see who answered - engineering staff or other visitors, a flurry of activity took place, and we received a promise of a room at 5. 5:15 arrived and a manager presented us with a key to a room in an area near our family's other room, an apology, and a partial refund to our payment for having missed a day at Disney while sorting this out. Up and out the next day, we got back to our room late to find it had not been made up. A call to housekeeping and a trip to the front desk to visit with managers resulted in the explanation that the cleaning staff had \"just not been told to make up the room\".

The negatives: No housekeeping, so when we called for extra towels, shampoo and soap since we had 5 people in the rooms for 7 nights they said they would do so complementary but we would need to pay next time.

We had a studio back water view of the dolphin and swan hotels and could hear the ferry boats little horn but it was a nice touch. It didnt interupt our sleep. I think we were the only ones staying in our wing of the villas bc it was dead quiet until the last night we were there when we could hear kids thru the connecting door. But this is expected its Disney. Thankfully that was the night before we were checking out. I understand why people complain about the walk from the one bank of elevators quite a walk after walking all day but worth it. The room was nice had everything we needed coffee makes, fridge, microwave, a couch, flatscreen TV. Our balcony was odd there was only one chair and the door took up so much space to open that you have to maneuver around it so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relax out there. Nice to have that divide between the toilet and sink area. Im girlie takes awhile to get ready. Bed was comfy and couch was good. Ordered room service for bfast one morning bfast potatoes were delish and service wonderful. I see why people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a quick service style cafeteria right in the lobby or same building but you are going outside to the park anyway. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem grabbing something quick to eat or just having coffee in the room and then run to the parks. I guess that sort of cafeteria setting would ruin the DELUXE aspect. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have food in any of the boardwalk restaurants but highly recommend beaches and cream (Beach Club hotel about 10min walk)! Awesome French dip, chili, onion rings! ICE CREAMMMM Look for the hidden mickey in the onion rings hehe Known for their ice cream we saw a group get a kitchen sink looked like an ice cream lover kids dream The bus to magic kingdom and AK came right when we walked up to the bus stop or we waited less than 15min for one. At night even when leaving for extra magic hours there was ALWAYS a bus to our hotel. Stops sometimes at Swan and Dolphin but what does that take like +5min!? no complaints with disneys transit system they have their ish together The ferry boat when leaving the parks if you can catch them without a monster line I recommend. So nice and romantic to ride back and take in the scenery Had a drink in the Bellevue lounge one day before heading to park for fireworks take your drink out onto the deck! wish i was there right now Bought sweets in the Candy Shop on the boardwalk for family back home but the parks have more of a variety buy in there Went to jellyrolls one night and that was the place to be. Boozed until 2am that was there closing time. $5 for a beer pretty good for Disney prices. Stroll around the boardwalk they have fun entertainment at night we saw a funny magician Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use our pool it looked nice with the clown coaster but the one over @ Beach and Yacht club looks way better. They have a lazy river. Going to swim there next time. Take the MAGIC EXPRESS and do the luggage to room service wish every destination was that organized. Take advantage of these things. Idk why you would want to wait for your luggage! Use the EXTRA MAGIC HOURS helllooo that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you spend so much to stay on the Disney property. I think like 75% of these people have no clue about them. Disney is the best money you can spend on a vacay IMO every minute of it was magical lol Compared to others ive stayed at stay here for the location and scenery !!! Room very nice !!!

We have stayed at the Boardwalk VIllas two times in the past four years. Each time we stayed in a preferred view one bedroom villa. Each time we rented points from a DVC member, which is a very economical way to save money versus going through Disney Direct. Anyways, I wont go into FULL details, but I will say this hotel is where we first fell in love with Disney. IT is an unbelivable value to have a kitchen and that much space for the kids plus a washer dryer. Usually people travel to Disney for more than just a few nights, so these extra convienences are really worth it JIMO. The one drawback to the room itself is that it can sometimes be a long walk from the room to the elevator. This is a notorious drawback to this particular hotel. The location - however - cannot be beat. You are a short walk to Epcot and a boat ride to Hollywood Studios. The buses take you everywhere else. However, a drawback is they share the buses and boats with other hotels so it is more than a 5 minute ride (probably 20-30 total). There are plenty of restuarants on the boardwalk - both Disney- Flyisng FIsh, Cape May, Spoodles (which has been recently replaced) and non disney - ESPN, etc The best part of the hotel is the boardwalk area itself, which has nightly free entertainment. There are performers, magicians, jugglers pianos, surrey bikes, all of which engage children and adults alike. There are also carnival games, snacks, etc for a price If you are looking for a great stay at the happiest place on earth, I highly reccomend a one bedroom or bigger room at the Boardwalk villas.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, classy hotel\u201d", "Author": "tescoqueen", "ReviewID": "UR105519350", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights after our Disney cruise in Jan 2011.

Check in and check out were extremely smooth, and the Disney's Magical Express service, which takes care of your luggage and transport to and from the airport, is phenomenal. We stayed in a studio villa. Our room was immaculate, the bed was comfortable, and we had a bit more space to spread out than you would get in a regular hotel room. There was a mini-kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, microwave, and toaster, and the hotel provided plates, cups, etc. We didn't use it much, but I can see how it would be a great money saver if you want to pick up some cereal or cold cuts for sandwiches and eat in the room instead of at the parks. Since the BoardWalk is walking distance from 2 Disney parks (about 10 minutes from Hollywood Studios and literally next door to Epcot), it's totally possible to eat in your room. Hollywood Studios and Epcot are also accessible by boat, and you can take the bus to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. I've heard a few bad reviews of the bus system, but we really didn't have a problem with it. One of my favorite things about this hotel is that there's tons of stuff to do even if you're not in the parks. The boardwalk itself has a few restaurants (including Cat Cora's Kouzzina- which was fabulous), a candy shop that serves ice cream, a bakery (delicious sandwiches and pastries), an arcade, and a few stores, one of which sold grocery items. There were a bunch of performers throughout the day, such as clowns, magicians, etc., and the Beach Club resort (less than 5 minutes away across the lake) had outdoor movie screenings every night. The pool also has a water slide which looked like fun. All of these things are great if you want some rest from walking around the parks but still want your kids to have something to do.

So we rented a car, went to Whole Foods and bought everything we needed for breakfast and for munchies. It was really nice to be together in the morning and make our breakfast, just the way we like it. It made the connections with the family just that extra special! We found everything really clean, and the mousekeeping forgot to replenish on the dishwashing detergent for the dishwasher one day. I called and within 8 minutes they were there! As you may know, you can walk to EPCOT (5 minutes) or to Hollywood Studios (15 minutes), or you can take the friendship boat. When we took the boat from the Studios, we stopped at the Swan & Dolphin, it was much quicker to then walk than than to stay in the boat, as the boat also goes to the Beach & Yacht Club before the Boardwalk. All and all I would recommend this resort big time. The convenience of being right next to those parks, the beauty of the Boardwalk and the amenities makes it a winner in my heart. Just a small drawback: the corridors. They are endless! Be prepared after a big day of walking to walk another 4-5 minutes just to get to your room from the elevator.

I know many people complain about only one set of elevators in a very large resort. So I will mention it... Our room was far from the elevators (3 minute walk) but the walk was cool and dry. It did not bother us at all. However, our daughter is 9 so she can walk on her own. We only walked to the elevators when that was the direction we were going in. There are many many stairwells located throughout the resort. My only complaint (and I am a very light sleeper) was the noise from the Boardwalk. We were right near the hoop game and I could hear the dinging. I could also hear voices. Once I closed the heavy drapes though it was sufficiently quiet so I could sleep. Of course sleeping at night is difficult for me since I work nightshift. My husband and daughter did not hear a thing. We loved the pool and the clown slide was like a waterpark slide. Really whips you around fast. We had no difficulty finding lounge chair as they were ample. May be a bit difficult in a busier time though.

The couch was like a rock, literally! We had just came from a stay at AKL and the couch was so comfortable - it was a very \"homey\" place. You could not even sit on the couch to watch TV. Even though the room seemed to have new rugs and a new TV, it was still very old looking. There was still hair in our tub from the last guests - ewww! Also, when we checked in our room wasn't ready. No problem, we went to the parks and they said that they'd send a text when it was. At 5 PM we didn't receive any texts - the desk said that they didn't know what happened. As DVC members, they usually leave a message on your phone the first night to welcome you and give you a number to call if you need anything. For the 1st time as DVC members, this did not happen. Again, not a huge deal at all, but it made me realize how just how much of a special touch it is. We had a studio and our fridge leaked inside all night. All you heard was drip, drip, drip, drip while you were trying to sleep. We didn't have a need to use the fridge, but it was kind of annoying. The pool was very old and not very clean compared to all of the other resorts I stayed at. I truly felt like was at a crappy motel at Wildwood, NJ. This is the first disappointing experience I have EVER had at Disney in the last 20 years. I won't go back there nor would I recommend it to anyone. Finally, there is no real quick service on property. I didn't think that would matter, but it did when we were looking for a quick lunch.

My advice is to use the side/back doors as much as possible. There are doors that open along the path that goes around the resort and this is much easier than going to the lobby to get out every time depending on where your room is located.

However I was sorely disappointed. We arrived at the front entrance and was told by the Bell boy that we either had to pay 12 dollars to have our car valet parked or park it ourselves a good half a mile or so from the entrance. We didn't want to pay, so we started to take the luggage out of the car. We went to grab one of the luggage carts and the bell boy stopped us and asked if he could help. We said no, and he then continued to tell us that it was Disney policy that we weren't allowed to use the luggage carts. With no other choice, we allowed him to unpack our car. Which he then gave us a ticket and said our luggage would be up shortly. Checking in was just as confusing as parking. We did the online check in, so we walked up to the appropriate desk to check in. The receptionist didn't say anything to us and just handed us our keys. I had to ask her for a map of the hotel, which she then handed us a DVC member folder and told me all the info was in there. Finding our room was a nightmare. There was only one elevator (according to the hotel map) and the elevator was extremely far away from our room. Hallways later, we found our room and THAT was an even BIGGER nightmare. It was the nastiest room I have ever seen. The bathroom looked like a public restroom at a gas station... dirty, grimy, hair all over the place. It looked like all the cleaning lady did was fold the toilet paper into a nice little triangle... but forgot to actually clean the urine off the toilet seat. Disgusted, I called the front desk to request for another room. They acted like I was really inconveniencing them. The male receptionist made a sarcastic comment about how there must be a dead person in our room if it's that dirty. We finally received another room, which was even further away from the elevator than the last one. Not to mention, the bell boy had already dropped off our luggage at the old room and they don't offer luggage help if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re leaving your room. So we had to drag our luggage all the way to the new room without a cart. Unfortunately, the new room was just as bad... if not worse. I had to clean the toilet off with a disinfecting wipe..I couldn't take a shower without the bath filling all the way up. THEN the worst part ever! I pulled the sheets back when I went to bed and I pulled out a very long brown hair ... I have short hair. The manager was unavailable to talk, they wouldn't switch my room again.. I ended up leaving a day early. And to make matters worse, I have bed bug bites all over my arm and neck.

My husband ran the Disney Marathon on the 10th, so we were there in the frigid week before. I know that many of the things we loved about the hotel probably would be problems had we gone during a warmer/busier time. So take it for what it's worth. We never had any noise from the pool, even though we faced the pool, but it was 35 degrees. I can imagine that if it had been warmer, noise during naptime (and bedtime) would have been annoying at best. If we stay here again, we will most likely request a room that does not face the pool or the Boardwalk, for noise sake. Also, because there were hardly any crowds, the buses and boats would get us to the parks in 20-25 minutes, unlike the hour that others complained about. Still, I have no idea why anyone would take a boat to Epcot when it is only an 8-10 minute walk. If a six-month pregnant lady, pushing a preschooler in a stroller in near-freezing temperatures can do it, so can you. Hollywood Studios was a bit farther of a walk--probably 15-20 minutes. Not bad if conditions are right, but it was so cold and I was feeling the pregnancy, so we took the boat. The buses to MK and AK ran on time and never took more than 18 to 25 minutes to get us from our hotel to the front gates. We had read the reviews about the long walk to the elevator, so we requested a room by the elevator. When we arrived at 3:30 for our 4:00 check-in, we had to wait until about 4:20 before a room was ready. Then we saw where the room was and it was not at all near the elevators. So they moved us (quickly) to a room that was supposedly closer. In actuality, it wasn't all that close. But when you're at Disney, all you do is walk, so it wasn't too bad. But definitely try to get as close to the elevator as you can, as there is only one in the entire villa. Twice for quick-service meals (we did the dining plan and HIGHLY recommend it), we drove to the All-Star Music resort and ate in their food court. It was a short drive and a wonderful place to eat. I only wish they had some sort of food court near the Boardwalk Villas. It was hard to find food (especially on the dining plan) that was quick and easy if we retired early to our room. We got a one-bedroom suite so that we could put our son to bed in the king bed and close the door, while we stayed in the living room, planning for the next day. Then when we went to bed, we'd simply move him to the pull-out queen sleeper sofa and go to bed in the king. The best part, though, of the one-bedroom suite was the washer/dryer. There was also a full kitchen w/a full-size fridge, oven/stove, and microwave. And because these are time-share rooms (even though we are not DVC members), they are stocked w/dishes, silverware, paper towels, dish detergent, etc. Really all we needed. As far as housekeeping, we could have gotten our rooms cleaned/beds made, etc, every day, but we chose to only do it a few times because we didn't really feel that it was needed. Two out of the three times that we purposefully left the privacy notice up (so as to not receive housekeeping), we received a phone call just being sure we didn't need anything. When our rooms were cleaned, they were cleaned very well. The staff even arranged my son's Disney stuffed animals on his bed. :) The concierge service was available 24-hours a day to answer our questions about how to get to certain places, etc., though they didn't always give the same information, especially about marathon transportation. One thing that was kind of annoying was that in order to use a luggage cart, you had to utilize their bellhop services. I suppose this makes sense and is probably standard in higher-class hotels, but we are too cheap to pay someone to carry our bags, so we had to do it all ourselves. All three trips. But that is just a preference on our part. I know many people have no problem tipping bellhops to help them, but we're perfectly capable of doing it ourselves. It just would have been nice to have a luggage cart to use. Even in a very low-traffic time (10 pm), they would not allow us to use one to load our car. Also, I think it is cheap and irritating that there is no free high-speed internet service, and that (non-wifi) internet is $9.95 a day. We did find an unsecured network in our room the first four days and that was great, but then it disappeared. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. I will never come to Disney and stay outside the parks. The convenience, the resort transportation, and the dining plan are all worth the extra money. While the MK is our favorite park, the resorts that are within walking distance of that park are considerably more expensive, so this was a great location.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Over Rated\u201d", "Author": "singlemom53", "ReviewID": "UR52408627", "Content": "Stayed the last week of 2009 in a Studio.

Buses in line have to wait for the first one to load and unload and can be lengthy with wheelchair loads. Boat transportation is also shared with the non-Disney Swan/Dolphin, boats often fill up there and Disney Resort guests are left waiting.

We would go to the quiet pool for some peace from the constant whistle blowing at everyone enjoying the pool. It was irritating. The rooms weren't cleaned very well and a member of our party got ringworm from the linens. Gross.

The busses operating to and from the hotel are a negative - you loose alot of time sometimes up to an hour each way - our average wait was about 20 min.

I dont know how - the attractions still close at the same time for everyone. the day before we arrived i called and asked for a room on a high floor near the elevator and when we arrived we were given the furthest room on the ground floor (about 5-10 min walk from the front desk) with no view of and the longest walk. The rooms are drab and dismal although this may be intentional to imitate the early 1900's or so. Service appeared non existent and nonchalant.

When you are not in the parks, there is the boardwalk with shops, restaurants, bars, boat rentals, free entertainment, and night life. The hotel itself has a large, lively pool (luna park) with a major water slide and activities for children. For those who prefer a less noisy pool, there are smaller, quieter pools in other areas of the hotel. At night we enjoyed jellyrolls, a piano bar near the boardwalk villa - duelling pianos, where you get to request your favorite song. All the performers are very talented and seem to have an endless repertoir of songs. The performer who is older and overweight and looks a bit like Santa can be grumpy and might try to insult your if you are having too much, you jst have to ignore him. Then, after hours of having fun at jellyrolls, signing, dancing and people watching, we would always return to the hotel pool and relax on one of those friendly pool elephants, that are just begging to be mounted.

That's it. I booked a 3 night stay at the Florida resident rate directly through Disney which gave me a 36% discount off the regular rate. The villas are so costly that this was still an expensive stay even with the discount. I was at the hotel for a total of 7 hours before getting angry enough to check out at 11:30 PM and go to another hotel. First, the parking....the hotel parking lot was designed for one purpose only...to get you to pay an extra $!0 per day on top of the expensive room rate so you don't have to walk quite a distance to the hotel's front entrance. Even the handicapped parking is far from the front entrance. Upon arrival, I pulled up to the valet area where I was ignored so I asked if I could leave my car there until I checked in. A valet took my keys and told me I could do that. At the check-in desk I encounter Cast Member - Raymond who although he's been working at this hotel for a while (as told to me by another Cast Member) knew very little information about it. I asked if I could upgrade to a room with a kitchenette because I hadn't realized until the night before my arrival, that the room I booked onilne only had a microwave and small refrigerator. I was unable to change my reservation online at that point. He told me that they did have a 1 bedroom villa with kitchenette available and after much fuss on the phone to see what the extra fee would be to upgrade, he told me it would be an extra $115 per night. In the few seconds that I was contemplating this, he received a phone call, and then told me he was sorry but he told me the wrong price and that it would be $238 per night to upgrade because they couldn't give me the FL resident discount rate at the hotel. (WHAT??!!) I started to get annoyed at this point and in the few seconds that I was contemplating what to do, another Cast Member came out from behind a closed door, looked at me and said \"I'm really sorry but we just sold the only 1 bedroom that was available while you were deciding what to do. NOW I was angry. I said \"this is ridiculous, what is going on here? For medical reasons, I need the kitchenette to prepare my own food, I've been here less than an hour and I'm already very aggravated, perhaps I shouldn't stay here at all.\" A manager that was nearby heard the conversation and whispered something to the Cast Member that came out to tell me the bad news. SUDDENLY....a one bedroom villa with kitchen became available and at the Florida resident discount rate. How about that!!?? Unfortunately this wasn't the end of my misery. I check in and return to the valet area to see about having my luggage taken to my room. A Cast member at the valet booth tells me to \"talk to that guy over there\" so I do and he walks over to my car with me when I realize I don't have my keys. I go back to the valet booth and they don't know where my keys are. They find them but by then the bellman that was going to help me had walked away from my car. Someone directs me to the bell stand just inside the entrance and I get help with my luggage. I tell the bellman that I'm going to park my car and meet him at my room. This hotel is so large and built in such an odd way that it's difficult to navigate. Raymond gave me the wrong directions on how to get to my room and I quickly became very lost and unable to figure out how to get to where I was supposed to be so I called the front desk from my cell phone. Two cast members came to assist me and they said \"this happens all the time here.\" Hmmmm.....if it happens all the time, don't you think they should do something about that?! Finally both my luggage and I are in the room. I'm exhausted, it took over an hour to complete check in, park my car and find my room. The room is beautiful and very spacious but that's all it is. There is advertising everywhere you look to join the Disney Vacation Club, including on the TV. And I do mean everywhere! The kitchen table had large stickers all over it with these ads and you see them throughout the hotel. I had difficulty finding a TV channel that was NOT advertising something Disney. I went out for a while and when I returned to my room and attempted to use my laptop, I found a sign on the kitchen table that said to look for an ethernet cable in the closet (there was no cable) and that there was a $10 per 24 hours fee to use the service. I was enraged. This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed at and they were going to charge me to use the Internet? No they weren't as far as I was concerned. I called the front desk, reported that there was no ethernet cable and that I wished to have the fee for the Internet waived. I was told they \"COULDN'T\" do that so I asked to be connected to someone who could. I was told that the manager would call me back. About a half hour later, the manager called. He asked me: 1. \"Why do you think the Internet should be free?\" 2. After explaining that I've stayed at many lesser priced hotels that all had free Internet, usually WiFi, he said \"Well if you stay at a Motel 6, they give you free Internet to get you to stay there.\" I've never stayed at a Motel 6 that was his assumption. After arguing with him for a while and telling him that if he doesn't wave what would amount to $30 for Internet use during my stay, I was checking out immediately and never coming back. His reply was \"well, I hate to put you out at 11:30 at night, is there anything else I can do for you? I replied \"yes, you can let me use the Internet without charging me. His response was \"I'm not WILLING to do that.\" I quickly found a very lovely Holiday Inn Express on Palm Pkwy. in Lake Buena Vista for $85 per night offering free WiFi, free breakfast, very lovely, clean rooms and helpful management. A few days later while investigating who at Disney I can report my horrible experience to, I found that the Boardwalk Hotel has free WiFi in the lobby and they have a business center.

The pool was open to midnight, so it was a bit noisy until midnight. We also had a view of Hollywood Studios. Our room was in the building with the Boardwalk Villas side and the walk from the elevator was long. The room itself was nice. It could sleep two adults and two small children. The only problem is that we had a connecting door to the one-bedroom condo (I think) and when they came in at 2 a.m. they woke us the first night. They supply paper plates and bowls along with plastic silverware. Small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker dish towel and dish soap. We were only eating breakfast in the room and going out to dinner so we did not need to cook. Nice big vanity area, bathroom was kind of on the small side. Little foyer in the entrance (which was great for leaving your keys and such), closet next to the vanity, long but narrow. The room is starting to show its age a little, but that is okay because we like the convenience of staying at one of the Disney Resorts. No DVD player in the studios and the TV was old. Bed was comfortable and so was the sofa to sit and read on or watch TV. Cute little balcony, we watched the people below while were enjoying a couple of glasses of wine. There was a list of prices for extra things and I was a little confused about it, maybe it was for people that are DVC owners or people staying longer, but there were some extra charges such as extra cleaning, towels and such. We had our room cleaned during our stay and new towels (which we did not ask for) and no extra charge. Internet is extra for non DVC members (which we are not). Now to the resort! We took the shuttle boat over to Hollywood Studios and enjoyed the ride (we have stayed at the Dolphin and Swan and love the boat ride to Epcot and HS). Transportation to the other parks was by bus, which we did not do so I can not comment on them. We ate at Spoodles and Flying Fish Caf\u00c3\u00a9; I highly recommend both of them (make sure to make your reservations).

Since we were staying at the Boardwalk Villas for the first time, we decided to go spend the night at Jellyrolls and Atlantic Dance. Jellyrolls have a cover, but Atlantic Dance is free. We had a blast at both places. As for the pool, we never got to use it because by the time we got back from HS it was raining, but it looks like fun. There is a quiet pool around the corner from the activity center. Next time we are going to rent bikes. We just really enjoyed the old Atlantic City feeling of the boardwalk with games, yummy desserts and nightly entertainment.

The rack rate for our room was approximately $600 per night, though we actually paid less by using points rented from a DVC member. At those prices, we expected the room to be spacious, clean, and comfortable, the amenities to be plenty, and the service to be top-notch. Unfortunately, only some of these expectations were met. First the positive: The property itself was quite nice, with the boardwalk being even more entertaining that we expected. The location was ideal, a very short walk from Epcot, and a short boat ride from Hollywood Studios. Boats seemed to be available quite frequently, and we never waited more than 5 minutes for a vessel to arrive. The room was spacious and quite comfortable, and the amenities provided in the room were as advertised. Now the not so positive: Overall, the service at the hotel was awful, and it was't until we decided to stop relying on hotel staff for any support that we began to truly enjoy our visit. Some examples: upon arrival, we pulled into the valet area to unload luggage and check-in. Though there were several bellmen available, none seemed interested in providing any assistance, despite our numerous attempts to request some help. After approximately 10 minutes, one finally offered to assist, but only after we had fully unloaded our belongings onto the curb. Check-in was quick and easy, but when we arrived in our room (at approximately 4:30 PM, well after the designated check-in time), we discovered that it had not been cleaned. The prior guests' food, soiled linens, and other trash littered the room. We immediately contacted the front desk to inform them of the problem. Astonishingly, the response was that no other rooms were available, and that housekeeping would get to it when they could. After approximately 30 minutes, someone from housekeeping arrived, armed only with a document noting that the problem was not the fault of the housekeeping staff, but of a front-desk error. That person then left without cleaning the room. A few minutes later, a bellman arrived with our bags, and thankfully he too was appalled by the condition of the room, unloaded our bags into a closet so that they would be out of the way, and immediately contacted housekeeping to rectify the problem. Approximately one hour after being notified of the problem, housekeeping staff finally arrived to clean the room. Later that same evening, we asked the concierge for directions to the nearest grocery store. The concierge was initially unable to provide any directions at all. A second staff member attempted to provide directions downloaded from Google, and handed me a printout directing me to a grocery store more than 20 miles away in downtown Orlando. Ultimately, another guest was kind enough to provide directions to a grocery store only 3 miles from the hotel. But hotel staff never did provide any helpful assistance. Upon returning from the grocery store, we again pulled into the valet area to unload groceries, seeking assistance from the bell staff. Unfortunately, we we unable to locate anyone to help.

We chose the Boardwalk because of its close proximity to EPCOT and MGM. We like to be able to walk to MGM and EPCOT. The Boardwalk is just a short stroll from these parks, or there is a boat and of course, the bus. We also like the entertainment on the Boardwalk at night. We are not early-to-bedders, so we enjoy doing something after catching the fireworks shows or Fantasmic, etc. The Boardwalk always has something going on - a magician, jugglers, a man playing the piano - not to mention the bicycle rentals or carnival type games. It is always nice to grab an ice cream cone and sit and people watch. There are several restaurants on the Boardwalk. We have tried Spoodles (even the pizza window is great) and the ESPN Zone. The candy shoppe is great for the kids and the bakery has quick breakfast items. We have heard that the toehr restaurants are great. We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa. It was spacious and clean. It may soon be time to begin to remodel a bit, but really, the rooms are beautiful, comfortable and have all the amenities of a \"home away from home.\" The only problem we encountered is a problem with the toilet ... apparently, the family before us must have left something in the toilet and flushed it down so on our first day there, we had to call maintenance to come fix it. We had left to go out but when we came back, it was fixed. I have to say, the housekeeping staff is awesome. We stayed at the Boardwalk Villas for 2 nights, left for the Disney Cruise and then came back to the Boardwalk for 3 nights. During the first stay, our daughter left a stuffed dog in the room. I called lost and found from the Disney Cruise and they told me they had found it and would leave it for us to pick up when we returned. Sure enough, it was waiting for us.

Our group spent half of our stay at the Pop Century and half at the Boardwalk Villas. We liked having a variety and Disney made the transition between resorts very smooth and easy. We just dropped bags off at the Pop luggage desk in the morning and they were waiting for us at the Boardwalk Villas later in the afternoon when we returned from the parks. We booked the Boardwalk Villa rooms through a Disney Vacation Club owner, which saved us a ton of money (cost less than half of booking directly with Disney). For more info on how to do this, check the DVC forums. Overall, our experience at the Boardwalk Villas was very positive. The grounds and lobby were beautiful. Service at the check-in desk and bell services was outstanding. I would highly recommend requesting a room on the upper floors as close as possible to the elevators to reduce noise and walking. Those hallways are long! Our room was very nice and clean. We had a studio with a queen bed and a pullout sofa, which was fine for out two young kids. Being able to walk or take a boat to Epcot and Hollywood Studios was a huge plus and basically our main reason for choosing the Boardwalk. The boat ride is nice and relaxing vs. taking a bus. One downside I should mention was that after staying at the Pop Century, which had a food court, we found the food selections at the Boardwalk to be inconvenient and overpriced. I didn't think this would be such an issue, but it was. In hindsight, I wished we would have stayed at the Beach Club Villas across the lake for this reason alone as it has a food court.

There is a riverboat to Hollywood Studios (or a long walk), a bus to Disneyworld, the monorail between parks, and the boardwalk, outside, so we never had to drive anywhere.

I was there with my wife and two sons, 3 years old and 10 months. My parents also came. Basically it was two joining rooms. 1 room was larger than the other. The larger room had a whirlpool, washer dryer, king size bed, full kitchen and livingroom with a pullout sofa bed. The other room had a queen bed, with a sofa bed and a small refrigerator and an area to wash dishes. A huge savings was to have food delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival. We did not do any cooking, however just to have snacks for the kids, muffins, donuts, PBJ, yogurt, cheerios, etc.. was great. Since we had to play things by ear due to naps it was great to have nosh in the room. Plus we also ordered bottled water, canned soda, milk, etc.. We also packed snacks, PBJ in a backpack for the parks. You will really be suprised how much $ you can save on just eating out once per day vs. three times. My wife and I ended up under budget on our stay because of this. They delivered the food to the hotel prior to me checking in. I placed the order online about 4 days prior to leaving for Disney. They recommend you do it ASAP. I ordered from gardengrocer.com. Bell services received the food and kept it in a refigerator until we checked in, that was a GREAT service. To know we had a stocked kitchen when checking in was awesome. We were able to check in early too which was nice. The check-in was painless, your room key also held your entry to the parks. You can also charge things using your room key if you set that up at check in with a credit card. The pool at the Boardwalk was okay. My 3 year old could not go on the slide as the slide warns that its for advanced swimmers. The Yacht Club looked like it had a nicer pool. The leaping horse libations /cabana located next to the pool was nice. For under $5 you can get a PBJ sandwich, carrots, and apple sauce. The location of the hotel was great. 7 min walk to Epcot or 1 stop on the ferry. Disney's Hollywood Studios (formerly MGM) is about a 20 min ferry ride. Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom and Downtown Disney all about 20-25 min bus ride. Bus pick up is in front of the hotel. Walking path to Epcot and/or Hollywood Studios is in the back of the hotel off the boardwalk. The boardwalk itself was very nice. There were a lot of street performers at night, and it was really lit up a night, very festive. I ate at ESPN CLUB which had the most moderately priced menu. Average entree was anywhere $13-$16. Also ate at the Big River which was a little more expensive than ESPN. Food was okay, nice beer selection as it makes all its own beer. Spoodles and Flying Fish Cafe required reservations. However after 9pm you might be able to get in. Flying Fish had a very expensive menu. Jelly Rolls which is a dueling piano bar has a $10 cover and has drinks only. The dance hall which is a music club has no cover but I did not go there. If your planning to eat anywhere at Epcot or if you plan any character meals make your reservations ASAP. I called the dining hotline and just about . every restaurant and character dinner was booked. I was able to get on a waiting list for Germany. One of the best services that the Boardwalk offers is the airline/luggage check in. That was fantastic. We didn't have to worry about bags or anything.

Our room was a little far from the elevator but not too bad the elevators always ran smooth and usually never a long wait. The rooms were the cleanest I have ever stayed in. We had a washer/dryer, kitchen which furnished all appliances and dishes, utensils, dishsoap, papertowels. The beds were awesome - the kids loved the fold out sleeper in the living area.

You can always ask for more towels or whatever you need and they gladly give them to you. Also you can request your room to have a full cleaning but they charge for it.

Some value places we found to eat were right on the boardwalk with the little stands set up. Chicken fingers and chicken sandwich meals were $7.00 and the kids loved it. Also if you go to the General Store things are a lot higher than a Krogers - we bought our pop, juice, and beer at a gas station in walking distance called Hess and they have the same prices as we pay at home. Also another plus was you could take your own drinks down to the pool area. The parks are nice but expect the long lines and hot humid days during summer.

The utensils in the kitchen were not thoroughly cleaned - there was food stuck to the forks. Good thing I bought plastic utensils for our trip. After the first two nights we checked into a studio. It seemed cleaner but the toilet was wobbly, wallpaper was coming off and the light in the bathroom was very dim.

This would not have been our first choice otherwise. This review is intended for those seeking to compare a Boardwalk Villa studio to other properties, either on or off WDW grounds. Studios do not have full kitchens (but do have a kitchenette), DVD players (I'd missed that detail, so I'd brought DVD's for my son but had nothing to watch them on), nor washer/dryers (although there is a free laundry room on the first floor, which I'd discovered on our last day - you only pay for the detergent). I believe all the above are included in 1-bedroom and larger units (we wanted a 1-bedroom, but none were available). Our room overlooked the Luna Pool. At first I thought this would be too noisy, but it turned out okay. It's only noisy during the day when you're up anyway. It's quiet at night when nobody's in the pool. We were able to see the fireworks our first night. This was our first time staying on a Disney property, so I cannot compare it to other DVC resorts. My first impression upon arrival was how lovely the resort is. The lobby area is nice, and the whole boardwalk area has a great vibe. However, when I entered the room, all I could think about was how dated and worn it was. Although the paint seemed fairly fresh, and the carpet was newly cleaned, the drapes and old-fashioned bedspread (germ factory) need updating. The bathroom is poorly lit, and has that irritating fan that goes on automatically when the light is turned on (so you can't leave the light on all night as a nightlight due to the noise). The person who cleaned our room never wiped down the bathroom sink properly as the faucet had toothpaste spray from the last guest (I had to wipe it down), and the little whiskers my husband shook out of his razor from his morning shave remained there the duration of our stay. That left me to wonder what else in the room hadn't been cleaned. As we are not DVC members, our room was \"cleaned\" each day, with fresh towels, bed made, and coffee and cups replaced. We called engineering about two maintenance problems (broken cabinet door, plugged up bathroom sink), which were both fixed in a timely manner. What I liked: -Location. Easy walk to Epcot. We also walked to Hollywood Studios, which was very pleasant. We took the boat back from Hollywood Studios, which made several stops first (Swan, Dolphin, Yacht and Beach Clubs), so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. Boardwalk is great. -Pool. Theme parks? What theme parks? My son was content to go down that spiral slide all day long. -Towels. Nice and fluffy, unlike the worn sheets. -Fold out couch. Actually more comfortable than the bed. Amazing. -The convenience of staying on-site, such as the Extra Magic Hours and the free parking (we drove to Animal Kingdom). -Disney-style service and friendliness (other than our housekeeper who couldn't clean a sink). What I didn't like: -The aforementioned datedness of decor. -The aforementioned iffiness on the cleanliness. -The morning bus to the Magic Kingdom made several stops before getting there, and was standing room only. When you're trying to take advantage of Morning Extra Magic Hours, maybe they could run the shuttles more efficiently. -Not sure if it's worth it. We paid rack rate which is a LOT. Maybe it's worth it if you're on points, or if it's not high season. The rooms at the Boardwalk are \"just okay\". If you're not paying much, the location might make them worth it.

We walked into Epcot just for a lunch a couple times because it was so close!

For 5 fabulous nights we stayed in a 1-bedroom standard view suite. We overlooked the front entrance (opposite side of the boardwalk) but heard very little noise. We were ~5 rooms away from the fastest elevators - longest wait was 15 seconds - no kidding! Other reviews I read described the floral decor as dated and although it was not my taste it wasn't annoying. The kitchen was equipped with everything - stove, microwave, fridge with freezer, dishwasher, toaster and the all imporant coffee maker. Dishes, mugs, silverware is also included right down to dish soap and fresh sponge. But remember to bring basket type (not cone) filters unless you want to use a paper towel. We had groceries delivered from Garden Grocer (excellent selection and service!) which made for easy breakfasts in the room. There is also a loud washer and dryer in the room. The pull-out sofa was cleverly designed with the attached cushions stashed under the very comfy queen-sized bed - no complaints from our well-rested kids. A TV with DVD/VCR player, table, breakfast nook, 4 dining chairs & 1 reading chair completed the room. The master bedroom had a wonderful king-sized bed, reading chair and TV in armoire/dresser combo. Each room had its own balcony with 2 chairs and table. The bathroom was split into 2 spaces with a sink in each. The master bath had a wirlpool tub while the other had a steam shower and toilet. We had plenty of fluffy towels (the good ones!) and did not mind that we only had towel and trash service on the 4th day of our stay. The lobby is decorated beautifuly with lots of whimsical touches. A large round banquette topped with a carousel and the flying horses chandelier were my favorites. Check-in was quick with no wait. The staff could not have been nicer - especially bell services. Every area was clean and sparkling - kudos to housekeeping. The pool was being renovated and we had the option of using the Beach/Yatch clubs' pool but it was too cold for swimming during our stay. Activities on the boardwalk are numerous and we were disappointed we did not have more time to enjoy them - especially the night-time street performers who drew large crowds despite cool weather. We did rent a surrey bike and had a blast pedaling our kids around. The ESPN club was packed on Sunday and looked like a great place to watch a game. Our son loved the arcade attached to the club as well as the arcade next to the fantastic gym - muscles and bustles. Don't miss out on the fantastic bakery - worth the extra time on the stairmaster! I am still savoring their cheesecake brownie - beyond delicious. The shops were nice with very pleasant clerks. We wished we had time to try the Big River Grill & Brew Works. The BoardWalk is located between Epcot and Disney Hollywood Studios (still MGM to me!) Both are an easy 10-15 minute walk - note there is no bus service from the BoardWalk to these parks. There is a boat that runs between the parks but it also stops at the Swan and Beach/Yatch Clubs. So unless the boat is at the dock it is usually faster to walk to and from MGM (or get off at the Swan and walk over the bridge which joins the Swan & Dolphin to the boardwalk area.) The boat goes directly to & from BoardWalk and Epcot but again it is faster to walk unless the boat is at the dock. The buses from Downtown Disney, Animal and Magic Kingdoms also make numerous stops and we found it faster to get off at the Swan (usually the 1st stop) and then walk over the bridge. Despite the chilly nights January is a wonderful time to visit WDW - low crowds meant very few lines and easy navigation through the parks. We found the Unofficial Guide to be a great resource and their crowd level calendar ([-]) was right on. Definitely buy the book for more information you will ever need and for the touring plans - big time savers.

We stayed at the BoardWalk Villas from December 5th - 11th. The weather was fantastic with sunny skies and temps ranging in the mid-70's to low 80's for our entire stay! We really enjoyed our 1 bedroom villa (#5026) and highly recommend the villas if your budget can allow it. Our room was a corner unit at the end of the hall overlooking the pool and canal to MGM. I read a lot of reviews about the elevator being far away, and if you consider a 3-4 minute walk to the elevator \"far\" then yes it's far. We were at the corner of this property and never felt that the walk to the elevator was daunting. We used the stairs a lot just for the convenience factor but I understand that if you have a stroller this is not an option. Here are some specific observations: *The Magical Express bus service from and to the airport was great! *Room was clean and the daily maid service was nice. You don't get daily service if you're a vacation club member. *Having the extra bedroom was great as it allowed our four year old to sleep in comfort without us having to worry about waking him up. Whirlpool tub as well as the washer and dryer were also nice options. *The pool was fun, though my son spent most of his time in the smaller kiddie pool. He was intimidated by the clown slide, but not because of the clown but rather the height and speed. Pool was heated though the heater was down one day we swam. *Internet access is $9.95 per 24 hours of service. They did supply an ethernet cable in the room if needed. *Holiday decorations were up and everything looked very festive. *Staff was overall very friendly. I will tell you that if you stay anywhere for a week you're bound to run into an employee that isn't having a good day. Don't let this ruin your stay, just move on. During our stay I saw several instances throughout Disney where families were up in arms about very trivial things. It seems like a waste of time and energy to me. *Walk to Epcot was about 10 minutes or less. If the boat isn't sitting at the dock, it's much quicker to just walk. If you're planning on taking the monorail at the front of Epcot, you're going to be looking at a 20-30 minute walk from the Boardwalk to the loading point. *Boat ride to MGM is about 15-20 minutes from the Villas once you get on the boat. You can also walk to MGM if you like, which may be quicker than waiting for a boat. I was told there was no bus service to MGM from the Boardwalk. *Bus service between WDW theme parks was overall very nice and seem to run about every 20-30 minutes. Keep in mind that if there is a wheelchair or scooters on the bus that it does take time to off load and load these so this can increase wait times. Be patient and if you REALLY need to be somewhere on time, don't push your luck and go early. *I read a post that you can get \"protective\" rubber sheets or padded sheets from housekeeping at all WDW Resorts to protect the mattress from potential bedwetters. All I can say is that the Boardwalk Villas didn't have this and it would be wise to call ahead to your resort to confirm this if you think you'll need it. I asked the maid for this and she came up with a nice solution and provided me with what looked like the inner liner of a shower curtain. While my son is 99% potty trained, we felt it best to do what we could to protect the pullout mattress. Being at Disney we knew he would be extra tired and this can certainly be a contributor for bedwetting accidents. *If you're a family with young children and plan to spend most of your time at Magic Kingdom, you may want to stay somewhere closer. Location can't be beat if you're going to spend a lot of time at Epcot and MGM. *We ordered groceries online from GardenGrocer that were delivered to our hotel and left with the Bell Hop. Highly recommend this if you need to order a larger quantity of food. The grocery store on the boardwalk does have a few items but the selection is limited and it is pricey. *Entertainment on the boardwalk is fun, though we were pretty beat at the end of the day so we didn't see too much. *We ate at the Boma restaurant at Animal Kingdom Lodge one night and since there was no direct bus back to the Boardwalk Villas we took a van taxi. For 4 adults and 3 children in our group, it was only $13. We thought it was money well spent as the kids were getting tired. The other option was to take a bus back to one of the theme parks (Animal Kingdom) and then catch another bus back to the Villas, which could take some time. *We were on the Disney Dining Plan and we thought it was well worth it! Be aware you do get a lot of food and finicky eaters will be harder to please. Overall, we had an excellent trip and can't wait to return, though we'll probably try another resort to mix things up. I highly recommend going during the non-peak periods as the it was crowded enough as it was. Also, be sure to go when the parks first open as the first 3 hours had very minimal waiting times for rides.

We stayed in a 1-bedroom villa, so we had a separate master bedroom, with a king-size bed, large soaking tub and separate sink area, which joined with the common bathroom (shower, toilet, sink). Then there was separate living area (couch and TV), eating area with table and chairs, and a generously sized kitchen. Though we have stayed at many Disney hotels and have come to Disney World at least 15 times, this was our first stay in accommodations which have a kitchen and living area. I must say it was really great. This trip was rather short for us, so we didn't have the chance to make much use of the kitchen (which was well stocked with nice dishes, glasses and silverware), but we could see how it could really increase your comfort level while at Disney World, especially for longer stays. There is so much to see and do while at the theme parks and other attractions, that it is really nice to be able to retreat into your room, have snacks available there, and know that when you wake up in the morning, you can make coffee, toast, or whatever you might like, and not have to drag yourselves out to a restaurant for breakfast or to get a cold drink. Disney World tends to tire you out severely (or that is our experience because we go and go) and it is really great to have a \"room\" that is more of a home base than just a bed and a bathroom. Of course, it does come with a price - we paid $540 per night (including tax) for the one-bedroom villa. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept on and it was very appreciated. The large counter space in the master portion of the shared bath was really nice. This accommodation is set up so that you can truly unpack (large closet, bathroom drawers, kitchen cabinets) and feel like it's your little home for while you are there. I will say that perhaps the maintenance/upkeep seems a little more lax on the Villas (timeshare) side than on the Inn side. We experienced moldy areas in the shower, loose doorknobs, drawers with missing drawer pulls, etc..If you remain aware of how much you're paying per night, this can actually start to be irritating, but it's important to remember that a large part of the amount you are paying each night is to be so close to Epcot and MGM - plus you have the draw of the Boardwalk. In our opinion, the Boardwalk is the best place to stay on the whole Disney property (all 47 square miles). I think next time, we will stay longer, and pay the additional amount per night for a preferred view IF that means that your room opens up to the Boardwalk - that would be really nice. We ate at 3 restaurants on the Boardwalk this trip: The Big River Grille, the ESPN restaurant and Spoodles. Our meal at the Big River Grille was only average at best, and we quickly racked up a $100 bill. The food was disappointing, certainly, but it was nice to sit outside on the Boardwalk. The ESPN restaurant was far less expensive - I believe our bill was under $30, but we only had nachos, iced tea and a chicken sandwich. I would only eat here again, though, if there were no other options, as it didn't stand out. We do love Spoodles, though, and breakfast there is always a hit. They have great coffee, good food, decent prices, and the atmosphere is a wonderful mix of Mediterranean decor. Finally the Boardwalk does have a cute little bar not far off from the lobby, which we have enjoyed before because it was quiet and relaxing, but we found that on a Saturday night after the fireworks, it was crowded and understaffed. They do stock a nice selection of liquors which cannot go unmentioned.

We love the convenience of the full kitchen and laundry room in the room.

We stayed there for one week and it worked out fantastic for us! We had a 1 Bedroom and it was perfect for us. We decided that we had one of the best views in the whole place. Our balcony overlooked the boardwalk and we could see the fireworks from Epcot every night. We were within walking distance to Epcot, which worked out very nicely for us, since we were on the Disney Dining Plan. We did not think it was too noisy at all. Our room was right above a restaurant and it really wasn't that bad. We traveled with our 2 1/2 year old and he never woke up from it. Our son slept in the pullout and it worked out perfectly. The hotel provided us with bed rails and he thought it was great. One of his favorite things was eating breakfast every morning on the balcony. We did love going to the Boardwalk Bakery every morning for a cup of coffee before heading out for the day. The location was so convenient for us. We would do the park hard all morning, return back to our hotel for the nap and then head back out. One of my sons favorite things about the boardwalk is the nightly entertainment, or as he called them \"the silly men\". they are just people who are walking around the boardwalk and juggling, doing magic tricks or a combination of both. He was mesmerized by them! Our rooms were clean and very nice. The decor isn't my taste, but it was clean and nice and that is all that matters to me. Since this is part of the Disney Vacation Club, there is no housekeeping, they do take out the trash and gave us new towels once while we were there . The pool was nice, but it was not something my son got into. He was too small to use the water slide, and frankly the giant clown is kinda freaky. The pool at Saratoga Springs is our favorite! The elevators are far away and it was a bit of a hike to get to them. The first day it seems the longest, but after that, you get kinda used to it. But since we did stroller my son it made it much easier and faster to get him to the elevator. The elevator thing would not be something to deter us from coming back. Customer Service by each cast member was friendly and prompt. When we arrived the bedrails were not there like we asked. We simply called down and within minutes they were at our door.

We waited until a few minutes after 4 to inquire about our room, only to be told that it was not ready yet. As we walked away from the desk, the manager happened by and asked if everything was OK, well after spending an hour chasing 2 little ones we told him that we were ready to go to our room but apparently it was not ready yet. His response was courteous and prompt. In less than 3 minutes he had us changed to another room and we were on our way, in fact he took our room number and had our luggage delivered immediately!!! The pool area is fantastic and was a comfortable temperature for February. We had the 1 bedroom suite and I slept on the pullout couch with one of the toddlers. It was very comfortable, definitely not your typical pullout couch. We called the desk to ask if they had bedrails for the toddlers and we were told that they could bring them up, the girl answering the phone said \"We are in the middle of shift change so it might be an extra few minutes, is that ok?\" We told her that yes we would be in our room for a while, well in less than 10 minutes we had the bedrails and an apology that it \"took so long\".

Didn't worry us at all as we had the suite as well but I would caution those looking for a luxury holiday that the studio will possibly not meet expectations. Location, as others have noted, is excellent. We found the walk to MGM a little to long with children but the ferry service was frequent enough that this did not matter. Transport to other parks and downtown disney was very efficient. Service was also very very good - I don't know what it is but Disney sure motivates their staff. Only poor service the whole holiday was at Spoodles restaurant (which I thought was overrated in any event). On that note, the Disney dining plan offers excellent valueand I recommend it. We bought some groceries at Goodings supermarket and ate in the room twice which gave us enough credits to eat at some of the high end restaurants - great value.

There was also visible rust on the inside door frame in the bathroom. 2) the microwave worked properly, but would randomly start entering \"4s\" on it's own.
