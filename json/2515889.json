The 2 bedroom apartment was huge with a washer/dryer which we used often, even better to arrive home with cases full of clean clothes! Everything you could want in the kitchen and they supplied tea towel, dishwasher powder, washing up liquid and kitchen roll. Bathrooms were clean and plenty of towels and shampoo/conditioner/soap and the walk in shower was massive. Whirlpool bath an added bonus to soak those aching feet after a day at the parks. Hairdryers in bathrooms were pretty powerful too. Plenty of space in the living area and tv in all rooms. Used the pool and hot tub several times (pool towels provided) and the sun is on the loungers next to the pool from about lunchtime to late afternoon but not actually on the pool itself. The sun deck had the sun all day and it was fun to spot the fish & turtles swimming in the lake. The hotel offers a free courtesy bus to Seaworld which leaves at 8.10am arrives Seaworld by 8.30 and then goes on to Universal to arrive by 9am. We used this shuttle a few times as it suited us but the one to Magic Kingdom went rather later in the morning and we like to get to parks early to try and do most of the rides before it gets busy which it did do as we went during the Easter holidays.

It is everything that they present it to be on the website. I read all the reviews before chosing this hotel and I was concerned. Thankfully it was a very pleasant experience. We have two teenagers who were pleased to have their own room! This is a change because when we travel we always stay in the same room and it can be a bit crowded. This was the most spacious hotel room we ever had. The two bedroom is the way to go if you are traveling with family. The washer and dryer were also a bonus. We intended to cook in , but never got around to doing so. We did not eat in the restraunt, (aside from a stale bagel) but the surrounding area offers so many options. I did not give this the full 5 rating for a few reasons. First, the restraunt is so small and the bar area is small as well. We booked through expedia so we got the 14th floor. We seemed to be the only ones on the floor and the hotel was not full so I'm sure we could have gotten another room. The problem with the 14th floor was the noises from the wind and other noises from the roof that I can't explain (1409 was our room). It bothered me the first night, but then I got used to it. People we met in the lobby said switching rooms was a pain so we didn't pursue that option. The check in process was slow and the pool gets shaded after a certain time of the day so you are limited to sun on the pool deck. The do have a sun deck attached to the property, but it is buggy. The cleanliness of this hotel was top notch. My husband is a hotel snob so if he was pleased I'm sure most of the population would be. The good out weighs the bad with this hotel. Our t.v. was not working and someone came and fixed it promptly. The room was always attended to while we were gone and there were plenty of towels. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is not in a busy part of International Dr. and yet it was close to the attractions. We did not use the transportation to and from parks because the times were not what we were looking for in our arrival and departure. (We like to get going early and return early). The drive to the parks was simple so we didn't mind paying the parking fee. The concierge was very helpful in our trips to the park. I would definately stay at this hotel again if we ever return to the area.

First of all, this is a hotel, not a resort. There are no amentities other than valet parking that you wouldn't find at a moderately priced hotel chain. What they do have going for them are newer, large \"condo style\" rooms that are priced like a standard hotel room, so if you are looking for value, consider this. We stayed 4 nights March 18-22, 2012. We had problems that took more than one conversation to get resolved. We arrived late, (10:15pm). We were put in the ADA accessible 2br unit. The master room was fine, but the 2nd br had a king when we were expcting 2 doubles for our 2 kids. The sliding door to the balcony was locked with a special lock that only hotel staff can open. Called downstairs, night manager said \"all 2br units are two kings, that none have what the website shows, but you can check tomorrow and we'll move you to a 3br for the same price.\" Left to go to grocery store, stopping by front desk to ask about lock - \"I'll send someone up right away\". Returned from store, door still locked. Called downstairs - new front desk person: \"sorry, we had high school kids staying recently and we lock them so they can't hang out on balconies, but only maintenance can open them and the maintenance people are all gone.\" Next morning, realized a doorknob on bathroom and a lounge chair in living room was broken, propped up on a broken leg...told the front desk on the way to disney. Came back, asked about the previously mentioned upgrade to a 3br....new manager: \"only the ADA 2br units have 2 kings, we can move you to a 2br that has a king master and two doubles in the 2nd bedroom\".....so it took 3 conversation with 3 different people to get what the website said we would get.....frustrating to say the least. This hotel is a great value, but it is obvious where they cut costs: it is newer and clean, but certainly lower end furniture in rooms, low number of staff, beds not real comfortable, etc. Pool area not cleaned until mid-morning, ordered pizza from the onsite restaurant - took 45 minutes. And the previous reviewers were right, the pool area is in the shade, no sun. Also, had some guests in the pool late (after 10pm) making some noise which echoes through the U shaped building design which was a distraction. The bottom line is this: if you are looking for a low priced clean hotel that you can put a family of 4 in one unit, convenient to disney - easy 10-15 minute drive - this is your place.

Will return!\u201d", "Author": "michtraveler81", "ReviewID": "UR126385567", "Content": "We just came back from Orlando about 5 days ago. I booked a 1 bedroom suite at Lake Eve just over a month ago. I was a little worried about what some of the reviews had stated. We just stayed for 4 nights but I wish we would have taken a longer vacation. The room at Lake Eve was wonderful!!! It is so much better than the typical hotel room (which are basically bedrooms with a toilet and shower). Even though we had the smallest on the rooms available, it was so spacious! The pictures on Lake Eve's website are what you get! The kitchen had full sized appliances (fridge, stove, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker). Basic kitchen supplies are provided (mixing bowls, pitcher, cooking tools, knives, silverware, wine glasses, glass tumblers, coffee mugs, plates, scrapers, pot holders, placemats, pots, pans). Also, dishwashing liquid and dishwasher powder was provided. Right off the kitchen were two bi-folding closet doors. One contained the heating/cooling until for the individual room. The other housed the stacked washer and dryer. Laundry detergent is not provided. Before leaving on our trip, I bought some single-use Tide packets in the sample section at my local Walmart.... Worked great and was acceptable for airlines 3-1-1 rule to carry liquid. Next is the dining/ living area. Our room had a nice round dining table with 4 chairs. The living area had a chair (which really was not very comfortable), and a couch which folded out to provide more sleeping space. A coffee table was there along with an end table and two lamps were in the living area also. There was a LCD tv on a rather tall tv stand. My daughter was happy as the tv received Nickelodeon and the Disney channel. The tv, however, did not receive HD-quality programming. A remote to the tv was provided, as was a channel listing in the hotel guide binder that is in the room. There is a ceiling fan also located in the living area. The bedroom was nice! We had a one bedroom suite which included 2 queen sized beds. Bedding was nice and comfy. Each bed was set with 4 pillows each. There was a nightstandin between the two beds which had a lamp on it, a 2nd telephone and an alarm clock. The alarm clock actually had the cord to plug into your jack on your phone to utilize the clock/radio as a speaker for your phone or mp3 player. And like always, a Holy Bible was provided. There was a nice dresser in the bedroom. Had 6 wide drawers. Atop the dresser was an LCD tv. Again, a remote was provided for that tv also. There is a closet in the bedroom that contains several hangers, a shelf, an iron and ironing board and the in-room safe to store valuables. It's a digital safe and you use your own passcode. There is also a ceiling fan in the bedroom. Right outside the bathroom and bedroom is a linen closet. Provided in the closet was a complete set of bedding, extra towels, and two extra pillows. The bathroom was nice. Again we had a 1 bedroom suite so it was not the \"master bath\" seen in the pictures online. It had a tall granite-topped sink. A good amount of towels were provided upon check in. A towel bar was right by the sink, as was a hairdryer. Bar soap, shampoo and conditioner was provided. The bath shower was a tad bit strange. The bath was a wide jacuzzi tub surrounded by tiled walls. The showerhead was fixed and was not a handheld head. Iam 5'4\" and it was almost too high up for me to reach, even on tip-toes. The water was always hot and a constant temperature. I took several very long showers and there was never a fluctuation in water temp. Another towel bar is located right outside of the shower. There are two seperate switches in the bathroom, onefor the lights and the other for the exhaust fan. We ate a couple times at the restaurant downstairs. It was good. Not too pricey and decent food. Hotel staff was ALWAYS friendly!!! They said bye and hi to us as we came and went. All maids were friendly, as were all the maintenence staff. The pool is vacuumed and cleaned every morning!!! The jacuzzi was also cleaned in the morning and the pH levels were always being checked. I will surely be staying here again if we visit Orlando in the future. It is a nice, clean hotel. Our 5 year old daughter loved it!!! Do not hesitate to pick Lake Eve Resort. It is very well maintained with all amenities you need. It is located in a quiet, yet growing area on I-drive. Although walking to some stores is possible, it really isn't practical. There is a new Walgreens being built close by but is not complete yet. There is also a Publix really close by. I highly recommend staying here.... Especially with a family. You aren't crammed into a single room like other hotels. Also the private balcony was great! They provide 4 patio chairs and two small patio side tables. There is also a patio light that can be used :) I hope you find my review helpful and if I forgot anything, I'll be sure to add it!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Gerry R", "ReviewID": "UR126157781", "Content": "We were very happy with this resort.

Not a huge deal, but they didn't even bother to mention it to us or ask if we were okay with that......as I said, I booked this like 8 months ago and I had been looking at pictures since then, so it was sad to arrive and get a room that was very different from all the pictures....totally different layout, VERY low counters in the kitchen, no drawers....it was just something I wish they would have asked us before just sending a young married couple who is quite obviously not handicapped into that room. The room was still pretty nice - although the dishwasher seemed to just be sitting under the counter without being properly installed. Everytime we went to open it, it practically fell out! Didn't seem safe. Our bathroom was also altered for someone in a wheelchair, which kind of took any of the romance out of it....having a handicap seat thingy right smack in the open of the master bath. Like i said, not horrible - but just not what we were expecting and we were not warned. As we went to check out, I mentioned that it would have been nice if they told us about the handicap room - the girl looked at me like I was an alien and said nothing.

When we called downstairs we were told that housekeeping wasn't available. We mentioned it again in the morning, were told that all sheets would be changed but they weren't - had to wait until the next day and 2 more conversations until they were. Once this was sorted, we had a great holiday - the hotel has an excellent location for all the main theme parks and I-Drive.

We payed for the kids triple play room rate but never got the kids goody bag they tell you on the site your supposed to get. Not even sure what that was, it was never mentioned. We were rushed through check in then they walked off. The rooms were nice and clean. We did have 3 light bulbs that were out and our living room chair was broken. We called the front desk and they did send a maintenance man up quickly to fix replace them. He was very nice, my husband told him about the chair just so they would know and not try to charge us when we left. He laughed and said no need to worry about that. I guess they are used to broken chairs. The hotel was nice and quiet, pool was pretty but we got in it once and it was extremely cold, the hot tub was not hot so my kids used that as the pool. We spent most of our time at the parks so didn't stay at the hotel much but we liked our rooms and loved having a washer and dryer. We rented a car so decided to use that and not mess with the shuttle. We spent one day at cocoa beach and the kids loved that, almost more than Disney.

We always look for a hotel suite or multiple rooms when we vacation. Lake Eve was perfect! We searched through Booking.com for a good deal & this was the best we found. A 3 bedroom suite for $149! I questioned whether it was in a good area & whether it was a nice place. We looked at the reviews & the worst reviews were that it didn't have free wi-fi in the rooms so we did a little research on the hotel website and found out that's not even true. When we arrived there was free valet parking, which was a plus. When we got to our room, we were VERY happy. The kitchen was very spacious. The dining table was large enough for all of us. The living area was ample. The balcony was huge! We had a view of the beautiful pool & lake. The bedrooms were a good size and warm & cozy. Bathrooms were pretty & clean. Everything seemed new & updated, We did have free wi-fi in our room. We ALL got a good night sleep, also, as the beds were very comfortable. We have nothing negative to say about our room. We were in Orlando to go to Universal. I almost didn't book Lake Eve because I wanted something close to Universal. But since we were so close to I-4 it didn't take long to get there and it was very EASY to get there. We loved that Lake Eve was situated on a quiet area of International Drive and yet so close to I-4. The only downer to our stay was in the morning when we all wanted breakfast. There was a breakfast buffet for $8 or you could order a la carte items. The buffet reminded us of nicer continental breakfast bars we've had at other hotels for free-- not worth $8. Some of the a la carte items on the menu looked good & reasonably priced but we opted to go out to breakfast where there was more variety. We went to the Denny's down the street. We ARE NOT Denny's fans-- we never go at home. But we were starving! This Denny's was actually not bad--we were pleasantly surprised! We are very happy that we ended up at Lake Eve.

The actual apartment was fantastic, we booked a 2 bedroomed apartment for 2 of us as this was the only accomodation left at this particular hotel, first impression was absolutely beautiful, spotlessly clean, view was gorgeous right over lake eve. Beds where comfortable, kitchen had all the utensils needed for a comfortable stay although we barely used them, ate out most nights. Jacuzzi bath in the ensuite bathroom was excellent, really relaxing after a very early busy day out. The best thing was the hotel was very quiet so had no issues with getting to sleep on an evening which can sometimes be an issue in a large hotel, but it was fantastic no problems with noise, even though the hotel was busy. Cleaners where very friendly and kept our room perfectly clean. The pool area was lovely, very clean, beautifully kept, cant comment on the restaraunt or snack bar at the hotel as we never ate from them. Location of the hotel at the VERY bottom of international drive, an I-Trolley stop is located just outside the entrance of the hotel, which suited us perfectly as we did not hire a car, but the i-trolley does stop at approx 10.30pm on an evening so you would have to use a taxi if you want to stay out any later for drinks or meal etc. The location is not a not an issue if you hire a car or use the i-trolley. The nearest shop is approximately a 15 minute walk south down international drive to the 'Publix' supermarket and there are a few eateries around that area, such as Subway, a Chines takeaway and Pizza Takeaway. Overall a lovely hotel I would reccomend it to friends and family, the only major let down is some of the members of staff who at times did not make us feel welcome, which is really uncomfortable. This is not aimed at all members of staff, as some in particular where absolutely brilliant and went out of their way to help us.

The alarm in our room was so loud, it could have woken the dead. I didn't call the front desk, we just evacuated as were told. I don't know what the previous poster wanted from an $8.00 per hour 3rd shift desk clerk who is answering about 100 calls from people who can't follow directions in an emergency, but whatever. We did have to walk down 11 flights of stairs, then back up a couple hours later. The 10-15 fire engines and firefighters going in and out told me that something was going on and that was good enough for me. Lucky I remembered to grab the keys to my rental car before leaving my room, so the kids were able to sit in the car and watch movies (Although fire trucks and rescue squads are more exiting to 8 and 12 year olds.) Most people were stuck sitting or standing on the pavement. When we checked out on Saturday, there was a letter posted offering an apoligy and explaining what happened. The hotel had no control over this and it is unfortunate, but life goes on. As far as the hotel, the rooms are very nice with seperate bedrooms and full kitchens, large bathrooms and showers, and flat screen tv's in every living and bedroom. The pool area is very nice, although several times no pool towels were available and empty drink containers and beer cans littered the pool area after a rainstorm. Overall very nice hotel. Walgreen's, Publix, CVS, and gas stations nearby. About 1.5 miles from Seaworld. The only complaint I have is the wireless internet was about the worst I have ever experienced from a hotel.

The rooms are modern, with fully equipped kitchens, multiple bedrooms, and new TV's in every room. Bathrooms are large, with whirlpool-style tubs and separate showers. The pool area is beautiful. The first impression was that this would be one of the best experiences ever! Unfortunately, we were awakened by a fire alarm at 12:30 am on a Friday. We were evacuated to the parking lot, where we remained until about 2:30 am, after walking down 13 flights of stairs. Apparently there was some issue that set off the sprinkler system on the 12th floor, and the sprinklers flooded the elevator shaft. The hotel cannot be responsible for a patron setting off an alarm, and safety is paramount, but the fire alarm did show the hotel's lack of preparedness for this type of event. 1.) The front desk staff did not know how to react when the alarm started. People were calling the front desk to ask if they should evacuate or if this was a system error, and the clerk could not answer. Fortunately, there was a hotel guest who was a retired fire fighter who walked the clerk through standard operating procedures such as identifying the fire panel, where the alarm was coming from, etc. 2.) During the two hours in the parking lot, there was no communication from the staff. Some guests were still on their balconies or stairway landings, and some floors were not evacuated at all. At about 2 am, staff members started handing out towels, what we were supposed to do with them I'm not really certain (most used them as pillows). 3.) After the fire, the elevator shaft in question was understandable closed off, leaving just two elevators for a 14+ story building. Long lines (20 minutes+) formed for the remaining elevators throughout the weekend. 4.) There was never any explanation for the cause of the alarm, nor basic apology - Even a note slipped under the door stating the cause of the issue and any advice on the elevator challenges would have been a nice touch. Through the gossip channels, hotel guests seemed to conclude that the cause of the fire was a patron throwing a lit cigarette into a potted plant. This seemed plausible, since there were a number of people drinking at the pool area and in the hallways all weekend.

I booked and paid for 15 nights and have the booking invoice to prove this. We actually stayed 14 nights, the extra one we paid for was to accomodate our late flight home. When we first entered our room we found the place to be rather dirty, lights not working and the lights over the kitchen area flickering on and off. The cooker had not been cleaned since day one and mixed assortment of kitchen utensils were also dirty. The refrigerator had a broken drawer and the coffee maker was mouldy from the last pot of coffee to be made as the bag was still in there! We reported these faults to the desk and the broken drawer was replaced the next day. NOTHING ELSE WAS DONE! We asked 4 times for a change of room but finally gave in as we did not want to spend our holiday waiting at the reception desk. Having decided to clean the place to our standards we were even further dismayed to get no room service for 2 days which resulted in us washing our own towels. On our return I found I had been charged for an extra night and for the cost of the broken refrigerator drawer. I sent an email to Lake Eve asking for an explanation and had to resort to embarrassing them on Facebook to get an answer. This is when I found out about what the charges were for. I have emailed back to say we paid for the nights we stayed and sent proof and to also check their records to see that we reported the broken drawer. THEY HAVE NOW GONE QUIET AGAIN! NO REFUND AND NO CONTACT! I have visited Orlando over 20 times and have never had problems like this. Other hotels and resorts have been only too pleased to correct any faults that have occured and also seem pleased to welcome your business. Lake Eve is another matter! It has been reported on Tripadvisor before about the valet parking system they run at weekends. They form a one way system with traffic cones and put up a sign saying there is limited parking and to use valet parking. The car park is hardly the size of a football pitch so why on earth would anyone require valet parking. The idea is to get a few more dollars out of you. Maybe Lake Eve would care to reply to my comments on Tripadvisor as they do not seem to want to reply to me in person or give me back my money that was wrongfully taken from my credit card. The sales and marketing person responsible for this debacle is a certain Amanda Simon. Maybe one of her seniors would care to reply.

We could not fault anything..( A special mention to Rolando :) ) We booked our holiday on the basis of having a hotel room that was more like a villa than just a room with a bathroom. We had read the reviews and although there was a few negative comments ( none of which worried us) we believed we had picked the best hotel for ourselves and our children. When we arrived we were very happy with the location and the look of the hotel, we had a very easy check in, and made our way to our room. Lets say we stood there with our mouths opened when we opened the door. We had booked a two bedroom suite, and the floor space was not far of the size of a large flat.. It was huge, with a beautiful modern kitchen ( american fridge freezer, ice maker, water dispenser, dishwasher huge cooker and microwave, coffee machine toaster all the plates and utensils you would need for a family of four + ). The children were excited to explore all the different doors and what they would lead too. There was a huge family bathroom, a huge twin room ( the boys couldnt believe the size of their beds) and lots of storage and hanging space. There was also a flat screen tv.. In the master bedroom again it was beautifully furnished, flat screen tv, lots of storage safe, and a huge en-suite with a jacuzzi and walk in shower. The living are was very substancial with a dining area too. There was also a washer/dryer which was ingeniously designed and hid away. There was an abundance of towels, and extra bedding, and they even left washing up liquid, dishwasher powder and coffee. The staff could not be more helpful in any request, the cleaning staff were fantastic, and the pool was meticulously cleaned every morning. We were never hassled once for valet service which was mentioned in a previous review, if you wanted it you asked if you didnt then you just walked to your car. The car park was well lit and we never felt intimidated at all if we arrived after dark. There was a small shop which was reasonably priced, a nice restaurant, a gym ( which i really should have used ) a good size pool which was never too busy, computer access and free wireless internet. Another thing I would like to mention is that the shuttle bus was a FREE of charge bus, which you booked the evening before. The location was fantastic, we did not have to use the I4 once as we were able to get to disney/ universal/seaworld all by using international drive, 536 and universal boulevard. Walmart was off the 535 ( a five minute drive) disney 10 mins max, universal 10 mins and Seaworld you can see from your suite balcony. I would like to say we have had a variance of experience, as over the last four years we have stayed in 2 different villas ( one a pretigious gated community) and another hotel chain. This by far has been our personal favourite. We are holidaying in Florida October 2012 with a large party of our family, and we will definately be staying here.

First time in Florida. Checked into our room early evening. Room 111 on ground floor. Would have liked to be higher up for better views from balcony but knew we wouldn't be in the hotel much anyways. Booked with Thomson and was given a 2 bedroomed apartment which as most of the reviews state was more like a condo than an apartment. Absolutely huge, spotless, clean, massive bed, amazing bathroom. Could not fault it one little bit. Used kitchen once and made good use of washer and dryer. All worked fine. No hiccups. Water form shower was sometimes cold but just had to give it 5 minutes to warm up first. Jacuzzi bath got used a few times...especially to soak my aching feet! Electricity power struggled to cope with our high powered hairdryer and the one provided in the bathroom was just as weak. Speaking as a woman with long hair...you can see how this caused an inconvenience. Just had to bear with it during the holiday. Only lazed round the pool on one of our days. Poolside service was excellent. Food was lovely. Very clean and well kept surroundings. Ate in hotel restaurant for breakfast on 2 mornings. Buffet style. Excellent to fill you up ready for a full day at the parks. Also ate in restaurant on 2 evenings. Again, couldn't fault the food or service. Lake Eve is situated at the bottom of International Drive so my only gripe if I have to have one would be the overall location. And here are my reasons why....no restaurants around, had to take I ride trolley up to middle of International Drive. Public transport in Florida is a joke anyways (I will be hiring a car next time) and the taxi's that the front desk order you are so expensive. If you don't have a car I highly recommend using the free shuttle bus that the hotel provides on a morning to the parks. They are available back aswell at 7:30pm and 10:00pm. Did not use them for return travel as the times weren't always suitable but atleast you know you have the option there. Another note to mention about transport is the I ride trolley which travels up and down International Drive. Have to say I hated these things. Cramped, uncomfortable, felt like you were waiting ages for them to come and one of the drivers obviousely loved her job so much that she shouted at most of the passengers and made them feel stupid. Lake Eve is stop number 39 out of 41 so it takes almost an hour to get from Stop 10 to 39 if there are people at each stop along the way. Highly frustrating after a long day when all you want to do is get back to the hotel. (another reason why I will definitely hire a car next time) Rant over!", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201c5 Star Rating, Best service and friendly staff Best value.\u201d", "Author": "CasperFamily", "ReviewID": "UR108680196", "Content": "MY Family and I stayed for 8 days at Lake Eve Resorts, My wife and I and our 7 yr old son & our 9 yr old daughter.

We were also informed that the hotel was now full and they could not accommodate us for any of the five nights that we had pre-booked. They said that they had tried to contact me. I assured them that there was no way that my credit card could be declined and I checked all my voice mails, caller ids and emails only to find that they had not tried to reach me.

I found this very interesting - we all were there close to check-in time, the hotel was full and we are told that our credit cards were declined???? Upon further checking with my credit card company, I found out the reason my card was declined was because they entered the wrong expiry date. I am quite sure that I did not give them the wrong expiry date, but mistakes can happen and perhaps I did, or they entered it wrong. Regardless, they should not have given away our reservation without trying to contact us and they would not try to assist us to find another accommodation. We and the other group of people were all made to feel like lowly peasants that couldn't afford a room there. What I find also interesting in reading some reviews up my return, is that other customers have been told their credit cards were declined - is there a staff member there that doesn't know how to enter credit card numbers correctly OR is this their way of getting out of their pre-booked reservations when they can sell their rooms perhaps??? for a higher price?

Having read many of the reviews before booking my stay I knew there were some issues but figured most could be overcome with it being a 2010 Expedia Insiders pick resort. Turns out there were many other issues we faced. Here are the pros and cons of our stay: CONS: LIVING ROOM - Ceiling fan only worked on low setting. No switch on light to turn on or off. Moved the couch to find one of the TV remotes that went missing and apparently they don't vacuum back there - gross! Stiff furniture. KITCHEN - When I walked in the base of the stove was off the hinges and had to be put back together (they use all HOTPOINT (cheap) appliances in their units - Dishwasher was very loud. Lights would flicker on and off. Faulty power outlet. HALLWAYS/COMMON AREAS - Smelled terrible - sometimes fishy, mostly like old cheese/clammy. BEDROOMS - Beds were hard and lumpy. Banging noises on the walls and ceilings all hours of the day and night (thin walls - you can also hear everything in the hallway as you pass by rooms). No Bibles noted. CUSTOMER SERVICE - Night audit didn't take our credit card information upon arrival (booked thru Expedia) to pay for additional room tax - was woke up the next morning at 8am by the front desk manager asking us to bring our credit card down. Same person checked us out and couldn't get a receipt to print and also tried to tell us there was no additional charge for room tax! There was no response to my email request to upgrade to 2-bedroom unit with king size bed, even after it was offered to us for $10 more a night. We were bombarded with pizza delivery advertisements twice daily. Delivery guys would park in no parking zones or handicap spots while making deliveries to resort. CABLE TV - Service kept going out (they have nice flat screen TV's but very cheap cable service (grainy picture) - no HD). Power buttons on TV's didn't work and one of the remotes stopped working half way thru our stay. BATHROOM - The toilet seat was plastic and also crooked. Sink was plastic and cheap - wasn't even installed properly or broken. First night there, sat in the jacuzzi tub and had black things floating in the water (mold from the water lines?). Power outlet breaker kept tripping when running the blow dryer they have mounted on the wall. Sink was plugged up - didn't drain properly. No hot water for showers or sinks - warm at best, but mostly cold. No hand lotion. Very cheap paper products (sand paper like toilet paper). ROOM CARD KEYS - Kept self deactivating. Had to go to front desk to reactivate - other guests having same issue. PARKING - Every part of lot was marked with cones - they try to get you to use \"complimentary\" valet service - just park your car yourself, if you can find a spot. POOL AREA - Towels were all stained and discolored. Pre-showers were broken - 1 or 2 had a trickle of water that came out. No sun in pool area until afternoon. COMPUTER/INTERNET - SD card readers on computers do not work. SECURITY - Nigh security guard (older guy) sat in chair in lobby most of his shift. PROS: Very close to all the attractions. Good place to stay if your looking for a fairly clean unit and can overlook all the cons. It was nice to have a fridge and oven to use and feel at home with. Dishwasher came in handy, as did the in room washer/dryer unit. Soap/dryer sheets sold at reasonable price on site. Housekeeping staff kept dishwasher soap packets stocked. Condo had nice deck over looking the pool area. Made use of the sauna as well as the hot tub and pool. Staff was always pleasant to deal with, but need a little more training. We left the \"do not disturb\" card on the door so staff wouldn't come in our room. We came home every day with a bag of fresh towels and necessities hanging on door which was nice to have. Equipped with basic cooking necessities (pans, etc). Filtered water from the fridge. Good room layout, but small for anymore than 2 people. Over all a fairly decent place to stay if you can get a good internet deal. I wouldn't ever pay more than $100 a night to stay here - try a package deal instead with airfare or car rental included - much better value.

On the weekend nights, it did get a little more crowded, but the lot itself is small, so it's not a far distance. Pool - the pool is nice, but you will not get any sun as it sits behind the hotel, on the lake. Ads/Menus - Yes, during the afternoon, menus are slipped under the door from local pizzerias. We live in NY, so this was not something we were concerned about. Cleaning - The cleaning staff made the beds & cleaned up the towels. Any clean items in the dishwasher were taken out for you to use. The cleaning staff came once a day - if you were not ready at that time, they weren't able to come back later. Food - save yourself the hassle of trying to determine when/if the restaurant is open. You can easily go down the street to one of about 5 Publix grocery stores & pick up anything you need. This hotel had families, couples, and business travelers, but never felt crowded or too busy. The rooms are huge & new. They have all the amenities of home, which helps you save money when you're visiting the area. Having a full kitchen + washer & dryer is amazingly helpful. Although the hotel is on I-Drive, it is further away from the hectic parts & has very little traffic.

The day before we left I emailed to confirm our reservation, I received an email confirmation. The day we left one of my colleagues called to make sure that the hotel knew of our late check-in (our plane did not arrive until 11:30 pm). Upon arriving at the hotel, by this time it was past midnight, we were told that check-in was at 3:00 pm and since we were not there at the allotted time they had given our rooms away. Completely unacceptable! Needless to say we were very upset considering the difficulty we had in locating new rooms during the spring break in Orlando at 12:30 am. We were assured by the man/boy working the desk that our rooms were only given away for the night, and that the rest of our reservation was secured for the next day. Some of our team had to scramble to find another hotel for the night while I had to share 1 bedroom with 3 work colleagues. During this period the night desk person was very rude to us. The next day we tried to confirm the rest of our stay, and the day desk person told us that the entire reservation was given to someone else. Unbelieveable! We had booked for 5 days to attend a work function and were now homeless. The person at the desk actually said to my boss \"too bad, so sad\" The staff at this hotel are the most unprofessional that I have ever encountered. I'm sure they gave our rooms away to the first people that walked in off the street offering a kick back to them.

First of all,, It is a beatiful place, very nice, and appealing to the eye. Let me start with the Pro of Lake Eve: a) The pool is nice, but you can only get sun from 10 to 3 other then that you are in the shade.b) The inside of the room is like living in a condo, very nice. c) The washer and dryer were great when you came back from the beach. d) the view of the lake and pool are nice. e) the housekeeping was gracious to clean up everyday and leave clean towels for us, even though we asked them not to clean till our last day, Cons: a) the valet service was to eager to get your bags, park your car, and get your money,, We are young, and we can handle our luggage, They did not speak English, and did not feel comfortable with them driving our rental car, b) the bed was worst, I could hardly walk some mornings, the pillows are cheap, and I was thankful for the hot tub to help my back,,, c) the staff was over friendly at helping you at check in, very disppointed that I almosted needed a translater for them. There was a huge Language barrier until we checked out d) the bill came at check out, and they had failed to take out the deposit of 100.00, we had to stop and have them do that, the night clerk had no idea on what was going on,, really felt sorry for him, e) if you choose to not use the valet parking, parking is limited and there were not many places to choose from. I am not being critical, believe me- It was beatiful in side inside, except the few minor things, We did not try the breakfast there on site, and it really seemed to disappoint the check in clerk, but we had read the reviews. Would we stay here again, I really doubt it, I would of gone back over where we had stayed the previous year, it was in the heart of shopping, close to eating places, the pool got sun for several hours, there was no valet parking, the doors were locked to outside people, and I could sleep the entire night, without having a bad back.

They have complimentary valet parking however, the hotel was not that crowded while we were there so we didnt really need it. Beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were huge. We had double sinks in the master bath and a large walk in shower which was great. THis condo was great for any price when you are traveling with children of any age. The pool was heated and awesome. The location is conveinent to about everything and yet out of the hustle and bustle of the tourist stuff so it made it a much quieter stay. We ate breakfast in the room before we left out in the mornings and that saved us a good bit of money on a meal. While we did not cook much we were able to heat up left overs or simple things that again saved us from big meals out. We have stayed in both hotels and rental homes in Orlando and this by far beat them both.

After getting our rental car we headed to the area of resort which took maybe 10 minutes. We knew check in wasnt for 3 hours so we headed to subway down the road and then went to Publix for some groceries. This was only about a 3 minute drive. We still had 2 hours to go until check in but decided to see if our room was ready. The resort was full and they had not cleaned our room yet and I was worried about our groceries we had just purchased since the weather was in the 80's our entire trip. They had housekeeping come get our things and bring them up to the room. We went to downtown disney for a bit and when we came back our room was ready, half an hour before check in. The hotel, suites and pool area are all very clean. We had a one bedroom suite. There was everything you needed except for a dish strainer if you prefer not to use the dishwasher. Even the washer and dryer worked well. The two double beds were very comfy although the bedroom stayed a tad bit warmer than the rest of the suite. There was also two flat screen TV's, one in the livingroom and one the bedroom. It was nice because the kids could watch what they wanted in the other room. The patio was nice and the view onto the pool was beautiful. We were on the second floor and we couldnt hear the noise from the pool at all. Sea World is only about 3 minutes away, the mall about 5 and Disney is about 10 so it is in a good location. I would not suggest going without a car though. There are not any restaurants or shopping within walking distance. The pool was clean and a nice size. My five year old wanted to live in it! The only thing is that if you are a sun worshipper you will be disappointed. The resort is in a U shape and the pool right in the middle, so you dont get much sun. At any hotel we stay at we always put the do not disturb sign up and just ask for towels and the things we need. We dont see the sense in cleaning it every day for a short stay. With that said I do not know about the integrity of housekeeping. The only bad part of our stay was the restarurant down stairs. They did not have any vegetarian options for my daughter, the menu is small, and charged us the same price for Chicken alfredo without the chicken. It wouldnt have been so bad if the service wasnt TERRIBLE! We were the only ones in the place at 6 pm and it took 15 minutes to take our order almost another 30 to get our food and then they added an automatic 8% gratuity. You can change it but I think its pretty presumptous of them if it is not a large party. Also you can only have it charged to your room, you can not pay cash or with a CC.

Everything from a full kitchen with a dishwasher to a washer and dryer in the suite. Everything was in very good condition. Now I did not examine the place with a magnifying glass as I am sure not every piece of molding was spotless, but honestly I could live with that. The cleanliness of the baths and beds rank higher with me. The downside to the property, Breakfast, Parking and the Shuttle to Universal. BREAKFAST: SAVE YOUR MONEY and Do Not Buy the Breakfast! Just buy something to prepare in your own room or go out to eat. The $5 to $7 charged is just too much for the lousy food that was served (and no real fresh fruit) - even my teenagers, who are happy just to have food and not have to clean up afterwards thought it was bad. Save your money. There is a Publix just down the street and around the corner. We bought eggs and bacon, etc.. for our next breakfast. Second, The Parking: The subcontracted valet guys block off most of the parking lot, to get to the main parking area, you have to go through the valet. It is advertised as free, but as we all know you have to tip them when they take your car and tip them when they go back and get your car. So it really is not free. While I understand the need for valet, (traveling with young children, helping hands to unload the car, elderly, etc..). I personally have never liked handing my keys over to a stranger. So I don't use valet. Because I did not use valet parking, we had to park along the outer edges of the parking lot, and unload and load. It is almost like the parking lot does not belong to the hotel but it is obviously the property of the hotel. So we felt like second class guests - we were not even allowed to use the luggage carts as I guess even those belong to the subcontracted valet/bellmen. So for some folks - not an issue, for me with able bodied teenagers it was an annoyance. I know that seems cheap, but I would rather save the $25 to $50 that is spent on those kind of costs and use it towards something special. (Dessert after dinner, special gift, etc...) Third: The Shuttle to Universal. One of the reasons I selected this property was to get the free shuttle to Universal (not Disney) only to find out that the hotel only runs one trip in the morning and one trip in the evening (they do have one at noon and one at 5pm but what good is that?) but I was traveling with teenagers and Universal was open until Midnight but the shuttle came at 7:45pm - no changes due to the holiday hours at the park. If you plan on driving this would not be a big deal, but it really cut into our time at the park and I was really hoping to stay late. We did not use the pool and while the water temp seemed warm enough, the pool needed to be cleaned of leaves and such. ( It would not have stopped the teenagers from swimming in - we just ran out of time>) I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling with small children, plan to eat in or eat out at restaurants, like valet service and were planning on driving yourself to the park anyway.

For those that don't know it the Lake Eve building was built as condos but after the real estate bust it was converted to a condo hotel. It's clearly cheaply done...made to look good for a quick sale (granite, semi stainless appliances, etc.) but cheap work does not last, as is evidenced by the state of the rooms now. They are already showing a huge amount of wear and lack of upkeep. We had a two bed / two bath room which was not ever really clean. Doors did not close properly, there were huge stains on the rugs and curtains. The kitchen cabinets were cracked and the appliances dirty. Every single room had light bulbs that didn't work. The kitchen had only one working light. Three calls to the front desk for new bulbs resulted in absolutely nothing. The walls are paper thin and the toilets got stuffed constantly (maintenance did come and fix this). We did not use the fitness center or pool so I can't comment on how they were. However, our room was overlooking the pool and it was very noisy at night (very late into the night too) with people in there drinking away. There are endless flyers put under the doors (at least 4 a day). There is no real restaurant on site. I think when we were there it was open on the weekend for breakfast only. No room service or useful store. There is a huge Publix down the street (driving) so stop there and stock up before you check-in. All of the above being said, the location was perfect for us. The price was right for a 2 bed 2 bath newish (if not well kept or very clean) condo. If it was clean I would have given 3 stars. If you are used to 4* or 5 * places and are expecting this to be similar you will be extremely disappointed. Only if you are used to staying at Motel 6 would you consider this a luxury resort. The real shame is this place could be a star with better management. The front desk was the worst part of the experience. I have honestly never encountered such ambivalent service. When we checked in the man who checked us in was wearing some type of \"street\" clothes. Obviously I am showing my age here but I'm not sure when a huge hoodie and jeans worn so low they sit around hips are appropriate for a hotel front desk. As an example of the level of service offered by the front desk I will offer up this: Our keycard stopped working every day as if we had checked out. We would leave for the parks and return at night to find we couldn't get back into our room. Each night we would go to the front desk and they would ask us our room number and how long we were staying and reprogram the key (never asking for name or ID).

So let me share my thoughts on this place (while I'm still here!). First, believe the pictures you see on their website. I was in a one bedroom suite, room 104 and it was impeccable. Everything was clean, beautiful and in working order (save 2 minor things). We booked this as part of a package with a Travelocity hotel & flight during thanksgiving, so I'd say I spent about $100/night. Location: very near the Premium outlet (which includes a Publix, so you can get groceries). We also rented a car, which I think is a must if you are going to stay here and get around Orlando properly. Gym: This can't really be called a gym. It had 2 treadmills, 1 exercise bike and 1 elliptical. There was a mens/women's sauna too, which was nice (but I did not use it). I did not use the outdoor pool. Ammenities: first off, you get free wi-fi (but the wi-fi can be slow often. You also get a real suite, which includes a full kitchen, washer and dryer. Bring your own soap, shampoo and lotion. The hotel's soap, shampoo/conditioner are the cheapest I've ever used and I don't recommend you use it! There is no lotion. there is dishwashing detergent for both your dishwasher and for handwashing your dishes (and yes, there are plenty of dishes, pots, utensils, silverware, etc). You have everything you need to cook! there is no sponge to hand wash you dishes though. There is also no laundry detergent so you'll need to buy that. There are two tv's in the room - one outside in the living room and also one in the bedroom. This really was such a nice and spacious place, I wish that I had friends I could invite over to hang out! The hotel does charge an additional $7.50/day but there is also free parking (and also a random free valet which we ignored over the weekend).

We decided to each book a two bedroomed suite at the hotel, which my sister decided to upgrade to a larger suite with better views. (tip, if you wish to upgrade, email the hotel prior to arrival and ask for a discount on this, my sister paid 50% less than normal rate). i decided not to upgrade as the rooms slept 8 anyway and we didn't feel the extra space was needed. Boy were we right, the suite was amazing, full kitchen, excellent living area, huge dining table and six chairs, two huge bedrooms with amazingly comfortable humongous beds. the master bedroom had the most fantastic ensuite i've ever experienced, jucuzzi bath, twin sinks, marble tops and a walk in shower big enough for six, i actually screamed and jumped up and down like a 12 year old when i saw this. my daughter had her own bathroom too, if a little smaller but just as lovely. each room had a large flat screen tv with loads of satellite channels, so all 3 of us could watch different things if needed. The air con was a godsend as the temp was soaring outside, simple system that you could adjust as needed. the suite has a never ending supply of furniture and storage cupboards aswell as washer/dryer, iron + board so you don't need to pack so much. included is a free safe in your room that you just programme with a pin number. The hotel service was great, maids clean everyday and bring fresh towels, bedding, toiletries etc... They even replenish the filter coffee daily so you can have a great cup of java whenever you like. for gods sake they even loaded the huge dishwasher and switched it on everyday for us, like i said AMAZING! Balcony was huge with chairs and tables and a lovely view over the lake, which pretty much every room had. Hotel staff were helpful and accomodating and they have staff to advise you on tickets, travel and places to go etc... such as the local supermarket just up the street. In addition we got menus for local food places pushed under our doors daily which we used to order in some nights and got them delivered to our doors. They have a large pool area with jacuzzi and kids pool + complimentary warm towels whenever you wanted them, so no trailing your room towels down to the pool. The only negative i have for lake eve was the buffet breakfast that you could buy for about $8 per head. It wasn't bad as such, just abit dull, However ,with the vast array of restaurants etc... on international drive this paled in comparison. i could go on and on about lake eve, but surfice to say that as a Brit, you will most definately not be disapointed. Any complaints about this place are from what i've seen abit petty and mostly made by the americans who are used to a much higher standard of service than us.

Well, I flew right into a bouquet of ROSES! This place is absolutely 5 star all the way. From when I drove up and the valet parked my car where I requested (near a side entrance), to the desk staff who had my keycard in my hands in mere minutes (they knew I had just driven 3 days to get there) to the cleaning staff who always met me with a smile and more toiletries and towels than I could ever use, the people were wonderful. The property...when I drove up (even thought I'd seen pictures), I was a bit overwhelmed! It is a large \"U\" shaped resort with the large pool, hot tub and courtyard in the middle, facing a lake where people paddle swan boats also facing town beyond the lake. I didn't use the pool or hot tub, but thoroughly enjoyed my A/C cooled room and whirlpool tub. (It was August, I was attending a convention and walked a lot outside!) Okay, enough about the building, what about the room/suite? Beyond my expectations. Now, I've travelled quite a bit, so I can be a bit picky. I've stayed at low priced hotels and expensive hotels, in Europe, the East Coast and most recently, LA, and I have NEVER stayed at any place that even approached the quality and value of Lake Eve. I knew this was a nice place, but nothing could prepare me for how HUGE this apartment (oh, I mean \"suite\" was). Since I had requested a room on the end on a high floor (12th), facing more straight towards the lake and town instead of the combo courtyard/lake views of the other rooms, it was quite a walk to get to the room with the view I requested from the elevator, but it was SO WORTH IT! After opening the door, there was a hallway. Turning right, I was delighted to find a large open plan \"house\" style layout, with a full sized kitchen with steel appliances (including dishwasher and microwave), granite countertop and island with bar seating, ALSO a full sized dining table and chairs. This area was tiled in high quality tile. Then more towards the end of the unit was the LARGE living area, with a long couch (which I think was also a bed), a loveseat, a large lounge chair, a coffee table, and a huge LCD TV. Of course this area was carpeted and beautifully decorated. Everything was of tasteful and high quality. At the end of the living room, nearly the entire wall was dominated by huge glass panes, one that slid open for access onto the balcony...talk about a view! (I got nightly fireworks displays from a nearby amusement park!) The balcony was huge (I'll be using that word a lot I think in this review!). It must have been at least 5 feet by 15 feet, and I'm probably underestimating. There also were four chairs and two small tables there. Since it was on the end and on the corner, you could also see down into the courtyard/pool area, but the main attraction was the stunning lake and views of town at night. Moving on inside, the maser bedroom (a separate room with its own door) was fit for a king. Of course there was a gigantic king sized beds , another big LCD TV, all the high quality linens and pillows you'd expect, all top notch, sophisticated and sleek design. (I normally don't care alot about that kind of stuff like interior design, but it was just so perfect it deserves mentioning!) The coup de grace was the master bathroom. A two sink granite countertop, a HUGE separate shower (at least 4 feet square) and a wonderful, big, separate whirlpool tub. THIS is what luxury hotels are made of. After long hot hours in the sweaty August weather, THIS was the place I went to sooth my muscles and my tired feet. Fantastic. Like they say on infomercials \"but that's not all!\". The suite I got also had essentially another wing! If you turned left after coming in the suite, there was ANOTHER huge separate bedroom with two large beds and another big LCD TV (for those of you keeping count, that's 3 flatscreens!). Across from it was a more basic bathroom, but with the same high quality materials. (Tub/shower combo, granite counter top). Other things I should mention is that there were closets EVERYWHERE, a washer dryer, a dishwasher (detergent provided), dishtowels, real dishes in a pantry close, and on and on. It was even extremely quiet! I thought I was the only one in my wing until I was checking out and met the people in the next suite! I chalk this quietness up to quality construction and insulation. It was silent with the windows closed. OH, I should mention that in the suites on the end, not only do you have the huge \"wall of glass\" where the balcony is, but windows also on all sides in each room (except the bathrooms). So you can enjoy all the Florida sun or use the blackout drapes to sleep in. A family could truly could live here comfortably and not be crowded. Move right in, they provide everything. The only thing you would need to bring is your clothes. Everything else was there. It's like home away from home (if your home is a luxury condo in a tropical paradise). If it sounds like I'm raving, it's because I am. I knew I was coming to a nice place, and there would be the expected amenities. I never expected the attention to detail, from towels folded into amazing animal shapes, the cleaning staff bringing more supplies than I could ever use, the spacious suite and luxurious outfitting of everything, and on and on. I am hoping to go see a rocket launch, and plan to stay here again. They have a person that arranges some excursions but I have not used that service yet. I got a pizza from the kitchen which was great, jbut I didn't use the pool area, I much preferred my nicely cooled A/C suite with whirlpool bath after a long sweaty day of walking. I recommend Lake Eve to all my family and friends, and would stay here even if it were an hour or so from where I actually was going (as in Cape Canaveral). It just makes the end of the day so peaceful and comfortable, which is important when you're away from home and need to be sharp for a meeting or want to be rested for your vacation. Love it! Can't wait to get back soon! (I don't give a \"perfect\" score lightly, I know travellers depend on others' reviews. For me, the location was fine with a \"trolley\" stop right across the street that went everywhere, so I could leave my car at the resort. Some may want to be more \"right in the middle of things\", I prefer to see the hubbub at a mile or so away and have my accomodations be a sanctuary at the end of the day, rather than having noise, cars and congestion all around me at one of the older type properties. So for me, it was a straight across perfect resort.)", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkcaldy", "Title": "\u201cFabulous accommodation in great location\u201d", "Author": "MikeKirkcaldy", "ReviewID": "UR85610370", "Content": "Looked at dozens of hotels around the Seaworld area - we knew we wanted to be at that end of I Drive, and got a great deal on a 2 bed apartment on the top floor for 15 nights in Oct 2010.

All I can say to those who have posted negative reviews is that there just must be no pleasing some people - we couldn't fault the place. The apartment was superb -spotlessly clean with great facilties, a queen size bed in our room and two kings in the kids room. So many of the hotels in orlando seem to just have one big room with two queen beds in - it was important for us that our kids could have their own room, and this fitted the bill perfectly. Hotel staff were excellent whenever we needed them. Only slight criticism was that pool temperature seemed to be a bit inconsistent. Lovely location on I Drive - 5 mins to Seaworld and Aquatica, 10 mins to Disney parks and maybe 15 or so to Universal. Publix supermarket within walking distance was excellent and only a 2 minute drive to Premium outlets. Never tried the breakfast in the hotel - we just bought stuff from Publix and had breakfast in our room. We had an absolutely wonderful time and if we come back here in another 2 or 3 years we will definitely go back to Lake Eve as the accommodation and location were just superb. Would also consider other places around this area (Floridays or Sheraton Vistana etc), but we really feel that Lake Eve was excellent value for money and we would have to get an incredible deal to make us go anywhere else.

As my brother is very young and we're traveling without our parents, you can probably sense how worried i was about.. everything. The biggest concern and quality that i seek in a hotel was : shuttle bus transportation to all major theme parks, price of the hotel, and safe neighborhood/environment. Lake Eve had shuttle buses to the three major theme parks (disney, universal studios, sea world) every morning picking us up straight from the entrance. It was very convenient. I dont drive, so it was very important that the hotel had this service.( FOR FREE!) . theres also an itrolly stop right outside the gate of the resort. and just 2 stops from the PREMIUM OUTLET . (awesome for shopping) . we had to book a taxi to the PRIME OULET though since itrolly would mean traveling from one end to another .. ( time's very precious when traveling with minor). The room are more than what is described . we feel right at home, and since the resort is pretty new, so are the rooms. the bed was very comfortable. and their bathrooms are HUGE and fancy. im really picky with hotel bathrooms, always making sure i have my slippers on when im in there. but for lake eve, i can even go barefoot. (thats how clean and nice it looks). i can go on and go about my great experience there. its totally children friendly . but make sure u pack your own breakfast because the all the reviews on how bad the breakfast is at the restaurant is actually true. From desk was very helpful when we asked questions. Though there isnt much around the neighborhood, its realli peaceful and quiet.

Firstly there are things advertised on the website which are not available or open. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and there is no where to buy any lunch or dinner, so if you are having a relaxing day at the pool then you will need to make sure that you have been to the supermarket. Like someone previously stated there is a little room which sells crisps and some 'Pot Noodle' type snacks, but it is very limited. Also the baby pool is never open and the water is very cold. My 9 month old, screamed his head off when I tried to put him in it. Check in was first class, but then we were the only ones there in reception ! The room was out of this world and one of the nicest I have stayed in. You have a huge oven and microwave, plus a dish washer, washing machine and tumble dryer. The bathrooms are lovely and have plenty of towels. There was always hot water available and there were 3 huge tv's to, so you are spolit for choice. The room was cleaned everyday and if we needed anything, it was no problem. The downside, this resort is quite away from the hustle and bustle of International Drive, therefore we really needed our car. You can use the green I ride bus which is fantastic and very cheap and this pulls up and leaves right outside the hotel and will take you to all the restaurants. This stops at 10.30pm and can get quite busy. There was an incident when we were there which the hotel tried to cover up. We had gone to bed about 10.30pm and the next morning when we left our room we noticed all spray paint on our front door. When we walked around the flood we noticed that someone when we had gone to bed had vandalised our floor with spray paint and had painted graffiti symbols on the fire exit door, it had gone on the edge of the walls, the metal kick boards and on the carpet to. We reported it to reception and they looked very alarmed in deed and said that they weren't aware of any maintenance work going on and that they would check it out. We were very unsettled and some Americans remarked that the security should be upped. When we came back from the Theme park, the manager totally back tracked and said that everything was ok and it was the maintenance man! This was complete and utter rubbish and any idiot would be able to tell it was graffiti. What maintenance man goes around in the middle of the night marking doors he had to paint whith spray paint with zig zag's symbols and getting it all on the walls, fittings and carpets! He would be sacked on the spot. Also just at the end of our holiday while we were out for dinner, my Mum while baby sitting our son noticed youths skate boarding on the roof of the hotel! She honestly couldn't believe what she was seeing as we were on the top floor and yet again, how did they get up there? Despite the above I would stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to friends.

We used MH Transportation to get us from the airport to Lake Eve Resort on International Drive. The driver met us by the baggage pick-up and allowed us a 1/2 hour stop at a local grocery store. I would recommend this transportation company. We didn't find the need to rent a car as tranportation was so easy from the hotel and we had all the groceries we needed before we even checked in. Lake Eve Resort was absolutely perfect. Not only was it gorgeous inside and out, but it provided all the amenities of staying in a condo. Some of the perks were the full size & stocked kitchen (w/dishwasher), stacked washer and dryer, Jacuzzi tub, balcony, and free shuttle to the theme parks. We booked the one bedroom suite and there was plenty of room for the four of us. We stayed on the 14th floor...amazing views! Tip - Freeze water bottles for the theme parks. This will save you tons of $$$. We took turns carrying the backpack. Also, I wanted to mention that the I-Trolley Ride is only $1.25 each way and you can even buy day passes. This trolley goes all the way down both sides of International Drive where there is tons of shopping, dining, and entertainmet. We didn't use the free hotel shuttle to get to Universal as the pick up/drop off times weren't ideal. The I-trolley worked perfectly. Universal is about a 10 minutes walk from the stop. Easy. We did use the shuttle to and from Disneyword and we have no complaints. Our teens loved the pool and hot tub and used it as much as time allowed. We didn't use the restaurant at the hotel because we bought so many groceries but buffet breakfast was only $5.95 if you booked it the night before. I highly recommend Lake Eve Resort.

We loved this hotel - the room was a fantastic home from home -with enough space for all of us to spread out - being a big family we all had our own large screen tv - the washer dryer was a handy addition and the best of all was the fully stocked kitchen including dishwasher that the maid loaded ! We had fresh coffee every morning a beautifully cleaned room everyday, the pool was basic but enough after a hot day around the parks and a good way for the children to meet friends. I would certainly stay at this hotel again I only wish I had a chance to let the manager know in person what a great hotel he is running - if I was going to give a negative it would be that the restaurant could have been a little bit more inviting. We had dinner there our first night which was not great and breakfast a couple of times but overall it was easier to eat in the room or out as you have an array of restaurants on International Drive and the hotel is right near a major supermarket. I checked Trip Advisor every week before we stayed here and valued the comments as it builds up a picture of your holiday and is invaluable when planning - especially as with three children of varying ages this is a holiday you certainly need to plan for.

I chose this hotel because it offered a 3 room suite (at a good price) which would easily accommodate 5 people providing us with a full kitchen, laundry, whirlpool tub and plenty of space for everyone to spread out and relax before returning home. It was also fairly close to the airport and Universal Studios. We arrived early, but we could not check in early because the hotel had been full the night before. However, the staff was kind enough to store our luggage, allowing us to leave and do a bit of shopping. They even delivered our luggage to our room after we checked in. The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location. We initially found the room to be beautiful and spacious with a great view. Unfortunately, over the next few hours we discovered so many problems with our room, that it took away from our ability to completely enjoy our stay. I am not a complainer by nature, and I expect hotel rooms to exhibit \u201cnormal wear and tear; however, there were just too many problems with our room for me to overlook. First, the door to our room would not open unless you shoved it open with your shoulder. Then, you had to shove it with your shoulder and slam it in order for it to close. When I examined the door closely from the outside, I noticed that it was cracked on two sides and looked as though someone had tried to break the door down at one time. Due to the condition of the door, the deadbolt would not lock which left me feeling a little uneasy. When my mom opened the dishwasher it was full of water. She called the front desk and they sent up a maintenance man. He brought a wet vac and sucked the water out, but told us that the dishwasher was broken and could not be used until a part had been replaced. The light above the whirlpool tub did not work and one of the lights in the kitchen, one of lights in the queen bedroom and one of the lights in the master bedroom appeared to have a short as they would go off for long periods of time before coming back on. At one point, I thought the power had gone out, except that other lights were working. Our room had four televisions -one in the living room and one in each bedroom. The television in the queen bedroom had bad reception and some of the color stations only played in black and white. In the same bedroom, one of the queen beds was broken and had separated from the wall. On the wall near the 2nd queen bed there were smears which looked a lot like blood. The chair in the king bedroom (not the master bedroom) had a broken leg which had been propped up under the chair and fell off when my father went to move it. The dryer worked well, but water temperature for the washer only allowed you to wash in hot water and warm water. The cold water was not cold. The ironing board appeared to be broken as well. Still, the worst thing about our room was the water. When I filled a glass with water from the sink, I had taken only one small sip before I had to spit it out. Then, I noticed the odor. It was awful! There was a strong chemical, burning smell. My father commented on it as well. We are all water drinkers, but it was so bad that none of us could drink it. There was no bottled water in the small store downstairs, and I finally ended up ordering two bottles when I ordered pizza from a local restaurant. I had looked forward to using the whirlpool tub, but when I filled the tub with water, all you could smell was the same awful, chemical odor. The smell of the water was so bad that it overpowered any soaps and bath oils that I put in the water. I was hesitant to even bath in the water for fear of what it might do to my skin. I used some of the bottle water to brush my teeth because I could not stand the thought of putting any of that water in my mouth. I called the front desk staff and reported all of these problems. The lady at the desk was extremely nice and said that she would note the time of my call and the complaints about the room so that we would not be held responsible for its condition. Upon, checkout, I also left a written list, outlining some of our complaints. The gentleman at the desk was very nice. He apologized for the condition of the room and said that he would pass along our problems to maintenance. Despite our experience, we liked the hotel and my family even commented that they would like to come and stay for about a week if the room was in better condition. All of the staff were wonderful and tried to be helpful. I have no way of knowing if we just happened to receive a room with lots of problems or if the problems we encountered are common to most of the rooms in the hotel. However, I just do not feel that I can honestly recommend this hotel to others until I am sure that the problems in our room are addressed and that others won\u2019t have a similar experience. As much as I liked the hotel itself and the staff, I would not have stayed more than one night in this room in its current condition. I hope that these problems are addressed because, as I stated before, this is a beautiful hotel, I would like to stay here again---in a room that has been better maintained.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the bad reviews!

I spent extensive time looking over the Lake Eve resort website and reading the reviews prior to making my final decision. The pictures of the resort were representative of the actual thing. However, the floor plans and description of beds in each unit were not. Their website states each unit has a king size bed in the master bedroom and two queens in the second bedroom. There is no disclaimer that this may vary by room. We checked into the hotel and went to our room. The first thing we saw was that according to the sign on the door we had been given a handicapped room. We went in anyway and headed straight to the bedrooms to set our luggage down. Instead of two queens in the second bedroom we found one king. Based on the relationships and genders we were traveling with this was absolutely not going to work. We turned right around and headed back to the desk to ask for a room as advertised. We were told there was nothing they could do as the hotel was sold out and that they could not give that room to someone else as we had now \"dirtied it\". We were also told that we wanted a two bedroom and we got a two bedroom and that our room was capable of sleeping 8 people - 3 in each king and two on the double sized pull out sofa. I explained that if it had been our desire that someone sleep in the living room, we would not have looked for the two queen beds. I was also curious to know which couple they expected to have a third person in their bed. We were told that the best they could do was try to change us the next day if someone checked out but that they did not think it possible. We asked to speak to the manager but the young lady at the desk said she was all that was available. We then asked for a number of someone to talk with and she gave us the general managers business card and stated he would be available in the morning. We went up to our room and then realized the second tub had a bench installed to be handicapped friendly which limited our use. We then called Travelocity and explained the situation. The agent there heard us out and then looked at the Lake Eve resort website. She sided with us agreeing that the site says all two bedroom suites have two queen sized beds in the extra room. She then called the hotel and talked with them and then told us the hotel had agreed to change our room in the morning. We did not understand why they would not change it then as according to their site, they still had rooms available. Late that evening we went to pull the sofa sleeper open and discovered that the metal frame supporting the mattress was completely cracked in half and unusable. We called the front desk who sent up the maintenance man. He kept apologizing over and over while telling us it wasn't fixable and had no other solutions. He also said that the desk was not going to switch our room that night but that they would in the morning. We again talked the desk who told us if we left, they would charge us a two night penalty. We did our best to sleep that night with one person on the closed couch. The beds were unbearably hard and uncomfortable and one of us who has a bad back was in tears when we were woken up at 5:30 by the telephone ringing. It rang 3 times and when we answered no one was there. We called the front desk and they stated it was not them but offered to send maintenance up again. At this point we were done. We went online and looked for another place to stay. Thank God for Marriott who said we could come over right away and that we could even eat at the free breakfast buffet. By then it was about 7:30 in the morning and the assistant manager was there. He agreed we could leave and pay for only the one night. He did, however, charge us the reort fee. The ironic part was that of the benefits of the resort fee, the only one we got to use was the free Internet, which we used to find a new hotel. We never had a chance to use the pool or anything else due to our multiple discussions with Travelocity and the front desk. We called Travelocity and they then spoke to the front desk to confirm we did not have to pay for more than one night and promised to refund our money. We then headed to the Marriott where we had breakfast and then all laid down to get some sleep. This is a beautiful hotel. It had a wonderful looking pool and the suite was very pretty. However, as the saying goes \"All that glitters is not gold\".

I will try to give an honest review of the hotel. We stayed in a 2 bedroomed apartment on the eleventh floor in end of May/June 2010. Views were great for the fireworks at SeaWorld in the evening. We travelled with a 9 year old boy husband and wife. The apartment Overall Excellent. 2 bedrooms one with queen size bed and ensuite bathroom with Jacuzzi bath and walk in shower other room 2 king size beds with ensuite bath and shower over bath. Plenty of clean towels and toiletries replenished 6 days not Sundays. Lounge with sofa, chair and coffee table. Large flat screen TV with lots of channels to choose from. Kitchen was well equipped with modern American Fridge/Freezer with ice maker, Microwave, oven, grill, waste disposal, toaster, coffee making machine with sachets provided. There was a dishwasher which was loaded by the maid if needed and detergent replenished daily. There was also a dining area which seated 6 and a huge washing machine and dryer. You needed to buy your own detergent. There is also an iron and ironing board. Home from home in my opinion. Large balcony with 2 chairs and small table. The apartment was serviced daily \u2013 the maid would remove rubbish, tidy kitchen, make beds, clean bathrooms and replenish towels. I'm not sure that they cleaned daily but we didn't really make a mess was very satisfied with the cleanliness of the apartment. Hotel in General There is an outdoor swimming pool with limited sunbeds and a bar that was only open at weekends. Free pool towels were provided. It is open until 10.00pm but there were children in there later than that. As long as you shut your patio doors you couldn't hear them. Not the best pool for sunbathing as limited sun but warm enough to have a refreshing dip. There was also a hot tub which was great to soak your weary body after long days walking round the parks. If you want a relaxing day of sunbathing go to Aquatica and lay on the beach there. The communal areas of the hotel were clean. The lift is very slow and takes a while to get you to the 11th Floor. Never had to wait too long though when calling a lift. There is a very small indoor gym with a sauna which we used once but don't expect state of the art equipment very basic. Reception is not staffed all the time and there is a very helpful concierge who will help you book tickets give you directions etc. There was a restaurant there but never saw it open along with a small shop. There is internet access but never saw anyone on it. At weekends there is valet parking run by very polite young lads who looked after us very well. We only tipped them on the last night but they still gave us excellent service. Surrounding Area The hotel is situated at the quiet end of International Drive which is fine as you normally drive everywhere anyway. It is well located for SeaWorld and Aquatica being only 5 minutes away and Disney parks are about 20 minutes. There is a large Publix supermarket (turn right out of the hotel) which stocks everything you will need. There is also a Subway there and behind it is a great family restaurant called Outback which we found to be very good value with good service. It is an Australian BBQ which serves good ribs, steaks etc. The Olive Tree on International Drive was also a very good restaurant. Nice Italian food with great service and again good value for money. If you want to eat cheaply then go to Sizzlers which is a buffet restaurant costing $10.99 for adults as much as you can eat salad, meats, fruits, Mexican, and deserts. We found Wet n Wild to be really busy and not very well managed with long queues. Aquatica was by far the better water park. We chose SeaWorld to view fireworks but the Disney parks do displays as well but we decided once you've seen one show there all much of a muchness. There is a Premier Outlook Mall near to the hotel (turn right out of hotel). Visit the concierge for money off coupons before you go. Summary This was a great choice for us travelling with a 9 year old. The apartments are of a very high standard, large and very comfortable. If you want to stay at the hotel during the day then this isn't geared for that but for using as a base to visit the attractions in Orlando it was fantastic. Would definitely recommend it. Better than Quality Inn's or Days Inn's that we've stayed at previously. Accommodation 4 star overall amenities 2/3 star. It makes a great place to stay with the facilities to cater for yourselves if you want to. We found that at weekends it was much busier a lot of Americans use it as a base which is a good advertisement as they are generally very fussy. We always found all the staff pleasant, friendly and polite. There is no food in the hotel but you do get lots of Pizza leaflets through your door.

We stayed at Lake Eve Resort the week of July 5th through the 9th, 2010. We were 6 altogether, 4 kids (ages 5, 7, 9 and 10). We had an awesome time.

The kitchen and bathrooms were spotless (I use to work for a hotel and that is always the first thing I checked, along with the sheets, etc...) We originally picked the hotel because it is minutes away from Sea World, the kids were in Sea World Summer Camp for a week and we choose the hotel because of the full kicthen. I must say it turned out to be the best thing ever. Aside from the fact that we were able to make our own meals and save money, we were able to refrigerate fruits and healthy snacks for the kids. (Kitchen fully equipped with plates, silverware, pots and pans, strainer, cooking utensils) The rooms are spacious and have lots of storage and closet space. Another big plus was the washer and dryer. I washed the kids clothes everyday. This was the first trip were I came home with a bag full of clean clothes rather than having a pile to wash. The housekeeping staff were very curteous. They came in everyday, emptied the trash, started the dishwasher for us, cleaned up a bit. Overall very good job. The front desk staff were very helpful and quite attentive. They hotel has a large pool (No need to bring pool towels, the hotel has them available by the pool). There is also spa and a kiddie pool. Our kids had a blast. The hotel has a small gym with a sauna, restaurant and a very small shop for essentials. As far as parking, I had read other people's review and we did not have the same experience. The hotel was fully booked, but parking was available. They offer complimentary valet at no charge or you can self park. Overall, I loved the hotel!!! Lots of families with small kids. Yes we could hear some of the guests walking around above our room, but hey with 4 kids of my own I know that the guests below us must have heard my kids running around and having a great time in our suite. Our suite was great. We all felt at home. It was so clean that I felt comfortable enough to allow my kids to walk barefoot in the suite. We stayed on the 12th floor overlooking the pool. Every suite has either a view of the pool or for an upgrade a view of the lake. We loved it so much. We have already told our friends and we are already planning to come back next year (the kids will be attending Sea World Summer Camp again). Great place!! We loved it so much, we called friends during our trip and told them all about it. Maybe next year we will share a 3 bedroom suite. The hotel rate was excellent! I booked it back last December thought hotel.com for $109 plus tax per night. You can't beat the price. Yes once you check out you are charged about $8 bucks a night for the resort fee. Did not mind the charge since the room rate was so low. Spoke to the mgr, the hotel has only been opened for 1 yr and 2 months. Great Hotel!!

First of the all, the rooms were of a good standard. We got upgraded so I am not sure of the size of the regular rooms, but ours was very spacious and clean. Also if you can get a room that is on a higher floor, you will most likely have a nice view. There were also all the appliances I mention above, although we didn't feel the need to cook in the room. The pool was also good, although we didn't use it much at all, but there were always towels available and there was a smaller section for younger children. The shuttle bus was not great. In terms of not having to bother with hiring a car, it was beneficial, but the bus itself was probably one of the oldest, most rickety buses known to man, and we didn't particularly appreciate the fact that there were posters everywhere on the inside of the bus saying how great and important tips are to healthy drivers (the implication being that if we didn't tip then our drivers' health would suffer!). Also I would check the times of the shuttle bus beforehand, because when we went there were only a few per day, in the morning and the evening, so if you wanted to come back early in the afternoon for a swim, then you would have to find your own way. In addition to this, the shuttle bus stops at a few hotels on the way to the parks, so it could sometimes take the best part of an hour to get there. The hotel is located on International Drive South, which was not actually all that clear to us when we booked. It is a bit further away from the hustle and bustle of International Drive then we would have liked, but it's not the worst location to be in. It sits on Lake Eve and as I said before, there are some nice views to be had. There is a supermarket which is about 15 minutes walk away, and there is also a Domino's Pizza about 5 minutes away. Apart from that, there isn't much nearby. I wouldn't recommend the hotel restaurant, we ate breakfast there on the first morning and the food wasn't too bad, but the hotel is a 'cashless' hotel, so they bill everything to your room, which means they add on tips and various charges at their own free will. When we arrived there was a poster on the fridge door advertising a pizza from the restaurant, delivered to your room for $9.95. We were tired and so we thought we would give it a try, but I ended up getting a bill for over $16 because they not only added on a delivery charge of $3, but they added on a tip of about 20% as well. Also, the pizza was one of the worst I have ever tasted. So essentially, if you are not going to stay at the theme parks all day and eat your dinner there, then you are better heading up International Drive and trying out the plethora of restaurants there. We often did this and the choice seemed endless. The one thing which did really annoy me about the hotel was that when we checked out we had to pay a 'Resort Fee' of $7.50 + tax per day. Having booked through lastminute.com, we were told that our booking had been fully pre-paid and that the hotel were not to charge us, but on our day of check out we received a bill for over $100 which we had not expected. This fee, by the way, was apparently to cover the shuttle bus to the parks, maintenance of the pool etc etc - which begs the question, why doesn't the room charge cover this? I raised this with the hotel and their response was that lastminute would not be able to charge us for this because it is a resort fee and lastminute have nothing to do with it. So essentially they sell very cheap rooms to lastminute.com, people book them thinking they are getting a good deal, and then the hotel adds on an extra charge to guarantee a bit of extra money from the customer to cover them selling the room really cheap. I believe a lot of hotels in Orlando do this kind of thing. Although this review has not been great, the hotel actually wasn't bad, and the staff were ok for the most part as well. We probably wouldn't go back, but this is because we know the area better now. It was good at the time of booking because it was pretty much self catering and had the shuttle bus to the parks - which was what we were looking for. Definitely not the worst place in the world though.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "memphis", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT!

The units were spotless, beautiful and up to date and everything was great. We liked it so much we chose to spend 8 nights there this year. In less than a year, the standards have dropped quite a bit. Lots of little things in our unit were broken, lights out, not enough kitchen utensils etc. The toilet kept blocking which was very embarassing. Our ceiling fan in the living room did not work from the first day onwards and when maintainence came out they said they couldn't fix it because of the guarantee? The weather was in the 90's so we could have done with that ceiling fan. Rooms were clean but not spotless as they had been back in June last year. Carpets especially were getting a bit dirty. I also had issues with the pool. It is too small for the amount of guests and a resort which caters for such a large number of people could do with more than one pool. I liked to swim when it was quiet so I would get up early especially. The pool opened at 8 AM but it was full of dead bugs. There were alot of centipede/worm type things around the pool and in the pool so maybe they need to look into better pest control? The man didn't start cleaning the pool until 8.30 AM or later some mornings so the pool had less bugs in it later but why open the pool and then start cleaning it after and when people are actually in the pool? Why not clean it at 7.30am? The gym was small, no weights, just a cross trainer, bike and two treadmills. One treadmill wasn't working. The shower room in the gym had no lock on the door?! I liked that they had separate saunas for men and women though. There isn't a huge amount to do at Lake Eve. No nature walks or activities for kids. We actually snuck over to the Bluegreen Resort next door for scenic walks. We had breakfast the first morning. It was ok but very quiet and not a huge amount of choice. On our last morning we were not checking out until 11 am but from 7.45am onwards the maid kept knocking on our door hassling us to get out. The same maid came back several times over a three hour period despite us telling her we would be checking out at 11 and she had a bit of an attitude. Each day there were also many pizza and takeaway menus pushed under the door which got a bit irritating. Other resorts prevent this, but Lake Eve didn't. Overall, we would actually stay here again as it is great value for money and we were still fairly happy here. It is ok as a base but we would stay somewhere like Hilton Grand Vacations Club if we were wanting to spend more time relaxing at our resort. Please don't let things go too downhill Lake Eve!

During peak season the lots gets full at night, but they are helpful in getting you parked. This hotel (from the higher floors) overlook Sea World, some of Downtown Disney, International Drive, you can also see Disney's Tower of Terror in the distance. This hotel is very quiet, even with a full house it always sounds like you're the only one on the floor. As far as people complaining about the water, to me that's a southeast thing. I was born and raised in Florida and have traveled to Georgia and the Carolinas several times. That's just the way the water smells. There is nothing any filtration or the hotel, for that matter, can do about it. The water tastes just like any other water, bottled water included.

Everything is brand new and therfore very clearn (medicore cleaning staff discussed later) The Average - Pool - Very nice heated pool with limited sun access...why would you build a resort in Florida that did not give your guests the ability to lay in the sun through out the day? Pool gets full sun for about 2 hours - we had to shift sides if we wanted to be in the sun. Cleaning staff - came by most days by 9am and if you asked them to come back they rarely did. They came back to change towels and clean our room 1 out of the 4 nights we asked them to do this and we never got clean sheets. On two of the days we came back to a very clean room with new towels, toiletries and clean dishes but, again no clean sheets. The bad - Restaurant - words cannot describe, avoid at all costs. Noise - bring ear plugs, you can hear the sound of screeching chairs all day and night long. Called down to see what could be done and no one answered. We talked to the Manager the next day and she stated it would not happen again. Needless to say, in continued for the entire trip. Again our solution was to buy earplugs. The absolute worst is the REQUIRED or as they say Complimentry Valet service. Very, Very, Very annoying. I know this sounds like a nice perk, but it s a huge hassle for most guests. You will find the non-required valet spots fill up very fast. Overall, I would NOT recomended this hotel for anything but a cheap stay in central Florida. Given sometime I think this could be a great place to stay.

Paid $99 a night and it was good value at that price. The only real complaint is the noise. Good Points: *Location is great. Close to I4, parks, restaurants, Publix, Walgreens, but doesn't have \"downtown\" feel. *Pool and hot tub are clean and nicely heated, although pool is basic - not a resort style pool. * Parking lot is busy. Didn't like the forced valet concept at first, but by end of week we liked the convenience, although I hadn't budgeted extra tip money. Never had to wait long for valet, and the valet guys were always very helpful and cheerful. * Room is great (except for walls discussed below) and very spacious. Full kitchen and washer/dryer. Feels like an apartment. Beds are comfy. Bathrooms are great. Kitchen is nice. * Price was right at $99 a night, but I wouldn't pay more than that. Mediocre Points: *Service is in line with a budget hotel; not a top notch hotel. Never saw more than one person at front desk, and that one person's job includes answering the phone. So if you were fortunate to be at the front of the line, you would have to stand there and wait for one or more calls to end. It got to where I would call the hotel from my cell with questions, or avoid the front desk altogether. Not a big deal, and you shouldn't expect the Ritz at $99/night. * Tried the breakfast once. It was ok, but we didn't go back as it was easier to make breakfast in the kitchen. If you do eat there, buy your tickets the day before as you get a discount. The price you pay in advance includes the tip, although the ticket they give you says it does not include the tip. Web page says there's a pool side snack bar, although we never saw it open the week we were there. Maybe since the weather wasn't that hot and pool attendance was down. *Had 3 nice large TVs, but if you are planning to watch movies, bring your own DVD player as there isn't one in the room. Also bring your own laundry soap for the washer and scrubbers for dish cleaning. \"Fitness Center\" is a room with 2 treadmills and another areobic type machine. Also, has women and men's saunas Not-so- Great Points There's maid service, but don't expect a full cleaning. First day, we spilled some dry cheerios on rug in living room. Maid came and cheerios were still there. As an experiment, we didn't pick them up. They stayed on the rug until day 5. They bring towels and make beds, but they don't really clean. Still, it's better than a timeshare rental. *It is supposed to have WIFI, which it does, but it is intermittent. Sometimes it worked fine. Other times it worked with a low signal, and other times it didn't work at all. If you need guaranteed access to internet, it's not the right place. *The only real complaint is that the walls seemed thin. You hear some from the neighbors on the sides, and the worst is that you hear chairs scraping across the tile floor from neighbors above. One night there must have been an all night poker game going above us and we got little to no sleep that night. Definitely bring ear plugs. Overall, a good experience.

The rooms were spacious and clean and the full kitchen (which was fully stocked) was nice since it gave us the option to cook, make sandwiches or just buy snacks at the supermarket and store them in the fridge. The location was close to Disney (and even closer to Seaworld). One of the issues we had were that on the first night the WiFi wasn't working. The front desk said they would send an \"engineer\" to help, but all the engineer did when he showed up was hand us a paper with instructions that did not help us access the WiFi at all. I suspect the problem was that the hotel was packed that night and too many people were using the WiFi at once, but this was never acknowledged and everything was working the following morning. Another tiny issue was that a maid showed up to clean our room one morning at 9 a.m. When we indicated that we would likely be another hour before leaving, she seemed put out about having to return and really pressed us for a time before leaving. That said, service overall was wonderful. When we asked for extra towels they were at our door immediately. The front desk staff was friendly and quick. The valet staff also was very courteous to us even though we did not use the complimentary service during our stay (we did not want to wait around for our car and the self-parking was convenient enough). One thing for families with small children: the bathroom sink was really too high for my toddler to reach, so washing his hands and brushing his teeth were a little challenging.

I was offered a 2 bedroom suite at $69+taxes a nite for the entire stay. Lake Eve Resort is located in the Buena Vista area of Orlando close to Disney and Universal. It is in a quiet section of International Drive South. Newly opened this year, there are many promotional rates available. The PR/Sales manager gave me a great deal after I found an advertisement in Craigs List when I was searching for temporary stays in a hotel/townhomes. I had the opportunity to spend almost every night at their restaurant/bar. From Trevor, the chef; bartenders - George and Jose; and front desk persons, Summer and Nina; everyone made us feel comfortable and welcomed. As soon as you walk in, you will notice Summer's big sweet smile. You cannot miss her. Every room is a suite and has a kitchen, two flat screen in one bedrooms and three flat screen tv's in 2 bedrooms, etc. Every room's balcony overlooks their elegant poolside and cabana. Unfortunately, it was very cold when we were staying there, we never had the opportunity to hang out at the pool. Weather was 40-60 degrees and chilly. There is a free wireless internet available. There's not much to say about breakfast buffet since we were always rushing out the door first thing in the a.m. but from what I heard from one guest, it was nothing to write home about. There are many restaurants in the area so you don't have to stick to one place. There is a very good sushi restaurant around the corner nearby the Publix shopping center. Lake Eve recently changed their menu for the better. Prior to the change it was offering steakhouse menus with some kind of an Indian flair. Thank god, that's changed. It just didn't fit to the image of the restaurant. Ask for Trevor, he'll take care of your taste bud, if he has the ingredients to whip up something! This is a busy season around Christmas and New Years and Orlando is buzzing! Traffic is beyond terrible and nightmarish. Avoid Buena Vista around I4 area. Take local roads if possible. All in all, Lake Eve Resort is a great, quality place, value for money. Clean, new, accessible to downtown Disney area and to Universal.

The rooms are very nicely decorated with new, beautiful furniture, the counter tops in the kitchen and bathrooms are granite and the living room furniture is actually comfortable! (that's a first). The kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need. The best part for me was that there was a washer and dryer. That was SOOOO convenient!!! The room had high speed internet service that worked fast and perfect every time. I found the maid staff to be extremely friendly and efficient. They tried to come in and clean on the first day (at a reasonable time in the morning), but since I do it myself no matter where we stay, I didn't need them to come in, but to everyone who wants the daily maid service - it WILL get done. All we needed each day were trash bags, fresh towels, coffee, dish washing soap, ect...and they provided all of it each and every day. Most of the front desk was pretty friendly. They got us checked in and all of our paperwork done in about 10 minutes. They also let us have a late checkout since they were slow, which we really appreciated! There was one problem with the front desk that I should mention. On our second day, we were all out at the pool and I wanted to run up to our room to use the bathroom. When I got up there, my key wouldn't work. I simply thought it needed to be re-set so I went back downstairs to get that done, but when I told the girl at the front desk that my key wasn't working, she said it was because I was supposed to be checking out that day. I told her, \"no, I wasn't checking out for 3 more days.\" She of course argued with me, so I told her if she would let me up to use the bathroom, I would bring my paperwork down with me. While I was in the room, she called my room to tell me that she got it straightened out, but I missed the call and didn't find all this out until I got back downstairs with my confirmation papers. It all got worked out, but I spent the last hour that the sun was out (a storm was coming) running back and forth from my room to the front desk trying to prove to her that I was in fact supposed to be there, so that was pretty frustrating. The other problem was that I noticed on my second day, after I looked at my online credit card statement, I could see the charges from Lake Eve Resort. I noticed that they charged me an extra $50.00 more than what I was supposed to originally be charged, so I went downstairs to find out why. I was told that I was charged the extra $50.00 at the check in time for incidentals (room service, room damages, ect...) and that it would be credited right back to me the day I checked out. I have not seen the credit on my online statement yet, but this is only my second day home. The pool and pool area were really big and clean - I loved the chaise chairs, but the water was WAY to hot - 93 degrees! in the middle of September in Florida!. The day we spent at the pool, the pool guy was there cleaning and said he would adjust the tempature of the pool, because he also agreed that the pool was to warm. I'm sure they have it that warm so people can comfortably swim at night (which it was nice at night as we did swim then to), but during the day, 93 is just to hot. Another thing that I didn't like about the pool was that you can't get ANY sunshine until about 11:00 am because of the way the building is shaped. The building blocks the sun from every angle until about 11:00 am and after 3:00 pm. A few things about the hotel that might be annoying to some people are that there are no alarm clocks, there is no phone book, pencil or paper or TV guide. There isn't much to do for kids, so if your traveling with young one's, keep that in mind.

Everything in the room was clean except for the balcony (spider-webs on the railings). I slept in the living room on the pull out sofa bed. Even that was comfortable! There were 3 32-in flat screen tvs in the room (living room and both bedrooms). The view we had of the lake was terrible. Since we were on the 5th floor of a 14 floor establishment, we saw the lake very close. It looked disgusting and there were many trees blocking the view of the rest of the lake. I'm sure that people from the top floors got a great view of the rest of the lake but we weren't as fortunate. There are fireworks from SeaWorld that are done every night. The trees blocked most of our view but we still got to see a few during our stay. We did receive about 5 menus that were slipped under our door but it didn't bother us. The pool was okay, it could have been cleaner but it did the job. There is no lifeguard at the pool and it closed at 10pm. During our stay, the pool bar was not open.

The hotel was quiet, the pool was wonderful and the rooms are great. Something tells me this was meant to be condos and then at last minute they decided to change it to a hotel... which is great. We had breakfast included with our room every day, and let me tell you, the breakfast was ok for being free, but I was won over by the nice lady that runs it every day. If you read this, I can't remember your name, but I will always remember how friendly you were to our family every day we were there. My two boys still talk about you and we've been home a couple weeks. I didn't like the lady that ran the weekend buffet... I think her name was Helen, though i'm certainly not 100% on that. I hope this restaurant is still there when we return next week, as is the lady who ran the breakfast. She told me it was in transition to a new owner or something like that. There are not enough guests in the hotel to keep the restaurant running as is, so they need to do something. I can't complain about lack of staff, we never really needed anything. That was my main concern after reading all the reviews. First of all, the condo units are very well supplied with towels and there are in-room laundry facilities so there should be no need to request more towels, especially since they provide towels for the pool. Each and every day we had a maid at least knock on our door to see if we needed anything. If we weren't there they would come in and do a \"light\" cleaning. Every 3rd day we were there, they would come in and do a full cleaning. The units were very clean, and everything was fresh. The view out the windows and doorwall were very nice overlooking the pool. Some people complain about the sun not being on the pool all day. I liked that fact. I had my 4 month old infant with us, so I preferred keeping her out of the sun during the day. We spent most of our time swimming in either the morning or after the sun was far enough down that the building shaded the pool. Also, if you are on in the left wing of the building, or the center left, you can easily see the SeaWorld fireworks each night.

Will post reviews on all three places. Stayed 3 nights in a 3 bedroom in June 2009. Hotel was tremendous. Rooms are large and very modern. Since the hotel has only been open for 4 months, there are some obvious kinks - all of which are minor (e.g., Restaurant is rarely open. Bar is never open. Front Desk is understaffed.) I got an incredible deal through Travelocity. $89 for a 3BR 2BA room. My guess is this hotel was experiencing low occupancy so they sold a block of rooms to Travelocity for an unbelievably low price. This was an absolute bargain. Front desk was kind of confused but I rate that to being a new staff. Rooms are massive. Pool is great. Location is wonderful right next to Floridays, Sheraton Vistana Villages, The Fountains, etc. Definitely need a car to get around. W/D and full kitchen is a great plus. Fitness room only has 4 machines with 2 of those being treadmills. Also has 2 saunas. Everything was brand new and first class.

After staying there I felt the need to come and post what a positive experience it was. First of all, having a FULL kitchen and a washer & dryer has now set the standard for future Orlando visits. Packing less clothes and being to save money on eating out was HUGE! The location was great, right near a Publix (grocery store), outlet shopping, & Sea World. We were able to be at Universal Studios or Disney in about 20 minutes. If you are looking for a clean place to sleep,eat, shower & wash clothes between hitting the parks this is it! If you are looking for it as your \"destination\" it probably isn't what you are looking for. Don't get me wrong, the pool was a nice size & clean with plenty of chairs but that was it to do in the hotel. I never saw the bar open like other reviewers said but again that didn't matter to us. Other reviews stated no security & poor front desk service. I called a few days ahead to verify my reservation because I had booked through Expedia (which had a better price than the hotel itself could offer) and I wanted to verify that we were in the system & would be a very late arrival. The person I spoke to said she was busy at the moment and asked if she could call me back, which she did within the hour. When we arrived even later than we expected (due to airline delay) it was 2:30 am and the front desk person checked us in and had uniformed security escort us to our room which I thought was nice. So there is some security there. I definitely would go back and reccomend it to anyone staying in Orlando who is there for the parks. I will also throw in here that parking was an issue for a couple of days that we were there. The hotel was full and I'm guessing there is 1 spot for every room and someone parked a trailered boat taking up 5 spots for 3 days and if you got in late there you had to make your own spot. The hotel was good about you parking in the front lobby area as long as you werent in a fire lane. But who tells the boat guy that that's ok knowing the hotel is full?", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay...will definately go back!\u201d", "Author": "Badelv", "ReviewID": "UR33054696", "Content": "I stayed at the resort with my daughters and their young children for 6 nights.

We originally booked at the new Homewood Suites, but it wasn't ready so we were givenaccomdations at Lake Eve. As many have stated, the layout of the suite is wonderful and having a full kitchen is a bonus. The washer and dryer in the unit made \"laundry day\" much easier. I have absolutely no complaint about the amount of space and the unit itself. Comfortable furniture and matresses throughout the unit. There were, however, some problems with Lake Eve Resort. The front desk is understaffed, and it seems, undertrained and not terribly professional. No real interest taken in guests questions or concerns. One night, half the hotel lost power and all of the hotel lost internet and cable. After calling the front desk several times with no answer, we gave up and joined many people on their balconies wondering what had happened. No one was sent to the rooms to let guests know what was wrong or when the electricity would be back on. Being on the 12th floor, I didn't want to chance the elevator to the lobby in case the other half of the building went out, and really didn't want to climb back up 12 stories of stairs. When I asked the next morning what happened...I was told...I don't know, but three other hotels lost power too. Housekeeping did come by early each morning. Although we weren't ready to leave the room, they were happy to exchange towels and give us fresh supplies of soap, toilet paper etc., which worked out fine. If you need the internet for work while you are here (as I did), don't hold your breath. Internet connections were iffy at best and when they did work were terribly slow. The best signal I got in 4 days was \"poor\". When I asked the front desk about connectivity, I was simply told to call the internet provider. There are two hard wired computers in the lobby but you are charged in 15 minute increments for using them. Management seemed unsure of how to run a hotel/resort. Perhaps because it is a new property they need time, but the management and staff seemed terribly unprepared for guests. No phone books, no information about the resort itself was provided. The restaurant in the lobby seemed to be open on random days and on other days, not at all. Luggage carts are difficult to come by. Each night we returned home to a myriad of \"pizza\" ads shoved under our door, yet when we asked the front desk to recommend somehwere, you are told they don't make recommendations. Finally on another night, a front desk employee gave us the name and number of a local pizza place that delivers. Overall, the building and units themselves are beautiful. Had the management/front desk personnel been more attentive I would have given Eve Lake a 5 star rating. However the understaffed, undertrained employees and lack of detail would make me think twice about re-booking here again.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNot bad...Price was excellent for what we received\u201d", "Author": "rockets3", "ReviewID": "UR32829741", "Content": "Just got back from a 6 night stay in a 2 bedroom unit.

The service staff was very friendly all though they could use another person at the desk but the check-in in and out was quick, they even allowed us to check in 2 hours early which was a very welcome relief after driving 14 hours to get there. During our stay the power did go out for half of the building one evening for about 3 hours, not a good thing but we were one of the lucky ones, we only lost our cable and phone service. The place was packed during our stay and there wasn't enough parking spaces, especially when a guest was allowed to take up 5 spaces with their boat. Also, there are no stairs that you can take, you must use the elevators going up, I wasn't big on that. Over all this was a good place to stay with a great price. As long as you can get a good rate ($102) for a 2 bedroom, we will be back.

Master bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed, master bath with whirlpool tub and large walk in shower. Second bedroom had two queen beds. The second bath was perfect for our kids. Lots of closet space. Large balcony overlooking the pool and Lake Eve was very nice. In-room washer and dryer was a lifesaver-- we didn't have to pack so many clothes (take some laundry soap powder), and simply washed clothes as needed during our week long stay. We have no complaints, but a couple of suggestions. There was no dishrag or liquid dish soap in the kitchen (one packet of dishwasher soap was provided per day). We had to use a washcloth to clean the kitchen and had nothing to scrub pots. If you are planning to do any cooking, as we did, you may want to pack a scrubber and some dish soap. Hopefully the hotel will consider adding these supplies in the future. Otherwise the kitchen was well supplied. We cooked a full breakfast each day and some simple suppers, saving us a ton of money compared to eating out. The pool was fabulous. Plenty of lounge chairs, large pool plus kiddie pool and hot tub. We didn't use the restaurant. It did not seem to be open all the time but this was not a concern for us. Check in and check out were fast and completely trouble-free. There was plently of parking on weekdays, but it filled up on the weekend (this was during the last 2 games of the NBA finals, with Orlando Magic playing at home -- possibly this contributed to the crowded parking on the weekend).

When we arrived they put us in a one bedroom instead of the three bedroom we had reserved. No problems getting that changed though; we simply showed the desk clerk our confirmation and she moved us. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous and very spacious. The pool area is equally appealing. The housekeeping leaves much to be desired. If you stay for any length of time they only clean every three days. They are supposed to come in daily to do light housekeeping. Most days the housekeeper showed up at 8 am and we weren't even out of bed. We asked her to return later and she never did. That happened three out of the six days we were there. They provide tiny, worthless trash bags in the kitchen area and we kept running out. With five people and cooking every day in the room it was hard not to generate trash. We started stacking it up next to the door hoping someone would come eventually and dispose of it. Two days after our arrival we were moved to a different floor due to electrical problems in our area. We received the call around 8:30 - 9:00 am and had fifteen minutes to pack our things and move four floors up. They did send a gentleman to help but he basically just put things on a cart as we handed them to him. It was so frustrating to delay our departure for Magic Kingdom to pack, move and unpack. Especially since we were finally settled, had gone grocery shopping and had a lot of food to move as well. I know they were thinking about the safety of their guests and it was beyond their control but they didn't seem apologetic about it. They should have offered something for all the trouble but they just said we were lucky because one guest had already left that morning and wouldn't be able to get into the room when they returned. We're lucky to have to pack up five people and a week's worth of groceries and move in the middle of our vacation?? Their customer service is lacking. The pool area was never crowded. Matter of fact, we were usually the only people there in the mornings. Don't expect to get any sun until about 11 am though. The way the building wraps around the pool keeps the sun out until then. That was good for my kids but not for me as I was interested in getting a tan. We had to clean bugs out of the pool daily. I'm not sure any staff member ever did so while we were there. That really surprised me. In conclusion...the location is wonderful, the amount we paid for the room was absolutely awesome and for that reason we didn't complain too much about the staff and inconveniences.
