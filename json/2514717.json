Particularly true, when you place your trust into a GPS rather than rely on long-term memory. The GPS took us from NJ through Staten Island to Brookly and over the Brooklyn Bridge rather than under through the Holland Tunnel (long-term memory). So we save a half-hour on traffic and drove through 3 of the 5 boroughs only to find a street fair along Waverly Place in front of the hotel. So, we found our intended parking garage two blocks away and jettisoned the SUV to the street smart guy who was happy to park it deep and forget about for a few days. Only two blocks and we had packed light so we strolled over with suitcases through the food vendors and artists along Waverly. Hotel staff happily greeted us a little before 3 PM, heard at least 3 different languages immediately which confirmed WSH as a European traveler favorite, and ushered us to our comfortable room with a large bath, comfy beds/pillows, free wi-fi, and continental breakfast. Rooms are not large but adequate and well-maintained. Remember, it's location, location, location! We went for a walk in Washington Square Park (built for the100th anniversary of honoring our first elected president) and found a great place for fresh Italian hot chocolate with double expresso) and got re-oriented to the habits and culture of the CITY. Located between 6th (Ave. of Americas) and 7th, WSH is a great base to explore the Village or hale a taxi for downtown (financial district or the place where all our money got lost) or mid-town and fan out shop, search for food, clothes, fabrics (check out West 40th near NY Times building and the foodie places along 7th Ave or the high-end shops over on 5th Ave. Every block east-west or north-south is an adventure as the pulse of the city grabs you.

The location is simply excellent. As first-timers in NYC it was great to stay in an area as laid back and lovely as Greenwich/West Village. You are a stone's throw away from endless bars, restaurants and of course the beautiful Washington Square park but still within walking distance or a cab/subway ride to the major sights. We actually walked the entire length of 5th Avenue from just outside the hotel, which was a great way to see New York by foot. In terms of facilities, the room price included a continental breakfast which consisted of fruit, bagels, croissants, biscuits and muffins, plus yoghurt and cereal. We only ate the breakfast twice as we were spoiled by numerous diners, brunch venues, but it's adequate and will set you up for the day. Our room was admittedly tiny, but we spent very little time in there. It was immaculate in condition and very comfortable. A nice touch is a coffee machine and crisp white bathrobes. We didn't use the hotel bar but it looked lovely and the hotel is equipped with a gym (if you have the inclination, but I'd recommend pounding the streets to get your exercise). The staff were also incredibly attentive and helpful. Always polite, the door staff were particularly friendly, offering shopping, eating and transport advice on our way out every day. Things to do in the area that I'd recommend: Walk along University Pl. (turn left out of the hotel and walk along Waverly Pl. till you see it) - loads of nice shops and cafes. We had brunch at Jacks outside in the sunshine, great menu and good service. Go to Bleecker St. If you like live music you'll love it there, there's tons of live music bars, most with singers/bands/open mic nights on nightly, most free entry. Eat at the Good Stuff Diner: a short walk along 6th Avenue. Simply the best breakfast I have ever eaten and a must for those wanting the quintessential NYC brunch experience. I'm still disappointed I only got to go there once. I can't think of any negatives with this hotel, perhaps except the size of the rooms, but that's New York. All in all, great value for money, fantastic location and brilliant staff. I will be recommending the Washington Sqare to everyone I know who's planning a trip to New York, and I hope to go back there soon myself!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great location\u201d", "Author": "Brad B Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126233500", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel more than 5 times during the last few years.

Never having been to New York before, we chose the Washington Square on the recommendation of a friend and am pleased to say that it was a very comfortable stay. Our room, 718, was on the corner, almost overlooking the Square, on the front elevation. It wasn't a large room, but it was comfortable, clean and with the facilities one would expect. However, the street outside can get noisy in the night, with refuse trucks collecting in the small hours. On one night, the City decided to mend the road opposite the hotel. Jack-hammers at 11:30pm until 2:30am is not something I was expecting. Not the hotel's fault, though, and the desk clerk did go and speak with the workforce on our behalf and offer us earplugs. The breakfast can either be a cooked or a continental buffet. On our first morning, a Sunday, the continental was in a sub-basement room/bar area and was great. A wide variety of pastures, bagels, etc, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, etc. Later in the week, this room was always closed, and we had to eat in the serviced area. The continental was still gratis, but you had no choice, as the waiters went to the kitchen to fetch the food. The cooked offer, which we ate one morning, was \"OK\". I didn't write home about it. Don't try to eat ion the ground floor bar - the tables a rev far too small. Very friendly doorman, Ronnie, who had lots of hints and advice about visiting the city and excellent desk staff.

As for the area, there's a drug store right around the corner on 6th Av, the street it's on (Waverly) is incredibly quiet and really quaint. Too many restaurants in the area to list and you're very close walking distance from Washington Square Park, SOHO, East and West Village for shopping and sightseeing.

We had to prompt her to say when it may be ready and were told 3.30pm (half an hour later than it should be). We were not offered an explanation or ideas of what to do in the mean time...NY is rather daunting when you first arrive! However the lovely guy on the door offered to take our cases and suggested we make the most of the beautiful weather and go to Washington Square Park, which we did. We arrived back at 3.20pm to be met by another moody receptionist who said our room was ready and asked for a credit card in most rude manner. I'm afraid to say at this point after 10 hours + travelling I did say that I was tired and irritable and was likey to snap back at her at any moment and after this, she became helpful and friendly! We finally arrived to our room and had to wait as the cleaner was still vacuuming! He didn't take long though and we were in. I have to say we were both a little disappointed on first glance. The room was very small and dark (view from window was a brick wall) and was in need of a lick of paint. However, it was immaculately clean and the bathroom was more than adequate with nice thick heavy robes for our use. The wardrobe is a joke for 2 women sharing! We had to stuff clothes in bedside table drawers etc! The room did its job though, we were only there to sleep in any case as NY has so much to see and do.

Previously we've chosen to stay in midtown hotels but were looking for something a bit more relaxed and I was so glad that I found this hotel. Washington Square itself is a lovely park/public area with dog-walkers, guys playing chess, joggers, birds, squirrels, pushchairs, low key musicians. Walking through it was a very pleasant way to begin and end the day. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful throughout. Decor was generally very good and had a bit of quirky character in the hallways. Our room was small (but I've stayed in smaller), and the view from our window was uninspiring (but I was prepared for that after deciding to book their most budget-friendly room). However the room was spotlessly clean and the bedsheets were crisp, white and good quality. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I'd brought a torch to look for bed bugs but after a close inspection I was reassured that the beds were clean everywhere. Despite paying a purse-friendly price for our room there were lots of amenities to make a stay more pleasant: bathrobes, hairdryer, bathroom toiletries, a great coffee maker, ipod alarm clock. Minor niggles were that I could only see one free electrical socket (2 people with a phone each need 2 sockets) and there was only a small supply of coffee/milk for 2 people. There wasn't a fridge but there was an ice bucket and ice available. The continental breakfast (bagels, croissants, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, juice, coffee, tea) was a bonus as was the free wi-fi. We didn't take our laptops but used my iphone to look up local directions to restaurants, subways, stores and cinemas and so found the wi-fi a lot more useful than expected.

The hotel has king, two doubles or two twin rooms. I will say the rooms are your standard NYC room, meaning on the smaller size and definitely not your big chain hotel size room. We had a King room and a room with tow doubles. The king had much more room than the queen, even room for a pack and play if you needed to place one in the room. The king room als had a \"makeup\" table with a lit mirror in front of it. The double room had something similar. Our double had two closets one for hanging clothes and the other had the safe and shelves. I will say that the shower in our double was too powerful. It was good for washing my thick hair, but not for sensitive skin areas. There was always plenty of hot water and the room was clean. The A/C was a little different in that you had window units in each room. Luckily, we had a new unit and it cooled well, but it felt humid in the room. However, my friend's room had an older unit and it did not cool very well or remove the humidity. My only complaint would be that these were supposed to be non-smoking rooms, but as soon as we went in you could smell the lingering smell of smoke. The hotel also has free continental breakfast, but we wanted something a little more substantial so I can not speak to the quality of the breakfast. As far as the location goes , it was excellent. It is located on the northwest corner of Washington Park. You walk across the street and you can hang out in the park. The fountain is fun for kids to splash and play in. It is only a half block or less to the Metro. You have so many good restaurants and sweet shops in the village. Fish was a good restaurant for dinner, as was Union Square Cafe, the Bagel shop had wonderful breakfast bagels. The western omelet bagel was delicious.

Location was indeed very excellent. Not far from super hip SoHo & Bleeker Street and only a block or so away from the 4th avenue Subway station. For being a relatively small (for New York) and extensively renovated hotel building, there's a lot going on in there. When you look at the reservation form, it appears that there are nine different kinds of rooms available. They also have two elevators and three stairways. All crammed into that one building. As mentioned in the title of my review, the folks that did the thorough renovating made very liberal use of mirrors & soft earth tones to give a very effective illusion that the rooms are bigger than they really are. There's only so much they can do with limited real estate. The room my office reserved for me, if I had to guess what they booked, was likely the \"Double Bed Deluxe\". The actual room that I slept in, next to one of the elevator shafts, was incredibly small, with one small window with at least the bottom third covered up by an A/C unit and an even smaller window in the bathroom. The room was very clean and very well maintained. A couple maintenance issues that I discovered and reported to the front desk were taken care of before I returned from my day outside. There's a \"iHome\" iPad clock stereo radio next to the bed that has a plug that allows input from other mp3 players. Room safe was very compact and while it has two shelves which comfortably fit iPods, wallets, and other small devices, it isn't big enough to hold any laptops. The closet also held a small ironing board and iron. No terry cloth bath robe in my Deluxe room, even though a little placard said I could buy the robe from my room for $75. What? I guess that's a Superior class room amenity. I really appreciated that WiFi and Ethernet (cable is hidden in the top drawer of the cabinet) is free. The room next to mine was some kind of King room and I was impressed with the size of it -- at least 2 - 3 times bigger than my room, with a double sink in the bathroom. This helps to explain the crazy difference in reviews I can see here for this hotel: when you pay a bit more in the rate, you're likely to have a dramatically improved room size and overall experience. Like the other reviewers have noted, if you have a room next to the elevator you'll certainly hear noise periodically (the door opening / closing) and maybe some talking in the hallway but in general my room was quite quiet. And I was able to switch the A/C unit to \"fan mode\" which really assisted my sleep with some useful white noise and air circulation. Every guest gets access to the \"continental\" breakfast in the (also small) bar/lounge area. Continental breakfast consists of various pastries (bagels are cut into halves), some small bits of fruit (and whole apples or pears), cereal and yogurt. There are only a few tables in the lounge area so if you can't find a seat, just wait a few minutes and one will open up relatively quickly. I saw a \"VIP breakfast\" voucher sitting on one table (and looking at a review just below this one, they mentioned warm dishes like eggs), so I'm guessing that certain rates and/or guests get vouchers to go to the attached restaurant to get a more thorough breakfast experience. Gym is also small but functional. There were two treadmills, a cable / nautilus machine, some free weights, a bike and an exercise ball. Cameras *everywhere* in public areas (which feed to a big monitor down at the front desk), so you can have a good sense of security. There's a huge variety of restaurants one block away down MacDougal street, including Mamoun's famous falafel shop and a sub-street level Ethiopian restaurant named Meserkem (which I very much enjoyed). So to summarize: unlike most hotels where the difference between room rates and room types can be very subtle, the difference here can be very dramatic and if you find the prices not too different from one room type to another, investing in a better room type might mean a much better time. Was my small room worth the $500+ all-in for two nights that my company paid? I could probably have gotten a much bigger room for the same price at a chain hotel somewhere else on Manhattan, but then again I can't think of many (or any) chain hotels in casual walking distance of SoHo & Greenwich Village off the top of my head. And hotels on Manhattan are always pricey, anyways. It's one of those things I might be drawn into debating over drinks in the breakfast area\u2026 errr\u2026 WSH lounge.

We were really pleased we stayed here - the beds (2 large doubles) were really comfortable and the bathrooms (We stayed in a quad room for three nights and twin and double for one as the quad was unavailable for the first night) ranged from sumptuous (Delux double) to just fine (double). The quad room number 120 is at street level and yes you do hear street noise - but this is New York and we were so tired after busy days doing exciting things that we all slept well. The bathrooms all had plenty of towels and free shampoo/conitioner/body lotion/soap. Breakfast was delicious - fruit salad, home baked pastires, good coffee and orange juice, cereal and yogurt.. The staff including the freindly doorman were all helpful and booked a taxi to the airport at the end of the stay to Newark for $62. Cheaper than getting a yellow cab and more roomy when you need to take all your baggage. The best attractions we visited were top of the rock and it's worth getting the daytime/sunset deal (we didn't and ended up paying twice) sunset over Manhattan has to be one of the world's most exciting views. The MOMA was one of the best art collections I've ever seen - 5th floor for all the Picassos,and Matisses - wonderful. Staten Island Ferry - free and great for skyline views. Our teenagers loved the Record shops in Thompson Street - nothing like it in the UK any more. Loads of good places to eat near the hotel and a Staples for online checkin just around the corner. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and would book again without hestiation. But if you want sterility and double glazing go somewhere else - you can hear street noise and that kind of thing annoys you you might be better off staying Uptown.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cwonderful stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "bellisimo", "ReviewID": "UR47903005", "Content": "we arrived on a wednesday evening and received a warm welcome.....we had requested a room on the upper floors with a nice view and the hotel accomodated our request. we absolutely loved this hotel...it is very quaint and the service from the front desk to the bellman to the restaurant servers was fantastic......room is not large but it is very comfortable and clean and the location can't be beat....within walking distance of restaurants, night life, shopping.......a real gem in nyc.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "RHW4", "ReviewID": "UR46166514", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel to be told our rooms were not ready - we had to for around an hour and a half for both of our two rooms to be ready for us.

It certainly was quiet as well, we did not hear a peep from outside or from anyone else in the hotel. Our room was very small and I would have liked to have a little more closet space but this was a small price to pay for being located in Greenwich Village. So much to see and do just on the hotels doorstep. The staff were also friendly and welcoming, always a goodbye or hello when leaving or entrering the hotel. With regards food, we only ate breakfast at the hotel, this was plentiful and you could also order cooked extras should you prefer. There are simply hundreds of places to eat nearby - I am a vegetarian and had a fantastic meal at a place called \"Gobo\", just around the corner from the hotel.

I read some of the other reviews, and have to say that we have stayed in both the deluxe and standard rooms and although the rooms are small, we're more than happy with the size. The last room we stayed in had a particularly small closet, but we simply put our luggage under the desk and it was out of the way. We weren't bothered by the thin shower curtain either, although I'd like to see the rod hung a bit lower to keep more water in. We love the WSH - the lobby is spacious, the staff friendly and professional (with the exception of Ronnie, who talks a mile a minute and tries to convince us to eat at restaurants we've no interest in - I think he gets a kick back for recommending certain places), the location is wonderful, and everything is CLEAN. Some reviewers complained about breakfast - I don't know what they're used to eating, but for us, a bowl of muffins/scones/bagels and yogurt, cereal and fresh fruit is plenty. We've also ordered off the regular menu and haven't been disappointed. The orange juice is always freshly-squeezed, and their coffee and tea is freshly brewed. We've also had some of the bar food - their guacamole is fresh and obviously made in the kitchen. The drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is courteous and professional. The best part about WSH? You can cross the street to Babbo restaurant and if you get there about 4:45 pm and wait at the door, you can be seated at a table near the bar and have the most astoundingly good meal. We do this every time we stay here, and sometimes 2 nights in a row. The food is THAT good. Cons? Small spaces - if you are an overly large person, you probably won't feel comfortable here.

We were expecting the small room sizes (and the middle range room really is small, there's nowhere to put the suitcase as the wardrobe is too small and there's no space for a stand!) and it was extremely clean. There were however quite a few niggles. One day we arrived back to see the maids still making up the rooms at 4.30pm - ours hadn't been done and as we didn't feel like going out again we had to flick it to do not disturb and go without. This seems riddiculously late to be doing the cleaning up. Another gripe was that whilst they do provide some free wi-fi access there is no shared computer, we traveled without a wi-fi enabled device and at the other 3 places we stayed at a computer was provided for checking emails and other small things. The TV had few channels and didn't have an inbuilt menu where you can see what's coming up in the next couple hours, I'd rarely complain about TV but again this was something we had had in our other stays. The breakfast was also amazingly limited, a small basket of pasteries to share between two, a small bowl of melon and one glass of orange juice. I realise it's rare for a hotel to offer breakfast but we expected a continental breakfast to be buffet style (one of their 2 rooms you are waited on) with the feeling you can have more than 1 serving. One day we escaped for waffles at the nearby diner just to start the day on a full stomach. Finally the bathroom had the cheapest, flimsiest shower curtain possible, so that it clung to your body and then all the water escaped into a giant puddle on the floor. The reception staff were very mixed in their helpfulness, on one occasion we needed to do flight check in at 10.30pm and had to ask at reception for the nearest late internet caf\u00e9, the staff on duty very grumpily told us to take two rights and there's a place that might still be open. Luckily it was but they really didn't seem too concerned. Although when we checked out we did have a helpful lady who told us they could look after our luggage and booked us a car to the airport. The cocktail bar was incredibly difficult to find, we had to ask at reception, which is a shame as the drinks were lovely and quite cheap ($9).The barmaid was very friendly but we definitely got the impression she wished more people knew about it. Generally this hotel is in a good location with good transport links around NY, we just felt it was a tad overpriced.

The location is fantastic, on a street of old brownstones at the edge of the West Village. There are subways to the West Side and Downtown at the west end of the block, subways to the the East Side a couple of blocks away at Astor Place, easy taxis on Sixth Ave. Washington Square and Fifth Avenue are at the other end of the block. The price is great and the rooms are very clean and up to date. What's not to like? The heat for one thing and the front desk for another. I had a hard time feeling the warmth at this hotel. It is an old building with radiant baseboard heat below the window. There is a control to turn the heat up or down. I had two rooms during my stay. In the first room the heat worked but had a difficult time keeping up with the draft from the old air conditioner stuck in the middle of the little window. This first room was on a light well with pigeons. After my first night I asked to be moved to a room with a better view. I was given a south facing room on the same fourth floor overlooking Waverly Pl. Fair enough. There really are not any views at this hotel. I have heard that some of the rooms in the back have a view of the Empire State Building, but none of these were offered to me. The second room had bigger windows. The heat barely worked and the room was was freezing. It had the same old air conditioner stuck in the middle of the window. I also see these same dirty, old air conditioners not being able to keep the rooms cool in the summer. Another big problem with the drafty room is the window treatment. The windows have no real curtains on them, only a valence and fake drapes on the sides that do not close to cover the window completely. They rely on two sets of shades, one set filtered, one opaque. Neither covers the air conditioner and to accomplish this they use two side shades and a center shade that does not go down past the top of the air conditioner. There are big gaps between the shades letting in drafts and light. It is impossible to cover the drafty old air conditioner. The second room was so cold I couldn't shower. I was back in the first room before the day was over. In all fairness, the front desk did accommodate my room hopping without any problem, but never before or after my room changing were they very cordial. Every person who enters the hotel must go past the front desk and a \"security guard.\" Neither ever said hello or good day. I felt like I was doing something wrong by walking through the lobby. I'm a well mannered, clean cut guy who tips and pays the bill. I deserve a hello. One day I asked the security guard for directions to Charles Street. i knew it was off of Christopher Street and i wanted directions to Christopher Street. He sent me south down Sixth Ave. to Houston Street and up the West Side Highway, a mile out of my way on a cold, windy January day. Christopher Street was one block north of Waverly up Sixth. I would have thought it a mistake on his part had he not been so adamant that I did not want to take Christopher Street, his refusal to tell me where Christopher Street was, and his insistence that I go south down Sixth no matter what. The night before I left I called the front desk to order a \"taxi\" to the airport for the next morning. The desk clerk said it would not be a problem. The next morning I reported to the front desk at the appointed time to find out that the \"taxi\" was actually an in-house car service. Without time to go looking for a real taxi, I ended up paying $15 more than I should have to get to the airport. The same security guard that gave me the bogus directions took one of my bags to the car. No tip for him.

However, a quick visit to the main desk, a new room was assigned, we just had to wait one day - so all was well. Second room wasn't huge either but was a good deal bigger than the first and was very comfortable. A little road noise can be heard, but that's shouldn't be be an issue to most visitors to NYC - I hope. The hotel is very clean, the staff courteous and helpful and the main plus - is location. I have stayed in mid town on 2 previous visits and we were ready for a change, so glad we did - it made for a completely different NY experience. There is a subway right at the end of the street and we got to all locations we wanted to without having to change trains, you get either one or the other of the 2 lines and they take you to most of the main attractions - excellent! We didn't try the restaurant - too many choices elsewhere. The complimentary breakfast is a nice touch and there was plenty of the usual continental items available.

Our main reason for picking this hotel is its location, in the heart of Greenwich Village. You're right next to the NYU campus, so of COURSE there is going to be noise and activity outside! The building only has around 9 floors, so you're not going to be high up enough to miss any noise, so if this is an issue for you, be aware. Then again, if noise is an issue, maybe New York city isn't your ideal destination?! Having said that, the noise wasn't that bad, and we managed to sleep pretty well every night (bring ear plugs!). We did ask for a quiet room, and were in room 810, which is a deluxe queen. The room was much larger than the one we stayed in last time. We had towelling robes, umbrella, hair dryer, safe, flat screen TV, iPod doc, ironing board, etc, in the room. The only problem we had was the noise from what can only be described as a construction site practically right outside our window! The building next door was being renovated and it was really bad when we first arrived, during the day. We did ask to be moved but were told our room was one of the biggest and anything else would be smaller and they couldn't move us until the next day. As it turns out, we didn't move as we were out of the hotel nearly all day and evening, and by the time we got back the construction work had stopped. Other people might experience problems with noise on this side of the building as other reviewers have mentioned it. But I don't want to sound too negative. This is a great hotel - not TOO expensive compared to other places; a bit rough around the edges in places, but you honestly can't beat the location - right in Greenwich Village, about a 10 min walk to Soho, near the subway. Plus the free breakfast isn't to be sniffed at! The staff are generally helpful, especially the great guys who work the floor in the lobby, very friendly, giving out advice and calling you a car for the airport, etc. I would definitely stay here again.

The room and bathroom were small (which we knew would be the case), decor was sparse but stylish, the staff was friendly and helpful. Our major issue was with the NOISE--from the street & sidewalk just outside our window at night (the A/C is mounted in the window, so the exterior noises are not filtered out) and the construction noises in the adjacent building which is undergoing major renovation during the day. Request a \"quiet\" room when you book or check in. Other guests appeared to have noise problems too and they were asking to change rooms. The rooms on the front and east side of the building might be less noisy (ours was on the west side to the rear).

I loved the Art Nouveau/Art Deco interiors, some other reviewers seemed to think it was dark but I think it was lovely and cosy. My only complaint is that I was made aware that my friend had tried to contact the hotel to put a bottle of Champagne in our room as a surprise and was passed from reception to the restaurant and back again, the outcome was we didn't get our Champagne to celebrate our honeymoon, not sure if this is symptomatic of this hotel only or more a reflection on customer services levels in NYC (which are not all they are made out to be!).

Having stayed in NYC previously near Times Square we were keen to stay in a different part of the city and to explore more of Greenwich, Soho etc. The location of this hotel made it an excellent base from which to do this and is probably it's biggest asset. We arrived at night and were allocated a room on the 5th floor. We had booked a deluxe room with a queen bed and were glad we had, there wasn't much room in the bedroom so I'm not sure how much smaller the standard rooms/beds would have been. The room itself was pretty basic, clean and comfortable and it made a perfectly adequate base for our weekend stay. If you're looking for a plush room with all mod cons then this isn't the place for you but if you want somewhere clean and comfortable to lay your head at the end of a day out in NYC then this is just the place. The only real issue that we had with the room was the air-conditioning. AC is provided by small window mounted units which made a lot of noise and weren't very effective. The temperature was such that we could have done with the AC on at night but decided not to put it on as we thought it would have kept us awake with the noise. Given it's location and proximity to bars and clubs etc we did hear a bit of street noise late at night, nothing too bad but if you are a light sleeper best to ask for a quiet room if possible. Good points about the hotel are the free internet connection and complementary continental breakfast. This consists of juice, coffee or tea, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, bagel and muffin and was a good start to the day. If you want something more substantial then you can order from the menu, the prices are pretty reasonable. We also drank in the bar on the night of our arrival which was fine, if a little dark. The best thing about this place is the location. In the heart of 'the village' just across the road from Washington Square Park with a subway station at the end of the road. There are loads of bars, restaurants and shops within a 5 minute stroll and we enjoyed exploring the surrounding neighbourhoods. Overall we were happy with our stay.

The bathrooms are very clean, the beds are very soft and comfortable, and if you upgrade like I did, you can have web access in your room. The staff is usually very nice and there is free breakfast in the restaurant where you can actually sit down and enjoy coffee. You can order off the menu for more. This hotel is in walking distance to NYU and Washington Square so there are many restaurants, diners, shops, 24 hr markets to get anything you will need for your hotel room. There are cabs everywhere so you can go anywhere in Manhattan. My absolute best advice from this trip is to pack very, very, very comfortable shoes as you walk everywhere. I ruined my feet from bad shoes and had to buy new ones, but the damage was done by that point. I cannot say one negative thing about this place. There is no early check in so if you arrive early, they will store your luggage for you. Every Weds. Union Square has a Green Market which is a don't miss.

There are lots of good restaurants within 10-15 minutes walk of the hotel - it's a good idea to book, especially at the weekend. The real downside for us was the problem of noise starting with deliveries or refuse collection well before 6 am and also the very intrusive building noise which is taking place close to the hotel at the moment. This starts around 8 am and is LOUD! It was possible to reduce the noise to a small extent by keeping the window closed (but it did not appear to be double glazed - so this did not make a huge amount of difference). If the window was closed the room got warm (even in April) and the air conditioning was also extremely noisy. We are not light sleepers and can usually sleep through the sort of noise you might expect in a city , or with air conditioning, but this was really bad. Overall we liked the hotel and there is little choice in Greenwich Village area. However I think we would only book again if we were going in a cool season when it would not be necessary to use air conditioning and we would check first to see if the building work had finished.

Everything seemed to be booked or more than $400/night. (I know Manhattan hotels are expensive, but sheesh!)

Since the rate I received for a single was so far below the rates I found for other hotels, I was nervous about the stay. But I have to say, the hotel far exceeded my expectations. I was allowed to check in very early by a pleasant front desk attendant. I found my (remodeled) room on the second floor to be lovely, but small, which is typical of New York, but with plenty of storage and surface space for my needs. My window overlooked an airshaft. Some people might not like that they can't look out on the city, but I prefer a quiet room at night and that's exactly what I got. Plus the room/bathroom were immaculate. (I even pulled up the sheets and examined the mattress corners for my bedbug check ;-) The continental breakfast was surprisingly satisfying (fruit, bread basket, coffee, juice) but I must say the service was spotty. Day one we couldn't get anyone's attention and sat for quite a while before being served. Second day there were several pleasant servers fawning. Who knows? I had a problem w/the heat in my room--too much of it---and the front desk had someone from maintenance up there within 5 minutes to turn off the register for me. In fact, I found the front desk to be extremely helpful, in general--one arranged very affordable, last-minute car service for our group, and someone was always willing to give directions, etc. (Loved that the subway entrance was a short block away and there was a drugstore on the corner.)

Doormen very ammenable, giving advice on the local area and hailing cabs.Our room was not ready on arrival but we were immediately offered complimentary cocktails in the bar to pass the time. Hotel is not huge but has been re-furbished, complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day, we ate in the hotel several times and food was a very good standard at a reasonable cost. Our room was compact and although kitted out with all the 'little extras', bath robes, shower gels etc, was classed as an 'internal room' and did not have any natural light. In fairness we knew that when we booked it, but in hindsight had it been available when we booked we would have paid the little extra for an external facing room. The hotel is situated on the corner overlooking Washington Square Park, there always seemed to be some type of entertainment going on there eg, musicians & singers. There are a lot of cafes and bars within easy walking distance, tables & chairs on the pavements with a relaxed European style atmosphere. Can recommend the open top bus tours (particularly the night time tour which takes you over into Brooklyn giving unforgettable views of the Manhattan skyline at night). Also the evening sunset water taxi harbour cruise was excellent value for money with more stunning views. On our final evening we 'treated' ourselves to a meal at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at The London Hotel and we were not disappointed, a real gastronomic experience. Our taste buds are spoilt forever.

The hallway was not air conditioned and was hot and stuffy.

I was attending a conference at NYU and my wife was doing art business. We travel to New York a lot. My wife is an artist and her gallery representation is in Chelsea, and her father, a New York City native, lives in midtown. We spend almost all of our time downtown and are constantly looking for good places to stay in the Village, SoHo, or Chelsea, and thought we would give this one a try, given my business at NYU. I have to say that this was my favorite place to stay downtown so far, for the money (I think we ended paying about 250 a night--it would be more between Labor Day and New Year's, I imagine. But you can spend that much in NYC and end up in a dump, and as we all know, star ratings for NYC hotels mean nothing--you have to know the place). To begin with, the location is fantastic, with easy walking distance to some of the best streets and shops in the city (Bleecker St.., for example, with the fabulous Murray's Cheese Shop and Amy's Breads, is only a few blocks away). Good subway access nearby as well, and right off Broadway. We often stay at the Solita SoHo hotel, at Grand St. and Lafayette (about a 15-20 minute walk down Broadway), and found this hotel better for the same money. To begin with, our room was very large by New York standards--much larger than the Solita--had a very nice bathroom with good light, and included free internet access. The furnishings, linens, etc. were relatively new and in excellent condition, and the decor was tasteful and Deco-flavored. The building has a lot of character and charm and has the feel of \"old New York,\" as that part of the city does. And by \"charm\" I don't mean \"old and broken down.\" Quite the contrary, the building is in excellent shape, with a nice, spacious lobby, very good elevator, a nice, cozy little bar right off the lobby, and a good bar and restaurant (the North Square) attached, where a nice continental breakfast was included in the rate (an excellent muffin, fresh fruit, and coffee and juice--not a big deal when you're surrounded by great coffee shops, but nice nonetheless). We found the service to be fine, though as with most New York hotels, it depends a bit on who is working the desk and whether you run into any serious problems, which we did not. We found the staff friendly, helpful, and warm. In short, if you want to stay in the Village, and you don't want to stay (or pay) in a larger place like one of the Grands downtown, this is an excellent choice, with a very good combination of character, service, and amenities. And the location is as good as it gets. This is where we'll stay from now on when we visit NYC, and that's quite a compliment, given how often we go there.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cgreat Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "sputwesthampstead", "ReviewID": "UR7393461", "Content": "I was recommended to stay at this hotel by one of my mates in London.

We arrived in the morning and check-in is not until 3 p.m., so we arranged with the doorman to store our luggage and come back later, which was no problem. The front desk noted our request to have a room on a higher floor, and this was the case when we returned. Everyone we dealt with was very helpful and pleasant. Our room was quite comfortable and very clean. There was some noise from the street the first night, but it did not last long. We faced onto McDougall with a view of the park; I can imagine there would be more street noise in the summer. Our room was right behind the elevator, but we did not hear it at all. The hallways are somewhat narrow but appear to have been painted and carpeted in the last few years. Judging by the decor of our room, we may have had a superior room rather than the deluxe room we booked; if so I would recommend the superior as some other reviewers have. It was not overly large but fine for two people. The hotel is central to everything we wanted, including several subway lines. We had breakfast in the restaurant both mornings. The food and service is good, though a bit expensive. We ordered from the menu instead of having the included breakfast (which is coffee, fresh-squeezed orange juice, a dish of fruit salad and a basket of toasted bagels with jam and butter). There are many choices in the area, and we will probably try other cafes or restaurants next time. We did not have lunch or dinner in the hotel, nor did we try the bar. The doorman on the Thursday was very friendly and recommended various places to see and things to do. And the doorman on Saturday actually ran down the street to catch up with us & let us know that the front desk had discovered they had charged the wrong credit card (I had changed from the card I used to make the booking, but they put the charge through on the original card & I did not notice). This was corrected with profuse apologies. Again, our flight was well after check-out time, but leaving our bags was no problem, so we were able to enjoy the rest of the afternoon. Even the maintenance guy that took our bags was friendly and chatty. There may be some staff at this hotel that are not welcoming, but we did not meet any, of the eight or nine that I can recall. We did a lot of online research before deciding on this hotel, and for the price I think this is one of the best choices. The location is unbeatable, the hotel has so much character compared to a chain hotel, and in New York you can easily pay double for the same size room elsewhere.

The water pressure was great and the shower head was terrific. The bed was made up with 4 large pillows (with another in the closet) on 1000 thread-count sheets. There was a safe in the closet (note: customers need to request the key from the front desk if they choose to use it) and plenty of hangers as well as shelves for shoes, bags etc. Breakfast was included in the cost of my stay and consisted of a good sized bowl of fresh fruit, a half of toasted bagel and a small muffin. There were jams and butter for the breads and I was also served a small glass of juice and tea or coffee.

The noise from the restaurant below (the kitchen staff were playing the radio loudly as they packed up for the night) made it even worse, as did the exhaust fans from the kitchen in the airshaft right outside our window, which had to be kept open (even in the cold of winter when we were there) cause the heating couldn\u2019t be shut off and we could have grown orchids in the heat. Reception staff had that fixed smile of people who\u2019d heard too many complaints and couldn\u2019t care less anyway. We were told we could upgrade for another $US25 (despite having prepaid $US100 a night above their declared walk-in rate). It\u2019s the only hotel I\u2019ve ever encountered where I had to wear earplugs to get to sleep! This place is worse than sleeping in the street. Come to think of it, the rats scurrying through the garbage in the street outside seemed a lot happier than the Washington Square\u2019s clientele.", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201csuper little haven\u201d", "Author": "U3", "ReviewID": "UR3329402", "Content": "delighted to have found this little haven in busy NYC! breakfast was indeed very convenient and you could chose to pay extra for a varied menu.

On arrival we were greeted with very pleasant staff who made us feel like real people not just a room number. However, they could only offer us a room with a shared bathroom but at the time no one else was in the other room and they said they would only let it out to a female. Later we were informed that a female had checked in. (I suspect she had been booked in all the time). Anyway the room was rather disappointing as it was cramped and pretty run down and shabby. Also it was only on the second floor so was noisy from the traffic down below. The bathroom itself had no heating and was freezing with a cold tiled floor, however, that was not the case with our room which was boiling with a noisy radiator! However, the bed and pillows were very nice and comfortable with soft cotton linen. And the location was great with plenty of places to eat and drink in and around the area. I paid \u00a3100 for this room which I think was definitely too much for the room but I guess it's about location location location. Also I booked it late so that could also be why. I think if we were staying there longer we would have asked for a better room but as it was only for one night it was OK and you also get a continental breakfast included which was very nice.", "Date": "March 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate, NY", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, very pleasant\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3236555", "Content": "Stayed at the Washington Square Hotel for one night last weekend with my teenage daughter. The staff of the hotel were exceptionally nice, the room was nicely decorated in a modern style, although it was a bit small. It was very clean. The breakfast, included in the price of the room, was nice and quick. You sit down, they fill your glasses with orange juice, they plunk down a fresh fruit salad in front of you, then plunk down a basket of toasted bagels and muffins. If you're in a hurry and don't want something fancier, it's fine. If you want eggs and bacon you may have to go elsewhere. Yes, the hotel architecture is interesting, at best. Yes, there's crazy hallways and staircases and deadends. But what can the hotel do about that, short of tearing down and rebuilding? It's an old, historic building. Get over it. At least the rooms and bathrooms are modernized. Unfortunately, the heating system is not. Our room was at least 120 degrees F. It was more comfortable after I completely turned off the radiators. The only other minus was that the pillows were terribly hard. Otherwise, it was a fun, if a bit funky, place to stay right in a very nice, fun area.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Washington Square Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93382-Reviews-Washington_Square_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$220 - $352*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">103 Waverly Place</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10011</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514717", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/61/28/6128af8bc536f0a8e1da3d2958bc8d853large.jpg"}}
