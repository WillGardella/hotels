The worst hotel i've stayed in my life, and i travel a lot in Portugal and Spain. The people are bad. The breakfeast paid in advance is more expensive then the ones outside the hotel.

The only thing going for this 'hotel' is the location. I booked it thinking it doesnt matter if its not posh, just clean and tidy, a bed for the night really - but it really was awful. Our room was on the 5th floor, there was a tiny ancient lift that went up to the 4th, then you had to walk up to the 5th. At this point I kind of knew how bad it was, carpets were threadbare, paint peeling off the walls, bannisters coming away etc. The room was cramped but looked tidy, beds made etc. There was a tiny portable tv but no remote control so that was useless. The bathroom was very dated, cracked tiles and when we showered the mixer tap came off in our hand and then we couldnt turn the water off. We had to tell reception, then go out leaving the tap running full on. There was tea/coffee in the room but I didnt even touch it, was so grubby. Breakfast next morning was so bad, we went to the cafe next door to get a decent hot drink. Breakfast was served in the tiny bar area in the cellar and it was help yourself, trays of mugs, every one of which had at least 3 chips. Breakfast consisted of toast, cheese & hard boiled eggs. I did have a dry slice of toast & 2 eggs (making the mistake of 'if I've paid for it, I'm having it) but I really regret that as later on that day I went down with what I think was food poisoning that then wiped out the next 2 days and really spoilt my trip. I cant be sure it was what I ate at the Ascot but I'd bet money on it.....

I stayed for a three day weekend with a friend, we arrived at about 1:00pm, to be told our room wasn't ready and we would have to wait until 2:00pm, so we checked in and payed our balance to the member of staff at the reception desk and went to get some lunch. We returned at about 1:45pm, the same lady who had taken our money was sitting at the reception desk, but didn't seem to recognise us or recall that we had been there less than an hour before, or that we had already payed the money we owed on our bill. We were then told our room was in a seperate building and were led by the cleaning staff to a building next door, we were then told that our room was \"Up, up, up.\" by the cleaning staff who promptly walked away. My friend and I then began the long trek up eight flights of stairs, which were precarious at best, to the top floor, with many obstacles such as, electric fuse boxes jutting out from the walls on staircase, my friend and I almost dislocating our shoulders on these on numerous occassions during our stay. The hallways weren't particularly clean or well maintained, the room numbers were no more than strips of ripped up paper with numbers written on them, taped to the doors. We arrived in our room, which had a double and a single bed in, both uncomfortable and well past their best, in order to move around the room we had to scramble over the beds as there was no room for movement. There was a kettle in the room and one teacup, despite there being two guests, and four drinking glasses, two of which looked like they hadn't been washed for at least a few months. I should say that towels were provided and the bathroom was clean, more than likely due to the fact there was no warm water. The shower was icy cold, and the water pressure was like having a small child pour a jug of water over your head slowly, even if we did have warm water to have a shower it would probably have taken most of the day. The heating in our room was also not working, and it was the middle of London, in November, with snow beginning to fall, and the blankets (one thin sheet and one thin blanket) on the beds left a lot to be desired; my friend and I did go to reception on the second day of our trip to inform the staff that the heating wasn't working and to ask if it was possible to get some extra blankets for the night, but we were only given the blunt, sarcastic and insincere reply of \"The heating's being fixed, they're coming to replace a fuse!\" As you may expect, the heating was never getting fixed, at least not in the last two days of mine and my friend's stay. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, including thew nice Australian couple who were stood outside as my friend and I were leaving to ask if it was worth checking in, we didn't hesitate to advise them to go to anywhere else, well within earshot of the reception desk. For three days, we had no heating, no warm water, no shower and we had to wear our clothes to bed, which we then had to wear throughout the day as well and the staff were just rude and unhelpful. The only positive aspect of this hotel is the location, it's right across the road from Paddington tube station, but I would have rather stayed further away if I could have had a warm night and a shower.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT BOOK HERE!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "taylorandrew20", "ReviewID": "UR87037726", "Content": "This place is an absolute joke and we knew on arrival we had made a big mistake.
