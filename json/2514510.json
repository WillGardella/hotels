The hotel advertises recent updates, yet I think this applies only to the new lobby doors (which, by the way, open opposite to what one expects; push to get in and pull to go out; I thought all egress doors had to open outward, not inward, but perhaps NYC has different regulations).

Very different from one of the morning-shift receptionists, the brunette one, who is extremelly unfriendly and impolite. The cleaning girls are also nice. The hotel is average. Bad points: internet access only at the lobby - which gets pretty crowded when many guests want to go online... - no breakfast (but it seems they're starting having it soon), the heating system is not very efficient, the stove in the kitchen on my floor was not working. Good points: Most os the staff is nice, the rooms are kind of small but comfortable (mattresses a little noisy...), cable tv, well located (near grocery stores, general stores, central park and subway station).

Very limited lodging options in this neck of the woods, but I fully recommend it to get a true local experience. No sign out front in this quiet (again, relative), residential street. As others have noted, a safe area, but don't be careless. Clean and basic, felt like a dormitory almost. Myself and two buddies got a standard triple room with one full and one single bed. Tight quarters for 3 grown men, but it wasn't awful. Reasonable closet space, dresser, fridge, small tv hanging from the ceiling. Fresh towels and soap daily, beds made up. Did not have a private bath, but rarely had to wait to use the one on our floor. Kitchen wasn't really stocked with anything, but if you were staying a while and got your own stuff, it would really help. We just got some snacks from the West Side Market, a quintessentially New York local grocer. Grab the house special at the Hungarian Coffee Shop around the corner to start your day off right. Bedding is basic, but adequate. I can't imagine how some of these bed divas would have survived in earlier eras. The three of us thought they were fine. No noise issues. Easy access to the 1 train, which can get you just about anywhere. Unless you have physical limitations or deep pockets, don't bother with cabs. The system is easy to learn, cheap, reliable, quick, and provides great people-watching. Internet was only available in the little sitting area next to the front desk, but free and clear. I emailed the property with some questions a few days before going and never got a response. They may have been offended that I used the term 'hostel.' My bad. I think there was one other negative, but I forget what it was. I work in a 5-star joint, so I had to seriously adjust my expectations, but what I found was a great value in a great spot in NYC. With the same budget, it's where I'd stay again. Tip: don't ignore the local sites. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is breathtaking, as is Riverside Church. Grant's Tomb, Harlem's main drag, the northern wilds of Central Park, and Columbia University are all walkable and worth the time.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for it's budget\u201d", "Author": "Erla B", "ReviewID": "UR121503307", "Content": "We stayed there for one week and we loved it, Patrick was the best !

It may not be in the middle of Times Square but is accessible to wherever you might want to go easily by the subway. The metro system is a couple of very short blocks from the hotel, and as you walk home there are three grocery stores in addition to a bakery. The grocery store on the corner was the one we used and had everything you would need down to a can opener. The hotel is in a very safe, quiet residential neighborhood. We never heard any noises inside or outside the hotel during any night of our stay. There were even signs that if you honk your horn you can be fined. Coming from the Sesame Street era, I felt Big Bird was going to step out at any moment as I looked down the street. In addition, we appreciated everyone who worked at the inn. They worked tirelessly to make our stay as pleasurable as possible. The cleaning staff was always busy, and the office staff was always available and very pleasant.. I might mention that Bobby was extra nice and Patrick, the manager, could not have been nicer or more helpful, in addition to his constant smiling face. It was as though we had always known him. He certainly is to be commended. If you want a safe place to stay that doesn't cost an arm and a leg so that you can afford to go to Broadway shows and do other expensive activities, The Morningside Inn is for you and your family. We don't spend much time in our room, and it was the least expensive place I could find for three people and we were able to save a bundle in an expensive city by having a small kitchen where I could cook. We plan to go back to NYC in the future and will definitely stay there along with recommending it to friends.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "preston", "Title": "\u201cA perfectly fine base\u201d", "Author": "angelcake375", "ReviewID": "UR69014892", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel twice, once in Dec 2004 for my 21st birthday and again in Dec 2006. I do consider myself to have high standards when it comes to hotels, restaurants etc but for somewhere like New York all you need is a base! You literally need somewhere to sleep and get ready in the mornings and this place caters for that perfectly. On my first stay me and my friend had a twin room with a shared bathroom, which, looking back I would probably not do again, however we had no issues getting in to use the bathroom and the room was adequate. Ok, so not all the furniture matches and there was a loud water pipe in the room but it didnt keep us awake, so going back to my original point-it was exactly what we needed. I dont see the point in wasting valuable spending money on accommadation in a place like new York! The second stay there were three of us and we stayed in the apartment suite on the ground floor at the end of the corridor. This consisted of a double bedroom, bathroom with bath and shower, living area with a bed settee and a kitchen area with fridge, freezer, sink and table. We also had a tv in the room and loved watching the American talk shows when were getting ready! Again, it wasnt exactly something out of the pages of an interior design magazine, however it was exactly what we needed. The location was great too, not too close to cramped midtown and not too far out that is was ever an issue to get about. The subway goes everywhere you need! Although the area is quite quiet, we never felt threatened at all. All in all both of my stays at the Morningside Inn were perfectly accectable for my needs. If you are wanting a base to explore new York and dont want to spend too much on a hotel but want somwhere clean and comfortable, the Morningside Inn will not disappoint you.

We ended up paying $100 for each room. They made us check out the next morning so they could put us in one room, but then again made us check out and check back in the 3rd day. All this was very inconvenient especially when we had plans to tour the city. The nightmare began when we came back at 4:30pm the 3rd day to check back in. There were no rooms available, except for 2 rooms that were recently fumigated for an infestation of ants. We asked to view the rooms and decided the first room smelt too strongly of chemicals, but the second was tolerable. At the same time a couple from Philly was also being offered one of these 2 rooms as their confirmed reservation simply \"didn't exist\" in the Inn's system. Unfortunately for them we took the better of the two bad rooms, which cost us about $83, whereas the other room was offered to us at $50. I mentioned this to the couple who asked the manager if they could get the worse room for $50. The manager Pat flipped out and asked me why I did that and threatened to give my $83 back and kick us out of the Inn. He also said that he was trying to do us a favor and I was basically ungrateful. From the other reviews and my personal experience it seems like this manager Pat is a BIG BULLY. His behavior and policies are UNACCEPTABLE. In the end, I had to apologize just because I had no place else to go for my last night in NYC. This experience single handedly ruined my trip to NY.

At first I thought it was a mistake, and when I pointed it out I was told the money would be refunded soon. However, after two weeks it still hadn\u2019t been refunded.

I have never experienced anything like it, and was forced to just walk away even though I was obviously charged too much, too soon. The second incident happened when I tried to have my boyfriend stay overnight as my guest. The morning after the manager again got very angry and nasty because I was apparently not allowed to have overnight guests.

Ever since these incidents the manager had a very angry attitude, gave me hateful looks and made the whole atmosphere pretty uncomfortable.

We stayed in morningside inn on oct 9th to the 12th. Arrving with an open mind and preparing for the worse, the \"notorious\" front office was noticibly plain but clean. The young girl working there was nonchalant, but quick to check me in. I paid cash to prevent any future discrepancies. (Although, be mindful that the young girl do not have access to the cashier after office hours, so pls bring exact change! ) So far so good. Now the room... I booked a double room with shared showers. The room is really plain but clean. A bed which was made up everyday, a fan with a hanging light, a window which worked. No aircon or heater, but it was autum now, so fresh air suited us fine. I was pleasantly surpised when i found out that there was a sink, a fridge and a phone in the room. The common shower is shared between 2 to 3 rooms each. Wasn't an issue. Most guests there usually have different agendas so no need to wait at all. The location and neighbourhood was quite good. Supermarkets are 3 to 5mins mins away. Eateries are nearby too. Both Absolut Bagels on 107th and Tom's Restaurant (112th), made famous by Seinfeld, are good for breakfast. Subway to downtown is only 5 mins away. One thing I noticed was the inexperienced front office. Other than the big man himself who is present only in the morning, the rest of the young staff seemed clueless about the hotel.

Poor hospitality staff. I booked one month in advance, on-line, for two nights. When I checked in they said only for one night. Twenty minutes later, they found me a room for two nights.

I was also required to pay the \"upgrade\" to the superior room. But it was Morningside's mistake. In conclusion, this is a clean place and reasonably cheap, but it's not a polished hotel in the tradition of hospitality. For instance, if a hotel makes a mistake regarding your reservation, they never make the customer pay the difference in price. But Morningside isn't run by professionals. It's run by one friendly man and his inexperienced staff. The renovation continues and the work is sloppy at best. My friend was staying in room 101 and they installed carpet on the second day of his week there!! Nobody is taking the right amount of care to finish the hotel before somebody stays there.

I had the room on the first floor at the front, right on the street. It's a huge room by NYC standards but a bit grungy. The window air conditioner had substantial gaps between the expander panels and the window frame so I asked immediately if something could be done about it. Turns out I had to ask twice a day for the first three days I was there. As a single traveler, this seemed a safety issue even though the staff somewhat dismissed my concerns that it wouldn't be possible for someone to get in thru the window because it was too far from the sidewalk. That may be, but I don't like taking chances or paying to do so. The bed was comfortable & looked new but the sheets weren't changed even once during my week's stay. I\"m not even sure if the cleaning staff made it in my room becuase there was a wrapper from a previous occupant that was never removed from the floor. (I left it there as a little test.) The last day I requested that the desk staff call a cab to take me to the airport. I had just enough money for the cab & some airport food but they instead called a car service that cost me quite a bit more. I had barely enough to cover the ride & ended up with almost no tip for the poor driver. I won't make that mistake again. So for a clean cheap room in NYC, it was OK but really nothing more. Oh and I'm really glad I had my earplugs with me -- the springs on the doors are really tight & the other guests always seemed to let the doors slam as loudly as possible at all hours of the night.

I stayed at Morningside Inn for about a week during October. The hotel did provide most of what it promised -- helpful staff who would call taxis for you and help you with directions for getting around the city, in particular -- a fridge and microwave in the room (without any utensils to back that up, though) and a laundromat nearby. I was disappointed mostly by the very uncomfortable bed, the poor quality sheets, the thin, tired pillow, and the single white towel (that was not replaced all week). To be fair, housemaids did find me another pillow and an extra cotton blanket with much ado following my request, but I ended up buying a blow-up pillow from the MoMA to supplement what was being offered. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was that I was in the US, the capital of worldwide television and advertising production, and there wasn't a TV in my room (or a joint TV room anywhere in the building) that I could switch on to get the news or some music. These are MUST have requirements when travelling alone. I went to the Radio Shack in the end and bought a portable, battery-operated radio to relieve the silence and compensate for the view of the brick wall outside (which I DID expect to find in NYC!). The internet was out of order for most of the week I was there. By the way, it was an antique anyway -- one of those coin-operated machines that you stand up and operate -- I hadn't seen such a machine anywhere in Australia for at least 10 years (yet the staff seemed to have all the latest equipment on their desk, including pay TV access). Upon checking out of the hotel, I suggested they may like to consider upgrading some of the technology, and at least providing it for single guests, rather than just stating it was available on their website. Sure, there are a couple of internet cafes nearby, but they would be better off promoting that Starbucks has wi-fi access worldwide so bring your own notebook! In the end, I bought a small notebook at a computer store, carried it round the world, and used wi-fi free at almost every destination (with the power adapters to suit each country that the computer salesman threw in).

I had a private bath, so the only thing I can't rate is the shared bathroom. The location is good for access to Harlem and Central Park ... and you can get a subway to anywhere else. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThey still your money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5226363", "Content": "The worst coustumer service ever.

Patrick- front desk was the greatest with hotel assistance and suggestions for sight seeing and other places. Morningside Inn is a great for those travelers who just need it for one purpose \"sleep\".... especially with the hustling and bustling of shopping and sightseeing within a 24-48 hr duration. The location was perfect for taxi drives downtown and close walk to the central park. We drove from DC and found a parking spot on 107th a few feet away from the Morningside and use subways, taxi and good ole \"pat & turn\" walking.

I actually stayed at Morningside Inn for a total of six months while I was attending school in NYC. I must say that at first I had my reservations about the place, but soon considered it home. Patrick (hotel manager) was amazing! He's super friendly and helpful when needed. I found the staff to also share the same friendliness. The only thing that was a little upsetting the whole time I was there was the fact that the phones were out of commission a lot. It became a little frustrating. But all in all, I felt completely safe there, no major problems with other attendents, great location and would recommend this place to anyone that wants to save money to spend on in that amazing city!", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Morningside Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d249710-Reviews-Morningside_Inn-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$85 - $1,136", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">235 West 107th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10025</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514510", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2b/e2/2be25f98c1810fc603b8e4423d3c2b751large.jpg"}}
