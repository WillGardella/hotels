As a big city with many hotel options, my choice to stay at this hotel was a suitable one considering travel time and budget especially since I went for New Years. I stayed in a single room. For some it would be considered very small but in my head since I\u2019ve cruised many times, the size is comparable to a room on a cruise ship. The room was adorable and very comfortable for just me. My room was toward the back so street noise was not an issue. Sometimes I would hear the early risers (hard core tourists) in the morning but that\u2019s my fault for snoozing in late in the morning. The bathroom was a good size but the shower was tiny. The staff were extremely friendly. They greeted me all the time and provided great restaurant recommendations as well as helped with overall directions and city suggestions. Location couldn\u2019t be more ideal as least in the mindset of getting around the city \u2013 literally in the center of Montparnasse. The building was two blocks away \u2013 just look up. We all wish to be staying on the Champs Elysses (too expensive to do so) but with easy Metro access literally one block away was great. The Raspail metro has 4 & 6 lines which took me directly to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, and more. After a while, I didn\u2019t need my map cause it was easy to navigate throughout the city. (tip: purchase a booklet of 10 carnets and keep in pocket \u2013 makes it easy to go in and out without always being in line to buy a ticket.) Walk 10 minutes and you\u2019ll have access to Rer B which took me directly from airport and to Gare Nord train station (for Amsterdam). If you walk up on Raspail Blvd towards the direction of the Siene, you\u2019ll find many restaurants, St. Germaine area and a visit to the Le Grande Epicurean at Bon Marche is a must. Walk the other direction and you\u2019ll find the entrance to the underground catacombs, Paul (bakery yum) and other good places to eat near the Defense.

I stayed with my other half last weekend, a total of two nights. We got a superior (larger!) room after reading other reviews on here; it was on the 2nd floor and contrary to some of the other reviews on here we didn't bother with the lift, the stairs were really not a problem even with luggage. The room was, of course, not huge. Paris is mostly old buildings and you won't get masses of space anywhere unless you're paying hundreds of euros per night. Its best to just plan to have no space in your room, pack lightly if you can or ask the hotel to stash some of your luggage downstairs to keep it out of your way. As per some of the other reviews, my 6ft 4 200 lb boyf found the shower small. I found this tres amusing. We had the breakfast both days, out of pure laziness and not wanting to rush around. Its 9 euros per person and bearing in mind you're pretty much going to pay 5 euros for a coffee anywhere in Paris its about the right price. You could pay more, you could pay less. It was worth it, totally French and very nice indeed. The best two things about Le Hotel de la Paix for me were the quietness and the location. There was no noise at all, I had no trouble sleeping. This is a good thing for Paris, it can be very noisy. The location was on 2 metro lines so you could hop on outside and get anywhere very easily. I wanted to do two things - the Grand Epicery de Bon Marche (French Whole Foods, woo!) and the Eiffel Tower. The Grand Epicery was a 15 min walk and the Eiffel Tower was 4 metro stops with no changes. You can easily walk up, through the Jardin de Luxembourg, to St Germain de Pres and all the nice places to eat and shop in that area. Around there are also some bars which show sport (this was important to my boyfriend; look for Rue Princesse near metro stop Mabillion and try Eden Park or the Frog and Princess). Both sides of the Bvd St Germain have shops, cafes, restaurants on cute little streets. This is what Paris should look like!! Additionally the RER B train from the airport stopped at Port Royale which was a 10 min walk from the hotel, and the train journey took about 45 mins. Its much easier than driving or being driven. I can't fault the hotel, it was clean, quiet, petite in a nice way and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.

Montparnasse is a very convinient walk so is the Rapsail metro station i. the bus-stop is very close by and I would highly reccomend the bus for the first time visitor to paris as it allows you to absorb the sights and sounds of the fabulos city j. the hotel would happily let you use their cloak room, infact we use to leave the pram of our child at the recption since the room was so small that the pram would just not fit the room even if braved it thru the elevator k. a couple of good pastry shops and foods store in close proximity l. room cleanliness on a daily basis was nothing great.

Free WIFI- just ask them for the password- you need a password for EACH device you are connecting with though-just tell them how many you need.

The article sounding promising and the other reviews on here were great so we booked it and it did not disappoint. Yes, the rooms and elevator is small but you are in Paris and should not be spending any significant amount of time in your room! The staff members that we encountered were all extremely helpful and multi-lingual. I speak very little French so their knowledge of English made it so much easier to communicate in regards to nearby banks and info about the sights of Paris. The rooms were great \u2013 they were very clean and had just about everything that you could need (a/c, extra pillows & blankets, a desk & chair, a safe, hair dryer, etc.). We stayed in room 15 & 53. They both had two twin beds but we liked 53 the best. It seemed a bit bigger and was on the very top floor so the views out the window of the streets of Paris were great. The location is great - really central to everything. Some things are in very close walking distance (Jardin de Luxembourg & the Catacombs) but the other big sights are easily accessible via short metro rides. It is a few blocks from Montparnasse Blvd which is full of cafes, shops & restaurants. The Raspail metro stop is literally steps from the hotel and 2 lines connect there \u2013 one that takes you to the Eiffel Tower area and the other to the Louvre/Notre Dame area. The Port Royal RER stop is less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel \u2013 we took this line directly from the CDG Airport and it was by far the cheapest option to get there - 18 euro for two people. Also less than a 10 minute walk is the Gare Montparnasse train station \u2013 from there you can take the TGV to practically anywhere in Europe. I cannot comment on the breakfast as we chose not to eat at the hotel but instead spent far less than 9 euros at the extremely close by patisseries. Also if you go left out of the hotel down Raspail Blvd. and then left on Rue de Campange there is a small grocery about half way down Rue de Campagne that has a little bit of everything to make a meal (we highly suggest getting some cheese, bread & wine and heading to a park/garden with it!)

Upon arrival in Raspail metro station (the closest metro station to the hotel), we were greeted by stairs from the platform to the street level (which seems to be the case for 95% of all metro stations in Paris after going to several metro stations in Paris). Panting, before entering the hotel front door, there was a another ledge which requires us to lift our heavy baggage (and an already sweating me) from the sidewalk to the hotel. Not happy. Can they at least build a \"wheel friendly\" entrance in front of their lobby door? Anyway, the young receptionist who checked us in was very friendly and more than happy to point out tourist attractions that we should not miss apart from the obvious ones. The receptionist at night, booked us for a place at Moulin Rouge as well which is a very nice gesture although we could've booked it ourselves. Wifi is free as well, but they have to give you a username and password for each device to login to the wifi. However, if you're using a Blackberry, you might not be able to login because my wife's Blackberry seems to unable to resolve the login page and therefore, unable to enter the username and password. I'm using an iPhone 4 and I could login fine to the wifi. Moving on, the elevator is the smallest I have seen in my entire life. Probably 1 meter X 1 metre. The sign says that it can fit 3 people, but I very much doubt that. Because of our luggage, only one of us can get in to the elevator and the other had to walk up the stairs. Upon arrival at our floor, you're greeted with (surprise!) another set of stairs. Apparently, the elevator is meant to stop midway between floors (which explains why the buttons have 1/2, 2/3, 3/4 on it instead of just 1, 2, 3, 4). Therefore, had to carry our baggage down the stairs again by an already sweating and tired me. The room was very small, but not too small with all working facilities (i.e TV, safe). A bit tricky on how to use the outside shades but ask the receptionist if you can't figure out how to operate this (it took me 10 minutes to figure it out). Bed was comfy, toilet was clean but very small (especially the shower) but I have no problem with this because of my not so big build. Moreover, for me, cleanliness trumps size every time in regards to hotel bathrooms. Breakfast is available for 9 euros per person although at the end, we didn't take this option.

Loads of places to eat and drink. and only 25mins walk to Seine through the Luxemburgh gardens or the very nice area of St Germaine. The hotel is lovely, it was much nicer than we expected for the price and compared to other 2*hotels in paris. The room was clean and nicely decorated .It was small but we knew this would be the case. We had a standard room facing the back, which was lovely and quiet. There are superior rooms which may be bigger. There is a small lift too. The breakfast was 9 euros and consisted of a pot of coffee/tea, fruit juice,croissant, baguette and pain au chocolat with butter/jams. We thought it to be good value compared to what cafes were charging. Great find and would most definitely return and recommend to others.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bozman", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, comfortable room within walking distance of city center\u201d", "Author": "Glitch58", "ReviewID": "UR61705961", "Content": "I stayed four nights in early April at the Hotel de la Paix, Montparnasse, on Raspail Blvd. I arrived several hours early, but was immediately checked-in. The desk people were attentive and helpful, spoke English and humored my minimal attempts at French nicely. The room itself was a small, immaculately clean room with a double bed and shower on the third floor facing Raspail Blvd. Though facing the street, it was very sound-proofed and the bits of traffic below were completely inaudible with the windows closed. An internet access code was provided, and an LCD television with European cable (mostly in French, with BBC Entertainment and CNN World as the only English stations). A Metro stop was within a dozen yards of the hotel entrance. Tour Montparnasse was a ten minute walk from the hotel. Overall, I found the hotel to be a good place. Everything worked well and the proximity to the more touristy areas was easily walkable ( note-- I am a person who enjoys walking) with the Louvre about a 20 minute hike and the Tour Eiffel about 30 -40 minutes away. There were a couple of small brasseries within two minutes of the hotel entrance, and many more up Raspail Blvd toward Montparnasse Blvd. This was a good place to stay. It does not have the frills and ambience of a more expensive hotel, but it is very comfortable in every way, and the staff was amicable, and helpful, knowing my name and room number whenever I came in, whether or not we had met before. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this as a reasonable, yet inexpensive city hotel.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery small room, but clean and quiet...\u201d", "Author": "SneakyTravelKitty", "ReviewID": "UR45696219", "Content": "Looking for a hotel in Paris while on a budget is a nightmare, so Hotel De La Paix M was a good 3-night stay considering its price, location and value. The hotel is located in Montparnasse area, 2 minute walk from Raspail Metro station (Metro line 4). Check in time for hotel is 1-2pm, we were given a room on 6th floor the moment we arrived. I understand that Paris does not have that much living space, but this room was Very Small! It was not more than 8-9 square meters - including the bathroom space. We were too tired to go complain at the front desk, plus based on the building format (tall and narrow) it did not look like the hotel had any larger rooms. We had to move some furniture in the room to make space for our suitcases. Valuewise, the hotel is clean and charming, staff is very friendly, everything worked properly (although we did not find the phone in our room). If you are claustrophobic, do not use the tiny elevator the hotel offers. Showering was a struggle as the shower was just too small. I was ok, but my boyfriend is wide shouldered and muscular - I cannot even imagine how he fit in there. The double bed was a bit rough, pillows were tiny. Our room was facing the street, so it could get quite loud sometimes. We recommend closing the window as night, - morning traffic will disrupt your sleep. The hotel offers a 9Euro/person breakfast, which consists of coffee, juice, 2 fresh croissants, few baguettes, butter and jam. You would find the same deal outside, so it is reasonable for Paris. The hotel does have a pretty good location. It will take you 20 minutes to get to Latin Quarter, 30 min to Notre Dame, 40 min to Louvre. Or use Paris's incredible Metro system, using which you can get anywhere in the city.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cExcellent accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Schug", "ReviewID": "UR14805736", "Content": "Just back from a 3 night stay at this 2 star hotel.
