It was a bit difficult to find, but so are many places off the beaten path. I was walking and did find it by myself on 3 different occasions so - not too bad. The room wasn't ready when I arrived early, so the staff was quite accomodating, holding my luggage, helping me connect to the Internet. Then, quite literally, the concierge walked me several blocks away to the perfect spot for lunch (La Solana). When I returned, I was able to check in and was positively delighted with the business class room. It was GORGEOUS. It's an old hotel, so some of the paint in the bathroom was a bit cracked and the toilet had a bit of trouble - it continued to run after a flush unless you jiggled.

The staff is very friendly, the experience was enjoyable from check-in till check-out. Rooms are really very, very small, that's a big shortfall - I had to upgrade with additionnal EUR 65 per night to get 45 sqm, the first room I was assigned (Deluxe) was really ridiculously small, but bed and linen are excellent. Bathroom not completely clean, bit of moisture here and there, would need an overhaul, but clean otherwise, besides of that. No fitness, no nothing besides of the room, but a very cozzy and warm lobby, really nice. At breakfast, pastries were cold and not really good, something to be improved, and not much choice in the menu. On the other hand, room service was very good, and generous. In short: the hotel is worth for the quality of the staff, very helpful and friendly, but rooms are very small, and quality of food should be improved. I would stay there again since our parisian office is just a few hundreds meters from the hotel, but for the price, I would suggest to look for another place offering larger rooms.

The hotel is one of several in a residential area but still within 5-10 minutes walk of the Trocadero and a bit longer in the other direction to the Champs Elysees so sight seeing on foot is not a problem but there is a metro station and a red bus tour stop at the Trocadero as well. (The red bus tour is 26 euros per person for two days unlimited hop on hop off travel so we used this to get across town which was a big time saver and reasonable value) Check in was friendly and fast and our request for a quiet room was acknowledged and we were offered a room on the fourth floor which we appreciated and a porter will help with luggage which is good because the lift will only just accomodate 2 people and one suitcase. The room itself was so incredibly tiny even compared to others we have stayed in in Paris. The photo i have uploaded was taken with my back right up against the door and as you will see there is no space at all. If you intend to stay for more than a few days might be worth asking if they can store your suitcases somewhere for you. Now our very minor niggles. While we were unpacking we found someone elses sock under the chair so that didnt inspire confidence. Then in the bathroom the fittings were very tired with a couple of cracked tiles and a stained toilet seat which are unforgivable at this calibre of hotel and cant be explained away by \"character\" or \"chic\". The rest of the room was more than fine though with bright and clean linens, carpets and curtains etc. The bed was comfy and clean and the most important thing for me in any hotel - we had a fantastic nights sleep both nights with no outside noise and very little from other guests after about midnight. We had room service the first night which was adequate but expensive so we walked to the cafe malakoff which is on the Trocadero and had breakfast there everyday. Much cheaper, excellent quality food and a good mix of locals(always a good sign) and tourists so a good ambience. The first day we came back in the afternoon for a nap and found that the room had not been touched but got disturbed at about 5pm by the maid service. OK, they were probably busy but then on Sunday morning we were having a lie in and she tried again at 9.00am. Having said that she (as were all the staff) was incredibly friendly and helpful and smiling. Thats all the niggles out of the way, all the rest was positive. We asked if they had a plug adapter as we had forgotten ours and were told it would be sent up to our room while we were out and we could keep it till we checked out. We came back and there it was. We asked if we could leave our luggage with them on our last day as we had a late flight and this wasnt a problem and they arranged a taxi for us at the same time. They were very helpful in suggesting itineraries and places to go and couldnt have been more helpful. If you want to experience a bit of olde world Paris in quiet surroundings with the nicest and most friendly of staff (especially Louise and Thomas on the front desk and Franco the porter) then this is the place for you. If you want modern surroundings in the middle of a lively area it isn't. We will be here again next year. thank you.

Since it was our anniversary the hotel kindly upgraded our room into a larger Deluxe room which was fine. Since we saw two rooms, I can say that the rooms are very nicely decorated with typically Parisian wall papers and decor all round. They are not particularly big, but who needs a big room as long as you have a king sized bed with lovely soft linen?! Perhaps the greatest thing this wonderful little hotel offered was the room service breakfast hot chocolate. Yes the fresh croissants were nice with French jams to accompany, but the hot chocolate was absolutely divine. Large cups of molten, creamy chocolate. I have never ever had anything like it! Since the hotel is located in Trocadero, the streets are nice and quiet at night, and safe too which was comforting, and it took two minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower, or a 10 minute taxi into central Paris (Louvre) which cost about 15 euros. Somethign fantastic about the hotel which they do not advetise is that there are three Paris street bike stands within 100 metres of the hotel. For English people, these are 'Boris bikes', for everyone else these are bikes which you can hire for 5 euros a day and cycle anywhere and then return in any stand around the city. Since we had wonderful weather, we wraped up warm and went down the hill from the Trocadero, along the river banks of the Seine to the Louvre and then into the quaint Jewish quarter further east. It was magical and the cost was minimal. There is an Apple App you can download (for free when using the hotel's free wi-fi) called Velo-Libre (French for 'Free Bike) which shows you how many bikes are around, or free docking stations there are at each location etc... Downstairs in the hotel is a small, but elegant Champagne bar. They serve a decent variety by the glass, and it is refreshing to see a hotel bar that was busy in the evening time. I spoke to a local couple who said it was the oldest Champagne Bar in Paris, which was backed up by the Receptionist upon check-out. The hotel lift isn't adorned, but actually made out of Louis Vuitton trunks! No really. It is without doubt the coolest lift ever.. especially if you have a girlfriend who enjoys glamourous photos! This is not a 5* hotel, but it is a very good 4* hotel that knows exactly what it is, and does it better than anyone else in my opinion. If you fancy going to Paris for a romantic break where you will either be under the duvet, or out seeing the main attractions this is the place for sure.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Adafa", "ReviewID": "UR123505305", "Content": "I have now stayed twice at this hotel and on both occasions I have been impressed with the warmth of the welcome and the charm of the rooms.

Once again my wonderful agent Jackie from Absolute Travel, Hillside NJ, recommended and booked this trip for me with passes to the museums etc. in hand. I did not have to worry about any of those things when I arrived in Paris. What an amazing vacation. She knocked it outta the park as usual with this trip. I am already researching another trip for her to book for me. This hotel is surely a 4 star! I was highly impressed by the level of service, cleanliness and professionalism at The Radisson Blu Le Dokhan. If you want a true old school Parisian experience when you visit Paris, then you stay here! If you want American standards with American service then stay elsewhere. This hotel is definitely where I will be staying on my return visit to Paris. I felt as if I had the entire hotel to myself. It was the perfect accommodations for a great price. Transportation from airport to hotel: We used Air City service to go back and forth from Charles De Gaulle Airport (30-40minute ride). Be aware that the Parisian driving is something out of an action movie. Make sure to keep your seat belts tightly fasten and enjoy the crazy ride. Air City will send a fax to your hotel 24 hours prior to your departure from the hotel informing you of the time they will be at your hotel for your pick up and return to the airport. The front desk staff at Radisson Blu Le Dokhan is very much on top of this, but it would be the \u201cresponsible\u201d thing for you yourself to stop at the front desk and inquire about your transportation to the airport. The front desk staff will also print your boarding passes (if applicable) for you and place in your room at your request. Main Lobby/Check in Area: Once you arrive to the Radisson Blu Le Dokhan and walk into the hotel the first time, your initial reaction is \u201chmm, small but quaint\u201d. You will not be too far off on this reaction; the foyer area is clean, neat, open enough where you are not cramped and has seating. Also, they have a strong perfume scent once you walk into the foyer area. As you walk through the foyer you will immediately see a small check-in desk to your right, seats 2 front desk clerks. To your left is a very elegant, comfy seating area that just sings Parisian atmosphere. This was one of my favorite places to be in the hotel and I just feel in love with the small fireplace there. (Great place for tea or coffee and a little snack). 2 gentlemen that you will most likely encounter from the minute you arrive will be Franco or Kerrin(sp?). These guys know there stuff. (Franco struck me as very knowledgeable and extremely professional. Franco is a most \u201cseasoned\u201d employee). At your time of check in they will try to give you as much information as possible with the most helpful map (this map I kept with me at all times) all highlighted for you. Do not be overwhelmed (it can seem that way) but they are just trying to ensure you get the most of a \u201cgood thing\u201d immediately. Your room will most likely not be ready before 2pm so they will take your bags and store them for you. We had arrived around 11:30am there so Franco recommended us to walk (7 minute walk) to Caf\u00e9 Trocadero. We ended up frequenting this caf\u00e9 during our stay. It helped that our main view was the Eiffel Tower! See more on this caf\u00e9 in my food section. Oh by the way, yes, almost everyone speaks perfect English at the front desk! Rooms: We returned from breakfast/lunch at Caf\u00e9 Trocadero and were told our luggage was already placed in our room. I thought this was a nice touch because we did not have to take it ourselves. We got onto the tiny Louis Vuitton lift which will fit 3 people very tightly. If you are on the heavier side, then it \u201cmight\u201d fit 2. So not having to take our own luggage was nice. 506 was our room and I just loved the 100% Parisian feel to it. This room was considered an upgrade deluxe. You walk into a tiny area, to your right was the shower and vanity with lovely amenities, and to your left was a tiny room with the toilet (all marble this was a sharp, clean look to me). As you walked into the room, there was another door (this was nice because when one person is in the shower you can close that area out as you stay in the bedroom). The bedroom area was a typical European room. Small (considering this was a Deluxe) but very nicely decorated, flat screen TV (only 2 English channels and they were news), nice work desk (I kept my laptop (wifi included) and phone etc. on this desk.) and 2 chairs with a small coffee table. And my favorite thing in our room was the amazingly huge French glass doors that opened out to a very nice balcony. Beautiful drapes were hung at this magnificent door. This just screamed \u201cParis\u201d to me. The bed at the Radisson Blu Le Dokhan had to be the most comfortable bed and pillows I have ever slept on in all my travels. It was extremely hard to get out of bed every morning. This was a dangerous thing; it was like lying in heaven. I would go on and on about this bed but I hope you got the idea. So, good luck getting out of it. We had 3 pieces of luggage, so we emptied one and stored some sweaters in the closet and hung a few other pieces of clothing. One luggage was on the stand(comes with every hotel room) in the corner by the doors leading to the balcony and the 3 luggage fit snug on the opposite side of the bed in front of the large mirror on the floor. I hope this will help you understand how to situate your items for your trip. The Radisson provides 2 very nice robes with slippers for convenience, one in the shower and the second in the bedroom closet. On our first night with Radisson, we also received a \u201cwelcome\u201d gift of cookies and sweet treats. A very simple touch that makes guest feel special. Turn down service is nice and they leave you little sweets in your room. Laundry: I am a traveler who hates to fly with dirty clothes so when we arrived at the Radisson and I noticed directly across the street (small streets so about 10 steps away) was a laundry facility, I was thrilled. The day before we had to leave we took all our laundry and (now do not laugh) Kerrin from the front desk. (Poor guy, super sweet to walk over to help us). He helped us to understand how much money was needed and how the soap etc. worked. It was very easy once Kerrin showed us what each item meant in English. I highly recommend taking advantage of this convenience. Champagne Bar: If you are reading this review then it means you are semi familiar with the Radisson Blu Le Dokhan and have heard of their famous Champagne Bar. This room is just past the reception desk on your right. This is a small, elegant very old school/rustic Parisian influenced room. We were at the Champagne Bar every night and even booked the Champagne and Caviar tasting one night. There were two gentlemen working there but the one we had the pleasure of meeting every night and interacting with was Anthony Gomes. This young man has a bright future ahead of him the in the Culinary and Champagne world. I do not know much about champagnes but after listening to Anthony, you cannot help but leave there feeling properly educated. The one regret I have is that I did not approach him sooner about taking us on a day trip to a champagne region of his choice. But now I know for my next trip to Paris and Radisson Blu to talk to Anthony about this. I noticed a few clients came into the champagne bar and in my opinion was a bit rude when he would explain to them about the champagne they were about to have. People, this is not a pub, this is an elegant well rounded Champagne Bar where you come for a great experience and a lesson in what you are consuming. It is not just a place for a drink. You can go to a local pub for that. Certain nights they will have live entertainment there so be sure to ask for a schedule. Food: We ate at Caf\u00e9 Trocadero-tip on caf\u00e9\u2019s like this one. There are 2 types of seating. The one on the inside is a different menu than the tables you see around the caf\u00e9 on the outside. We learned this the hard way. It does not matter that it is the same Caf\u00e9, they will not serve you from the other menu on the table outside. Our first time there we wanted something along the line of breakfast. We went inside to sit and they give us a lunch menu, I looked at the person sitting one table away from me having coffe and eggs with a baguette. When I asked for that menu I was told \u201cNo, this is lunch\u201d. Hope you get the point. In the winter time, it really is not too bad to sit outside some of these caf\u00e9\u2019s because they have the best heat lamps. Keeps you nice and warm. Plus when you sit outside, you can people watch as well as watch the crazy driving in front of you. Caf\u00e9 Trocadero and Caf\u00e9 Kessler were perfect for this. The Eiffel Tower was the main site in front of these 2 caf\u00e9\u2019s so how could you not hand out there?! Louise at our hotel front desk also recommend a restaurant (10 minute walk) on Victor Hugo called Brassiere Le Stella, this place had great food, great seafood towers yummy escargot etc. We ate there twice. At the end of the day we would always stop at a local street stand/vendor and get a nutella crepe and during the day hot dogs (very yummy). You cannot beat the local street vendor cuisine for a true local Parisian experience. Room service at the hotel was not a bad thing either. Breakfast and Dinner was very nice. Not as good as the restaurants on the outside, but not bad either. Location of hotel: Radisson Blu Le Dokhan is \u201cPERFECTLY\u201d located in the 16th arrondissement! This hotel is surrounded by restaurants and caf\u00e9\u2019s. But it is the ultimate location for walking to the Eiffel Tower (7-11 minute walk) and to Arc De Triumph/Champ Elysse (10-12 minutes). At the time we were there the Christmas markets were just opening up. The ones at the end of the Champ Elysee were wonderful. The ones buy the Eiffel Tower and the St. Germain area was opening the day we left (12/8/11). So that is a tip for you if you plan on doing a Christmas trip to Paris. The second week of December seems to be the best time to see it all. Staff: The staff members that stood out to us were Louise, Kerrin, Franco and of course Anthony Gomes. There was one other gentleman at the front desk that worked the early shift with Franco and I am sorry to say I forgot his name. These staff members were like friends to us and not just hotel employees. Louise was a great conversional person. We loved speaking with her. Franco was like your protector and overseer, he was fabulous. Kerrin, well this kid helped us with our laundry across the street, I mean it does not get any better. Anthony, my Champagne sommelier, we loved chatting with him and learning from him. You can see he has a shy side but once you get to chatting with him, it is like an old friend. The housekeeping staff was just so polite and very sweet. Tips: The shower at this hotel has a \u201cdial\u201d looking device between the water nozzles. This is the temperature control for the water. So try not to scold yourself with the hot. We did that in the beginning, which is how we learned what that dial was for. The slightest turn on that dial drastically changes the temperature. There is a small grocery store 1minute walk from the hotel on the same street (they are actually everywhere) where I recommend you go get some bottle water, sodas, wine etc for your room. This will help with your expense. I do have a few tips on the Eiffel Tower and best way to get up and not have to wait in line as well as Taxis. But it is way too much to type on here.

The hotel is fantastically positioned - 10 minutes to the champs elysee and arc de triomphe, and about the same to the eiffel tower. Trocadero metro is a 5 minute walk too. In the area there are plenty of bars/restaurants, as well as mini markets if required. All in all, I thought the location perfect for us.

The lobby is quite nice, and the lift to the rooms whilst small, (and I mean really small!) is really funky, decorated in luis vuiton. We loved it - some people moan about it but it's a fun twist. Rooms are tastefully done; ours was room 208 with materialed-walls. Beds were very comfy. pillows deightful and I think most rooms have doors opening to a false balcony which was nice. Now to the the staff. I know full well that this aspect revolves around having the right character(s) working for you; all of the staff we encountered had the very best attitude and made us feel welcome, valued yet not in a sickly way.

He has a fantastic knowledge of the area, and is a great \"fixer\" - if you have any questions or things you need to book or work out, dont be shy, ask Jean Pierre - he will help you make the most of your trip.

After reading a number of mediocre reviews about the standard of rooms in Paris we were worried about what we would find, and we were very pleasantly suprised. We received a warm welcome from the staff, who were very pleasant and forgiving at our feeble attempts at speaking French. They of course, spoke excellent English. We were pleased to find that they had upgraded us to a deluxe room. The room was lovely, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was very small, but well presented and also spotlessly clean. We were very pleased. The hotel is in a quiet location, (ensuring a peaceful nights sleep) but well situated for the Eiffel Tower, Arc De Triomphe and Champs Elysees - all of which you could walk to in about 20 minutes. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Trocadero) so we found this hotel to be in an excellent location for accessing all the sights of Paris without being in the thick of things. The breakfast room is quite small and formal, and it is not very clear as to what kind of breakfast is served. We were given a basket of pastries and coffee etc when we went down, and we (stupidly) assumed that it was just a continental breakfast, but as we left we saw other people with omlettes - so dont make the same mistake as we did. We would definately stay in this hotel again. I can imagine that visitors from the US or Canada might be disappointed by the size of the rooms, but unfortunately rooms at their side of the Pond are much more generous then they are in European cites, and so this should be expected, but all in all we had a lovely stay in a lovely hotel and would like to thank the staff. I would recommend to other Paris 'first timers' to make use of a weekend Metro ticket (20 Euros each for a 3 day ticket) The Metro system in Paris is excellent and saves you no end of walking. I would also recommend booking your tickets to go up the Eiffel Tower in advance on the internet of you can - the queues are absolutely crazy. If you are unable to do this (as we were) get to the tower for about 08:30 to joint the queue. It doesn't open until 9am, but it's worth getting there early to avoid waiting in a ridiculous line.

We stayed a few days in the Summer of 2010 and highly recommend it. Here are a few notes and tips: - It is a very cozy and traditional-style boutique hotel. Very pretty, pleasant and quiet. - Its right near the Eiffel tower and the Trocadero metro station. 5 minute walk. - Plenty of cafes and restaurants around. For more authentic options, head in the opposite direction of the Eiffel Tower. For example, up to Victor Hugo square. Its not as touristy. - The hotel staff are wonderful here. Forget all the stereotypes about rude Frenchmen. The staff here are extremely helpful and speak English very well. They are what made our stay so enjoyable. They will call and arrange dinner reservations, taxis, river cruises or whatever you like. Its like having a French travel agent at your disposal! Don\u2019t hesitate to ask them for advice. - Try the Stella restaurant nearby. Its at the intersection of Victor Hugo and Rue St-Didier. Another nice non-touristy area for cafes and restaurants. - Our room was well appointed and high quality. Yes, it was kind of small. But this Paris. Not Vegas. Big hotels rooms don\u2019t exist here \u2026 unless you want to spend US$400 per night. - The breakfast is expensive here (like all hotels). Go outside and grab a pancake or a croissant at one of the cafes nearby. Its cheaper and more fun. - It is, perhaps, a bit expensive. But I think that if you go much cheaper in Paris, then the quality of the accomodations go WAY down (e.g. unfriendly staff, no air conditioning, etc).

The hotel is a small boutique hotel, which is to be expected in the 16th arrondisement of Paris and is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the hotel sits in one of the quietest and nicest neighborhoods of Paris. However, what is included (which is nearly nothing) at the hotel versus what you pay is a large difference. The beds were extremely comfortable, but the entire hotel had a very stuffy \"old wealth\" feel to it. The internet was complimentary which was very nice, but it cost 30 euros to watch tv. My husband and I were on our honeymoon (in Paris) so we didn't care very much about watching TV, but thought it was odd that a place would charge for it. Breakfast also cost over 25 euro per person, when you could literally step right outside of the building and have breakfast at a Parisian cafe for half the price, if even that. Overall we couldn't really complain about our stay, as I stated before that we got a great deal on our room rate. If we had paid 500 euros for it, I guarantee we wouldn't have been as adaptable. Our carpet was old and there were stains on our curtains, but again, we were accomodating. The air conditioning of the hotel was also broken, which was not very pleasant during Paris's heat streak the week we were there.

He was an excellent waiter and was willing to talk to is about Paris and France in general. The conceierges were also extremely helpful. After discovering a particular champagne that I liked, the concierge went so far as to contact local wine shops to see where I could locate it. I did not ask for this kindness, but rather he did it of his own volition and he presented me with an address, phone, and directions to the store. Another concierge said to me, verbatim : \"I am here for you. Here is my phone number; call me any time day or night and I will help you.\" as he handed me a card with his mobile number. This kind of service made a huge difference to us because we felt like we had people who were genuinely interested that we enjoyed our stay.

On arrival at around 3pm Friday afternoon, my request for a quiet room on a high floor had been met and we were directed to a charming room on the 5th floor with a small balcony. As my family is French I started by speaking French, but the hotel staff insisted on speaking English, presumably because my married name was English. This was no problem the day we arrived..... On Friday night, we went to the champagne bar in the hotel for an aperitif before going out to dinner. The hotel offers a tasting experience where you are offered small glasses of different champagnes with accompanying hors d'ouevres. The menu states that this is not available on Fridays; however, a \"proper\" French couple who arrived 20 minutes after us were offered it without asking. The next morning, we went out to see Paris at about 9am. When we returned at 3pm, our room still had not been made up, despite the fact that the housekeeping trolley had been on our floor when we left 6 hours before. There was no-one around so I made the bed and we settled down for an afternoon nap. Despite the Do Not Disturb notice, the maid entered the room and encountered us naked, much to my (very British!) husband's chagrin. My husband dressed and went down to Reception to make sure there was no repetition, and to ask for some fresh towels so we could shower before dinner. He was assured this was a one off and would not happen again. Sunday, we went out about the same time and got back to the hotel at 3.30pm. Again, our room had not been made up. I made the bed and changed the towels from the trolley on the floor while my husband went back down to Reception to ensure we would not get disturbed; 15 minutes later, the maid walked straight into our room again. At this point, I called and asked to speak to a manager. I spoke to a lady who said she was the restaurant manager and offered us a free breakfast for the inconvenience of having to clean and make up our own room for the weekend. I pointed out that we do not eat breakfast and what I wanted was a reduction in our rate, commensurate with what they would have paid the maid for actually cleaning and doing up the room each day, rather than waiting until the Do Not Disturb notice went up and then walking in, almost guaranteeing she wouldn't have to do anything. This lady promised to refer this to a manager the next morning as she had no authority. At check out, the day manager took my card for the bar bill and clearly had no idea that there had been any problem. I delcined to explain as we were due to catch a Eurostar back to London, but I wrote to the manager on our return setting out the problems and asking for his comment. Six weeks later, I have received neither acknowledgement nor response and have given up waiting. I am very surprised to be treated like this by a Sofitel, which is normally a great brand. In summary, if you really want the Paris tradition and romance, together with world class service and food, stay at Le Crillon, which is the best hotel in the world and where we usually stay.

L'Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees are a mere 5 minute cab drive. Overall, our favorite thing to do each evening was to walk the three blocks down to Trocadero Square and eat at one of the many cafe's enjoying the night time view of the Eiffel Tower. Dining: Continental breakfast (juice, coffee, croissants, muffins and yogurt) was included each morning with our room and made for a great start to the day. While you can enjoy light snacks in the afternoon, there really isn't an official restaurant on the premise. We didn't see this as a problem as part of the fun was enjoying the local cafes. Each evening we opted for a suggestion from the hotel manager/concierge and were never let down. Our first night was spent at the Museum Cafe (a short three block walk). While we were pre-advised of the food being somewhat average, the view at this restaurant was to die for. We were not let down. With such a spectacular location, this really was one of the highlights of our trip. Room: Although somewhat small (as others have mentioned), the room was extremely charming with a generous sized bathroom. Very comfortable bed with local parisian chocolates placed nightly on our pillows. My only complaint would have been for the air condition to have worked a little better. Tip: We booked the room as a bed and breakfast package through an online website and paid about half of the usual rack rate. Coming from London, we took the Eurostar train direct to Paris.
