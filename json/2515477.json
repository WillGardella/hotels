After reading most of the reviews on trip advisor being positive, I thought we were going to be staying at a really cool place. The restaurant food was ok. Movie night was cool. Our first night at the hotel was a Thursday night. After the movie we went back to our room. The room smelled good. But, there were many areas which could have used some attention. Dust along the edges of the walls, Nicks in the nice white furniture (would look better if touched up), Bathtub really gross and needing to be replaced (found out the next day that the drain could use attention too....standing water while showering), the caulking along the bathroom floor was so bad and the glaze on the tile was coming off. Under the sink the pipes are rusting out. Just needed much needed repair or replacement. There is a hairdryer, but it is very sticky with hairspray and tons of lint in the vent. The noise from the hotel is awful. The same retro music playing all night long. And a huge gap under the door to the room, which does not help at all! One last thing, the bedding is soiled. I woke up after the first night and was going to pull up the comforter, this is when I saw the stains! Gross!! So, I left a note asking to be replaced. The comforter must have been just turned around, as the stains were still there! I would not stay here again!

The restaurant on the weekend was great - very lively and delicious food. If you're looking for nightlife outside of their own restaurant on the weekends (we were disappointed to find that they close up at 10:30 SHARP weekdays) and don't have a car, not the best location. We booked through Tablet Hotels and the location said La Jolla - well, it's close to, but a 20 minute drive on the freeway. So not much to do at night in the area after 10:30. Also sad that the pool wasn't heated, even on two 28 degree days. Bike rentals were much appreciated - we biked to Ocean Beach (the closest beach) which took about 45 minutes (but the La Jolla beaches were much better).

Also, the entire staff was great, working as a team, without the \"attitude\" so common today at nice places. I worked all day writing while sitting at the bar (its' closed during the day), and accomplished my goals. The food is good (my wife is a \"foodie\") and we always eat there during our stays. Its just nice when your on the road, and get where your going, to not have to go somewhere else to have a drink, eat, or just chill-out. Its just a great place to be.There is a little road noise, due to its proximity to the street, and the bar crowd can create some noise if you turn in early. We usually ask for a room towards the back that is a little more quite. I guess in summation I would say that if you enjoy the mortuary quite, cookie-cutter corporate hotel style, stay at one of those. They're all the same, and easy to find.

My husband and I had booked a room at the pearl for 6 nights, but we had also just been in Vegas for 6 nights so needless to say we had a LOT of luggage etc. when we arrived at the pearl we were greeted by the smell of delicious food, good music, friendly staff and lots of other guests/locals just having a good time! When we arrived at our room we were greeted by a modern sophisticated, environmentally friendly, clean space! However due to the fact that this is a boutique hotel the rooms were too small for us (this time due to the fact we had so much luggage and we had 6 more days of travel) I should mention that although the rooms are small they have made good use of the space! My husband and I decided that it was just not the type of room we needed for this trip. I reluctantly made my way back to the front desk to ask if we could cancel our room and was expecting them to charge us for half of the stay which is the policy at almost every hotel and is also fair....I was happily surprised by an entirely different scenario...the gal at the front desk apologized for the room being to small and offered to move us to their slightly larger room which would have been great but another guest had specially requested that room for a portion of our stay, so instead the gal at the front desk cancelled our reservation, offered to make a new reservation for us at a different hotel and gave us 2 free drinks to use when we return to the pearl for supper (which we will because the food smelled great and the atmosphere was awesome!) In short...although we did not end up staying I wanted my review to show others that you DO NOT come across service like this often...even at 5 star properties...at the pearl they really do put guests first even if it means they lost out on a reservation! For this reason alone when we return to San Diego again (under different circumstances less luggage etc) we will definitely stay at the pearl!

My compliments to Meaghan on the front desk...she's very pleasant and a wealth of info for me and other travelers too\u2026 an amazing asset for The Pearl! The location is very good as it\u2019s only a $10 buck cab ride from the airport, within walking distance to many local sights, and within walking distance, or a short bus ride, to downtown San Diego. My room (#10) overlooked the pool and was just fine for me; featuring a large low-strung bed on a wooden platform, a double size couch and a chair with wall mounted desk for laptop. The entire room overall, and the bed itself, was clean and crisp, compliments to the cleaning staff! Yes, they do have a \u2018fish\u2019 in the room and that\u2019s so cool. The d\u00e9cor is funk and hip and eye-appealing. There are plenty of towels in the bathroom plus spares by the pool. There is also a good quality iron and iron board in the room to keep your shirt crisp. PRO Funky d\u00e9cor, 60\u2019s style for sure, loved the fish, loved the clean linens, loved the area shag carpet, loved the \u2018live\u2019 plant, loved the a/c in the wall, loved the \u2018touch lamp\u2019 and loved the spiffy wall-mounted desk area for the internet connection, and LOVED the free internet too! Loved the large wall-mount flat screen TV. Loved that the bathroom is done-over okay with a new sink and toilet and dual light switches! Loved the lobby bar and the always entertaining customers; it\u2019s certainly a local attraction, and the restaurant too with such unique local offerings, great food! The pool itself is fine; it\u2019s warm and salted and kept clean...Thank you! And the pool-side heaters were a blessing during the Wednesday night movie. Speaking of movies, the large screen is pretty groovy and one of my main attractions for booking at The Pearl. Truly the best part of The Pearl is that it\u2019s an accepted part of the local community and it\u2019s patroned by the locals; simply put...an excellent atmosphere! CON Didn\u2019t like the fact I couldn\u2019t buy a beer at the hotel bar before 5pm, but I do understand Liquor laws. (There is a liquor store about 50 steps away and they have all the drinks, mixes, and snacks you need, along with great service too!) Didn\u2019t like that there was no fridge in the room, but they did offer to keep my beer in their fridge, loved that! Didn\u2019t like that there was no coffee maker in the room, overseen on my part (I never stay at a place without a coffee machine and fridge, but this was the exemption I guess), but the lack of coffee machine was tempered with the offer of free morning coffee at the lobby bar, and strong coffee too, a great wake-up bonus! RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGEMENT: THE ROOMS ARE GOOD OVERALL, COOL AND VERY CLEAN, THANK YOU. BUT DO CHECK OUT SMALL BATHROOM REPAIRS SUCH AS BENT SHOWER RODS, WORN BATHROOM FLOOR TILES, TUBS THAT HAVE THE PORCELAIN WORN OUT(MAYBE TIME FOR LINERS?) ALSO, DON'T FORGET TO REPLENISH THE H2O SPA BATH PRODUCTS ONCE THEY ARE GONE. CONSIDER ALSO PURCHASING NEW RETRO CHAIRS AND TABLES POOLSIDE; THEY ARE OLD AND THE LINEN CHAIRS POOL-SIDE ARE DIRTY AND NOT INVITING TO SIT AROUND AT!

After finally staying, it more than lived up to the hype! I stayed in two rooms during my stay: the gem and the jewel. The first night was the gem, and it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in... however it was also one of the best for it's price (even compared to rooms three times it's size at other hotels!) I was easily able to plug my laptop into the HDMI port of the 42 inch tv mounted near the wall, and then sit on the bed and control some of the movies I have prepared for my evening. The bed itself was also VERY comfortable, and featured a very lightweight summer comforter sandwiched between two clean and very soft (high thread count I imagine) sheets. The second nights stay was in the Jewel. The jewel was much larger and had a larger bed as well. The bed was the exact same make it seems so it was also very comfortable, and there was again a large HD television (panasonic) in the room for me to plug my computer into easily via an HDMI port. Also in both rooms were two wonderful little beta fish (one per room) which me and my girlfriend found quite amusing (I've never seen fish in a hotel room before!) All in all, I would steer clear of the gem if you are claustrophobic or dislike small spaces, but if you're anything like me, and love cozy little places that are well furnished and VERY practical, then you will love the \"bachelor pad\" that is the gem. I have never stayed in the pearl's largest room as they were sold out both nights, but I can bet they are very nice! All in all, if you're looking for a luxurious get away, the pearl is not for you, but if you have an interest in something different you just might love it. The staff was also extremely friendly and helpful - some of the best i've ever experienced even compared to the nearby resorts.

We stayed in one of the standard rooms for two nights. While the room was on the small side, it was perfectly adequate. It had been mostly updated with new furniture, carpet, and tv. The bathroom renovation seemed to stop at the tub, which was original and run down. It also lacked a full sized mirror and had a loud AC. However, the room was equipped with a fighting fish named Felix! In the daytime, the Hotel was relatively quiet. It is located on a busy street, but the noise wasn't really a factor. Come evening, it turns into a totally happening bar/ restaurant, which was completely packed. We had a couple of drinks and a dessert, both were excellent. When we went back to our room, the noise went away as soon as we shut the door. To summarize, we found The Pearl to be ideal for our needs. The awesome Shelter Island location, proximity to the beach/downtown, the cool retro modern style, warm pool, free Wifi and use of bikes made this a memorable stay.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cSheek, with a good atmosphere, but not perfect!\u201d", "Author": "pjmac123", "ReviewID": "UR115955611", "Content": "The pearl hotel is a trendy hotel. It has a trendy bar and restaurant which is frequented by the locals (except when it's closed on a Sunday) and the look and feel of the place is very modern with tasteful decor and funky furniture. There was a little hic-up at the beginning of our stay when we were given the wrong room. However the hotel made up for this by giving us vouchers for the restaurant and some free drinks and got us in the right room for the rest of our stay. I have to say though, the staff did seem a little confused and overwhelmed at times and organization was not the best. The rooms themselves were nice. We had a pet fish which was a nice touch. We missed having a fridge though, and there wasn't much storage space for clothes etc. I can't help but get the feeling that they decided to spent the money on the look of the place rather than on the extra room provisions that would have made our stay a little more comfortable. They run a film night by the pool/bar which was a neat idea, except that we couldn't hear the film, so that kind of ruined that. Shame. You'd be better off going out for a nice meal/drink and going to the cinema afterwards! Overall though, our stay was pleasant enough, location was good, although you need a car (free parking available!) as a taxi to the gas-lamp quarter will set you back $25 each way. The gas-lamp quarter is the place to go for food/drinks. Good atmosphere and plenty to choose from.

This hotel was not in the area we thought it was in, actually it was pretty far from what we expected. As it turns out that was a good thing. We weren't to far from Ocean Beach which is a fun experience in itself, and not to far from Pacific beach as well. They provide free beach crusier rentals and we had fun taking those out to get around quicker. Now the Hotel itself is in a somewhat run down area, and there isn't anything to see unless you bike for 30 minutes but we had an adventure because of it. Downstairs as all the other review say is fun. You can play board games get a drink and hang with a mixed crowd of people while enjoying a seat by the pool. The room is average, maybe a little below. It was clean (other than stain on sheet) and for the age it was descent. But we need to point out that the age does make a difference. The bathroom is dated, and the basic feel is a converted Motel 6 into a retro style hotel. But then again we didn't stay in the room long so those facts didn't bother me. The staff was friendly and very personable which makes up for the hotels state of disaray. I would recommend this hotel if you are open minded, enjoy people and music, and like the out of the box experience that you can't have at a huge hotel.

I tend to veer towards boutique hotels because of the more intimate experience. When coming in from out of town, not knowing anyone, it makes such a difference when there's an approachable, friendly staff to chat around with and dig up local knowledge. I like well-designed spots, but admittedly, I shy away from hip, trendy hotels because too frequently the staff is stocked with snotty youngsters with attitudes. Right upon entering the Pearl I was greeted by the friendly front desk manager and given a little tour of the various areas of the hotel. Not only did the manager seem cool, I sensed right away she was very concerned about the quality of my stay not just at the hotel but in San Diego in general. On my second day she actually came up to me at the bar and gave me a heads up that a group celebrating a birthday booked a room next to mine. Anticipating they might get rowdy that night, she asked me in advance to let her know if I felt bothered. I really appreciated how she looked out for me- that simple gesture made me feel like a special VIP (and also probably prevented a negative review in Tripadvisor!) I liked how the bar, restaurant, pool, lounge were all integrated in the same area. This created a nice mixture of locals and hotel guests, everyone casually hanging out doing different things- eating, swimming, chatting, lounging. It wasn't a party scene, but definitely relaxed and lively on both weekend nights. I usually don't spend much time in rooms, but the rooms had a contemporary, simple, and beachy feel- not overdone. I was pleasantly surprised to find beds similar to those in a high price hotel. I slept so soundly.. The location to the airport was quick and easy. I had a free afternoon and borrowed one of the hotel beach cruisers (free!) and explored the Pt. Loma penninsula, Sunset Cliffs, as well as Ocean Beach community- it turned into a most memorable day of SoCAL sunshine and the beautiful ocean! Definitely a not-to-miss experience.

I\u2019ve never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem & wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 & 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) & were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car & into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We weren\u2019t going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem & they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isn\u2019t a chain restaurant & is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next day\u2019s weather will be & the menu for that evening\u2019s dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband & I had the burger & loved it \u2013 they aren\u2019t lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace & although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat & drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar \u2013 the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers & ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar. With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something I\u2019d never seen before in a hotel & I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms & all were of good standard. The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo & Old Town \u2013 none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi & it didn\u2019t take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly & if you are thinking about booking this hotel \u2013 I recommend that you do as you won\u2019t regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel & we still talk about our stay there \u2013 it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim & LA.

They have done some cute things to spruce up an old motel, but it is still an old stinky motel in the end. It is near the airport and would be fine for anyone looking for a bed and a TV, even better if they do not have a sense of smell. I booked the largest room called the \"Strand\" based on the room photo and description on the pearl's website. The room they gave me was the exact photo of the smaller and cheaper \"Jewel\" but the front desk insisted that I was in the right room. They had described the room as spacious (450 SQ FT) with a couch and comfy soft chairs. They promised framed art, chrome accents, high thread count sheets, \"room to roam\" and a large wooden desk. None of these things were in my room. The room was about 100 square feet and the art on the wall was literally a child's crayon drawing about four inches by four inches. No couch, no comfy chair, no desk and no chrome accents but for the Kleenex box. The sheets looked and felt like hospital sheets, I'd guess about 100 thread count. The mattress was about three inches thick and felt like it was fifty years old. Mushy and nasty, I could not even think of sleeping there. The first thing that hit me when I entered the room was the strong smell of nasty air freshener. they literally had one of those tacky oil diffusers sitting on the table. It was clearly masking something, probably the nasty gray carpet that looked like it used to be a different color and was total stain now. They had a few nice design details that I do give them credit for, it looked cuter than your average dive hotel. But to promise high thread count, room to roam and a seating area and then offer none of the sort, that is just plain false advertising. They say that they have four of these rooms on the website but the person working admitted that they had only one and it was out of order. Even though I arrived at midnight, I still refused the room and found exceptional accommodations nearby for the same price. Seriously I ended up with a beach side bungalow with a kitchen and living room for the same price as the Pearl. The person who wrote the ad copy describing the room could have been on crack.

I had a fish in my room named Barnaby. The hotel provided wifi. The rooms open out to an outside common area. The nights can be noisy with people coming in late. If your a light sleeper there may be issues with the noise. I would recommend The Pearl to people who enjoy a boutique hotel. If you want a really quiet space I would not recommend this hotel because it is not laid out in a way that minimizes noise. I got what I expect and I was pleased. I did not have a car so I relied on taxi service to and from the conference. I spoke to the hotel before booking and they said that taxis were easily available.

The Pearl is the result of a no-frills low-budget beach area motel trying hard to outclass and outsmart itself with unique touches that most other hotels that pop up nearby along Rosecrans Street would never bother to think up or care to spend the money on since their single proposition is to provide basic accomodations near the beach. For example, flat screen TVs...yes, in the room - but also next to the tables by the pool...and of course, hard to miss the huge projection screen facing the pool - part of their whole \"Dive in\" experience, a unique touch that no other low-budget motel that I know of has thought of. Yes, the rooms are small and relatively spartan but fresh updates abound in many locations both in and out of the rooms, which help to give a nice, more modern feel to the place. What I liked the most though was the dinner experience. I sat both nights at the bar for dinner and enjoyed conversation with the people next to me at the bar as well as with the bartenders. The menu is appreciated by many locals as well, so many of the guests who eat there are not actually guests of the hotel but instead are people who simply know the restaurant as a great place to eat. One thing that would be nice would be to have a small computer area so that guests can do things like print out boarding passes. I can understand why such a computer doesn't exist though, since the space in the lobby is so small. Perhaps an alternative solution could be to provide guests with an email address at check-in in case they need to print out anything at the front desk (so they can email the document to be printed out). I should say thought that the staff is very friendly and will gladly assist in printing out anything that you need printed out on their computer. Overall, this was a great experience. If your definition of boutique is purely upscale, then this may not be the place for you. But, if you enjoy modern updates coupled with some thoughtful retro design elements in lobby/lounge area, at a no-frills, low-budget price and are willing to concede on extra amenities and space, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA TRUE GEM WITH FANTASTIC SERVICE and STAFF\u201d", "Author": "pazosa", "ReviewID": "UR79800304", "Content": "Great, small boutique property with European-feeling flair & sophistication.

I chose this place based on the excellent price, amenities, location, and positive reviews / pictures that were noted here. Our experience was top notch from start to finish. We purchased a package that included the cost of parking at the hotel. I highly recommend this as the hotel parking spots are limited and street parking can be challenging at times. The package also included two cocktails and an appetizer each day we were there. We had no idea how fantastic the food was going to be and when we did, we totally took advantage of those coupons. We ate dinner twice at the restaurant and had Sunday brunch. The food choices went beyond the ordinary (brushetta with squash...who knew?), the service was fantastic (Vanessa our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive), and the food quality was outrageous. We loved the restaurant so much we decided not to go out the 2nd night and dine in again after eating at the hotel the night before. The meals were affordable especially since we ended up getting an entree for free each night for a birthday special and because we used a coupon they have online. You can dine by the pool or inside, but regardless it is an open air restaurant with a great atmosphere which includes groovy tunes and a movie running at the Dive-In Theatre (soundless of course as the music sets the mood). We liked our room as it was clean, well decorated (60s retro), had quality electronics, and most importantly the bed was comfortable. The pet fish was also a great touch! The room was just big enough as we tend to be out more than we stay in. The pool is really a nice to have and I especially enjoyed cat naps in the hammock swings that are right next to it. The hotel was close in proximity to just about everything making it so easy and quick to get around: La Jolla, Sea World, Mission Bay, downtown, Balboa Park, Little Italy, etc... The staff went out of their way to help us get acclimated to the area and settled comfortably at the hotel. John even moved a table from inside to out by the pool for dinner when we asked for an outside seat and there weren't any left. Now that is what I call Service! Ironically we also ran into our waitress Vanessa at a local restaurant she had recommended where she greeted us with hugs and excitement! Overall this staff made us feel at home and even went beyond that by giving us VIP treatment without the VIP cost. Overall I would say this hotel is better for adults as the atmosphere lends to it.

As long as you have a car, you are 15 minutes from everything in San Diego while you get to stay in the cozy and pretty Point Loma neighborhood. All the reviews about the hip style and laid-back attitude are accurate. I've stayed in plenty of boutiques up and down the West Coast, and this ranks as one of my all-time favorites. The beds and bedding are very high quality, the staff is casually gracious and warm, the mod room and hotel amenities are just right for singles and couples without kids, and the overall vibe is pitch perfect for SoCal casual cool. I'm so glad I found The Pearl! The clientele tends to be noticeably attractive, young and stylish, but you don't get that silly attitude or poseur scene like at a W Hotel or Hard Rock Hotel. The Pearl staff and guests know they are cool, but they all keep the mood light and unpretentious. One word of advice, brunchtime and socializing around the pool starts around 10:00AM on weekends, so if you want to sleep in I suggest ear plugs.The room windows are new and double glazed, but in a small property like The Pearl if the bar or the pool has a party going, you'll still hear some of it in your room.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cSo much fun!\u201d", "Author": "hjc_Denver", "ReviewID": "UR62002232", "Content": "I LOVED The Pearl!

There were a number of serious problems with this hotel. First of all - despite booking and paying for a car parking space, there were none available. We ended up parking 4 blocks away and had to drag our luggage back to the hotel. A refund for one day's parking was provided (after we complained), but this was already an inconvenience. The design of the hotel was pretty cute, we enjoyed the pool and the cocktails, sure. Some of the decorations were a bit quirky in an attempt to be cool - the curtains fit the window perfectly, but letting a bunch of light around the edges. There was a goldfish in a bowl on the wall, although unfortunate little \"Pluto\" appeared to be dead. We were pretty interested in the restaurant menu - Lobster Mac and Cheese sounded cool. However we were told that the restaurant was closed during the evening of our stay (and was never open for lunch). Not too much of a problem as we were easily able to make other plans in San Diego, but a bit disappointing. The main problem was - we couldn't sleep. With an early drive on the morning of our check-out we planned to leave at 7am. The hotel was throwing a private party and extremely loud music was playing until midnight. When I say loud - I mean: the whole room we were staying in was vibrating from the bassline. The music was switched off sharp at midnight but this didn't really affect the noise levels - the soundproofing is so poor that we could hear individual conversations of the party guests who stuck around til the small hours (not to mention the road noise). The night porter would only say that \"we explain on our website that this is a lively hotel\". They also say on that website \"For quiet, in-room enjoyment, care is taken to limit sound levels.\" It's a lie. No compensation was offered whatsoever. We were made to feel very uncomfortable and the experience left me personally very angry. Also - we were told there was free wifi, but the password we were given for the wireless network was incorrect and we were unable to connect (note that we are computer literate - this was the hotel's problem) My main requirements for a hotel is that we are provided with a bed and quiet enough to sleep - this hotel was not able to provide that.

In the first room (standard) the faucet of the shower was dripping but they fixed it properly as soon as we told them. The rooms were clean and nicely furnished (modern style) and the beds were large and very comfortable. The hotel has a pool and a bar which is probably very nice in summer time but we didn't take advantage of them. The Pearl might not be a good place for people who are sensitive to noise. The adjacent road (Rosecrans Street) is a very frequented street and the hotel opens onto the road. So there are more quiet rooms and less quiet rooms. However we did not have a problem with the noise, nor with the bar having loud music till rather late one night. The water and the harbor are very close by car and there's a place Point Loma Caf\u00e9 that can be recommended for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Overall the Pearl was a decent stay for its price, although the parking fee might be reduced by about 2$ (currently 10$ a night). Also we personally didn't like the fish in the room.

Overall we had a pretty good stay with a few minor complaints. The accommodations are very clean & trendy.

It is true that the washrooms have minimal renos (faucets & lights) but they are clean. The staff is friendly. The food is delicious (we found a coupon on their website that gave us 2 for 1 dinner entrees if we purchased 2 drinks) however we had more than two since we were crawling distance to our room and our waitress let us know that they had some wines on special for $5/glass. And the location is fantastic. Biggest downfall is parking. We paid an additionally $10/day (which we figured would guarantee us a spot) however on Saturday night we didn't finding parking and were told they'd deduct the cost from our bill (but forgot to) and told to park across the street in the Medical clinic as they don't check on weekends. The only time we benefited from the parking pass was the first day when we wanted to offload our suitcases. I believe parking in the front is free (4-5 tiny stalls) but hotel parking on the side (4-5 stalls) is charged. You should be able to find street parking during the day or during the week. Parking Friday & Sat night is the biggest issues. The other issue we had was the paper thin walls. You can hear everything. I had issues sleeping one day because someone was chatting outside. I could hear them clear as day and when I commented (in a normal voice) to my husband they quieted down. Closing the windows helped a little.

The bed was super comfy with high-thread count sheets, 4 pillows, plus two bolsters. Down comforter and a plush lap blanket. I had read mixed reviews about the noise level and was expecting to have to put up with loud music until late hours. I'm happy to report that noise was not an issue and our room was right across from the bar/restaurant. The pool was adorable and I wish we would have had the chance to take a dip. They had a games area where you could play Jenga, checkers, etc. They had an outside area for smoking with a pretty fountain. In addition to the ample on-street parking, for $10.00/day you could pay for a reserved space. We never had a problem finding a parking spot. My least favorite part of the stay was that my tub had a slow drain and there were some flying bugs in the room, which I discovered came from their homebase of the potted plant in the room.

The only suggestions I have which would make this place a little better would be that the bathrooms are very basic and in need of some upgrading and the hotel is a little noisy.

I think The Pearl is my dream hotel because it really did provide everything I want in a hotel. First and foremost, the style and vibe of the place is amazing. When we arrived on a warm July Sunday around noon, there was a full-fledged pool party going on! Everyone was lounging around with drinks and listening to some great music poolside, some were finishing their brunch which is served every Sunday during the warm months. I didn't get a chance to join the fun that day, but I was jealous of those who did. It's an great example of mid-century googie architecture, but the owners have done an amazing job of renovating the place with one eye on maintaining it's vintage charm and the other eye on tasteful, hip modern design. I love the fact that they brought new life to this old hotel. There is a kidney bean shaped pool in the center courtyard and set next to it is an open-air full bar and restaurant. I think there are probably less than 20 rooms total at The Pearl which makes for a boutique feel. Despite the party in the courtyard, our room was quiet and a great place to relax. It was all brand new and styled like it should be featured in Dwell magazine. Wait, has this place been featured in Dwell? If not it should be. The room had a flat screen TV, lots of Ikea style furnishings, and a very comfortable bed. Oh, and it came with a goldfish named Cosmo! He swam around quietly in his bowl and was a great roommate. The location is great, very close to Downtown San Diego and the whole surrounding area, with restaurants all around. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The one issue is that you have to be careful about parking in the neighborhood. Apparently the police like giving tickets for the smallest parking infractions. However, the staff is very interested in helping that not be a problem for the guests, they will give you pointers and even spot for you while you park your car. So, not a problem really, just be careful parking your car. The The Pearl is my dream hotel because it has great prices, an amazing pool, clean, comfortable and stylish rooms, a welcoming staff, a full bar and restaurant, great and unique architecture and interior design, and it's in a perfect location.

The hotel totally had a hipster swanky vibe right off the bat and my boyfriend was very impressed when we got there. And so was I, until our third night there, when I notice that our sheets weren't changed. The bed wasn't even made, it seemed as though housekeeping just threw the blanket on without fixing the sheets underneath. I was very disturbed by that. I just hope that when we first arrived the sheets were freash and not from the previous guest. I read the reviews before we got there, and it seems as though I got the room with the leaky tub faucet that someone else mentioned. I thought the bathroom could have used more light.

But what you can do to brighten up the place, is take the bedside lamp and turn it upside down to face the ceiling. What I didn't really like about this place, even more then my unchanged sheets, was the bar scene. I didn't notice an over abundance of noisy or rowdiness.

We did reserve parking one night, because we went out to a wedding and I wasn't sure what time we'd get back. They made the mistake of charging me for 2 nights, but were very quick to fix it and refund me. They also had these cool radios in the rooms that played specific stations. The Pearl's Station was very cool and my boyfriend and I would listen to it all the time and just chill in the room and relax. I wish I could have taken that home with me! They also offered complimentary wifi. I had no problems using it for my entire stay there. I encountered no issues and it was never slow.

Eesh! With what promised to be an interesting and possibly overwhelming weekend ahead of us, the last thing we wanted to deal with was the hassle of finding the right hotel at the right price. Enter The Pearl... DRUMROLL PLEASE...I absolutely LOVE this place! I called on a Thursday and was able to book a room immediately for the following two nights. The person I spoke with over the phone was amazing. His name's Tom and was so friendly and incredibly helpful. There are three types of rooms available, The Gem, The Jewel, and The Strand. We booked one of The Jewels for $109 a night, which was a surprising $20 CHEAPER than if you booked the same room through http://Expedia.com. When I got off the phone with Tom, I was so excited for the weekend I could hardly sleep that night. When we got into San Diego (Point Loma, to be precise), we headed down Rosecrans to find The Pearl. Upon arriving, the parking situation left much to be desired. Valet parking is $10 a night and I'm not one for unnecessary expenses so we parked a couple of blocks away and hoofed it. When we entered the hotel, I was blown away by the decor. The vibe is retro-beach-glam. Is that a real thing? No? Well, I just made it up, so HA. The furniture has that sleek futuristic look that was the height of coolness in the 50s and 60s. There are plenty of candles and mirrors on the walls that work with some colored bulbs to create unique and beautiful lighting. The pool area is fun and hip, complete with a huge mounted movie screen that they call the Dive-In Theatre. They do movie nights where you can hang in the pool or on the comfy pool-side seating and catch a flick while enjoying a drink or two from the hotel bar. Our room was totally cool-- cozy and welcoming--even better than the hotel's website had led us to expect. It had a 42\" flat screen TV, a king-size platform bed with soft (and CLEAN) sheets and fluffy pillows. There was ample closet space although we wouldn't need it for just the two nights, and the bathroom was spotless. The hotel provides H2O products for the standard shampoo-conditioner-lotion trio and I must say, the lotion made it's way into my purse in less than ten minutes and stayed there for weeks while I squeezed every last drop out of it. We also had our own little patio but the best part of the room? The beta fish! Every room has their own little beta fish in a bowl mounted on the wall. It was such an unexpected detail and I thought it was totally cute and original. Because it was such a short stay, we didn't have a whole lot of interaction with the staff. Upon checking out we had to wait a while as the front desk clerk was nowhere in sight but when she showed up she was really sweet and made sure we'd had a great stay. We were really busy with family stuff so we also missed out on having dinner and drinks at the hotel restaurant but we'll try that out during our next stay. All in all, we were really pleased with the experience.

Yuk! - we called the front desk and they promptly came to clean it up. But that wasn't the end of it. We were promised by the website a large flat screen TV. - true, but it didn't really work. Each time I turned it on, it would immediately turn back off. I finally figured out that if I turned it on and immediately changed the channel it would stay on.

When my friend and I got there it was quite late at night as I'd flown down to San Diego after work and the club lounge downstairs was lively with lots of drunk beautiful people.

A few changes would help maintain the standard set everywhere else in this hotel and bring it from 3-4 stars to something more special.

I read all the reviews before we went, so I was under no illusions that this would be a quiet place, a luxurious place, or a perfect hotel. We had never stayed at a non-chain, and I wanted to check it out anyway. We really enjoyed our stay. We checked in on a Monday, and not too many guests were staying on a Monday. I was prepared to ask for a room away from the pool area if necessary, but we got one without asking. (Number 17.) It was near a side street, so street noise wasn't too bad, but we had to run the AC at all times because the room got really stuffy if we did not, and the AC was very loud. Still, if you don't mind loud fans running, that doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Plenty of chain hotels are the same way. Some of the rooms are RIGHT next to the pool. I wouldn't have liked to stay in one of those rooms. A few of the reviews mentioned that there was no place for breakfast nearby. This is not true (or I guess it may be true depending on your definition of breakfast). A Starbucks and a smoothie place are about two blocks away, and there was another restaurant that appeared to be serving breakfast maybe 3-4 blocks away, although we did not check it out. It is not the most pedestrian-friendly area, but it is possible to get to these places without an automobile. Also - the restaurant does have coffee available in the mornings. They set up a coffeepot at the bar. One day the cleaning people did not clean the room while we were out, but I was able to find someone to ask about getting clean towels in the meantime, and the cleaning crew was still around, so the room was cleaned when we went out again later. The food at the restaurant was phenomenal. I had this mushroom risotto that was just wonderful, and the drinks were great too. We ended up splurging for a daily guaranteed parking spot. It was our honeymoon, after all. I think it was $25 a day. This required us to ask someone to move a cone to our spot after we left for the day, but after the first time we just did it ourselves rather than bother anyone. Street parking seemed to be relatively available, but it was still nice to have that guaranteed spot and not have to worry about it. We paid in cash, and they were not really equipped to handle payment in cash. They didn't have any change, and the bar was not open. Fortunately we didn't really need the change, so we just told them to tip the cleaning crew. All in all, it was a unique experience for a honeymoon, and I'm glad we took a chance on a new place.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel1985", "ReviewID": "UR23294200", "Content": "I was hesitant about staying at The Pearl because of the bad reviews I read...but had no choice because everything else was booked.

Everything was retro-modern which was a nice change from all the generic cookie-cutter hotels out there. We stayed over a Sunday night in the winter season so it wasnt too busy and was very quiet.

I looked around and did a lot of research on local hotels and was really excited to snag a room here. We usually stay at bigger chains like the W, Westin or Omni, but I thought a little boutique hotel (that is in the fun Point Loma area) would be a nice change. Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as hoped. The average rates for 2-star chains (Ramada, et al) are about $150. Higher end (W, Hard Rock, Omni) are about $300. This was in the high middle, about $255 after taxes. The girl on the phone offered me a free room upgrade (from queen bed to king), which was nice of her. I also signed up for the \"essentials package\" (free parking plus 1 appetizer and 2 drinks at their restaurant/bar) for an additional $35. Essentials package is fine for the money - if you want the drinks and apps. Parking was nice, because the street parking is hard to come by on a weekend. Good news is there's free wireless internet. Better news is that ll of the staff are really cool, friendly and accommodating. From the check-in girl (who saved a parking spot for me in the tiny lot with her own car) to the bartender (who took good care of me, even though she was slammed with a party), they all were really sweet and ran their butts off taking care of the guests. Best part was that the food was surprisingly delicious. We had late-night snacks, desserts and drinks in our room and were THRILLED. The hotel is TINY. There's a tiny pool surrounded by tiny rooms. Our room had a king bed (quite comfy) that nearly took up the whole space. The shower was nice (love the rain showerhead), except that it was a little grimy. Could have been cleaner. It was noisy because the bar is around the pool, which is 4-feet from our door. We had to keep the blinds closed or the bar people could see right in. Weird. Luckily the air-conditioning unit was really loud (in a good way) and drowned out the people noises. We slept really well. The unfortunate part is is that the website makes it look WAY cooler than it is. It looks like a groovy mid-century hotel (like the fabu Horizon in Palm Springs) that offers a chill time. Maybe lounge around the pool and kick back with a mai tai and some fondue. Re-reading their website after the fact, they do mention a \"spirited nightlife scene\" and that \"occasionally, the energetic buzz of good times can be heard in-room...\" and that, \"...care is taken to limit sound levels.\" Um, okay? I don't know if there's a college around there, or something, but this was basically a frat party. It's 20-somethings running a hotel and bar that caters to 20-somethings. Definitely go there if you A) want to be in Point Loma, B) like to party and be loud, C) are 21-30, D) get a rate of $160 or less, or 5) can sleep through noise. Overall a decent enough place.

The Pearl is not a boutique hotel -- it is a renovated MOTEL. It's basically a dozen rooms circling a tiny pool. The management has tried to doll the place up, but the upgrades are very meager. My room felt like a cleaned up basement. The \"platform King bed\" looked as though it were resting on packing pallets! The entire place screams \"motel\". The staff was generally courteous, but neglected to tell me that I'd pay an extra $15 for parking in the \"parking lot\" -- which was nothing more than a parking strip off of Rosencranz. That's \"service\"? In short: do not trust the hype either here or on The Pearl's website.

We were fine at the bar, got really fast service, and had one too many blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis. Thursday night was even louder, I think some game or karaoke was going on til about midnight. In addition, road noise was quite loud in our room as well.

Ha, ha) at this quaint boutique hotel. Now if you're looking for a tired business lounge with computers, etc. go to a boring businessy type of hotel, but if you are looking for something different & fun then read on! For me, The Pearl conjures up moods of old black & white Hollywood glamour, those cool now-famous collectible 1960's HIGGINS glassware pieces, thoughts of Frank Sinatra lounging like a lizard with a Cuban fatty, or images of Marilyn Monroe & Dorothy Dandrich wearing taboo fox fur shawls with the heads & paws still attached! (Sorry vegans). The only difference is that The Pearl has been beautifully updated without bastardizing or compromising the original 1960's design, architecture or flare! It is truly a Boutique Hotel in that it offers \"unusualities\" (my pet word for: unique or unusual amenities) that other hotels may not. For instance, they have a Movie Night! You can lounge, have a gourmet meal or go tapas style out by the pool, all while watching classic movies on a huge screen! Inside you'll find next to the concierge, a cool shag carpeted area with board games to play with. As well, they have an outdoor side patio with a Zen water fountain and a large table that would seat a nice-sized dinner party. The Pearl really almost has a home-like feel to it, because of the cozy floor plan layout. But I can't close without mentioning something my husband didn't even realize before taking me here...the food is excellent! They should really push to the public that they truly offer a full restaurant and bar! Plus if you have dinner, you can get a room (if you are not pre-booked) for a huge discounted price, if there is availability after a certain time (I think almost 50% off!!!). The menu is definitely impressive and tasty to boot! Our room was a corner room #9, I hear it is the owner's fav! Well, it's now ours too! It had cool, simple lines, airy, stylish colors and great tile/wallpaper design, not to mention a truly comfortable platform bed. I also loved the unexpected balcony just off the living room/tv area, where my husband & I enjoyed our early morning coffee overlooking the pool. Overall, I should be giving them a 9 score and that is only becuase they were still in construction at the time of our stay and they could use much brighter/visible signage, but I loved it so much that I'll go ahead and give them a perfect 10!!! I will definitely be back for many more stays and for certain, start coming to their Movie Night!!

So I took my wife there as a belated birthday present. If you are a design buff, especially mid-century or modern, you get it. Some people just won't get it since there are numerous run of the mill roadside franchise hotels nearby. Its a wonderfully not-overdone restoration/modernization of a late 50's or early 60's hotel, with all the best parts preserved. At the front, its not immediately obvious that its different from its more modest neighbors. The first clue that this is something different is the valet service. Next is the upscale restaurant, in of itself unusual in an under 50 room hotel. The restaurant is very open-air and resort like, with seating spilling out around the pool; and with an architecturally blended movie screen over the pool on which mid-century classics are shown during evening hours (we saw 007 Dr. No). Dinner was long and liesurely, since the surroundings were so comfortable. We just didn't want to leave - not to mention that our room was just accross the pool. The room (#9 - \"The Strand\") was large with a sofa seating area large enough to be its own room, a wide plasma tv, and a balcony overlooking the pool. The bed was nice and firm, the sheets and bedding clean, the bathroom facilities large, modern and luxurious (what do you call those wide ceiling showerheads and separate handheld shower nozzles?). The design throughout is mid-century modern yet warm - about the best I've seen this genre done. What also amazed me was the great number of interesting spaces and amenities packed into a hotel of this size. Lots of lounges, board games, balconies, nooks, and items of visual interest - all in earth and water tones, giving a feeling of warmth. There are even beach cruiser bicycles for guest use. The staff was very friendly and attentive (and probably saved our two year old's life). The location is close to the harbor, and central to downtown, the beaches, and San Diego attractions. About the only complaint I had was unavoidable due to its newness - i.e., the fresh paint and carpet smell. Anyway, think the Dub-U or one of those hip little South Beach hotels - at about half the price, but for my money better. But if your just looking for an adequate place to crash, without interest in an onsite restaurant, heated pool, or other little luxuries, you can stay accross the street.
