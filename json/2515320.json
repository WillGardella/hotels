However It was appalling and we decided that we would not stay there again. I did some research and found the Hotel Raphael a beautiful example of the belle epoque style. We arrived very late from Vienna to a warm welcome form the young receptionist. The room was spacious and clean with a typical balcony off the french doors. The bathroom was modern clean and best of all had a separate shower. This is something as Australians we much prefer since having a shower over the bath is cumbersome. The breakfast was included in our tariff and it was excellent with friendly service and more than enough food to choose from the buffet. The house maids were wonderful, they knew when we had gone down for breakfast and came in and weaved their magic so when we returned from breakfast to collect our jackets etc, the room had been cleaned and tidied. The room was a little stuffy but we found opening the french doors provided a wonderful breeze through the room. My partner organised as a special treat (which was extending my birthday celebrations) a Sunday lunch at Le Cinq. The Concierge organised this and it was kept as a surprise until the Sunday morning. Now I would have given the Hotel an excellent rating except on check out the young receptionist put the wrong charge through on Amex thus ensuring a very long conversation on her part with Amex Paris on how to reverse it and put the correct amounnt through. Unfortunately contrary to what I was told I now have duplicate charges with Amex, which Amex is now sorting out. Yes it is only a minor issue but it spoiled what a had been a most pleasant stay to finish our 5 week tour through Europe. However should we stay in Paris for less than 7 days Hotel Raphael is at the top of our list (for stays over 7 days we normally stay in a serviced apartment).", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRoom smelled\u201d", "Author": "InfrequentTrotter", "ReviewID": "UR127138264", "Content": "Room smelled horribly like cigarettes and it was very hot in the room the whole trip.

Entering Hotel Raphael one discovers the atmosphere of a private club. Walnut paneling and generous seating areas line the wide gallery, hung with art and carpeted with Oriental rugs. Rococo describes the ambience of the high-ceilinged guest rooms, furnished with Regency, Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, and Directoire antiques, yet thoughtfully appointed with satellite television, direct-dial telephone with voice mail and modem port.

The service, the welcoming, the location, the food, the free valet parking, the room service, dinner in the room, the 30sqm room space, the huge bathroom size, the room lighting, the english bar are few of the services we tried and that are simply perfect.

We stayed at a friends place, but i also wanted to treat my girlfriend to a night in a fancy hotel. Having searched on location, price and reviews on trip advisor, I decided to book a room at the Hotel Raphael. I chose the Deluxe room, and was excited to go. There was a nice confirmation email mentioning that I could make free use of the fitness room, which prompted me to bring my work out clothes :) Excited to check in, we go to the hotel on Saturday afternoon and were kindly greeted. The staff was friendly and the hotel lobby and dressing looked fantastic. Really nice, old-fashioned, lots of wood. You have to like it, but if you do its great! We got to the room on the first floor and it looked stately, just like the pictures. I went to check out the fitness room and after I had found it, it turned out to be an upgraded cupboard (ok, they did have a shower separate to the work out area.) All they had was a treadmill, a bike, a cross-trainer and some dumbels. That to me was the first disappointment. Since the treadmill was already taken, I went back to the room and checked out the bathroom. Everything looked okay, but on closer inspection it turned out that: The shower cabin looked a bit moldy at the rubbers and the doors didnt close properly. Overall, it all looked quite dated, as in that it hadnt been serviced for a long time. The toilet seat also looked damaged, which to me really takes away from their luxury branding. A shame really because you expect quality. After having gone out for a nice meal, we came back and got ready for bed. That's when we noticed that the rooms were super noisy. Our bathroom had a locked door, that was connected to another room. So if you spoke in the bathroom, the other guests could hear it. When we layed in bed, we could hear the television set of another room adjacent to our room. All these small things are to me missed opportunities for a four star hotel.

After consulting numerous Tripadvisor reviews, I settled on Hotel Raphael - which subsequently met all our expectations and more. Upon arrival, our first impressions were \"Wow!\" - the hotel is a wonderfully historic building with masses of antique furnishings and classic renaissance decor. The desk clerk happily informed us that we'd been upgraded to a junior suite - although I was never able to conclude what may have prompted that to occur. Never look a gift horse in the mouth! He then personally escorted us to our \"room\" - a word that does no justice to what we entered. The suite was undoubtedly the most sumptuous and elegant accommodations my wife and I have ever encountered - and we've traveled extensively over the years with little concern about budget. If you've ever wondered about whether the photos shown on hotels' websites are an accurate representation of what you'll get, this is one case where they actually did. The hotel is within 100 yards of the Arc De Triumphe, so it's brilliantly located for all the usual attractions. Service and attentiveness were first class, as one should expect in something this \"high end\". The restaurant was excellent - albeit possibly a little \"formal\" for our liking, but we acknowledge that Europeans have a different perspective on this, which we respect and enjoy. However, there are plenty of options within walking distance - so we didn't feel in any way confined. If money were literally no object, the Raphael is a magical experience in the most wonderfully romantic sense. I can't comment on what the \"normal\" rooms might be like, but the suite was a truly memorable highlight of our European vacation. Maybe they mistook us for Brad and Angelina, but we gratefully accepted the upgrade. Cost? - very expensive. Enjoyment? - priceless. I've rated it Very Good only because of the cost factor - you really need to be prepared to drop some serious Euros.

It is a classic, palace hotel built to accomodate travelers who spent whole seasons in Paris. For this reason, the rooms and bathrooms are enormous.

The concierge team are very knowledgable and helpful- they were able to secure hard-to-get tickets for us about two weeks before our trip.

Worth noting - there is construction on both sides of the hotel right now and it looks like it will continue for a while. If possible, stay on a higher floor for better view/less noise.

My son kidded me that my catch phrase for the week was \"value proposition\" (he's a business degree candidate and I'm a doctor--I probably didn't do too well trying to speak his language). I would value the following elements to our stay: 1) The hotel is beautiful. It is not shiny and new, which is not high on my list of priorities. The bathrooms were clean and more than sufficient. The bed was very comfortable; my only trouble sleeping was either my screwed up internal clock or the kids upstairs playing tag until midnight-who calmed down instantly when we called the front desk for a little polite help. The rooms are unusually large for European hotels. 2) The location is superb. The Metro is literally 30 feet away and only one stop from a major exchange line (Etoile-Charles DeGaulle) from which you can get to all the major downtown sites in a matter of minutes. We walked to the Eiffel, Champs Elysees, the Four Seasons bar, the American Cathedral for Christmas service (not sure those two should be in that order, the bar and the church, but what the hey), and even the Rodin Museum and the Invalides, all in rainy/snowy weather, but we like to walk. If your expectation is more resort based where everything you might possibly need is moments away I'm not sure where you would stay in a grand city like Paris. This was easy at the Raphael. Go four blocks down Kleber and window gaze at the Teslas. 3) The food was very good. We also used the Luxury Link package and enjoyed the morning buffet. I left each day full and satisfied with what was available. Tempting to max out on the volume to reach the peak of the value proposition, but I'd hardly feel I had to order an extra omelette to get there. The dinner that was part of the package was very good. We stayed over Christmas and chose to also eat in on the holiday day since everything was closed. Both meals were very good; I would eat there again. Am I a heretic to admit that the value proposition at the hotel was better than at Guy Savoy (which I really enjoyed, just not so much the comma in the bill)?? 4) The alcove rooms (104,204,304....) are part of the package. We had no trouble whatsoever with construction noise but remember that we were there over the holiday. Given that I was paying half price, I don't think I would have complained about noise after, say 8 oclock in the morning, and we were gone for the rest of the day. Were I paying full price I would have asked for an upgrade and don't doubt for a moment that I would have been accomodated. 5) Service. Outstanding. Failingly polite. The better the question I asked, the better the help I got. Help them help you. Concierge was very quick to call and verify that something was open and that our reservations were intact. Thank God their English is so much better than my fractured French. I don't believe in being so tight with a buck that you can't enjoy yourself but can't imagine a feeling much worse than to have overspent on a vacation. I, like everyone else, work hard for my money. I feel good when I know someone has worked hard to separate me from my cash by giving me something good in return. Does it have to be over the top? Not any more; I'm over those days. Does it have to be just decent? No, it has to be much better than that.

The hotel was built in the early 1900s apparently for well-heeled travellers who would stay for longer periods. Hall, restaurant and bar are plush but at the same time intimate and cozy. A sweet little fitness room was more recently added with a small steam room and sauna - perfect to warm up after a day of sightseeing and we always had it to ourselves. Our Alcove Room was huge by any standards and very classically appointed (hand painted ornamets on the walls, chandeliers, antique furniture and mirrors everywhere). The bed was most comfortable, plenty of wardrobe-space and a bathroom with daylight and a separate toilet. Very nice bathroom products by Fragonard. WiFi was available in the room and we paid 15,- Euros for 10 hours which was more than enough for our whole stay. The most impressive feature of Hotel Raphael was the incredible service: concierge was very efficient before and after arrival, maids made up our room (twice daily) even when we just left for half an hour and room-service for breakfast (inculing fresh rose) was out of this world so that we never got back to the breakfast downstairs. The standard breakfast is French (wonderful pastries, buttter, jams, freshly squeezed juice). The optional buffet is not huge but all the items (fresh fruits, ham, cheese, cereals etc.) are of the very best quality. Apparently, the hotel's breakfast is also quite popular with local businessmen immune to the steep prices. Had it not been included in our rate, I don't think I would have paid 39,- Euros for the buffet breakfast (certain egg-dishes then still come at an extra-charge). We had dinner once at the hotel as it was included in our package and the food was excellent. For Paris standards, the 65,- Euro dinner menu including drinks in such an elegant place is very good value. The location of the hotel is in a very upscale residential neighbourhood near Arc de Triomphe, not ideally located for sightseeing but a metro station is most conveniently located right in front of the hotel entrance. The hotel features an incredible rooftop-terrace with breathtaking views all over Paris (Arc de Triomphe - Sacre Coer - Eiffel tower). On the negative side I have to say that the fixtures in our room (wardrobe-doors, bathroom) were in need of maintenance and that the squeaking of the wooden floor of the room above us did slightly disturb our sleep but neither bothered us enough to report it to the front desk. Our \"LuxuryLink\" package included six nights accomodation in an Alcove Room, daily buffet breakfast and a dinner at the hotel's restaurant and represented outstanding value.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellaire, TX", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful experience!\u201d", "Author": "Roldew", "ReviewID": "UR88702715", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at this hotel on a package offered through an online luxury hotel website and were extremely pleased with it!

We were traveling with another couple whose timeshare entitled them to a two-bedroom suite. The entire hotel was beautiful and very authentically ornate, with gorgeous wood floors and bannisters, plaster decorative mouldings, murals, etc. The mattress was new and firm and the bathroom large, including a full size tub and separate stall shower. Our package included breakfast, which was delivered to our room each day and included breads, yogurt, eggs, and fruit. Another plus was that the Kleber Metro stop was literally right out the front door. Our friends made good use of the EXCELLENT concierge service, which helped them arrange everything from dinner reservations to a private tour of Reims/Epernay. They were also willing and able to assist with a side trip to Normandy if we had decided to pursue that option. The concierge seemed to be available and attentive at all hours, even late into the evening. The only criticism I will make of the hotel services, which in all other ways were excellent, was that there was no free internet services in the rooms. There was a cumbersome process of using extremely long passwords and codes and international cell phone #s in order to PURCHASE internet service. This was a minor inconvenience to me, as I only wanted to use the internet briefly each evening for personal communication, but I imagine a business traveler would be quite hampered by running out of minutes, needing to enter new time-sensitive codes, etc. The hotel needs to re-evaluate this and change it. The only other \"criticism\" is that this area of the 16th is pretty \"dead.\" It's a good thing that the room service breakfast was so good because there was no option to walk to a neighborhood cafe, bakery, etc. We wanted to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood on the first night we got there, and actually had a hard time finding a place. The options were very limited. Not like the \"Paris\" that I was used to in the other places in which I've stayed. Good thing the Metro is so near because you NEED to get somewhere from there in order to see any signs of life. On our last night there, we did find some excellent pizza about 8 blocks away. But the streets were deserted. So I guess I'm saying that I adored the hotel itself (aside form the poor internet access), but I see the location as being too isolated.

The Concierge also sells Museum Passes and tickets to the L'Open double decker bus tours. The bus stop and the Metro stop are conveniently located right outside the hotel doors. Lionel also gave us great directions for our trip to Versailles. The Raphael location is very close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees, and about a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel bar is cozy, and it seems that many local professionals frequent the bar. Our only negative experience was the restaurant on the roof that has a wonderful view of Paris.

The hotel is older, but is clean and has the modern amenities. Our bedroom had french doors seperating it from the sitting area. The bed was very comfortable which is more than I can say for the other furniture in the room. The couch was ornate, but was small and hard as a rock. The shower was tiny, but did have the mutliple jets (one of the self-contained units). If you are overweight, I am not sure you could even use it. The bathtub was very beautiful (antique free-standing with brass feet). Its a bit of a hike from the Louvre and about the same distance from l'Orsay, but is very close to Champps Elyesee. It is very quiet which we enjoyed (even on Bastille Day). Its fairly close the Tower. So the part I did not like was their concierge. Nice enough people, but terrible in recommendations.

We visited the first one, its was the size of a small basement and full of smoke (most clubs in Paris are), but the problem was that everyone there was in their early 70's or late 60's. Which would be ok, if we weren't in our early 30s. The second recommendation (which we stopped by only out of shear curiousity) was supposedly the \"happening\" place where we could use his card to get in. I am glad we had it as there wsa not a doorman or anyone else there for that matter. I think there were about 10 people in the entire bar and there was not a band. Needless to say we ended up going the bar at the Plaza Athenee, which is definitely a place to see and be seen (several celebs there when we went). Its worth seeing and the staff was actually fairly friendly. I could give another paragraph on their restaurant recommendations, which were actually worse than the clubs. They will \"encourage\" you to eat in the roof top restaurant and its actually not bad. It does have a nice view and is the like dinning in a garden in the middle of the city. The tables are seperated by hedges & assorted plants. A bit pricey, but compared to other places its not outrageous. All in all, its nice hotel.
