The public rooms and our room had clearly been recently decorated. The entrance hall, and the quirky lift, give a good first impression. The room itself was smaller than we expected. The air conditioning was not working. The shower drain emitted bad smells. The walls were very thin, meaning that even quiet conversation was heard in the next room. We asked for a non-smoking room in the reservation, but the room we got had an ashtray and complimentary matches. I don't know what the breakfast was like - we were too horrifed at the price (21 euros per person) to try it. Some staff were helpful, some less so. We had trouble with the magnetic keycards, on 2 different occasions. The first time they were recoded with apologies and no fuss, while the second time a different person implied that this was all our fault for keeping them in the same pocket as coins or mobile phones (we didn't). The local neighbourhood becomes deserted in the evening, and most of the nearby bars and cafes close in the early evening - and don't even open on Saturday or Sunday. When travelling on the metro, we often found that the line with a station very close didn't actually take us to any of the sites we wanted to see, and we always had to change.

I would also check the room dimensions before booking and make sure you're aware of the size you're getting, as ours was slightly smaller than expected, but still very nice.

Located just a few minutes walk from the Champs Elysees, we were within walking distance to many sights, stores/shopping and restaurants. If you want to experience a little Parisian flair, this hotel is the best place for it. The hotel is in a Haussmann building retaining many of its old features, including the wonderful cage lift and spiral staircase. Attention to detail is a priority at this hotel, illustrated by the artwork throughout the hotel, and the books in the lobby. We spent six nights here, and had a most enjoyable stay. I have always been wowed by many hotel lobbies only to be disappointed once I got to the room. Thankfully, this was not the case with the Hotel Bradford - the room was wonderful! We were very impressed with everything - the room was huge and included a sitting area with fireplace and two balconies. Most comfortable bed and pillows, and overall the room was very clean. I was travelling with my mother who is a clean-freak, and she was most impressed with housekeeping. The bathroom was lovely too with great water pressure (never ending hot water) and a towel rack which was heated. We had a little problem with people staying in the next room on two of the nights, as you could hear everything and it did not help that they were very loud also playing music until 2AM. This is not the fault of the hotel, although it seems our room was an adjoining one with a communal door so perhaps was not as isolated as other rooms in the hotel. After being kept awake the first night, we spoke to reception the next evening when it seemed the noise levels were going to continue. They dealt with the situation very promptly, speaking to the guests in the next room and the issue was solved. For this we were very grateful, as the staff responded quickly to resolve our concerns and followed up with us to ensure we were happy. Service is excellent and all the staff members we dealt with were efficient, helpful and always smiling. They provided us with a map of Paris, printed boarding passes and also booked taxis for us. We didn't try the breakfast, following the other reviews we read, and instead enjoyed daily treats from the neighbouring patisseries. We probably spent about 8-10 Euros a day for breakfast each, but in most cases we had lots of left over treats to take us through to lunch as well. So would recommend trying as many different patisseries in the area, we liked Julien's for the delicious fig rolls. The weather was below zero during our stay, snowy and raining, but the hotel was so warm and comforting. The only thing the hotel didn't have was umbrellas for the guests to use. This is an amazing four-star hotel, great value for the location and highly recommended. Also free highspeed wi-fi in the room was a bonus too. Don't miss sampling the hot chocolate and macaroons at Laduree on Champs Elyesses, or the Christmas Village if you are visiting during this time. Paris is a truly beautiful city, and our stay was enhanced by the wonderful experience at Hotel Bradford.

Then again, I had reserved in advance one room in particular, but at my arrival the front desk said it was not possible for me to get that room, because they were still doing refurbishment of it....;a few hours later, while taking the elevator,a couple of customers came out of the same room I had previously booked (I got a smaller one on the same floor that time)...and I asked them if the room had some \"work in progress\" inside...and they answered it was perfect and they gave them that room at their arrival...(and it was their first they stay at Bradford hotel...) while I actually was staying there every 3 months,every year!. I think that all of this is too much to handle,without complaining. Furthermore, after the refurbishments they got (so many times I stayed there and all the windows could not be open due to those works, undergone for more than 2 years) the price of stay has grown more than 3 times the price list they had till last spring 2010...and the rooms are always the same...except from the furniture, which had obviously to be changed from years! I always tend to be really honest while reporting my stays, no fake complaints, and I often travel worldwide for work; every time I stay at a hotel where I usually go for work , no matter where, the director or the front desk always try to give me a very good accomodation, because they know me and they are glad I come back at the same hotel every time....at Bradford it never happened...I don't know why...the only person who always cared about my stays was Fredricat the front desk..and I'll always thank him for it!

The hotel was very easy to find and it was really easy to walk to everything from the hotel. Metro stops are just a few minutes walking distance in two different directions. We often cut through the covered inside walkway in a shopping \"mall\" (near the Marriott) and it took us right onto the Champs easily. We actually enjoyed late nights out so we were never up early enough to try the included breakfast. We saw the tail end of it one morning and it looked like an average \"continental\" type breakfast. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, our room was not ready. Granted, we were early so we left bags and strolled. We were told to check back in an hour or so, but even then, still not ready. Two hours later and a meal eaten nearby, still not ready. We finally sat in the waiting area for a few more minutes and THEN our room was ready. Our room was nice, we could actually see the very top of the Eiffel Tower from our bathroom looking out the doors to the small balcony. Our only complaints: 1) the closet would NOT unlock for us no matter how much we jiggled the key. We finally had to call the manager and he struggled a while before getting it open. 2) We returned from a day out and about to find our room door propped open with a door stop. Apparently the housekeeper just forgot and left our room open when done. Luckily, nothing was missing. 3) The staff just could not offer good suggestions and help with things to do in the area. We utilized staff at the Marriott desk instead since they were far more helpful (on the advice of friends). Overall, a good experience, great location for far less money than staying on the main street, and very easy to get to everything. Appreciate the small lift to assist with luggage also!

We were originally booked into the Best Western Malte Opera and got a phone call about an hour before we were due to leave saying they'd 'upgraded' us to the Bradford Elysee and would charge us the same price but this time would include breakfast. We thought that the hotel was of a good 3* quality overall with the following observations - we stayed in room 52: Reception: We used their local knowledge on several occasions and we could not fault their willingness to help - excellent !! Their English was also of a high standard so, bearing in mind that our French is very basic, we had no communication problems. Room: The usual twin beds pushed together(!) which is a real shame as they could easily have connected these and made them up as a double bed - we did this ourselves instead ! Tea/Coffee Making Facilities: When we arrived, the reception staff asked us if we would like a kettle and they were happy to keep replenishing our stocks of tea and coffee - so no problems here. Bathroom: Excellent standard - clean and looked new but spoiled by the fact that the shower had to be hand held. This could easily have been remedied by having a bracket on the wall. Breakfast: Although this was complimentary for us as part of the upgrade, the quality and choice of the food was poor and the service was even worse !! There were only two staff and they were having real difficulty keeping the tables clean and set for new arrivals. As a result, we had to sit at a dirty table and ask for plates, cups, milk and spoons which all arrived at different times. Another guest asked for some more scrambled egg (as the serving plate was empty) and she was told that 'the eggs are finished'. The guest insisted and the waitress reluctantly went and made some but she was clearly not happy to do this. Bearing in mind it was only 9.45am and breakfast didn't close until 10.30am.......and also that the advertised price for breakfast is 22 euros(!), this was all very reminiscent of Fawlty Towers. In short, more staff, better quality food and a cheaper price would all add up to a better breakfast experience......on reflection take breakfast in one of the many local cafes. Out and About: On the subject of local cafes, take care to search out the good value ones - we paid \u00a35 each (yes!) for coffee at one of the pavement cafes on the Champs Elysee. We found quite a few cafes away from the Champs Elysee that offered coffee for 3 euros - still expensive but that's the euro for you at the moment.

We have stayed at several 4 star hotels where the bath takes an eternity to fill! the bed was quite comfortable and the air conditioning worked ok. the public spaces were quite nice with a small lounge and the breakfast room was also quite picturesque. however we were guided by other reviews and booked room only and from what I could see this was good advice as the breakfast looked vastly overpriced.please note there are many cafes and places for breakfast a very short walk from the hotel. We enjoyed dinner 1 night at the bistrot neapolitan on rue franklin rooseveldt just round the corner from the hotel. I know it seems a little perverse eating Italian in Paris but the cost there is very reasonable and the restaurant was full and lively so I would reccomend booking. I had one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten and it was enormous and delicious.Paris was the usual delight especially if you just enjoy wandering around and exploring. the streeets around the marais district are enchanting and also those on the Isle de st. louis.one slightly out of the way walk we took started on the rue moufetard where there is a food market and the road itself is crammed with small food shops selling all sorts of tempting goodies.From there you can walk quickly to the Pantheon where many famous french people such as Marie Curie are burried and from there it is only about 200 metres to the Luxemburg gardens. from there youcan walk into the district of st germain de pres with its great shops cafes and art galleries. it certanly made a great trip for a few hours.In conclusion I would not put anyone off staying at the hotel but dont expect too much. we paid about 160 euros per night and I would say any more and it would have been slightly overpriced. having said that Paris is not a cheap city although these days probably no more expensive then London.

Fully recommend this place, and will be staying again in the future.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Bradford Elysees", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197946-Reviews-Hotel_Bradford_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$241 - $399*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10, rue Saint Philippe du Roule</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">75008 PARIS</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "197946", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e8/d1/39/facade-de-l-hotel-hotel.jpg"}}
