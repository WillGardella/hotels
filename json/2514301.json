Had booked through laterooms 2 weeks ago. The main reason i chose this particular hotel was that it was billed as having smoking rooms available. This was not the case. However, having got over that annoyance, we were directed to our cupboard! To call it a room would be a gross exaggeration. It looks like a cell and the toilet/shower cupboard is unbelievable, your knees are squashed behind the door if you manage to get the door shut. Unlikely i will manage a shower as the toilet overhangs the shower tray. I intend , to leave in the morning.

A boiled egg is served which is not common at many B&Bs. I would rate this place as a small step up from a hostel. My room and bed was tiny, resembling a prison cell. And the shower is at the end of the bed with a curtain so its very easy to get mold in the room, although my room was clean. The toilet is up the corridor and it is crooked. So you sit wonky. And the tv is on the wall by the bed so it's kind of useless unless you stand up or sit on a chair to watch tv. My room faced the street that had the pub so was noisy at night then again in the morning with garbage trucks. If you want budget accommodation and a break from shared hostel bedrooms then this place is fine.

The pictures that you see on the website must be of their best room and there can only be one as the room we got was nothing like that. You walked in and there was a double bed pushed up against the wall with room for a bedside cabinet next to it and that pretty much covers the width of the room. The bed itself incidentally is like an old fashioned camp bed with a metal support running across the middle and squeaks every time you sit on it never mind move in your sleep, at least it was comfy though!! To hang your clothes there were some pegs on the wall at the end of the bed, there was a telly but you could only watch it's reflection in the mirror on the opposite wall!! The windows do not appear to be double glazed and if you want to get any sleep before midnight good luck, there is a pub on the corner and you hear every patron as they leave it doesn't really get quiet until about 12.30 and the road noise starts up again sometime before 7, I swear it would have been just as quiet if we had camped on the pavement, it certainly would of been more spacious!! The bathroom, well what can I say about the bathroom, from sat on the toilet you could swivel to your right and have a complete shower literally, swivel to the left and you could clean your teeth!! I couldn't stand in there and stretch my arms out because it wasn't wide enough, my other half described it best as saying \"did they get that out of a caravan?\" Macdonalds did a tremendous amount of business from us whilst we were there as they sell very good tea for 98p, which is handy seeing as there are no tea or coffee facilities within the room. In fairness the room was clean and it's price did mean we could do some extra things whilst we were there, but next time I think it may be stars over price!!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lowestoft, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cyou get what you pay for..\u201d", "Author": "rozzi1", "ReviewID": "UR111420311", "Content": "a basic hotel, ideal if you just want to stay there to sleep not hang around in, rooms are small and basic, would have been nice if there was tea/coffie facilatys in room, we had to bring in coffie from maccyd's what was just round the corner... had breakfast there, as we felt uncoftibal going to breakfast in the basement (youngens/students) but was pretty much near all the shops, ice rink ect... was a good walking distence to go to oxford street, cheap/good value.. will retune but hope it will be more quiet... and we WILL bring our kettle with us !!!

We checked in this tuesday, We were meant to stay for two nights, but within 3/4 of an hour we checked out! The one good thing I guess is that they gave us a full refund! As we walked in the entrance was messy and looked like it had not been repaired or painted in years! We checked in at the reception with a gentleman who did not know we were coming even though we had booked directly through their website!! He rang someone and shouted down the phone to stop any further booking. Not a great start! We were then given out key. I asked for a hair dryer and yes I was given one, but it took two members of staff a lot of fuss and agression to find one! It was all pretty uncomfortable from the start. We then went to our room which one can only describe as pokey! there was mold and condensation everywhere, making it hard to breathe, the bedding was dirty with hair and bits all over it! We asked if we could see another room, the man angrilly showed us another room. We went next door to an even smaller room. Someone else has written a very good description of the \"Bathroom\" (You can have a shower as your sat on the toilet) you could bearly stand up! We thought maybe we could just bear the 2nd room as it did not smell of damp, but then when we went to open the blind we found there was nothing to pull it up. We asked the man about it! This is the hilarious moment that we decided we wanted to leave... he walked over to the blind and said \"Oh dear someone has stolen it!\", if it wasn't already bad enough he told us to leave the room for 5 minutes! Where apon someone came up the stairs with a power drill and a blind! It really is fawlty towers!!! The lights in the landing flicker it smells odd and the staff are rude and scary!!!!! When we were stood in the landing, we decided to leave and find somewhere nice to stay, I went to the door, when I knocked, I was shouted at! A very odd and horrible thing to happen! We told him we did not want to stay and when he realised that he had shouted at me not a member of staff he backed down and gave us a full refund! I was left horrifed at the whole experience! I didn't know wether to laugh, cry or shout! We left asap and can only advise you all to NEVER EVER EVER STAY THERE!!!

It is more like a hostel than a hotel. The only difference between this and a hostel is that the New Dawn Hotel has all private rooms. I know that it is probably impossible to find a private room at a cheaper price in the middle of London, but I would rather pay the extra 10-20pounds a night and get something decent. The rooms are very very small. The bathroom is a joke, when you are sitting on the toilet you are practically sitting in the shower, and the sink is right in front of your head. The New Dawn provides towels, a very small bar of soap every day and has a TV in the room. Bring your own toilitries if you decide to stay other than that. The window in our room was broken and we were unable to properly close it. It was very noisy in the pub near our window and so it was pretty difficult to sleep. Breakfast consisted of Tea or Coffee and toast. That is it don't expect any more. The hotel will store your luggage if needed but they don't have a secure room to do this so you do so at your own risk! Overall, I would never stay here again or dream of recommending it BUT if you are a backpacker on a very tight budget and want a small step up from a hostel then you might consider staying here.
