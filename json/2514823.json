As others have pointed out, the Eiffel Tower is no more than a 10 minute walk away. The Rodin museum, Military museum, Napoleon's tomb and Rue Cler are also within 10 to 15 minutes and if you are going to the other main museums and sights, the 3 lines served by the La Motte - Picquet metro station can get you to most of them directly within 15 minutes. We also found the #69 bus, which leaves from Champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower, to be a very convenient way to get to the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Pompidou Center, etc if you prefer your travel above ground.

What we found was a fantastic hotel in a great location that was quiet but near everything you would want and the staff were first class. I have read the negative comments and can only say that these people need to get a life. It seems there is no pleasing some people and/or they are very difficult. The public areas and rooms were spotless and seemed to be cleaned throughout the day. The whole hotel is very well furnished and the attention to detail like slippers and Hermes toiletries add that finishing touch. We took a Classic room which is on the small side but I am assured this is typical of Paris hotels but for the two of us it was fine. How big does a room have to be to sleep in, relax in, wash and change? The minibar was also a great bonus. Only soft drinks and mineral water but only 5 Euro per day regardless of how much you use. The staff couldn't do enough for you and were very friendly even including the night porter when we came back from the Moulin Rouge at 1.30 am. They helped arrange taxis on the day of my wife's birthday and also confirming our airport return transfer too. We were sitting at a cafe having a drink and one of the staff stopped to speak to us when out for her lunch, now that is a great touch!! There are a number of lovely bars and bistros a short walk away. We particularly liked Le Pierrot on Ave De La Motte Picquet and Le Beujolais on Ave De Suffren. There are some very nice shops, going by my wife's interest, along Rue Du Commerce just past the Metro station. The Metro at Le Motte-Picquet Grenelle is a 5 min walk and takes you to Charles De Gaulle Etoile where you can connect to anywhere in Paris. The Metro system is first class and easy to master and navigate. Only tip is to remember which destination you are heading to so you can go to the right side of the track. All in all we had a wonderful time in Paris, our first, and we loved the Hotel Ares Eiffel.

Our room, #64, was first class all the way and immaculately clean. The bedding was crisp and sumptuous, the towels in the bathroom were thick and plush and we loved the Versace tile and Hermes bath products.

The staff at the front desk all speak english well and were always so pleasant and helpful with directions and maps, restaurant recommendations, etc. Housekeeping did a fantastic job and kept us well stocked with bath products. The location is quiet yet convenient. From the Charles de Gaulle airport, we took the RER-B train and transferred to the Metro line at the Denfert Rochereau station, then got out at La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle station which is a very short walk to the hotel. Being close to the Eiffel Tower was great for us. We boarded the double decker bus from the Tower as well as the evening cruise along the Seine. We walked back several nights to see it all lit up and twinkling on the hour - so romantic, and on our final day, took the elevators to the summit. All the other Paris attractions were easily reached from the 3 lines available at La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle Station. There are great restaurants with outdoor seating near the hotel. We enjoyed the \"Suffren\" and the \"Primerose\" and a wonderful patisserie across from the Metro where we purchased pastries for breakfast.

Because every morning i would request for 2 pots of hot water due to the cold snap period while we were in europe. The lady attendant would brought up for us, I think during the second morning upon our stay, she took the initiative to give us a kettle.

They speaks great english too and were always smiling with the guests. During the day i left, they still joked with me to \"send\" them the weather from my origin country Singapore (A tropical island all yr round). 2) Value: The price was abit steep for us but it was still worth it for a short stay. 3) Sleep Quality: Booked the room (no 63) on the high floor located at the rear.

The staff is friendly and try to help Close to the metro comfy pillows Cons: No breakfast included in the rate (we were offered the breakfast one day because our room was not attended to. The pastries and coffee were good). The hairdryer is very weak and is attached to the closet (we stayed in the Classic Room). It is very akward to blow out your hair while standing in the corner of the tiny room. The minibar was never explained to us upon check in. There is no price list. We never took anything but upon checkout we were charged for 3 days worth of items (I now know that it was 3 days worth of minibar items as I just read another review stating that it was a great deal to be able to take anything from the minifridge for only 5 euros a day). We would buy our own wine or water and take it back to the room and the housekeeping staff would throw away our items even if we were not done. That was annoying. I emailed the hotel one month before we arrived stating that we were staying there to celebrate our 7 year anniversary. Throughout our stay, it was never mentioned or acknowledged in anyway. Although it is close to the metro, the location is not that great. The neighborhood is not very lively. I guess I just expected a bit more. I know my cons are not catastrophic or vacation ruining (which they were not!) but all added up just made the experience at the hotel average.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and very well appointed\u201d", "Author": "CarolinaToTheWorld", "ReviewID": "UR124865803", "Content": "Spent one night year as part of a short stopover in Paris. It is in a really excellent location in a quiet area (Swiss district) and yet a very short walk to the metro and the hustle and bustle of the Eiffel Tower. There are some good restaurants, cafes and bistros in the area as you are far enough away from the Tower to get away from the pure tourist trap ones. Hotel itself has done an excellent job of furnishing and appointing the rooms in a modern but classy style. While everything is typically small it is all very well put together. We picked one of the larger rooms to accomodate a family of four with two chairs that converted into twin beds. It was tight but very nice. Impressed with the facilities - Bang & Olfusen TV and Hermes products in the bathroom. Last time I had Hermes products in a hotel was at Burj al Arab in Dubai! Downstairs was nice too with a nice lounge area with new Apple iMacs for browsing the web. Breakfast was nice if simple in a small but comfortable dining area. Also really worth noting that staff were very friendly and helpful. No need to even say who we were when we arrived they knew from the fact we were family with kids who we were. Really nice touch and made you realize they were making an effort. My one complaint is pricing and hence 4 not 5 stars. One night was over $500. Yes it is Paris and yes it was in height of summer but still this is very expensive and we can do far better in NY, London, Tokyo etc so not sure why Parisians think they can get away with such high prices.

The bathroom was absolutely stunning!! With Versace wall tiles and Hermes toiletries! My wife loved the rain shower, which I have to admit after a long day travelling around Paris was great! The seating area opposite reception was also stunning. Very modern in parts yet with that classic French/Parisian feel that you would hope for. Even the stairwells and corridors are dramatic and stylish. The only thing that let the hotel down was the breakfast room. It felt like a kitchen/eating room you would see at a hostel.

However, when I arrived with my family after a 14 hour flight was absolutely denied a room even though I know the hotel had rooms with extra beds that usually had family members. the owner absolutely refused to honor this and insisted that we get two rooms which was over $300 a night and we had booked 4 nights. This was a nightmare. he kept insisting that we were trying to be dishonest and I kept stating that we were not that stupid to get a room for two and have 4 of us in the room. We are a family that has travelled extensively. After two horrible hours of arguing, expedia paid for the extra room and I had to spend the rest of the evening frantically looking for a room in another hotel. Fortunately my usual stand by Hotel D'Orsay gave us a lovely suite for a reasonable price during the middle of the summer. So we moved the next day with a horrible feeling. yes, the rooms were small but cozy. The location is good but not central to other places. Yet, I would have preferred a compassionate and kinder owner/manager. The irony was he stated that he know there will be an issue and was waiting for us. I wish they had e-mailed me as I had made the reservation many months ago. Also I feel at the time of reservation there was such a room available and was given away. Perhaps there was a hope that after a long journey we would be too exhausted to fight it and would pay the extra money for an additional room.

We landed in Paris for one night before setting out for England and Germany, and for that initial night, used the Renaissance Place Vendome, which was outstanding. Based on reviews here, and the relatively low cost, we decided to stay at the Ares for three nights on our return to Paris to close out the trip. We just narrowly averted disaster. First off, if you do decide to stay at this place for some reason, be sure to get detailed routing info to the hotel from the hotel via e-mail. We didn't, and the cab driver took 10-15 minutes of trial and error and mapreading to find the very small side street upon which the hotel sits. Check-in was fine, about what I expected for a boutique hotel in Paris, where I've traveled before. The staffer at the reception desk was polite, but certainly not overly welcoming or warm. There was no offer of assistance with luggage, which, again, is to be expected for this sort of property. The elevator is absolutely tiny and not for the claustrophobic. The room cleanliness and overall appearance was exactly what I expected based on the TripAdvisor reviews; very pretty linens and drapery, huge bathroom with a window, plenty of space if you understand the general size of Paris hotel rooms. (Some reviews here say the rooms are small - - they aren't, not for Paris anyway.) Immediately, however, we noticed the distinct musty odor of cigarette smoke, which was disappointing for a nonsmoking room. I figured that the A/C would take care of it, and went to activate it, but found that I couldn't. I went downstairs to ask the staffer at the front desk what was wrong, and she told me (not rudely, but not very apologetically either) that since it was \"so cold\" outside, she had disabled the A/C for the entire hotel. This meant that there was no circulated air of any kind inside the room; no heat, no A/C, no central fan blowing uncooled air from the vents. As we continued our discussion in French, she told me that \"in winter, there is no air conditioning.\" I'll grant her that it wasn't 80 or 90 degrees F outside (it was about 60-65 during the day and maybe 50 or a touch lower at night during our visit), but October isn't winter, and there's a difference between \"no air conditioning\" and \"no central air.\" Both my wife and I have mild allergies and we need some sort of air circulating - - particularly if there's a lingering air of cigarette smoke from a recent guest. The staffer's solutions were to tell me to open the windows and to offer me an ancient-looking fan to carry back up to the room. The window solution was out of the question, as the Ares has large windows with no screens, and we weren't trying to deal with insects and perhaps even a bird in our room. The portable fan, of course, was unacceptable. I told her that this probably wouldn't work and that I would be back down soon to let her know. She said that was fine. I returned to my room, and my wife and I thankfully located a room at the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe (which was far more expensive but wonderful) for the remainder of our stay. We left, having sat in two of the chairs and logged on to the high-speed Internet. We were at the property for just over an hour. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, the front desk staffer was totally rigid and unwilling to waive the night's charges. She told me archly that I should have e-mailed the hotel in advance, and she would have readily told me all about the coerced deactivation of the air conditioning. I told her that wasn't my obligation, and since the hotel claims on its website that it offers air conditioned rooms, the hotel needs to live up to that promise. I simply didn't understand why any guests who didn't want A/C couldn't turn it off in their rooms, leaving any of us who did want to have some air moving around with that option. No dice! (I suspect the A/C might have been broken, but if so, she certainly wasn't telling.) In any event, although she had not taken my credit card upon check-in, I certainly didn't want to break any laws, so I handed it over and she happily charged us for the full night's stay - - about 350 Euros. She offered no apology and (even though we had seven bags) did not volunteer to call us a taxi. We walked to one of the nearby major streets, got a taxi, and went over to the Renaissance, thankfully enjoying it thoroughly regardless of the far greater cost. I followed up directly with the hotel by e-mail after returning home a few days later; they didn't even bother to answer me. No refund or reduction in the price was made, and the full charge appeared on my credit card statement as I expected. I realize that a lot of TripAdvisor registrants wouldn't care about this sort of situation, and a lot of people wouldn't want anything to do with air conditioning in Paris in October. Completely understood. However, the point of this review is not really in the details but in the big picture - - the Ares is fully prepared to mislead you about at least one of their claimed amenities (two, if you count the \"no smoking\" room that wasn't), and if you complain, they won't do a darn thing about it, and in fact will blithely ignore your request for a refund or price reduction later. So, if you're prepared to take that risk, the hotel is well-maintained and in a nice, well-located neighborhood once you find it - - just hope that you don't have any complaints! And, of course, if you like to have air circulating in your room during a \"transition\" month like October, April, or May - - forget it. Naturally, I will never stay at this place again. In fact, this experience has sadly soured me on all Paris boutique hotels. I'll be sticking with full-service establishments going forward. With the Ares, you definitely get what you pay for - - or in our case, you pay for it even if you don't get it. Lowest possible recommendation.

Not only was their reply swift and friendly, but the staff at Hotel Ares Eiffel went above and beyond for us: our balcony also had the view of the very top of the Eiffel Tower! Upon arrival at the hotel we were overwelmed. The exterior is very classic and Parisian and is obviously very well looked after. My partner and I only speak a few words of French (basic GCSE standard really!) but the staff were always helpful and gushed to assist us in any way. Our room (a \"standard\" room) exceeded our expectations and, although small (although I'm told most Parisian hotel rooms are) it was luxurious and well-equipped. The bathroom was beautiful (Versace tiles!! Hermes toiletries!!) with a massive double shower, the bed extremely comfy and the extensive TV channels and wifi access were a great extra. However, our view really was amazing and was the icing on the cake... I cannot comment on the food at the hotel as we did not eat there, simply because the location of the hotel was so close to many beautiful pattisseries and fine-dining cuisine, aswel as small supermarkets for any extras you may need. It is also very close to the metro, which is handy, and ofcourse within walking distance of the beautiful tower. Thank you so much to the staff at Hotel Ares Eiffel.

All of the other top 20 were all over 500 euros! In reading the reviews of the hotel I was surprised at the glowing recommendations from the guests who stayed at the hotel. So I decided to book a room via email. Also being we have a child I called and the manager answered the phone right away and said that no worries a crib would be in our room when we arrived. Once we arrived at the rhotel, the front desk staff treated us like their favorite family members who they have not seen in 5 years.

At least the standardish rooms (i.e. non-suites) seemed quite small (which was to be expected -- it's a small boutique hotel in the centre of Paris), but they are of very high standards with decoration and electronics from the more luxurious brands such as Versace, Poltrona Frau, B&O, Herm\u00e8s etc. The staff was very helpful and friendly and overall it will be easy to choose the hotel for our next stay in Paris!", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in a very nice location\u201d", "Author": "WYSOKC", "ReviewID": "UR115818512", "Content": "Wife and I stayed here on a trip to Paris and loved the room.

My visit to Paris was a mix of Business/Leisure with my wife. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Eiffel Tower and has a Metro Station (La Motte-Picquet) just around the corner. There are lots of cafes/bars just a few minutes' walk away on Pl Joffre which have lots of eating options, and an Indian Restaurant barely a minutes walk from the Hotel where we dined practically every night. There is also a shopping street close by, Rue Commercial which has lots of small shops to browse around. What I found best about the location is that even though the Hotel is very close to these facilities, it is actually located in a small street tucked away. This ensured that we had absolutely no concerns regarding noises from the traffic or the road and had a peaceful stay. Although, other tourist places within Paris are all a cab-ride away. Champs Elysees, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc are all about 10-20 minutes by cab, traffic depending. What should be taken into account is that if you do intend on staying closer to Champs Elysees, you will be paying much more than The Ares for a smilar hotel. I was extremely happy with my accommodation. The rooms are small, but then they don't get any bigger in Paris, unless you want to really splurge. The rooms are very well equipped. Have Bang & Olufsen products, chic furniture and decor. The bathrooms are surprisingly nice sized and have excellent Hermes bath products. The staff is friendly and helpful. We wanted to watch a show at Lido, and they were quick and efficient in reserving our seats for us. The breakfast isn't particularly great, especially for vegetarians and is priced at Euro16 per person which we felt was steep for their offering. Getting taxis in Paris can be tricky especially during rush hours. We faced a similar problem on a Tuesday morning when we had to catch a train to Belgium at 9:00am for a meeting. We waited for the taxi to come for about 40 minutes but to no avail. Ultimately the owner of the hotel offered to drive us to the train station. We were grateful to him for driving us there and more importantly, he drove with great urgency because we didn't have much time. We missed our train ultimately and he apologized, even though he wasn't at fault. A gesture like this really won me over. We were really thankful to him and the entire staff at The Ares for making our stay a very memorable one.

None of which prepared us for the amazing time we had while staying at the hotel. The staff was amazing, especially the woman who checked us in (sadly I can't remember her name). We were greeted warmly and treated like old friends from the minutes we walked in the beautiful wrought iron doors. The hotel is small and decorated like a stylish home versus a typical upscale hotel. After check in which took all of 2 minutes (including friendly conversation) we were personally escorted to our room up a curved flight of stairs (an elevator is also available). While the room was small (to be expected in Europe) it again was styled more like a well appointed guest room than a hotel room with soft linens, thick draped, polished hard wood floors and Hermes soaps in the bathroom. A small juliet balcony led us a wonderful view down a small quiet street. When we asked about places to dine, or directions, again the staff was more than happy to recommend wonderful places and options that proved point on. The neighborhood is more residential ( i.e. not touristy thank God!) and has wonderful shops and cafes which are open early and close late and best of all is only steps from the Eiffel Tower. Taxis are also abundant, but most of central Paris is in walking distance Words can't describe the experience adequately, and we will never stay anywhere else in this incredible city.

The location is a little out of the way - about 15mins by metro to central attractions, about 30 to montmarte or pere lachaise - but Paris is a big place so you'll need to spend a bit of time on the metro wherever you stay (note: do use the metro, it's not at all scary, and there's a station on several lines just around the corner from the hotel). The neighbourhood is homely but chic, a little like the upper west side in NYC. There were some annoyances, most notably noise from other rooms, but nothing that would stop me from giving this hotel 5/5. I paid 254AUD/nt via Expedia (not including breakfast), I think that's excellent value for a hotel of this quality in an expensive city.

Very clean high spec rooms with lovely decor, Versace tiled bathrooms, double walk in rain shower, high ceilings, aircon, room safe, mini fridge, flatscreen TV with BBC channel, spacious even for 4, nice crisp white sheets, nice toiletries & fluffy towels and slippers for all. Some very friendly staff who were great with the kids. We were given a very warm welcome and introduced to the owner. Nice chocs in the room for us on arrival. Free internet access (and the ability to print) from the lobby. ...and now the not so good stuff: The rooms have wood floors which amplify noise. The kids fold out beds had poor, thin mattresses which we ended up stuffing with extra pillows and blankets so they couldn't feel the springs! The walls are thin and we could hear conversations from other rooms pretty easily. No coffee or tea making facilities and the breakfasts are very expensive. We had a day at Eurodisney as part of our stay. Was an easy 40 min trip on the local RER A train from the Arc de Triomphe.

There are many little stores and great cafes in the immediate area. Major sites are in walking distance and the metro is so close. The staff and service was impeccable and the rooms and bathrooms were very well kept and beautifully decorated. We traveled all the way from Honolulu, Hawaii and upon our arrival were jet lagged to say the least. The staff was incredible and worked to make sure we were perfectly accommodated.

The hotel did not disappoint. Location: Located in the 15th Arr., but really just on the outskirts of the 7th. It was a delightful area to walk around and just around the corner from dozens of restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, florists, bakeries and the Monoprix. Although we didn't shop there, it is literally next door to the Swiss Market. It was also one block away from the Metro, which was incredibly convenient for getting to the rest of Paris. It was also a lovely walk from the Eiffel Tower. Within three minutes you are at the beginning of the Champs de Mars. It takes about another 20 minutes to reach the actual Eiffel Tower, but it is an enjoyable walk. Cleanliness: Literally the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The entire hotel appears to have been recently renovated. Everything is sparkling white, fresh and immaculate. The sheets, beds and bathrooms looked like we were the first ones to use them (which is certainly not true so a credit to the housekeeping staff.) Rooms: We had a superior room and yes, it was small, but it was by no means tiny or claustrophobic. It served perfectly for people who go to Paris to be outside of the hotel! The bed was large and so so so comfortable. We literally had to peel ourselves out everyone morning because the mattress and sheets were heavenly. The room had a small desk (which we used to shelve our toiletries) and a very big flat screen TV. There was also internet through the TV and free WiFi throughout the hotel. The room also had a safe and a closet. Keep in mind that the closet and attached shelving is the only place to store clothing. There are not other drawers. We made do but we had some wrinkly clothes! There was a small table and chair in the room and a cute balcony. You could stand out the balcony for a quick picture or breath of fresh air. Bathrooms: The bathrooms are the star of the show! Immaculately clean and sparkly bright, the large tub had a rainshower faucet, which made for some refreshing showers (it does tend to leak all over the floor though.) There are dual sinks with delicious Hermes soaps, shampoos and lotions! A blow dryer, which was decently powerful, was attached to the wall. The toilet is in a separate chamber. Service: The owner was really nice and sweet and refused a tip after carrying our very heavy bags. The clerks at the front desk were fine. Not too helpful but polite enough. They called taxis for us many times, but were unable to help with recommendations for restaurants, etc. Go armed with your own list because they will NOT be able to help. I am not sure whet the actual check-in time, but we had no problem getting two rooms at 11:00 am. When it was time to check-out, the staff held our bags for us while we had a last romp around the neighborhood. Decor: The hotel is amazingly beautiful and decorated luxuriously. The lobby has beautiful window treatments, sofas, lamps, pillow, etc. etc. You can tell particular detail was made to every last decorating decision and the result was truly beautiful. Overall: When I return to Paris, I will be returning to the Ares Eiffel!", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cChic hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "BeccAndBarry", "ReviewID": "UR99681625", "Content": "We usually stay in larger chain hotels but after reading the great reviews on Trip Advisor we booked three nights in the Ares for our first trip to Paris.

It was incredibly easy to find, and even though the hasty online reservation we had made had not yet registeredin the Ares computer system when we arrived, they found a room for us immediately and checked us in with the web price (at a discount). The lobby is very modern and stylish (and clean, which was most important to us at that point), and the clerk was very friendly and efficient. Our fifth floor room was a delight (it is not very accessible to those with a disability though; there are a few stairs once you step off the elevator on that floor. It was not huge as we had only requested a standard room, but it had plenty of space for the two of us. The bed was large and very comfortable with enough pillows for us and our whole wedding party. The TV was emblazoned with a personalized welcome message and the free mini bar was welcome after driving all day. Free wireless internet was fast and easy to access and the bathroom is a story unto itselt. I loved that there was a room for the toilet (with a phone, just in case), and a vanity room with towel warmer, Versace tiles, double sink and every Hermes bath product you could ever need. It was very roomy and super clean. We loved the decor of the room - very unique and boutique styled. The window with miniature balcony revealed the very tip top of the Eiffel Tower and a lovely church in the distance. After a lovely deep sleep, (no noise from adjoining rooms, although we could hear the neighbours across the hall) we tried the breakfast. It was not as expansive as those we enjoyed in Germany, but even as a vegetarian I did alright. We filled up fairly well and headed out for the day. The housekeepers came while we were out and arranged everything in tip top shape, adding extra toiletries since our room was only made up for one the day before (remember, no reservation). We checked out after two beautiful nights at 1200. Since our flight wasn't until 2000hrs, the staff offered to keep our significant amount of luggage behind their desk for the day. The owner was there when we were checking out and asked us how we had enjoyed our stay and if we had any suggestions. He then offered us a coffee before we headed out for the day; he made it himself and left us to enjoy it in the chic lobby lounge. (It was very good). The only thing I would not recommend is making use of the parking arrangements. Parking in Paris - especially so close to the tower - is scarce so the hotel has an arrangement with a nearby supermarket. One way streets make it a bit tricky to find, and the street that houses the market is what I would call sketchy...and expensive at 14 EU/night. On that note, I just plain wouldn't recommend driving in Paris at all. It is a frustrating and frightening experience and you can walk everywhere. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. A bit pricy, but beautiful, well-located, clean and stylish. It was the best of how we imagined Paris and had just the right amount of romance for our Valentine's trip.

I'd been told by friends that you have to be very careful with the hotels in Paris as they can be very hit and miss.

We arrived 2 hours prior to check-in time and expected just to be able to leave our bags at the hotel until we could get to our room. However we were pleased when we were able to check in there and then with no hassles at all. The room was small (as are most paris hotels i'm told) but beautiful. We payed a little extra for a superior room so I can't say what the standard rooms were like but I'm guessing they were just as lovely. The beds were made daily with fresh towels everyday also, and on the second day we came back we found 2 pairs of fresh Ares slippers waiting for us which we thought was a lovely touch! The only downfall is that the hotel is quite near a school so there was quite a lot of noise in the mornings but nothing major and it didn't affect our stay at all. We bumped into the manager a few times and he was very nice and friendly and couldnt do enough for us. He was very eager to please but not OTT - just what i like!

We ended up taking the hotel shuttle to the airport on the way home it was 45 euros for 2 people.

One of my favorite things was the doors open up and you can get some fresh air. The bathroom is a good size. The bathtub is a little odd though-it is a very big step to get into the tub and it has a glass door that only covers 1/3 of the tub so the floor is always wet. The room is a small, we had a superior, but I honestly didn't mind because of how nicely it was appointed. I felt like I was in someones apartment. We didn't not have breakfast at the hotel as we thought it would be fun to get croissants from a different boulangerie each day. The concierge has helpful in getting us restaurant reservations. The hotel is in more of a residential area, which I liked. I do, however, agree with a previous poster who commented on the lack of nightlife.

The extra special touch was providing Hermes Soap, a Bang & Olufson TV, Versace tiles in the bathroom, free wifi, iPad and iMac for use in the lobby. We were always greeted with a smile by Isabelle and an Airport Shuttle was organised for us to get to the Airport. This cost 34 euros but it was shared transportation.

There was also a great patisserie on the corner, right in front of the metro entrance, that was great! Best of all, we had only a 5 minute walk to the eiffel tower. We spent many evenings there on the grass, playing cards and viewing the light show. As with most hotels, the walls are a bit thin so bring some earplugs in the event you have noisy neighbors and you'll be just fine. The staff is extremely friendly, accommodating and responsive. If you're having difficulty making restaurant reservations, send them an email request and they will take care of it quickly!

As were were just two, we asked for them to be returned to chairs so that we had a bit of space to put our bags down. In the X4 configuration there was lying room only.

There is an abundance of good restuarants in walking distance, the Eiffel Tower is such a short walk away and everything is very easy to get to.

Breakfast was very lovely which consisted of meats, eggs, pastries, cereals, yoghurts, cheeses and toasts. The room we stayed in was the basic room which was small but very appropriate. The bed was comfy and the furnishings were gorgeous. Really you are in your room for such a short time it really was just perfect. We spent most of our nights on the grass in front of the Eiffel admiring the lights (a must see). A word of warning and not about the hotel but about the people in Paris. 1. Learn your french. Even if it is the absolute basic like, Can I order a.............or............Where is the toilet............or...................Can I have the bill please. The french are not big on tourists and sometimes it really does feel like they have no time for you. If you speak french you will have a better chance of enjoying your meal with better service. 2. Watch out for the men selling the Eiffell Towers. Dont ask how much they are. They will pester you forever. 3. If an indian dressed woman approaches you asking if you speak English \"SAY NO\". They all want money. 4. Watch out for the person who finds a gold ring and wants to give it to you. We accepted the ring they supposedly found then they demanded us for money.

As an extra, we could see the top of the eiffel tower from our window. Breakfast was not included in the price, which is pretty surprising when you pay 400 EUR for a suite, but it was decent enough with good coffe and tasty bread. In all, this was a very pleasant hotel experience. The interior in all of the hotel was very good looking and contemporary and the staff was friendly. However, the suites was a bit small and I would think that they could include breakfast when charging this much. The area around the hotel is central enough with some of the must-see things close but we didn't find the area very cozy for just a stroll when you are looking for a nice restaurant or a buzzing bistro.

The hotel is full of character and the building has been sympathetically renovated. We paid for a superior twin room which wasn't huge, but plenty big enough nevertheless. It was on the corner of the building and had dual aspect with a beautifully clean modern bathroom with shower, bath, bidet and basin! Hermes toiletries were included and we had clean towels daily. The beds were superbly comfortable and it made a change to have feather pillows instead of those infernal foam ones that so many hotels now use!! There are no restaurant facilities at the hotel as such but it is in a good area with a reasonable choice of restaurants and bistros serving an amazing choice of fresh seafood, oysters etc.. Breakfast is available at the hotel in a breakfast room downstairs at 14 Euros - service between 7am-11am. It is a self service affair, but the bread is fresh with ham, cheese, fresh fruit, yoghurt and croissants available. The crockery and cutlery is all Villeroy & Boch - coffee is hot and freshly squeezed juice is plentiful. The staff speak reasonably good English and are helpful. There is no concierge or bell hop. The room mini bar really only has soft drinks in it and a bottle of water is 5 euros. Everywhere was beautifully clean.

There was no bar or restaurant- in fact no way to get a drink or snack at all in the hotel. No tea making facilities in room or downstairs outside of breakfast times, no iron, trouser press or full length mirror in the room also disappointed.

It's also not a flophouse or a bed-and-breakfast. It's a small, boutique hotel with updated fittings and fixtures. It's within a couple of blocks of the Eiffel Tower, though actually seeing it from the hotel is not an experience I had. The first thing that struck me was the cabbies had no idea where the hotel was, had not heard its name and either couldn't understand my pronounciation of the address or hadn't actually heard of it - though one found it quickly with the GPS and the card from the hotel itself. The entryway is understated, on a back street away from the main drag and near what appears to be a primary school. The entryway and lobby are elegantly appointed, with rich dark colors but without being gloomy thanks to the bright (and somewhat eclectic) lounge area. We were quickly greeted by the person behind the front desk and given our key, a small RFID tag with a big metal-topped tassle that looked like something off an old-style drapery pull. Being on the 7th floor, we elected to take the (fairly small) elevator, which was more than quick enough. All the lights in the small hallways (it appears there are only 4-5 rooms per floor) are motion activated but come on very quickly. The hotel was very quiet, despite it being the middle of the day. On entering our room, we saw that it was very nicely appointed. I'd say the bed was US King sized, and probably just a little big for the room. There was not a ton of closet space, which was fine for our short trip but might be an issue with someone who is staying for an extended period. The room featured an electric safe, a nice sized flat-screen TV with Internet, a mini-bar (with one daily price for any or all of the eight or so beverages in there), and a private bath with elevated shower tub and seperate commode. All three doors were double-thick (entry, bath and commode) and my one possible gripe was no peephole for the entry door. When housekeeping knocked, I had no idea who it was (tired from sixteen hours' travel and weak on my French). Breakfast, at \u20ac14, seemed a bit steep and perhaps a little sparse (continental with scrambled eggs, pretty much), but the hotel is very near several nice places for breakfast. And lunch and dinner as well, by the way! It's also very near a Metro station and with a little study you'll quickly realize how easy it is to get around the city for a few \u20ac! We mostly walked, however, and the hotel was in a nice enough neighborhood that we felt safe around there even late at night. The desk seemed manned at all hours and while there was a key in the lock at the bottom of the glass door, it never seemed to be locked.

Well, all of Paris is cute and romantic, so being that it is located in Central Paris, that is obvious. The hotel is about 5-10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower area itself isn't all that wonderful considering all the other Paris neighborhoods you could be in. But, it was still adorable enough. The best thing about the location is that the metro is 2 minutes away and there are multiple lines. You can go almost anywhere from the station. But, you can also ramble all around by foot - it is close enough to all that Paris has to offer. The best thing about Hotel Ares is the helpful staff and the stylish (although very small) rooms. We booked everything through our hotel, including a quick reservation at Guy Savoy - one of the best restaurants in the world. I was surprised we got in! We had the hotel staff call around to talk to everybody for us because we know very little French. It helped for making all sorts of wonderful reservations! One of the coolest things we did was a romantic Citroen Tour where a cute french man comes and picks you up in a tiny Citroen convertible and drives you around to wherever you want to go, telling you all about things. It is very romantic and lovely! The rooms are very small, but very stylish with nice products. We couldn't really walk around in the room with our luggage out. We would have to roll over the bed at times just to get across. But, alas that is Paris for you. All the rooms are small.

Room is a very good size \u2013 two adults, two suitcases, two small backpacks \u2013 with room to move. Bed was comfortable. Housekeeping made the room up on a daily basis. Room has flat screen tv, safe (fits laptop), minibar (5 euro for one drink or for entire contents!), wardrobe and small writing table. Our room had two balconies (floor to ceiling windows) \u2013 which opened up the space and allowed fresh air. Bathroom was a decent size and modern with a rain shower plus handheld over the bath.

We chose the hotel based on the trip advisor reviews. We booked the hotel with booking.com. We booked a superior room inc. breakfast which cost us 253 Euros in total. Pros: We arrived early at about 11am and we could check in and go to our room straight away which was very nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is decorated nicely. The bathroom was perfect; shower was very powerful \u2013 which we loved! Someone on here also said there is no full length mirror in the room, in our room there was \u2013 it was on the inside wardrobe door, which was good enough for me. The beds were fine in my opinion. However, the mattress is a little hard and if you don\u2019t like that you would probably find the bed uncomfortable. There are a lot of nice restaurants and caf\u00e9s close by and the metro is not far away either. They also offer free wireless internet which was nice! Oh yes, we drove there by car and we could park right outside the hotel for free which was super nice!! Cons: The hotel and rooms are small (but from a Parisian perspective they are probably spacious \u2013 most hotel rooms in Paris are small, also keep in mind that a 4 star hotel in Paris is not the equivalent of staying at a 4 star in London or Dublin) There is no bar and the lounge/ lobby is like a small living room. The location is ok; it is about a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel tower. The breakfast was terrible I do not recommend you to get it. I am an Irish gal and I love my \u201cfry up\u201d and what this hotel offered as a fry up was horrible. Scrambled egg was very rubbery and the sausages were just disgusting (kind of like salami).

(about 4-6 blocks away) Lots of good places to eat, a pharmacy, an ATM (BTW: If you're a BofA customer, look for BNP Paribas in Paris -- they will not charge fees for getting cash), and a small grocery store are all around the corner. Rooms are moderate-to-large for a European hotel (but there is not a lot of closet/storage space). The hotel is pretty quite despite the fact that the first or second floor is being completely renovated (though some hotel guests do slam their doors). The bed and linens are very good. The bathroom with shower (no tub) is plenty big for one person (but a little tight for two. Note: The towel hook is behind the mirror, which is a tad awkward). You can access the Internet in room via a keyboard and the flat screen television. My partner tried and it took him a couple of tries to get the knack of it (I used the computer in the lobby/lounge to print our boarding pass, check e-mail, etc.). I believe the hotel has room service but we didn't use it. We ate breakfast (two mornings) at the hotel and despite the fact it was $16 euros each. Croissants, pastries, turkey \"lunch meat,\" sausage, eggs with cheese, cereal, fruit salad, juice, coffee, hot chocolate -- descent spread, with descent food. The staff is friendly and while all are French, speak English, so no need to have any language concerns (though it would be polite to TRY and speak a little French). All in all, a great place to stay, if you looking for a little boutique hotel that's not stuffy or frilly. In many respects, if felt more like we were staying \"at home,\" versus in a hotel (except that you leave your very large room key -- it also controls the room light (though one of the lights by the bed didn't seem to work) -- at the front desk, and you have to be let in by hotel staff after the sun goes down). I do think the hotel might be a tad expensive (versus what you might get in terms of amenties and services in a US hotel) but the price is not over the top (via Orbits, we paid just over $250 per night include tax).

Just up past the main metro station there is a street with lots of shops, we found this to be less touristy and there were some nice clothes shops especially for young children. The hotel had some nice restaurants nearby and we tended to stay close by rather than take the metro at night. We found a nice Italian which was extremely busy. The Eiffel Tower is a pleasant 5-10 minute walk and we walked that each night after dinner. Paris is expensive and with the strong euro at present it just seemed even worse!

They are generally very positive, in as much as the hotel is very stylish (looked like they'd copied Jaques Garcia's La Reserve in Geneva), very friendly, not absurdly expensive, clean, and well maintained; everything you'd want from a hotel really. However, I think it's let down by the very small rooms and its location. 1st, the room size shouldn't really matter that much if all you're doing is sleeping, but it did feel a little claustrophobic and there is very little hanging space. If you were intending to be there for more than 2 days, and with a partner, there is no space for hanging shirts or dresses. 2nd, while we never found issue with the location because the Metro was so effective, it did feel a little removed. Having gone to St Germain, and walked past the Luxembourg Parc hotel (currently number 3), I think we would have preferred that for the price (based purely on location and how it appeared from the outside). I guess it all depends on what you want to achieve while you're there. If the decor of the hotel is the most important thing, and you want to be walking distance from the Eiffel Tower, this is probably ideal; however, if you prefer some trendy night life a short walking distance from you, i'd probably suggest the Luxembourg or something in that area..A couple of other plusses while i think about it - The free Wifi was excellent, and the 5 euro per day mini bar were appreciated!", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, clean friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "kmgw", "ReviewID": "UR29278856", "Content": "Quiet, clean, friendly hotel.

I'd be a liar if I said that I wasn't concerned about the hotel's location in the 15th arrondissement, because just 3 months ago, I stayed in the hip/chic Saint Germain district. There wasn't much text in travel guides about the 15th, and some friends looked at me like an alien when I said that I was staying in this \"quiet\" district. However, I was looking forward to experiencing a new neighborhood and being further away from tourists. The hotel arranged for inexpensive shuttle transfers for us to and from the airport, which I greatly appreciated. Upon our arrival, everything was seamless. The hotel is on the small-side, but it was decorated very nicely. We took the small elevator up to our 6th floor room, opened the door, and laughed at eachother b/c of its small size (I live in New York City and STILL found it tiny). The room was decorated richly, had a balcony and was perfectly clean. My problems were the following: No hair conditioner or body lotion is provided Breakfast was 16EUR Our shower leaked to the point that it overflowed our bathroom The a/c did not work, so we had to sleep with our balcony door cracked One of the staff (an older male) was incredibly rude and condescending: When I asked about the a/c not working, then about our shower leak, he said, \"I can't wait to see what you complain about tomorrow night!\" The neighborhood is literally a restaurant wasteland Things I liked: Cleanliness Decor Located very close to mass transit 7 min. walk from the Eiffel Tower I suppose I was spoiled when I stayed at the K+K Cayre during my previous trip to Paris.

There is even a playground nearby which our children enjoyed. We didn't eat the hotel's breakfast because we thought 16 Euro per person was too expensive, so I can't comment on that, but there are numerous cafes nearby for breakfast. The hotel is a very nice boutique hotel, but I wouldn't call it a luxury hotel. Certainly not in the same league as something like the George V. One small caveat is that we could pretty easily hear noise from the room next door and our TVs even seemed to work on the same remote, so we had to unplug our TV at night in case our neighbors came in and turned theirs on because it would also turn ours on!

The room was small but this is to be expected for Paris but was still of good size with a king size bed of 180cm wide and great bedding. The bathroom was huge with double sinks, walk in rain shower and separate bath. Versace fittings and wonderful to come home to after walking for 10 hours at the trade fair. Internet was wi-fi and easy to log in to and the rooms all have LCD Bose TV's and all mod cons.... The thing that surprised me about this hotel was that it was only 3 star!!! We never stay in 3 star hotels normally and opt for 5 always but this has the same luxury, comfort of a 5 star. Ok fine you did not have the gym, pool and room service but little else was missing. The mini bar was even semi complimentary with just a nominal charge of 5 euro per day for all of the contents... We will definitely stay in this hotel it is a true designer gem...", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Binnie32", "ReviewID": "UR24096400", "Content": "My bf & I stayed here for a long w/e at the end of January. We had a 'classic room' which was small however it was perfectly suitable for the 2 of us and my huge suitcase! Seeing as one doesn't spend that much time in the hotel room, the size was really not an issue. The room was beautifully decorated and kept spotlessly clean which is far more important to us. The Hotel Getting to the hotel from CDG is pretty straight forward. Get the RER B to Denfert Rochereau and then change here to the Metro (Line 6) to La Motte Picquet - this stop is literally at the end of the road where the hotel is. This journey cost us 16.80 euros each - works out cheaper and quicker than getting a taxi during the day. It is well located within 10 min walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. All the other main sites such as Notre Dame, L'Arc de Triomphe, etc are also within walking distance (provided you're wearing flats!) We only took the Metro to get to Sacre Couer and when we were heading to Pont Neuf for dinner one evening (you can get a 1 day travel card for 6euros). We spent the rest of the time on foot as you get to see more and stumble across lovely cafes, shops, etc that you would otherwise miss. There is wifi available in rooms for free however if you don't have your laptop you can surf the web on the plasma screen TV in your room or there is a MAC in the lounge for guests to use (free). Everything about the hotel is positive apart from a couple of grumbles including minimal hanging space, no mirror anywhere near the hairdryer and no full length mirror - however none of these grumbles would prevent us from wanting to stay here again. If you're in to running as we are then I'd recommend taking your running kit as the hotel is close to the Seine which is lovely to run along side - also a really good way to see the sights! If you're in town on a Sunday then head to the food market that runs all the way down Blvd Grenelle - the most amazing selection of patisserie, deli, fish, etc stalls - makes your mouth water and makes you wish you lived in Paris! Cafes/Restaurants We didn't have b'fast at the hotel as felt it was overpriced however we found a lovely contemporary cafe/patisserie that sells amazing freshly baked Pain aux Raisins, croissants, etc at reasonable prices (2 Pain aux Raisins & 2 coffees for 6euros) - it's located on Boulevard Grenelle (on a street corner) and is called Secco. We ate locally at Le Suffren one evening which was really nice for a local venue. We had Steak Frites and the most amazing Profiteroles I've ever had (one portion looked like enough to feed a family of four so we really struggled to eat it all between the two of us!) We also ate at Kong which is a Philippe Starck restaurant that featured in the last episode of Sex & the City. Although it was funky and a stunning location (high up above Pont Neuf), it was overpriced for what it was as the food wasn't that exceptional. The service was good until we ended up waiting nearly half an hour for pudding, however after mentioning that we felt this was unacceptable to the manager, we were offered 2 complimentary glasses of champagne which was a nice gesture. In general Paris is expensive (esp with the exchange rate being so rubbish at the mo) however you can get good reasonably priced meals (much the same as London) although you can also get completely ripped off so always check prices before going in! So, all in all our Paris experience was a good one and I would definately go back there and stay at the Ares Eiffel again.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bras\u00edlia", "Title": "\u201cDelightful!\u201d", "Author": "Gustavoh", "ReviewID": "UR23940852", "Content": "Not much to add, but I'll try.

At the time of booking, Hotel Ares occupied top rank. Moreover, the room rate was within the group's budget, while mapping the hotel confirmed its central location. Room: The room had attractive state-of-the-art decor. The main problem was the tight room size of about ten square metres (excluding bathroom and lobby). There was absolutely no space for luggage. So this was opened on the bed and then replaced on the floor which made it uncomfortable to manoevre round the bed. Hanging space in the wardrobe was hardlly sufficient for one person. To make matters worse the hair dryer located in that compartment competed for space with hanging clothes. Amenities: An extensive choice of TV channels was available. The internet facility advertised on the Quadriga system turned out to be a joke and effectively unusable in terms of speed and userfriendliness. Service: Reception staff were extremely courteous and helpful. Housekeeping staff were totally inconspicuous, but their performance left nothing to be desired in terms of cleanliness and room turnout. Breakfast: One member of the group tried out the buffet breakfast and reported that the offerring (including eggs only in scrambled mode) was over priced at 15 euro. So we opted for a more varied breakfast for 10 euro at a coffee bar round the corner. General: The central location is indeed a boon. Nearby boulevards Suffren and Motte Piquet are full of shops, restaurants and bars. The Motte Piquet metro station, five minutes away, effectively connects the hotel Ares with the rest of Paris.

I picked Ares Eiffel based on previous reviews (thanks all of you). Last year we stayed at a romantic 4* hotel, in Opera Garnier area, but there are no rooms for families. The Ares location is fabulous, on a quiet street, near the metro station, close vicinity to Eiffel Tower (10 min nice walk on the av. Suffren), 30 min to the Ch de Gaule Airport (45 min during weekdays), 5-6 metro stations to the Galleries Lafayette and Printemps (15 min), 3-4 Batobus stations (25 min) from Notre Dame, 1 h to Disneyland (1 metro + 1 RER). The metro station La Motte Picquet is 1-2 min away from the hotel. There are 2 exits: Village Suisse is closer, but if you want to buy Paris visite tickets you must got to the other one. There are 3 or 4 metro lines connecting to different areas. You cannot ask for more! On Saturday 25 th Oct. there was an antiques market on the street, under the metro bridge. We didn\u2019t know about it! So pitoresque and surprising! Quite an experience! The Eiffel Tower is indeed very close to the hotel (better avoid visit the tower on weekends) and the top can be seen around the corner. In front of the tower, accros the street, you can fiind the Batobus station. We decided to take Batobus instead of Bateauxmouches or anything else because it really is like a bus and if my son would not enjoy the ride we could descend in one of the 8 stops. You can buy a ticket and travel all day long, getting on and off whenever you like. We booked a triple room, large by Paris standards, with a 1.80 m x 2 m comfortable bed, 4 pillows (2 soft and 2 firm) and an uncomfortable expandable armchair. Furniture is nice and looks new, the TV is an ok Bang & Ollufsen, the windows are large but you must keep it cover because of the wind blowing trough. The bathroom is practical (2 sinks, 1 shower, 1 bathtub, windows), incredible large, but incredible smelly and cold!!! Cleanliness was a little bit desapointing chapter: we stayed 5 days but they never change sheets. We moved a little the sofa bed and we saw a lot of dust, as they never use the vacuum cleaner in that corner. I expected to have more amenities and the used ones to be replaced. The elevator is not as tiny as in other Parisian hotels (it is enough room for two adults, one child, two big suitcases and a small one!), but is the only one and that is not enough. Stairs are narrow and round (winding). Breakfast is expensive, but poor, so you could choose one of the many bistros on the av. La Motte Picquet. Frontdesk is ok, helpful, childfrendly attitude. Check in was fast, check out too. The night staff should learn to answer to somebody\u2019s bon soir! They have few nice umbrellas you can borough if it is raining. If you want to have lunch or dinner in the hotel area, there are plenty o f restaurants and bistros on the av. La Motte Picquet and av. Suffren.

We got to the hotel from CDG Airport, by train/metro in about one hour, after getting a \"Carte Orange\" travel pass in the RAPD/RER sales desk in Terminal 2. The nearest stop is La Motte Picquet-Grenelle, about 200m from the hotel. The hotel is located on a quiet side street, off the busy Boulevard de Grenelle. The location is excellent, eg. only a 15mins. walk from the Eiffel Tower. There are many restaurants and shops nearby, including all the usual department chain stores located on Rue de Commerce, such as H&M, Monoprix, Promod, Sara, Pimkie, Celio, Gap, Etam, etc.. In addition there is a supermarket, \"Le March\u00e9 Franprix\" on Avenue de Motte-Picquet. We arrived at 6pm. Our check-in went smoothly. The boutique hotel theme hits one immediately. We stayed in room 32 for the four nights. There were four of us, i.e. my wife, two teenage children and myself. The room felt small for the four of us. The bathroom too was small. The decor was nice however, and very up to date. Versace tiling etc.. One strange thing was that there were some flies in the room. Both my wife and son, woke up after the first night's sleep with multiple insect bites. I swatted all the flies subsequently. The flies may have come in via the air-conditioning system, or the window, which was a little loose and not double glased. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, as we suspected that it was too expensive at \u20ac15 per person. We found an excellent boulangerie chain outlet at 10 Rue de Commerce, called \"Brioche Doree - Le Fournil de Pierre\", opposite the H&M and Sara stores, only 250m from the hotel. Its breakfast was only \u20ac3.90, and included an orange juice, a croissant with jam, and a coffee. Before we found this, we also tried \"Le Bouquet de Grenelle\" across from the Metro stop on the corner of Boulevard de Grenelle and Avenue de Motte-Picquet. It worked out at \u20ac10 per person minimum. There were many restaurants in the area, eg. French, Indian, and Italian. There was also a MacDonalds and a Pizza Hut. We tried only one, \"Le Suffren\" (about 250m in the Eiffel Tour direction, at 84 Avenue de Suffren), as we were on the move each night. It was okay. All in all, we found it a nice hotel, well centered, and nicely decorated, but expensive.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cUnknown expectation\u201d", "Author": "DustyDaveAuckland", "ReviewID": "UR21438238", "Content": "We didnt know what to expect because of mixed reviews.

Our budget did not allow for more than 310.00 per night - we were willing to pay that much for a nice room in Paris - for less in Paris you'd get a 2 star hotel at most. We usually stay at 4-5 star hotels, but in Paris the budget had to be reduced to 3 stars because we simply refuse to pay 500 or more Euros per night for a four-five star hotel in Paris! The Ares Eiffel is lovely and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The hotel would be FOUR stars if it was larger and had a full service restaurant. I prefer the three stars for the price and eat elsewhere! The Ares was lovely. Felt like a smaller boutique hotel. Up to date. Not old and stuffy. The weekend receptionist is overly kind!!! The night staff, a gentleman, is very shy and doesn't speak much - not even to say bon soir. That could be improved. You have to leave your keys when you go out and you have much contact with the reception. The metro is about a minute walking distance from the hotel. The Caf\u00e9 Suffren was around the corner and very good (both service and food). The Cafe Garnelle has a Crepe guy on the street and is very very kind- and has the best crepes! We did those for breakfast often. Hotel breakfast at 15 Euros buys you coffee and bread, basically. The crepes are 3.50 and very filling. Full Breakfast in the area can be around 8-12 Euros.

The position of the hotel is not the most picturesque, being in a back street about 1/2 mile from the Eiffel Tower but the hotel itself is superb. As other reviews I have read have said, the rooms, like in most city hotels, are not large but they are finished to the highest standard. It looks as though the hotel has been completely refitted not just a paint job. Everything from the tiles on the walls to the furniture and the linen looked brand new. Everything worked perfectly in the bathroom and the separate toilet, from the large rain shower to the twin washbasins, and the B&O TV was fine, except that there were only two English channels - BBC Prime, showing endless repeats of 'The Family' etc., and CNN news. The bed was reasonably large and very comfortable, although the pillows presented the usual problem of one was too little, two were too much. The only criticism we have of the room is the size of the wardrobe/closet for hanging your clothes. It is tiny - around a foot wide with only three hangers in it (take some of your own). There are also some shelves, a small fridge and a safe built in as well so we could only take a few shirts etc. out at a time to hang up. The area around the hotel had many restaurants and a supermarket and the Metro station (La Motte Picquet Grenelle) around the corner was on three different lines and was very convenient - we went everywhere on the Metro, very cheaply (the only thing that was cheap in Paris!). We thought EUR15 was expensive for breakfast before we got there but we looked around the local restaurants and whilst you could find cheaper options, they generally only included juice, a croissant and a pastry for about EUR9 or 10. The hotel buffet included (very good) fresh fruit, toast, fresh juice, yoghurt, cereals etc. as well as croissants and pastries, so was much better value.

The hotel is very kid friendly, and we got free internet through the TV and wireless as well (try that in a big hotel). The breakfasts are expensive (like anywhere in Europe) but of high quality. The small dining area can get crowded so you may have to wait a few minutes to get a seat in the morning (they have a nice adjoining reading room). One of the best things we found as a family was that they had a deal going where you could take all the juice and water in the minibar for a flat rate per day ($5 Euro I think). This saved us countless Euros during the day. We had two very well appointed rooms and beautifully decorated. Not large by any standard, but we were not in the rooms often or for a long time. The larger of the rooms comfortably accomodated Grandma and the two kids (one on a \"pull out bed\" chair).

After combing through TripAdvisor, the Ares looked promising and I decided to give it a try for a night or two of my 6-night stay. (I like variety). I can appreciate small Parisian hotels for their charm, but usually I manage to snag a good corporate rate at one of the major chains such as Hilton, Westin, or Hyatt which tend to offer more amenities, so to be fair, the 3-star Ares, no matter how pristine, was probably not going to live up to my usual 4-star experiences. The current exchange rate between the $USD and the euro is hard to swallow, so was it worth $400 a night? My first impression was not great, because I arrived late at night, the door was locked and it took repeated ringing of the bell and knocking to rouse the night attendant. I was grateful my taxi driver waited those moments with me, otherwise I would have been a single woman on a dark street by herself. I do speak French, so what follows is translated\u2026The night attendant said something along the lines of \u201cWe didn\u2019t think you were going to show up\u201d. I think it\u2019s my business what time I arrive, especially for a room for which I\u2019ve prepaid (one night deposited was required on their website), and it\u2019s his business to answer the door promptly! Even though I was traveling alone, I had decided to book the Superior double at 260 euros/night when I could have booked a standard single at 230. I think that was a good decision, because I sure would not have wanted the room (#16) to be any smaller. I expect Parisian hotel rooms to be relatively small. What bothered me is that when you visit their website and click on Superior room, it shows a bright corner room with 2 big windows. I got a small dark room with one window. When I saw the room, I was convinced they had given me a standard room by mistake. The night attendant was not qualified to answer any of my questions. I would think the person on duty should at least have been able to say with confidence what type of room it in fact was. He seemed perplexed that I didn\u2019t like to room, and could offer no further assistance as it was simply the room the day shift assigned to me. The hotel was full, so there was no choice in rooms at that late hour. At least he was able to provide me the internet access code and I was appreciative of the free internet. The other great deal of this hotel is that you can take as much as you want from the minibar for only a 5 euro per day fee, but note it only contains water and soda. The bed was large, a queen or maybe even a king. It was comfortable enough, however if the sheets had been a little softer and the pillows feather rather than synthetic, I would have been much more impressed. The other thing that bothered me was there was no place to put my luggage. I had to put it on the only chair and then had nowhere to sit but the bed. I would think it would be in the hotel\u2019s interest to provide a simple luggage rack rather than having people throw their bags on the new furniture. The air conditioning worked well. There was no iron & ironing board in the room, but the next morning when I called for one it was promptly delivered. The room was very clean-immaculate dark wood floor and stylishly tiled bathroom with double sinks, a bathtub with rainshower and Hermes amenities. These quality elements are what drew me to the hotel in the first place. Considering the bathroom was a design element of the room, I was particularly disappointed that there was insufficient hot water. I don\u2019t mean it ran out, it was just was not hot enough. At that point I was exasperated and decided I was going to check out as long as I could find a decent rate for a 4-star which I did. When I checked out (at least they didn\u2019t give me a problem about checking out early) the owner asked me about my stay and expressed great concern when I mentioned the lack of hot water. He seemed caring and responsive and said he\u2019d check into it. I also asked to see a twin room, which turned out to be the spitting image of the Superior room pictured online-the bright corner room with 2 windows that I was looking for. It also had a larger bathroom. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel so I can\u2019t comment on that. The hotel is located in a classy neighborhood and it\u2019s nice and quiet. It\u2019s near the metro and especially near the Eiffel Tower, so if you are perhaps on your first trip to Paris I think you\u2019d be impressed that it\u2019s only a short walk away. One could definitely do worse for the price.

I was not certainly not dissapointed!! Upon arriving at this hotel after taking some time to find it (nearest metro station is Dupleix which we discovered after a long walk) we were greeted by some people doing a designer photo shoot of the lobby area, it was that chic. Although the room was small, which is not uncommon in Paris, our room was stylish, modern and yet still aired a traditional Parisian feel. The room was clean and luxurious, even down to the bathroom tiles! The room had most things you'd need, a small mini bar, a safe in the room and a flat screen TV for watching those bizarre late night French movies. The bathroom was small again but perfectly formed with its marbled sinks and designer tiling. The shower was heaven and you were fully catered for with small toiletries and a hairdryer. The staff were very friendly and helpful, albeit a little aloof on occasions. Breakfast was good, a simple continental occasion with yoghurts, pain au chocolates, crossiants, cereals, juices, coffees etc. The one thing that impressed me the most though was how quiet the hotel was. Not on one occasion did we hear another guest or hear a lift buzzing or a door banging. The only dissapointment Id say was that we expected a room with a view of the tower and although we got a view of the tower it was only the top half and the rest was obscured by buildings. Still, we did have a small balcony we could stand (not sit) out on and share a glass of french red wine and look up at the tower all lit up. Quite romantic. We loved this hotel and feel it was worth every penny. We'd stay again for sure!!", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Ares Eiffel\u201d", "Author": "TXtraveller54", "ReviewID": "UR20155712", "Content": "Incredible hotel in a charming area of Paris.

We found it on Trip Advisor after much research, and were definitely not disappointed. The hotel looks exactly like the pictures on the website: chic, modern 'hotel' decor, very stylish but no precious antiques etc. The beds are firm-comfortable, pillows down soft but hypoallergenic. The rooms, though small, are imaculately clean with dark wood floors and super modern stylish bathrooms with a good shower - the space saving bath is a bit tight if you are bigger than average or tall. We had a standard double room which was fine for two and the Bang and Olufsen tv with free internet access was useful for local research, although all tv stations are in French except CNN. The aircon is efficient and quiet. In fact this is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed all around the world from fleapits in London to five star resorts in the US to the Stormont in Belfast. The hotel is hard to find if you rely on local maps as Rue du General - Larminat isn't on any of them. Make sure you get a detailed local map (Google?) before you go, or ask for La Village Suisse, a collection of 150 antique and art shops which most people know. At the edge of this area you can see the hotel sign and indeed the road name. The hotel is in 15th Arrondissment, a quiet area, but its very easy to get around from here. La Motte Picquet -Grenelle metro is just around the corner and Champ de Mars rer station about ten minutes walk away, next to the Seine. We used the RER to transfer from CDG airport and found it easy and relatively quick - about an hour with changes on the way back - a bit longer if your train is not a direct service and makes all the stops. transfer costs 8 euros each way per person. A few minutes up the river at the Eiffel tower is the Batobus river shuttle - a pleasant way to get around the city on a nice day, but at 11 euros for a one day pass it's cheaper and more versatile / quicker to buy a metro carnet pack of tickets. The staff speak good English if you need it and are helpful and polite. We didn't try the breakfast at the hotel as we wanted to get out and try other places so can't comment on the quality but the price is high in comparison with other local options. We enjoyed breakfast most at a salon du the just down the road with a stunning array of pastries and good coffee. Local restaurants - avoid La Pierrot it is cheap but poor quality. La Gauloise has excellent food in the traditional French style with very pleasant helpful staff - although ours spoke only French he tried with a dictionary when my tourist French ran out of steam over the less obvious dishes on the menu. I had sot l'y laisse (its chicken - I had to look it up!!) with white truffle risotto and it was divine. Followed by an assortment of desserts 'Assiette Gauloise' which was lovely but made me want to go back and try the larger versions of the tiny sampling portions. The chocolate mousse is very well made.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "tenorone", "ReviewID": "UR19949777", "Content": "We had a very nice stay -- the staff was very helpful and nice.

If you have an extended stay and want to take a break from french food then please try Goldini's Italian Restaurant just around the corner. The staff here was very friendly and spoke good english. The pasta was delcious. Also, if you are staying during the weekend, check out the local farmers market on Sunday morning located under the metro track around the corner.

The room was small, but nice. I loved the wood floors-it seems so much more clean than icky carpet. The bathroom was small, but the shower was actually pretty nice. Bring your own washcloth and soaps and shampoos though. We ended up using a hand towel as a substitute for a washcloth, and also ended up buying emergency soaps at the grocery store as the hotel's soaps were like cologne. Very pungent. The air conditioning in the room was wonderful (I wasn't expecting European ac to be very effective). One night the ac didn't work at all for about 6 hours, but then miraculously came back on. We had huge windows that opened onto a little patio so there was the option of leaving the doors open too for a little fresh air. The street noise was almost nonexistent except for garbage trucks and the occasional passerby. Towards the end of our six nights we finally noticed we had a view of the Eiffel tower. It wasn't very dramatic, but we could see from the upper observation deck to the top. Pretty cool! You aren't going to be any closer to the metro either-it's right around the corner. All in all, we really loved the hotel and the location. If you want a cheaper stay though, my sister was one metro stop away down by Rue Cler (which has lots of good food choices) at the Mugeut Hotel. The room was smaller and the bathroom miniscule, but it was clean, had a great breakfast sunroom and nice ambience all around. We ate at her hotel as we didn't feel the 15 Euros for a continental breakfast was worth it. Her hotel charged 9 Euros for breakfast and included all the continental fixings plus omelets made fresh.

Moving on to the actual review, we arrived here on the 4th August at around 9.30 AM, and check in (if I remember correctly) was at 12 PM. We had booked a deluxe room (for 4), a triple room (for 3) and a double room (for 2). The deluxe room was ready which was a bit of a surprise, and the other two rooms required a little more time. As a result, all 9 of us went into the deluxe room, placed our luggage in there and freshened up after having to wake up at 1 AM in the morning to catch our 5 AM Eurostar journey to Paris. The deluxe room wasn't tiny (and neither were the triple and double rooms) but neither was it spacious. With all our luggage in the the deluxe room (9 peoples worth), there was still some room to move around in. The beds were truly comfortable (which was a great advantage as we spent 3 days in Paris and we had to rush to fit everything in therefore we were burnt out by the end of each day), the room decor was excellent and the bathroom was very classy too. They also do a continental breakfast buffet i.e. croissants, pain au chocolat, cornflakes, turkey slices, yoghurt etc. which was 15 euros per person. The breakfast room's decor was also very well done, although the room was smallish. There was a member of staff present, restocking the fresh juices and foods, and she was also very helpful and cheerful. The receptionists (changes in the morning and evenings) were very cheerful and helpful, which was excellent. On two occasions, we got back to the hotel past midnight and the hotel was locked. We knocked and the night time receptionist happily allowed us in. It's also worthy of note that there is an elevator which goes up and down to all floors.

This hotel was located in a great area, not to close to the hustle and bustle but close enough to be only a couple of stops on the Metro from anywhere we wanted to go. The hotel is beautiful, modern inside the rooms and very clean. The only criticism I have is that they said they had a single suite that would fit 4 adults ( my wife and I and our two adult daughters ) but the room was clearly not big enough for 4 adults with virtually no room to walk around the room . Compared to our stay in the other 6 hotels recommended by Trip advisor the service at the front desk was OK but not outstanding as was the case with the other Hotels we stayed at.

We had got a good deal on an Executive Room which was a beautiful room and looked very luxurious; the bed was huge and the bathroom was large with a fantastic shower. The room itself wasn't huge, so I wouldn't like to think how small the cheaper rooms are. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, instead we thought it would be better value for money to go to one of the many local cafe's for our morning coffee and croissants. There was no parking at the hotel, instead they have some sort of deal with a local supermarket that has an underground car park which we could use for 11 euros a day. We left the bike there for 3 nights and it didn't come to any harm, although it seems most people abandon motorbikes on the pavements in little groups, so in future, I wouldn't bother reserving a parking space and instead do as the Parisians do... it'd be a lot cheaper! The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. We didn't have any problem with room noise or road noise, as other people seemed to have experienced. The hotel is only about a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower which looks stunning when all lit up at night. Turn left out of the hotel for the closest metro; the metro system is very efficient and good value for money. Restaurant recommendation - Le Train Bleu at Gare de Lyon train station. Ignore the fact that this is at a train station - the restaurant is about 100 years old and has a fantastic menu with some excellent food and wine and very attentive, professional service. All in all, our experience was well above that of a regular 3 star hotel in Paris and I would definitely return.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLovely Room\u201d", "Author": "Mondave", "ReviewID": "UR17833137", "Content": "Room was beautifully appointed.

Location: Having not been to Paris in 10 years, we had no idea what location to chose and were advised that Opera and Saint Germain were better options because there is great buzz in those places.I have to agree I loved the narrow streets and bustle of Saint Germain and the cute little bars and restaurants but we were 100% satisified with the location we chose. The hotel is situated just off Rue de Grenelle,5 mins walk from Ecole Militaire and 10mins max from Eiffel tower.What we loved about the hotels location was that it was a very residential and local area - so you really got the feel of staying in proper Paris with little restaurants and bakeries full of locals and not too many tourists around. Hotel: We were there for a few nights so picked the cheapest room which was 200eur a night (I'm told this is good for a nice hotel in Paris).The room, as expected was tiny, but beautifully done up and the bathroom was a nice size. The size of the bedroom didn't bother us at all was we were out all day. Very nice flat screen tv with free internet which was great for looking up places to go etc. Although the decor of the hotel was lovely, the atmosphere was almost non existant - there was a small open room inside the main door with books and comfy couches but you'd never really sit there.Reception staff were helpful and friendly but we had very little contact with them and really just spent our stay going straight to room and leaving it, with no interaction with hotel. It was nearly like we were renting a little apartment - there was no bar/place where you'd see other guests. We didn't really mind this as were gone all day anyway and out again at night but if you were looking for a hotel with good bar/buzz I wouldn't pick this one. Didn't have breakfast based on tripadvisor reviews - instead we stopped every morning in a boulangerie around the corner and had breakfast on the go which was always delicious. We are not massive fans of all french food so one of the nights we went to Goldinis restaurant which was recommended by another tripadvisor reviewer. It's an Italian restaurant just down the road from the hotel and we loved it.

There was no where to put my case for packing or unpacking except for on the bed. That was Ok for unpacking, but for packing it was an inconvenience. I stayed three nights, I used all of the tiny bottle of complimentary Hermes shower gel on the first night and it was never replenished. There appears to be no provision to get a cup of coffee in your room in the morning instead of going downstairs and paying 15 Euros for a basic continental breakfast. Admittedly I did not ask, but then again there was nothing in my room on the information sheet to indicate that any sort of room service is available. I am not a mean or penny pinching person, but felt that the price of the breakfast was a little steep for what was on offer.
