Being a Seattle native and UW alum, I've wanted to try the College Inn for years. I was thus so very inclined to like this place -- but came away with a combination of anger, disappointment, and the decision not to return. Here's why: --This place is not clean where it matters. The blanket on my bed STANK of some other person's perfume or deoderant -- very distinctive, not an aftersmell of detergent. If they wash the blankets at all, they don't do a very good job. --The shower drain was badly plugged up, so that within a few seconds I was standing in my own wastewater, which, of course, then sloshes together with the remains of other people's showers -- ugh, I don't want to go on thinking about that.... --I was promised a double room and received a twin room (two twin beds). This was after having booked well ahead of time and getting both a phone and email confirmation of this. They were completely full and since we were staying for only one night, I have a strong suspicion that we were given whatever was left over. I also know that they had switched rooms on us at some late point b/c I had received a call from Chris, the manager, giving me the room number and telling me that since we were arriving late in the p.m. to get buzzed up and just go straight to that room which would be unlocked. On arrival I found that the door was locked (I probably disturbed whoever was there by trying the knob), and I had to buzz the staff who live upstairs to let me into the room that they had set aside for me -- a different one from what I was originally promised. --The next morning, when I mentioned the room switch, the manager did not at all appear surprised or concerned. He said that it should not have happened but his statement that it \"shouldn't\" happen again was not at all convincing. --Website is dishonest: under Parking it says, \"Saturday and Sunday free parking one-half block away on a space-available basis.\" When I called to get directions to this free parking area I was told that it is between 42nd and 43rd on Brooklyn -- which is more like 5 blocks away from the inn. We're walkers, so NBD, but this seems to me to be indicative of a tendency to paint a rosier picture than what actually exists. --Having had a difficult day of travel and getting only 5 hours of sleep, the next morning I made the error of leaving a clothing item in the room. Two days later, I realize that it is missing and I work hard to follow up with the staff there to locate it. I leave a message, call back when I don't get the courtesy of a return call, stop by in person to inquire, speak with \"Joe\" (I think that was his name) as well as Dean. I get a couple of assurances that I will receive a call back -- they say they have to check with housekeeping. Even with my repeated calls, including an angry final call that got me the assurance that Chris would call me back the next day, nobody ever bothered to phone me, even to tell me that the item went missing. My guess is that this has happened before, so no big deal from their perspective, and that in my case the housekeeping staff knew someone who could use my clothing item. The only positive comment I will make is a heartfelt one -- but it isn't about the Inn, it's about the College Inn Pub downstairs. The place is friendly and has an excellent choice of ales. Scruffy and real, if you are a beer enthusiast and are after authenticity instead of hype and polish, I would really recommend the Pub.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGood Cheap place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Chrisfs", "ReviewID": "UR10067395", "Content": "I was there last year, I was on a budget and it was a very decently priced place.

We already knew that it was a dorm-style establishment with a shared bathroom down the hall, so we came prepared with our own robes and shower shoes. Our major problem with the Inn was that my husband had been told when he made the reservation that it would be possible to check in before 3 p.m. The website states that no one is in the office until then and the front door is locked; visitors must be buzzed in to check in and are then given a key to the front door. As I said, we were told that they could make arrangements for us to check in early. We arrived at the Inn around 12:30 p.m., luggage in tow and exhausted, only to find that no one was there. We tried buzzing and calling but there was no answer. We drug our luggage into the tiny cafe downstairs and had a bite to eat and then sat on a bench for a while until we saw someone inside the entryway to the Inn. Lucky for us that we saw them, as we were allowed to stow our luggage in the office for a few hours, but we still couldn't check in until 3 p.m. I understand that that is their stated policy, but they should not have told us that we could get in earlier if it wasn't true. So be warned, do not expect to get into the building before 3 p.m., no matter what they tell you!!! My only other gripes with the Inn were minor. While there was a small chest of drawers in our room, there were very few hangers and no closet. They could definitely stand to have some more hangers available. Also, there is one shared ironing board and iron that is kept upstairs; you have to go up to the 4th floor lounge/office and ask for it. The iron was ancient and completely empty. The room itself, however, was fine. The bed was no more or less comfortable than any other standard hotel bed. The sink in the room was definitely helpful, since the bathroom down the hall could get a little crowded depending on the time of day. The continental breakfast was great, definitely better than any standard breakfast at a major hotel chain. And from what I saw, the staff was very helpful in assisting travelers navigate their way around the city or suggesting things to see. We heard other travelers complaining about noise, but we didn't experience any of the problems with loud neighbors or noise from the pub downstairs. For our needs, the College Inn served us well.

The room was noisy from street traffic (we had room 208, street facing, second floor, so we were neither over the restaurant nor the bar, nor\u2014and, important fact here\u2014the high rise construction on the back end of the hotel.). There was a 1\u201d gap under our door that was a little disconcerting. The front lobby and the stairway had carpet that was well worn and with some interesting stains; the check in area and the breakfast area are in the attic area on the fourth floor\u2014more than a little challenge for our out of shape bones to hike up to.

Keep in mind that this is next to the college and all that it entails regarding parking. I ended up parking in one place, and wisely moving the car late that evening to something that was away from the construction but nonetheless required getting up to feed the meter at 8 a.m. Food in the area was not bad, though college oriented--cheap and filling, the cuisine leaning into Thai, pizza and hamburgers for the most part. Probably the most important question: Would we stay there again? Lordy, I hope not, but if you need a cheap room in a safe area and can swing with the issues that I have mentioned, it is a very acceptable place. The hotels in Seattle, as you probably know if you are considering the College Inn, are more than a little spendy.

Not your everyday hotel... and definitely very european with the set up of the place.", "Date": "December 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cVery cool!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4157170", "Content": "The staff and location of this hotel is great.

It looked like a really cute place to stay from the outside. Initially I thought great and I thougth the people were friendly. When she placed me in the small dorm like room, I thought fine. The first thing I noticed was there was no nob on the heater and no working phone. Luckily I had my cell. I didnt mind at first because she would give me the room for 40.00 because the phone didnt work. I thought well this is a good deal. I then found out we had an upexpected not paying guest who was sleeping and eating in the house. I felt unsafe. They delt with that issue and I commend them for that. They gave me another room on the second floor above the bar and I felt safer the next night. But my room cost more because it had two beds but I didnt ask for this room. Also, this building is a non smoking building , but that has nothing to do with the fact that the smoke from the bar downstairs leaks into this room and I dont know about other rooms. I felt sick in the am the next two days. When I approached her about this , she didnt want to accomodate me. I moved again to the third floor after two nights in that room because she needed the room for someone else. This new room on the third floor had one double bed so I moved all my stuff again to the third floor. Now I just wanted a little holiday in Seattle. The room on the third floor was 313. It too had problems because it was so noisy. Outside the room was a some type of fan which was so loud. It was so difficult to sleep. One good thing about this place was the continental breakfast although you have to walk a one or two flights of stairs depends on which floor you stay on. I enjoyed the fruit, toast, bagels, and cream cheese breakfast.

Yes, the rooms are spartan, but they have an old fashioned charm with their soft colors, antique furniture and big window seats looking out down the \"Ave.\" The shared bathrooms are spotless, feature two showers and toilets each and I have never had to wait. There are sinks in each room which helps a lot. The best feature of the guest house is the fabulous location which puts you in the middle of the University scene and within a few steps of bus service to downtown or Wallingford. Also outstanding is the big continental breakfast and beverage service all day.
