They had little toys for the children and were able to answer multiple questions. The room was small but had everything we would need, including a Nescafe coffee brewer. The hotel was clean and safe, and located right on the bus line, near the metro in Sevres. I stayed there because it was close to a friend's house, but I don't think I would stay there if I wanted to tour Paris. It's about a 15 minute walk to the metro, then a 30 minute ride to the center of paris. Breakfast bar was great and had a lot of choices. It was included in our rate.

Hence the week-end offer (\"City Break\") was extended to the Wednesday and Thursday nights with free breakfast. As usual with Novotel, children stay for free. Our room was slightly bigger than the usual \"superior\" (which really means \"standard\"), which was adequate for a family of four (the sofa bed could take 2 + 1 people). It faced the courtyard. That made the four-night stay good value for money. The choice for breakfast is reasonable and certainly wider than at the average independent three-star hotel. For instance salmon was out, but pancakes / actimel / smoothies were in. The staff at the bar and at the reception was overall very helpful - bar one particular irritating incident when the breakfast waiter forcedly sought to impose on us to sit at a table for six even though we were two families of seven in total. We were told that it was \"up to him\" to decide where we should be sitting. The Manager or Supervisor later apologised. The hotel is clearly situated off-centre and a ten-minute walk from the terminal tube station on the line number 9. This was fine by us - we looked for value for money - but may not suit \"romantic strollers\". From there, you'll reach the centre of Paris (St Germain/ Notre Dame) within 20' - 30', and the West (Trocadero / Eiffel Tower) within 15'. The area is adjacent to a wealthy district and feels very safe. We parked overnight in the street. Day-time on-street parking may be an issue, particularly if you play by the rule - e.g. feed regularly the parking meter. A parking fine for overstaying your time is \u20ac11 and my personal observation is that you have less than 10% of chance to get fined in any one day. Cars don't get clamped for metering offences. The hotel is 15' away by car from a large commercial centre (\"Velizy\" and \"Velizy 2\", the Brit equivalent to Bluewater although a bit more dated). Galeries Lafayettes, Printemps, Decathlon, etc,.. are there. You can also fill you boot before you journey back home with a large selection of wine at Auchan (closes at 10.00pm on weekdays). The hotel is also on the way to Versailles and its palace and to the wonderfull drive-in zoo of Thoiry. In conclusion, this hotel is good value for money for families, particularly if you come with a game plan and know your way around with the tube. I will recommend it to like-minded friends.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot as nice as expected\u201d", "Author": "AAM17", "ReviewID": "UR100735216", "Content": "Looking at the pictures on line was miss leading. the rooms looked new and modern online, but when i got to my room it was not what the pictures looked like at all. my room was old and not what i was expecting. i am pretty sure there was newer lookin rooms in the hotel though. there was only 1 computer for all the guests.

Windows can be fully open to get some fresh air, but you get the noise of the busy streeet in front of the hotel. My experience with the restaurant is that the service is pretty quick by French standards, but the menu is limited. It is fine if you are on business and just want a quiet night in the hotel but you would not travel to this place just to eat!

As we got out of the Metro, we needed to walk another 5-10 minutes to reach the hotel. The property turned out to be a pleasant surprise, because it was bright and airy and the front desk staff were friendly and spoke English quite well. The room was large (1 bedroom suite w/ 2 large LCD tvs, a king sized bed and a sofa bed) and very clean. The hot breakfast buffet was also quite good, with a choice of breads, fruit, sausages, scrambled eggs, yoghurt, and even rice porridge for a few days. After exploring a little further, we found convenience stores and restaurants about another 10 minutes away and the locale was quiet and safe.
