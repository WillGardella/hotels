Our room was pleasant, well presented and maintained, but while both the room and bathroom were clean, neither were particularly large. The bathroom, though small was relatively newly renovated and the shower pressure very good. We spent little time in the room - after all we were in Paris! Breakfast was quite adequate (good even) with fresh, fruit salad, a couple of cereal choicees, bread rolls, croissant, brioche, cold meat, cheese, yoghurt and juice. Our only complaint would be that we found the staff to be aloof and not always very friendly. That said, we would stay there again for the location and overall value for money.

The bathroom had been recently refurbished, there was a safe, free wifi and for those who need it, air conditioning. It was more than adequately heated the weekend we were there, which happened to be unseasonably warm, or as things look now probably seasonally warm, global warming taken into account. The breakfast was decent with yogurts, several cheeses, ham, coffee with hot milk or without, you choose, real juice, several types of bread, regular sized croissants and pain chocolat, (not the usual over-sized type, neither of which I sampled so cannot attest to their quality). The breakfast room is pleasant a with a large television that thankfully, only played a screen saver. The one criticism I'd have of the breakfast room is that stylish though the chairs were, they were too low for the tables and the stools were a tad small for regular-sized butts but not of course for the pert little butts everyone aspires to. Staff were helpful. Rooms were clean. Breakfast personnel worked hard to keep up and spoke English. A good solid bed with no street noise with the window closed.

The hotel is very comfortable for all the reasons other reviewers mentioned -- clean and comfortably sized rooms and bathrooms (for Paris), good breakfast, polite staff, surprisingly quiet for being one or two blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, etc. Check for last minute deals on their website. Those prices are for stays later that week or next week and can be a signficant savings, especially over several days. The location is fabulous. With good weather, comfortable shoes, and lots of time, we walked to the Tour Eiffel, Louvre, Notre Dame, Jardin Luxembourg, and places in between (e.g. window shopping down George V, Rue de Rivoli, Rue du Fauberg St. Honore, etc). It's very easy to walk out to the Champs Elysee in the evenings to join in on the people watching and window shopping. And our picture of the Arc de Triomphe lit up at dusk is one of our favorite pictures. Transportation is very convenient from here with the metro station nearby and the Air France airport bus stop a block or two away. We arrived in Paris via Gare du Nord. The taxi ride for the two of us with our two suitcases came out to almost 30 euros. I'm not sure if that's the right price as the taxi drove north a bit and then came down towards the hotel. Maybe it's to avoid the traffic near the Champs Elysee. (Or maybe the ride seemed longer than necessary because of the angry and offensive rap music the taxi driver was playing.) There are various restaurants, little shops and bakeries nearby. We had trouble finding a boulangerie and grocery stores serving locals at local prices like we found in other parts of Paris.

The biggest benefit for me was the accessibility to Metro Station which is just a few yards from the hotel, I was able to see many parts of Paris and at the same time was able to come back to the hotel take rest and then venture out again. Another plus point was the staff fluency in English and their helpful nature. Staff provided all help in guiding me for travel spots and restaurants. I will be always grateful to them to help identify two Indian Restaurant which are very nearby \u201cSantoor\u201d and \u201cRath\u201d. Both restaurants are good for great Indian Food.

My colleague was right on all fronts. The hotel is located a long block from the Arc de Triomphe. It is where the Air France bus (Bus number 2 to Arc de Triomphe) from the airport dropped me off so I only had to walk a long block to reach my hotel. I also had the option to take the RER/Metro, which is also conveniently located by the hotel (the M1 line will take you down to the Louvre, Palias Royal, and Bastille, the M6 line will take you towards the Eiffel Tower, both a 10-15 min train ride). Once settled, exploring began and it is wonderful to walk an 2 blocks to find yourself at the top of the Champs Elysee. The room is clean and small. I, personally, do not have a problem with small rooms however, a larger individual may find the rooms uncomfortable, including the beds which tend to be on the shorter side. The first room I stayed in had a bath tub so if you prefer showers, you should ask before checking in or as you check in. There is a television in the room with cable (the BBC is my friend) and a telephone. The key, like every other hotel in France, is unique and the front desk requires you to leave it whenever you leave the hotel. Just don't forget your room number. In conclusion, if the price works for you, you should stay at the Hotel Astrid. The location is its main advantage but it didn't hurt that they had clean, abeit small rooms and really nice staff.

The smallish hotel is located on perhaps the quietest of the 12 avenues (spokes) that radiate out from the Arc de Triomphe \"star\" in the 17th arr. The hotel is one long block (slightly uphill) from the Arc, which is where the metro (Charles de Gaulle/Etoile station) is located. Not too bad. The hotel and room were very clean with a modern bathroom including hairdryer. Free WiFi was terrific for my boyfriend. The staff was very helpful. We ran out of the thin continental toilet paper one day, called down to the lobby, and a roll was delivered to our door within 10 minutes. A pretty good continental breakfast was included each day. Fresh brewed coffee and tea, fresh orange juice (I believe blood orange), several cereals, several pastries including croissants, pain au chocolat, boiled ham, and a rather fatty salami(?). This was served in a modern breakfast room which was an extension of the lobby. Also included were 2 tickets for the Seine River cruise starting from the base of the Eiffel Tower. We just showed our tickets to the man at the gangplank and we were onboard! Personally, I would have preferred a hotel located in the Saint Germain or Marais area, but this location was fine. Overall, a good deal.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancashire", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel ,great location .\u201d", "Author": "mini041", "ReviewID": "UR25157588", "Content": "great hotel we just spent three nights there very clean, tidy good breakfast continental but plenty to chose from ;bedroom not bad really for paris big enough for two people very nice very clean with nice finishing touches .the avenue it is on is quiet but you are two minute walk from arc de triomphe which can be seen from the hotel windows at the front. there is a metro station on the same avenue on other side of the street would stay in this hotel again but would take a travel kettle next time.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Astrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d233592-Reviews-Hotel_Astrid-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$125 - $320*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">27 Avenue Carnot</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515189", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/89/5d/895d4f0d6a5205a9dfe3322347c5f54e4large.jpg"}}
