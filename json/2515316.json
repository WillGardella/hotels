Nice hotel, nice rooms right in the heart of downtown and super frinedly staff from doormen, to front desk to waiter/waiteresses. Here is a little story to sum up the experience. On night 3, without any other real interaction with the concierge, we ask him to make a dinner reservation for 8 at the Metropolitan, a famous Seattle steakhouse. He makes the call for us and we head out for a drink and then to the restaurant. After we are seated and looking over the menu, the waiter brings 4 plates of 'American' Kobe beef carpaccio, compliments of the concierge at the Fairmont. Considering we had never been in the hotel before and only had three rooms booked there at a normal rate, I was extremely impressed by the gesture.

Always will be. The exception is the wonderful hotels of the Fairmont group that has yet to disappoint. I have written a wonderful review for the amazing Fairmont in Vancouver, Boston and Washington DC and now....this true gem of a 'Super 5* luxe experience'. The hotel, itself, is stunning. If you love to have a drink in a beautiful setting, come down to the lobby and order a 'coupe de champagne' and enjoy the wonderful ambiance. The Two restaurants are tops for dinner, the 'Oyster Bar Schuckers' being more oak-room casual and just delicious. The main Restaurant, 'The Georgian', is one of the most beautiful in Seattle and one of the best for 'haute cusine'. The foie Gras served with a chutney of puree of apricot and cinnamon was incredible and the Duck in 5 spices was just as good, The breakfast in this same lovely dining room can't be beat and the servers, especially John at beakfast, were warm, 'on point' when you needed them and just an example of what I found in my experiences with the entire staff. FYI, Penny gave me one of the best massages that I've had in months and the spa employees and ambiance is just Superb We were upgraded to a jr Executive suite as we are \"President Club Members' (you get free wifi and late checkout just for joining as a base level member), and it could not have been more lovely. Double doors between the bedroom and the sitting area. Amazing bed with fine, Egyptian linens and Goose down comforters. All the 5* ammenities you would expect were found in the room..and more. Lovely, sparkling bathroom with very nice samples and a sumptous tub. Clean? Every inch of this hotel just gleams. I can't go on how the combination of this lovely room and the warm but professional staff made this stay so perfect. I find this is true at most Fairmonts but this was the 'best' of the best.

Check-in was very slow because we all arrived in a bunch but they didn't put more people on the desk to deal with it nor did they have our room keys ready in advance. I was put into a small room on the second floor next to the swimming pool and lifts so there was quite a bit of through traffic in the corridor outside and a really lousy view of a flat roof and some litter outside. Not a big deal for one night but not terribly luxurious either. I was slightly irked that the guy in the line in front of me got a top floor corner room with lovely views and the guy behind me got upgraded to a suite because of the wait at check in. I know because they were both in my party and were obviously delighted with the outcome and told us all. I obviously drew the short straw. The room was fine, clean, well-appointed. The air conditioning unit in my room was too noisy to leave on and the one from the room next door was also very noisy and I didn't get a great night's sleep as a result. But It's pretty astonishing to have to pay for internet connectivity these days and $8 for a bottle of water from the minibar is also pretty outrageous. In the last year I've stayed at Raffles, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton etc. and I'm pretty sure I didn't have to pay for water or internet at any of them. My colleagues tell me that their rooms had an espresso machine but mine did not, which is a shame. This is an increasingly common amenity. So, what was good? Breakfast was fantastic. Really tasty omelette, nice buffet. The lobby is pretty impressive. I'm told (ahem!) that the views from the higher floors are nice. The bathroom is shiny and marble and the room compares well with other luxury hotels in terms of amenities and comfort. The location is good and central.

Sadly, some Fairmont staffers need a lesson in courtesy. When I asked the concierge about a limo to the airport, she said she'd have to call one and get a price quote. I thought this odd since the concierge dispatches limos daily. She said the price would be higher because of the snow and then proceeded to defend this practice loudly, to the astonishment of a nearby guest and myself. Since airport limos are flat rate, and since she then recommended that I take a metered cab if I wanted a flat rate, I thought she needed better training before staffing a concierge desk. Later in the day, I asked the front desk clerk for a copy of my bill to ensure it was in order before the morning checkout. There was a restaurant charge that was not mine, as I don't sign room tabs. I told the clerk this and showed my charge record receipts for my meals. He insisted that it must have been something I forgot and immediately called the restaurant manager to the front desk. A third clerk entered the fray, and the three of them cross examined me in the lobby about my bad memory. But they couldn't produce a signed ticket. I thought the correct procedure would have been to remove the charge immediately, apologize, and then find the ticket. Of course, when they found it two hours later, it was for another room, and the damage had been done. There were other very fine employees, notably Rick the bellman and Joanne in the Executive Lounge, as well as waiters John and Sean in the Georgian Room.

First impression is that the hospital is very early-century chic. Although a horrible analogy, in many ways I feel like I have boarded the Titanic (in a good, non-sinking way). There is opulence everywhere but it isn\u2019t over stated. When entering the lobby the first thing you notice is that it is 2 stories (main level and mezzanine level). Check in was very quick (I called the night before so that I could check in at 7:30 am) and I had no problems. In fact, I was upgraded (complimentary) to a deluxe executive suite. That makes a good first impression. When I entered the room, I was surprised to see a sitting room. Off to the side of the sitting room is the bedroom with king bed (separated by French doors). There is a flat screen TV in the bedroom and one in the sitting room. The sitting room has a chair, sofa bed, desk/chair, end table, and \u201crefreshment center.\u201d The mini bar is definitely fully stocked with 18 small bottles of liquor, a bottle of wine, bottle of champagne, some beer, some juice, some water, and some soda as well as candy, cookies, and chips. Beware, however, the minibar isn\u2019t cheap. A liter bottle of water is $8.00. The entry way holds the closet (with safe) and a chest of drawers. There is an umbrella and robes in the closet. Also in the closet is an ironing board. The bathroom (next to the entry) is well appointed with marble countertops/floors. I like the scale in the bathroom. The shower is a tub/shower combo. I found the bed to be very comfortable and it seemed as if there were two types of pillows on the bed, both firm and soft. There was a simple alarm clock next to the bed. On the first evening, I awoke at midnight to a soft beeping sound. I thought that an alarm in an adjacent room must be going off. It sounded strangely close, however and I realized that it was coming from the sitting room. There is a \u201csound machine\u201d radio with alarm in there and the alarm had been left \u201con\u201d for midnight. Lesson learned \u2013 always check all alarms. The hotel staff are amazing and very accommodating. Everyone says hello and several have called the elevator as I was approaching. The food has been excellent (privately catered in The Garden), although the meals were constructed somewhat oddly (Green beans, salad, pasta, and 5 kinds of meat just seemed a little too Atkins). The \u201chealth club\u201d is very large with dressing rooms for both men and women. The dressing room has individual showers and lockers. There are 3 ellipticals, 6 treadmills, a stair climber, and a recumbent bike in one room and the other contains free weights as well as some universal equipment. Each piece of cardio equipment has its own TV/DVD. Just ask for headphones at the health club desk. The desk also has complimentary water Just on the other side of a glass wall is the swimming pool and spa. The staff can be seen bringing beverages and food to people poolside. From a business meeting perspective, be aware that it can be a bit noisy at times. If you are in a large room, the food and beverages are in the room with you. Every time the staff come in to refresh your drinks, they will be stacking coffee cups or adding ice to the bowls holding the drinks. It can get a bit annoying after a while. This is a very minor complaint. If you happen to be in one of their smaller meeting rooms, the food and beverages are kept outside of the room so this isn\u2019t an issue. All in all, I had a great experience. The staff were always accommodating. The hotel is in need of some renovations (not because it \u201clooks\u201d bad, just to get it a bit more up to date). For example, the thermostat in my room was probably 30 years old. One would expect something a little more sophisticated than a dial. There is some wear and tear noted. However, there is nothing screaming that it needs repaired. As previous reviews noted, the hotel is centrally located so there is easy access to many of Seattle\u2019s best attractions.

Unfortunately I became ill overnight on my last night there from food poisoning from a local restaurant (not one of the ones at the Fairmont!). Being sick alone in a hotel room far from home is no fun, but everyone at the Fairmont went totally above and beyond to make me as comfortable as possible. Everyone I interacted with was very caring--the bellman who brought me some pepto-bismol from the gift shop below, the housekeeper to whom I apologized profusely (and tipped what I hope was generously enough) when she had to clean up the bathroom which was in not such a nice state after my illness, and everyone else whom I dealt with as I was recovering. The \"Royal Service\" agent who assisted me on the phone was helpful first with my request for a late checkout and then, when I realized I was not going to recover in time to make my afternoon flight, arranged for me to stay in the room for another night, charging the same (low) group rate that I'd had for my original booking. They even surprised me with a complimentary bowl of soup as I recovered--just what I needed. All of this gave me a very positive feeling about the employees and their care and attentiveness towards their guests. Even before that I had really enjoyed my time at the Fairmont--very pleasant and well-appointed complimentary health club and pool and nicely decorated rooms with curtains that overlap to provide a true \"blackout\" for a good night's sleep.

But it wasn't renovated, and boy did that room pale in comparison with the one we stayed in the first time we were here! I called down to the front desk and asked if any renovated rooms were available. They told me there was one on a lower floor if that was OK, and I said that was no problem. The manager actually ran the keys to our new room up to us in about 2 minutes! THAT is service! Kudos to you, Fairmont Olympic. The new room was also a suite, and the renovated rooms are SO MUCH NICER. Nicer bedding, cleaner-looking lines, nice paint tones, newer finishings like light switch face plates, nice new marble bathroom. I would probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if I had stayed in the original room they gave me during that stay. The hotel itself is in a good location - if you're heading out to I-5, you just go straight up the street a couple of blocks and you're there. Lots of restaurants, the SAM, and pike place market within blocks. There's a hotel car that can take you around the downtown area. The first time I stayed, I was having dinner at Canlis as part of the \"find a key and get free dinner at Canlis\" thing in October (I was graciously invited for helping! :) and I mentioned that I needed a taxi to one of the valets. Well, he told me to hang on and that he'd see if he could get the hotel car to take me. It was free, so they gave me a free ride to Canlis, which I must say is not exactly in the \"downtown core\", either. You guys are the best! The second time we stayed, it was a busier night so we had to wait about 20 minutes for the car to take us somewhere, but the driver was great, again (different guy). We were going to Kneehigh Stocking company, which is a speakeasy-type place and purposefully difficult to find. Well, our driver was so thoughtful - he made sure that he knew exactly where this place was before he would drop us off, probably so he'd know where to pick us up later that night, but it was really nice of him.

The bathroom was beautiful, all white marble and chrome. Two cons: the phone on the desk was broken, and the toilet flooded (but what can you expect, this place is like 100 years old, so I'm sure the toilets here aren't too powerful). Each time I called the front desk/concierge for help, they were really polite and friendly, and fixed anything I needed right away. The food in this place is to DIE for!!! I am used to the usual dry fish and chicken in hotels - not so here! The chef really seems to pride himself on not only serving delicious food, but doing it in an innovative manner, which is pleasing to the eye and palate. I couldn't have been more impressed. Additionally, the servers were all very nice, and anything you needed, they were there to help.

This location is fantastic! It is walking distance to everything: The Convention Center, Pike's Place, shopping, and even the Space Needle if you're up for a walk. We made it to the Space Needle going down 4th street which is about 1.3 miles away (Lucky that there wasn't any rain!). The hotel is very old, and beautiful. The room was good sized, with a complimentary paper each morning, robes and slippers. We had a corner room with a peek of the space needle and the rooftops nearby. We chose to self-park around the corner at the structure. However, just a word of warning if you need an accessible entrance. Unfortunately, the only way to get from the self-park structure to the street is down some stairs or through an attached convenience store when stairs cannot be used (Which a security guard had to come meet us after calling on the call box and show us the way). The store is open I believe from 7am-9pm - so this means, if you plan to self -park outside of these hours and cannot use stairs, you are stuck. When we pulled up to the Valet parking at the Fairmont, we explained we were going to self-park so the valets wouldn't have to mess with the hand controls on the car. It would have been nice if they had let us know there were restrictions on the accessibility of the parking garage. I understand this doesn't apply to most people...but again, would have been nice to know. If we weren't driving over to Spokane after, we wouldn't have needed a car. It sat in the garage from arrival until check-out. I would recommend not renting a car if you are staying at the Fairmont and don't need to drive out of town. The bathroom in our room was nice and big, and was probably one of the coldest I have ever stayed in due to the single pane window.

Walking with a carry-on luggage up what was about 7 blocks (Seattle's actually very hilly, hillier then Sanfrancisco) was rather a challange and work out. When I got to the hotel I was greated by staff asking to assist me with my carry-on, wish that had been 8 blocks down the hill. The young lady that chcked me in was very nice and professional, her name was Emily. I asked her quite a few questions, all of which she answered and then when I looked back there was a big line-up and a concierge desk which I could've gone to, it was nice of her to help me. At at the little cafe a quick croissant and safe latte and it was lovely, like french patisserie. There was always someone present in the lobby so if I had any directions questions or recommendations there was always someone readily accesible to answer my questions. The pool and gym area were lovely as was the entry and sitting area and the shrubbery and outside of the property. The room was clean and fresh and I am rather particular about hotel cleanliness. The room was large and bathroom was very large. The windows were on level with other rooms windows making me feel uncomfortable to leave the window open at anytime in the case of a room invasion and fresh air would've been nice. The light above the sink was burnt and didn't really matter to me but that the maintenance person came within 15 minutes of me checking in to fix it, this should've been done prior to my check-in so, I declined him coming in and asked he return after I check-out. The only thing I REALLY didn't like about the hotel was that the location was a bit out of the way causing me to taxi many places and I like somewhere in a prime location so, I can walk everywhere. Again, had I had more time in the city perhaps the location wouldn't have been an issue but it was because I was pressed for time and seeing as it wa out of the way I took at least 6 taxis that could've been easily avoided.

The exterior is classic, and upon entering the \"Lobby\", a grand mult-floor height marble hall, one feels like this is one of the grand European hotels. We were married here several years ago, in a small family-only ceremony in the Cascade Suite, a marvelous one-bedrom 3,400 sqft suite with a private dining room (where we had a private dinner served). Unfortunately, there is no way to make that into a suite with several bedrooms, despite the grand living area; the most that can be enclosed in privacy - and safety for young children - is with one other executive suite. Therefore, we've also stayed in the only 3BR suite in the Hotel (still not quite large enough for the family). As far as we know, the other corner suites are 2BR at most. Usually, when it is just the two of us, we stay in a large executive suite, and occasionally in the larger bedroom (part of the corner parlor suite that goes with the 2-bedroom suite... and with the one 3-bedroom suite). As wonderful as this hotel is, there are some problems with the heating system, such that it is tricky to get a room that isn't too warm. We now know which rooms to request, and we call ahead and remind the Front Desk staff that we'd like the thermostat turned \"as cool as possible\". The service here is absolutely the best. With special requests for a large extended family, the hotel staff came through with everything from tiny bathrobes for children (which we of course purchased for the grandchildren!) to getting a prescription refilled on short notice. And we've arranged special meals in the Georgian Room (the first time, when we could still hand-carry a special bottle of wine on board a commercial flight), and it was just perfect. We tried another hotel, and we walked out of the new Four Seasons (The Olympic *used to be* a Four Seasons), which was in one of the few seamy areas left in downtown. We then tried one of the new high-rise hotels, but it was like walking into the (small) lobby of an office building, simply to be spirited upstairs on the elevator right by the front door. (To due justice to this other Hotel, it did have a wonderfully huge and deep bathtub, with water that came out of the ceiling; if only our grandchldren could have seen THIS!) But the suite was just \"another modern hotel suite\", albeit one with very soothing displays on the walls, a very \"zen\" sensation to be sure, one lasting the full stay.

Avoid the over-priced hotel restaurant for breakfast and go to the Belle Epicurean coffee shop. It's attached to the hotel, accessed through the lower lobby. They serve the most decadent, freshly baked European style pastries. Yum! Luly Yang is a hidden shopping gem adjacent to the hotel. Walking by the display windows you might assume it's just a wedding and formal-wear store. That is it's primary focus, but hidden in the back is a small boutique for men. They have absolutely the best selection of ties I've ever seen. Lock up your Amex before you go unless you want to go home with a clutch of new ties. They also do custom made shirts and suits.

The next morning I thought I may be able to shake it off so we went sight seeing but I was still not myself so we went back to the room to rest and as soon as I stepped into our room I was overwhelmed with chemicals and had a massive asthma attack, I could feel my face begin to puff up and I was very ill. My husband who never notices any thing said he could taste the chemicals. I knew I couldn't stay in this room or at the hotel but wasn't sure what to do so I called the front desk and Edward who is in charge of security came to see how I was doing, he said there was a car waiting to take me to the hospital, I declined as a hospital bill was the last thing I needed on a holiday. This was probably a mistake. Edward made arrangements to move us to another room and this room was a lovely suite but sadly I couldn't enjoy it as I was far to ill and just went to bed, so no sightseeing for me. Edward did say that they are soon to change to greener cleaners but at this stage they were still using harsh chemicals. What ever it was in that room was very harsh. The kindness of staff was so appreciated at this time. I later on had a visitor who had a reaction at the hotel when she went to the toilets in the hotel, so at this stage I am thinking this is not just me.

They have greatly reduced staff and it shows. The remaining staff remains upbeat and professional but there are not enough of them. I have stayed here at least annually since 1984. I used to think it was the best hotel in America. No more. The rooms are down at their heels. The fitness center and pool are stunning but filthy. The locker rooms are infrequently tended to so I found it trashed on 2 of the 3 visits I made there. They have some tables at the end of the swimming pool along w/a couple of loveseat sized seats all of which had garbage and food remnants under them. Our breakfast in the Georgian room was an absolute disaster. There were about 10 occupied tables and ONE person tending to all 10 tables. At one point the phone rang, and rang, and rang. Nobody ever picked it up but it rang, loud enough to be heard throughout the whole of that stunning room, for a good 3 or 4 minutes until whomever was calling gave up. Thank goodness. With the economy coming back, perhaps the ownership will spend the money it takes to return the Olympic to its former standing. However, they've lost me and my business. There is a new Four Season in town and the Pan Pacific has recently opened. The Inn at the Market is reliable. All in all, The Olympic has skidded so significantly that I have concluded that it's beyond repair. I shared all of this with the front desk manager when I left who expressed his sympathies. I wrote the general manager who sent me a generic letter that didn't even attempt to address the hotel's failures.

Here's some info I would've liked to have known. I stayed in an Executive King room, which is one step up from the basic room. There's a bit more square footage, and a set of French doors to separate the sleeping and living room areas. If you're planning to work on a laptop during your stay, the size of the desk is inadequate and the outlets are on the wall under the desk. That's a bit of an inconvenience compared to the chains you probably stay at in other cities and expect outlets in the desk lamp or something. Wi-fi is spectacularly unreliable.

No issues with the cable, which works fine but chains you to that tiny desk. Not really sure it's worth the upgrade from the basic level room (which is why I'd chosen this room type...more space to work). Excellent service in the business center. I rented a room for meetings and the staff was impeccable. Always professional, with a friendly comment or funny quip here or there to keep a smile on your face. Breakfast service at the Georgian Room is hit-or-miss. Sometimes fantastic. Sometimes phoned in. Buffet is repetitive...eggs benedict four days in a row?

Literally 10 feet away from both of our windows was another wall.

The concierge was not only knowledgeable about the city; she was tuned into the kind of dining experience and activities that we were looking for. The expansive common area seating areas are serene; comfortable chairs and small tables abound around which you can have quiet meetings. The hallways are elegant and clean with very fresh air \u2013 actually our hall way was a little Arctic, but I\u2019d go for that over stale air any time. Our Room -- Understated, and spacious. Windows that open; comfy beds, very nice linens; tasteful art, nicely framed; pretty lamps; CD player; comfortable chair and ottoman; armoire and side table; spacious desk. You do have to pay for Wi-Fi. The Closet \u2013 Extra blankets and towels; a good quality umbrella in case it rains; wood shoe horn and brush; a basket to leave your shoes out for shoe shine; both wooden and quilted hangers; an extra lower shelf; two pairs of complimentary slippers and two (not complimentary) bathrobes. (At least I think the slippers were complimentary \u2026) The Bathroom \u2013 Well-lit; high quality amenities (however, one of the soaps was so highly fragranced that I actually had to put it in a drawer); a number of extra hooks and bars and an extra shelf; magnifying mirror; scale; elegant shower curtain. Now normally I wouldn\u2019t notice or comment on a shower curtain, but really every detail in this hotel just cries out to you (softly). Although the toilet was in the same room as the shower, it was tucked away. The Fitness Center \u2013 Very good, with a variety of weight and cardio machines. However, there is not much floor space, so if you have a dedicated yoga practice, you better hope that there is not someone else who is doing their kickboxing or Pilates at the same time. They offer fabulous coffee, complimentary water and apples. Be forewarned: there was quite a crowd there on a weekday morning at 7:00 a.m. The Restaurant \u2013The food is excellent; very creative without being wacky.

Hints - you can avoid paying $36/night for valet parking by finding a spot on the street. The only catch is that no cars are allowed on the street during 7 - 9am, so you have to get up early and move your vehicle.

I would recommend valet parking even at the outrageous price of $36.00 a day. Other nearby parking garages I saw were charging $30.00 as their daily rate, so why not pay the difference to the hotel and let them park and bring your car to you) Fabulous exercise room with the latest equipment well maintained with an excellant indoor pool and spa. Very nice touch providing complementary bottled water and Washington State Red Delicious apples at poolside. Well appointed and maintained men's locker room/shower with plenty of towels and various toiletries. Operating hours of the pool/heath club I believe were weekdays it opened at 5:00 A.M weekdays 6:00 A.M weekends, closing at 10:00 P.M. Quite adequate. We did not dine at either Shuckers or the Georgian which are on the property Both restaurants appeared to be very elegent however, and I have no doubts that the food is quite good. For cheapskates such as myself, Bernard's on Seneca just a block from the hotel would be a fine choice for either breakfast or lunch. I will give the room a 4.5 diamond rating. A 5.0 diamond for service, but a 4 diamond room overall. Details follows: Compliments: My wife and stayed in a deluxe king suite on August 6 and August 7. The room itself, the sleeping area, and bathroom are spotless . Nice touch providing bathrobes for guests. Water pressure in the shower while not great is more than adequate. Complementary daily New York TImes and Seattle Times brought to your doorstep each morning.. Housekeeping filling your ice bucket. daily Very classy indeed. Critical comments: The room is somewhat under furnished. A second armchair and ottoman would have been nice for the wife and myself to use to watch television together . it would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room. There is a nearby Starbucks, (they are on practically every major street downtown, along with a Tully's and Seattle Best Coffee also nearby for those of you that may have issues with Starbucks. Then again, not everyone would want to leave the property to get coffee ( I did, because room service prices are simply outrageous, but then that is SOP at all hotels) Hotel location -Fabulous- University Street station is just a couple of blocks away, which offers subway service to Pioneer Square, Chinatown. Mariners/Seahawks stadium and if I am not mistaken, in December 2009 to Seatac airport. . Seattle's public transportation system does have designated \"free zones\". ie you can ride public transporation for free with limitations. Please ask the hotel about that upon your arrival Pike's market, several block walk away In conclusion, if you are planning to stay in downtown Seattle, and price is not a consideration , this is the place to stay. At times this year I have noticed this is the most expensive property downtown. If price is an object,( for some of us rooms starting at $300.00+ a night + tax+ parking is simply too much money) watch for specials. Be patient. It will be well worth the time and effort.

We took the airport shuttle to the Fairmont Olympic hotel -- which arrives at the back entrance. We dragged our luggage into the lobby and checked in at the main desk. The staff was courteous, but I found it strange that no one asked if we needed help with our bags. The room was nice, though the furniture is somewhat dated. We had a room with a king size bed. The room had a sitting area with a sofa, chairs and flat screen TV and a separate bedroom with another flat screen TV. I did not find the problems that others have described, such as leaking sinks or stained and dirty furniture -- everything seemed in good repair. Except for the ironing board, which was a cheap piece of junk. It was flimsy and refused to lock into place until I turned it over on the floor and physically bent the locking mechanism back into place. It collapsed twice before being repaired. I was just glad that I didn't have a hot iron on it when it fell. I did have one issue that might not bother some, but it really bothers me. In an age when everyone has a cell phone, probably a laptop computer and likely a digital camera etc. that needs to be recharged, why don't hotels put some form of power strip on the desk in the hotel room? Our hotel room had a very nice writing desk with a lamp, telephone etc. However, to plug in any sort of charger, you were required to pull the desk out in order to reach the single available outlet back in the corner. Good luck plugging in two things at once, unless you are unplugging something else. No chance finding an outlet that is not behind some heavy piece of furniture. I did get the idea that the hotel is short on staff. The first morning, the promised wake up call never came. One day we stayed in our room past noon and received a phone call from the housekeeping staff to call housekeeping before 10 pm if we wanted to have the room cleaned. I appreciated the fact that they hadn't knocked since we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. We called housekeeping and left a voice mail message at about 2:00 pm that we would like the room cleaned. No one ever showed up to clean the room and we never received a phone call or other message as to why the room could not be cleaned. The concierge desk and the people in the gift shop were very helpful and friendly.

The deluxe room had a very comfortable king bed with nice linens and down pillows. By far one of the most comfortable beds I've slepted in for a long time. There is plenty of room for your clothes with drawers and a large closet with many hangers. Robes and slippers are included in the room as are nice quality toiletries.

This was a huge disappointment as most rooms that I've stayed in have a coffee maker. The hotel should really consider providing coffee machines in each room or upon request at the least.

I checked out the next day scratching my head as to how it is rated a 5-Diamond rated hotel and strongly beliveve based on my stay and room, it is at best a low rated 4 or a high rated 3 Diamond hotel. I was allowed an early check-in, which was much appreciated. Reception had only one staff member working, whom I will say was nice and pleasant. Upon exiting the elevator on my floor, first thing I see is an old dirty styrofoam coffee cup on the table. This raised a \"red flag\" with me immediately. The room itself was a bedroom with separate sitting area. The rate was quite good. Never knew 5-Diamond hotels dropped their rates this low. As for the room, this was where most all of the problems were. A missing blind slat in the sitting room window. Just happened to be the middle slat, so much for keeping the sun out. The slats themselves were filthy and four of the slats had a rust covering on them. The two pillows on the loveseat, one had lipstick stains, the other was dirty with black marks on it. These evidently had not been cleaned in sometime. Found change on the closet floor near the in-room safe. Guess housekeeping did not run a vacuum in there. The loveseat did have arm covers on them, which the chair definitely needed. The arms on the chair were almost black. You can definitely see the dirt against the yellow material of the chair. The desk chair had a sizable dried up blood or chocolate stain all over the seat. Then there was the refreshment area. Three nicely stacked Dean and Deluca candy bars, howerver, one was almost two months past the freshness date. In my opinion, totally unacceptable at any rated hotel. I am still trying to find the ice machines. This is still a big mystery to me. Absolutely no direction nor mention as to where to get ice. After all of this, I was beginning to wonder, what kind of room have I been placed into. The bed was very comfortable, the linens, duvet, pillows, etc, very nice and of quaility I would expect at a hotel of this caliber. The bathroom equally as nice. Although the toilet would not always flush right, would have to take the cover off to fix it, I just put up with it. The amenities in the bathroom were very nice, and the size of the bathroom itself was quite adequate. The towels were not of the highest quality, but they did their job. Room size was fine for me, and really liked being able to open the window to get some fresh air into the room. I did get a laugh though, when I saw the televisions in each room, as I actually own one just like it that is six years old. Now come on Fairmont, we can do better than that. Plenty of cable stations to watch if that is of interest to you. Went to enjoy the pool at the Spa/Fitness center. The young woman at the desk was a delight to meet--very cordial, helpful, willing to please the guest, but way overworked. Enjoyed the pool and hottub, clean, right temperature, and very relaxing. However, the men's locker room was nothing short of a pig sty. All the amenities expected at a 5-Diamond hotel, robes, shaving cream, deoderant, etc., etc., however, they had run out of many of the products. It honestly looked like this locker room had not been touched all day, and this was 5:00 pm. There were not that many people using the fitness center. A very big disappointment to encounter. To top it off, of the hundreds and hundreds of towels in this hotel, I just happen to be given a dirty one. I just laughed, and threw it in the dirty towel bin. I did inform the young lady who was most apologetic. It was not her fault. Utilized the concierege service who was most professional, helpful, and really went out of her way to try and find something of interest for me. Kudo's to her. Room service was outstanding. Food very good, delivered in a timely manner. Laundry service, again, what I would expect. The garments were returned when I was told they would be and in the condition I expected. The shoe shine service was equally as good. My pair of shoes had not looked that good in a very long time. A great job done. Had breakfast in the Georgian Room. Breakfast was very good, but nothing exceptional. Service was adequate, howerver, noticed a few guests did have some wait time before being seated. Did speak to the Manager on Duty regarding the above problems. My complaint was and still is that the Fairmont Olympic is a 5-Diamond rated hotel and naturally is very proud of this rating, but in my case, it sorely did not live up to it. All problems but one were rectified, breakfast was comped, had a nice platter of 5-chocolate covered strawberries delivered to my room while at the fitness center, howerver, no silverwear came with it, lucky to get a napkin I guess. I did check out of that room the next day with that \"old\" candy bar still sitting there. The entrance to the hotel is most inviting, the lobby and Georgian Room were grand, and very comfortable, the hallway looked very fresh. Staff was just adequate, with a few delivering the service expected of this hotel. In my honest opinion, I believe occupancy could be down, and staff has been cut back. Housekeeping Department may be rushed and just not able to tend to the details that should be looked at. That was the major problem, details that separate this hotel from others and especially a 5-Diamond rated one from even a 4-Diamond rated one. Service, cleanliness, and attention to detail very lacking here. It is also the only hotel of this caliber that I had to actually get the front door for myself on two different occasions. One time, there was no one out front. Only saw one bellman at all times while I was there. This hotel cannot live on past laurels and maintain its rating.

We were upgraded from a executive suite to a Deluxe Executive suite. Holy S***!, huge room with a living room and big bathroom. This place is extremely clean. Probably the cleanest hotel and its rooms that i have ever saw. The problem is the furniture is so old, something you would see maybe at a second hand antique store or Sally ann store, but in good shape. Saddly the carpets had slight ripple and was not in style.. I found everything to be in the 80's style with the furniture being early 70's. The bath tub is the lowest i have saw.. Really , its so low don't expect a deep soaker tub which i would have expected from this hotel. The toilet was so low to the ground, i needed a handle which wasn;t provided. I'am in my late 30's , great shape and found an inconvenience. I feel really bad the decor is mostly suited for those over 70 years old but lack handicap accessories found in European and Canadian Hotels. Yes you do get CBC from Canada on the old 26 inch panasonic tv, but the picture quality is less than digital with fuzz snow in every channel. The hide-a-bed in the sofa had a sink in the middle. Our teenagers complain of this. Our king size Mattress was so stiff, i kept twisting and turning all night. Everything felt and smelled clean. But the bed, the curtains(GOD UGLY), old tv sets, toilet, bathtub, carpets, french doors, thermostat all need to be modernized and improved to a high standard. The door knobs where worn off from the brass, the french doors had no glass, just see thru curtains from the seating room to the bedroom. as to the noise, I was on the 10th floor. I could hear all the traffic outside and someone yelling on the street. Its true , there is no view anywhere in this building. You are surrounded by newly built highrises way taller than 12 stories..lol as to distance to the shopping district and Pike Market where they throw the salmon. You are really close but far away from teh crowds. about a 15 minute walk. I was thinking before booking Fairmount Olympic Hotel to book the Sheraton. But the Sheraton and Westin in Florida really suck and over price for the dumps they own! BUt seeing the Sheraton, I would definitely book the Sheraton. It looks newer, beautifully decorated, really what a new hotel should look like and lots of stagette parties. Convenently located to everything and priced moderately. next time, it will be the Sheraton or the Pan Pacific. by the way valet parking in Seattle is $30 , at the Fairmount its $35. beleive it or not , its much cheaper to the the valet than using the public pay parking where they charge you $11 for a 90 minutes parking. Also everything is Seattle is overpriced to any other big city. It has no real good restaurants and all are over-rated and overpriced. But We did enjoy the TapHouse. Seattle is the most unfriendly City and a dunGY ugly city. I take cruises every year or Royal carribean and Princess and travel to many huge metropolitan cities. Seattle is the bottom of the list for restaurants and thinsg to do. IF your on a budget but still want a nice place, but don't want to pay a fortune but still stay close to Seattle.

Upon booking, we advised we were staying for our wedding night and would like an early check-in if possible. The person who booked our room was very polite and professional. He noted that we were booking the \"only 5-star rated hotel in the Seattle area.\" Check-in was okay. The person behind the counter was a little robotic with the \"Welcome to the Fairmont\" script and there was no acknowledgment that we were there for our wedding, which I guess we sort-of expected given the fanciness of the hotel and having given this information upon booking. We were given an early check-in without any hassle however. Our room was spacious with a bedroom and separate living area that had a couch, chair and coffee table. The decor is okay. It keeps with the old style of the hotel but we were expecting some more modern touches such as a flat-screen TV vs. the old one in the room (not that we watched any TV on our wedding night - just an observation!). The bathroom sink and faucets could be a bit nicer. The bed was comfy but not as good as some of the beds at nicer Hiltons where we've stayed in the past. The shower was very nice. The hotel did deliver a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries with a 'Congratulations' acknowledgment of our marriage. The valet parking also left us cookies & milk when we departed in the morning. Both were nice touches. After taxes and valet parking charges, we paid a little over $400 for our night's stay.

The hotel is walking distance from most city sights, including the waterfront, aquarium, shopping, Market and many more. The lobby is old-style, large and comfortable, with oriental rugs, lots of wood, etc. Check-in was quick. Getting to the room -- not so quick. The hotel has four, quite small and quite slow elevators, one or more of which was almost always out of order in the two days we stayed there. Thus, at peak times such as mornings and dinner-time, there was a 5-10 minute wait. And, when the elevator finally did arrive, it was filled, because it only holds 5-6 people, without luggage. With luggage, it's crowded with 3. Our room was disappointing. Knowing that older hotels have a hodgepodge of rooms, many of which are smaller than modern hotels, I didn't expect much. Still the room was VERY small with no view. Queen bed. Only one chair -- thus, one of us had to sit on the bed to watch the very small TV. Of course, because the chair and bed were directly opposite (and the room was too small to move the chair next to the bed), we both could not watch TV at the same time w/o craning our necks. There was almost no place on the floor to put our suitcases and we ended up tripping over them. Room decor was ok -- not memorable -- and bed was comfortable. The A/C worked well and I believe there was a mini-bar (didn't use it). However, the room was so small that we didn't want to do anything there but sleep. The bathroom, by contrast, was a good size with lots of marble and nice amenities. Rooms were very well-insulated and there is an in-room safe. Wakeup call was timely and staff was very friendly. The concierge desk was well-manned and provided excellent suggestions. We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast. The food was good and served fairly promptly. Cost was about what you'd expect for a high-end hotel. Workout room was modern and there was plenty of staff to assist.

The crib wasn't there so I called downstairs and they brought it up. The crib ended up looking very nice and we also got some baby toiletries with it.

We arrived around 9:30AM from our cruise ship and they let us check in at that very moment, no added fees. My mother-in-law and I took High Tea at the Georgian. It was excellent and we were not rushed, but were encouraged to linger. Upon check-in, we were given a little bag of toys (very cheap made in China), but a nice thought and a card to order complimentary cookies and milk from room service for our 2 year-old. Both rooms were huge!! Ours was so large, and allowed plenty of room for our portable crib. The draperies were a little dated, but lovely as they were trimmed with bullion fringe. We learned from an employee that the Georgian Room is about to be renovated-a shame, I liked the green upholstery. Everything is very elegantly decorated, but the bath faucets and fixtures show their age. The hotel was lovely, one of the finest that I have ever stayed in while in a large city. Some things are worn, but I am sure that renovations are soon to follow. Never once did I see anything dirty or grimy, everything was neat and clean in our room. My overall opinion of the Fairmont is a high opinion of a classic hotel that knows customer service and care. Try not to be in a rush, be nice to the staff (anywhere you go), even if it takes a little more time. Many of the Fairmont\u2019s staff are international and are sincere about guests' concerns. I would jump at the chance to stay at the Fairmont again and am blessed to have gotten such a great room at such a great rate for this trip. TEA at the Georgian Room Our waiter suggested I try the 1907 Fairmont blend tea-a wise decision. He was very nice and helpful. His name was Quoc (Asian guy). Another waiter was Alvis (Eastern European?) Both were humorous and answered any questions we had about the hotel or food, all-the-while remaining very professional. One could tell they enjoyed their work. The decor of the 2 chandeliers (8 feet high each), green furniture and creamy walls was soothing. It is not the fanciest hotel that I have taken tea in before, but the food was superb and again the wait staffs made it seem grander than the Palm Court Tea experience that I had in San Fran. The Wait staff was horribly snobbish there! At many other high teas I have had, the chef brings in certain finished pastries, etc. The waiters explained that the only items not made on the premises are bread and crackers. All pastries are made there and also supplied to their little patisserie.

The desk clerk DOWNGRADED us at the same price we had paid for the superior room that he had given away earlier! We complained to American Express who apparently caused a stink with the asst. manager who grudgingly offered to move us to our original room the next day with a $30 credit for the night we arrived.

That said, we greatly enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Olympic. Danny, the doorman went way, way out of his way to welcome us. I mean literally went out of his way - he walked me all the way to the escalators leading up to the lobby. From Adam on the front desk, we received a gracious welcome and keys to room 1007. This suite doesn't have what most people would consider a \"view\", but given the very good rate we received, and knowing that you can't have stunning views in 100% of your rooms, I loved it. It's a long rectangle with three windows on the long side, so the late-afternoon light was beautiful. Boom - I'm sold right there. But I actually liked the view out over the rooftops into the city, especially the modern pre-fab house on exhibit on the roof of the building across the street.Two comfy armchairs, two side chairs, king bed, vast bathroom. Robert, the houseman, arrived shortly after we entered with our requested pillows - enough for our little dog to build herself a fine little nest while we were out. Speaking of which, they brought silver dishes on a silver tray with a linen cover for her to eat from. Since I couldn't really go out after my operation, we decided to order in from room service and enjoy a movie. I'm maybe the only person on the planet who doesn't really like room service; I like eating at a table with other people to watch, and room service food, it seems, is never at the right temperature. But that night we had the best room-service meal ever - a beautiful piece of salmon, buttermilk-fried chicken with biscuits, all of it piping hot. It was easily as good as a restaurant meal, with the added perk of getting to eat in a comfy hotel bathrobe and slippers. The bed was gorgeously comfortable with sparklingly-clean linens and a thick duvet.

The lobby is one of the least fancy i have ever seen in any fairmont property, (and i have stayed at at least a dozen of them.) I will give credit to the fact there was one lady at the concierge was very very kind, it was surreal. There on the other hand, was a male concierge , who ignored me as he flirted with a woman who was in town asking where the hip clubs would be, he must have stood there talking to her for 15 minutes , not even looking at me, or telling me he would be right with me in a moment,, nothing. I never did get the help that i needed.

Who out there enjoys sleeping in a single bed?I did not know they even make those anymore do-they? The rooms also could use some renovating, including a flat screen tv for starters, its not common to get the old sears TV in the year 2008 in your room if you are in a upper class hotel. The location was great on the other hand, right across from the Purple restaurant, which has an unbelievable wine wall that is so high , it has a spiral staircase built around it to go up to get the bottle they need. Also nearby there is a great restaurant named the Brooklyn, 5 star dining for sure, great atmosphere, no candle light dinners or anything but very hip. Walking distance to almost anything you would need, such as the famous Pike Place Market, or the downtown shopping center and shops.", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cTrue Excellence\u201d", "Author": "PaintTheCity", "ReviewID": "UR13458619", "Content": "If I had to rate this hotel and staff on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm giving it a 20.

I opted for a deluxe room on the 6th floor. The room was well appointed, medium sized and generally comfortable, if a notch below Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton levels in finishes and level of upkeep.

One night before the cruise and three nights post cruise. We booked through the AMEX Centurion Card, so we received a number of perks. PROS: Location is ideal for walking about without being in the middle of the fray at Pike Market. There is a great restaurant across the street too, sort of a trendy tapas/wine bar, but the food was wonderful, fairly priced and despite the initial air of pretense they were very welcoming of the five children in our group (including three wee lads). Town car service was handy and freely offered. Food in the Georgian was perfect, really, perfect is the word. From fresh local cherries to the best chicken hash you could imagine the breakfast food was divine. We had room service dinners and the food was equally outstanding. Rooms were on the \"charming\" side, but the furnishings and finishes were first rate, the bed was of the top of the line nature with down comforter, fancy sheets, pillow top mattress. The windows actually open which is a very nice feature in Seattle with the refreshing sea air. The fitness/pool area was a little oasis in the city and hit the spot. But beyond everything else the service in this hotel was as good as the best hotels in Europe or Asia. We were greeted by name throughout our stay, we were \"remembered\" on our return visit a week later. Servers were great with our three small children in the restaurants, not to mention the milk and cookies and toys. The best example was the kitchen fire on the day of our departure (10 guests mind you) that set off the smoke alarms throughout the hotel and put their emergency announcements into action and elevators were turned off for safety. We were on the 4th floor and needed to depart as our shuttle van was at the front door. We called the bell desk and at first were told that they could not come for our bags due to the elevator issue, I then explained our deadline to get to the airport and 4, yes four, bellmen came immediately to our room and brought our bags down 4 flights of stairs with smiles and good spirits. CONS: The Shuckers Restaurant had very slow service, it was almost like the staff there were not on the same channel as the rest of the hotel, I think it may be a concession.

The first Saturday night stay we booked a room because my husband's office holiday party was at the hotel, so we thought we'd make a whole night of it. We had a beautiful deluxe room with a King bed. The furnishings, drapes, etc. are a bit dated, I must say, but still very classy and lovely, with a formal feeling. The service was top-notch, though. Marble bathroom was nice enough, though could definitely use an update, especially the tub/shower. There was no fan in the bathroom, which leaves the mirror steamed up after a shower. Fluffy white robes are provided, which are nice to don when you go use the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi--this wonderful big room is in a glass atrium so you can see the sky and the city. The second Saturday stay was with our three kids (7, 4, and 1). We booked an Executive Suite, which is larger. The King bedroom has French doors that keep it separate (sort of) from the sitting area with a pullout sofa. I never thought of this hotel as a kid-friendly hotel until our stay--they are awesome to kids! When we checked in, each child received a gift bag with age-appropriate goodies/toys. Each child also received a certificate for free milk/cookies room service. Once we settled into our room we called room service, and soon a very nice guy came with a silver tray laden with fabulous choc chip cookies and kid cups with milk and \"magic\" color-changing straws. Big hit with the kids :) We went out to dinner and did some of the Christmas-y things around downtown, then came back to the hotel for a swim. The closet had 5 fluffy white robes: two adult ones, two kid ones, and to our absolute delight, a tiny little robe for our toddler! I didn't know they made these hotel robes for toddlers :) The kids LOVED their robes, and LOVED the pool/jacuzzi. There is a basket full of kids' pool toys--noodles, floaty toys, boogie boards--which all the kids enjoyed. What could take this hotel from a 4-star to a 5-star rating: - Update the bathrooms and some of the room's furnishings. - Get new portable cribs. For a Fairmont hotel, I was quite surprised to get a portacrib that looked like it was about 15 years old, with tatters and rust on some of the joints. It was so old we couldn't even figure out how to open it up at first, since it didn't open and get set up like the newer portacribs do. We have stayed at Grand Hyatts, Marriotts, Four Seasons, etc., and never have gotten a portacrib like this before. - Put glass on the French doors in the suites. The whole \"wall\" has no sound barrier because there is no glass on the doors or windows--just open frames with dainty little curtains on them. Why bother, really, if there is no sound barrier (hence, privacy) provided?! - Newer TVs. Flat-screen would be even better! I would still stay here again, because the service, pool/jacuzzi, and kid-friendly features are just too good to pass up. But I would bring my own portacrib next time!

It's a perfect location for Christmas shopping, the concierge and front desk staff are top-notch and very helpful. We had reserved an executive suite which was a king bed in one room, and a couch and sitting area in another. We hosted a wine tasting with friends before dinner and a show and the sitting room worked out perfectly. Ordered a wine set up (glasses, etc) and a fruit and cheese platter from in-room dining which made it a bit more special. Delicious selection of cheeses, crackers, grapes, dried fruit and mini-pears came on the tray. Parking at the hotel is $30 a night, room was $180. Bathroom was immaculate - only one bath towel for the two of us but housekeeping quickly fixed things up. Also the dial on the heater/a/c needed adjusting which we let them know at check-out. The hotel is decorated beautifully for the holidays with a huge tree in the lobby. We missed the carolers (they're there between 12-1pm) but we did see the huge gingerbread replica of the hotel. Very cute. We've eaten at both the Georgian Room and Shuckers in the past (good food) but other than the in-room dining this time we ate at Pike's (Cafe Campagne - delicious for brunch - recommend reservations). We also used the fitness facilities in the morning. Heavy chlorine smell from the pool in the cardio area but it's a very nice workout room. We could hear the showers from neighboring rooms in the morning which woke me up. Wish the walls were a little thicker.

But the kicker was...that they had NO glass in the doors..just sheers...so NO privacy or peace and quiet what so ever. Also, they had two tv's in this small space..one just outside the french doors and one in the bedroom, back to back to the other one. There was no way you could have both tv's going at the same time as the doors offered no sound barrier of course. The overall decor of the hotel was dated and tired looking.

Had a wonderful time based mainly on suggestions from the concierge staff relative to dining and activities. There were only three negatives: We were given a room, which obviously had been a smoking room at one time, as it stunk. The housekeeping staff was most helpful in that they sprayed the room on a regular basis, which assisted greatly with the problem. The second being the stained arm chair and carpet. It would seem an establishment of the Fairmont's stature could afford to completely renovate the room to rid it of the smoky smell permanently and replace the upholstery and carpet. The spa, which is in the same building, was quite a letdown as it was dirty (dust everywhere) and slightly cheesy in that the pedicure consisted of placing one's feet in a plastic tub, as opposed to having a chair with a built-in tub to soak in and when offered a drink, it was water, which had obviously been drawn from the sink and was warm. My point being it was the spa suggested by the staff.

And happily, there have been VAST improvements. THE ACCOMMODATIONS We were upgraded to a suite perhaps because they could not find our reservations. That was obvious. But nevertheless, the upgrade MORE than made up for the glitch. The room was beautiful and spectacularly clean. As the elevator opened to the 10th floor, (we were in room 1034), I was impressed by the beautiful colors of the hallways---a subdued butter yellow and a beautiful deep Tiffany blue. The room had 2 TVs, a CD player with a CD of jazz standards. The great perk was FREE wireless internet. That was a HUGE thrill. Housekeeping service is given twice a day. (Turn down service at night.) My only complaint is the A/C. There is a thermostat and fan control but they did not seem to work as the room was HOT. The windows, unfortunately, could not be opened. The vents were located on the window sill which was totally blocked by two curtains...well, you had to close them for privacy. Anyway, we kept the curtains open and the room just would not cool even if we placed the thermostat on the lowest temperature. I do believe that hotels have thermostats only to make guests feel that they can control the temperature but I am sure that the thermostat is controlled by the hotel. That really ---- because it was HOT at night and we could not use the nice comforters because it was too hot. My other beef is the pillows. They are very long and amazingly, very HEAVY. But when you place your head on it, it just gets FLAT. So we woke up with stiff necks. But the bed is wonderful and the beddings just superlative. PLEASE upgrade the pillows. We took a peek at the standard rooms and they looked very nice as well. Shuckers, the restaurant downstairs is very good but the Bella Epicurean, a bakeshop on street level is simply AMAZING. Anything there is fabulous...and so good it's almost criminal. THE SERVICE The concierge was helpful and most of all, CHEERFUL. This we found to be STANDARD from the reservationist to the housekeepers. When calling for room service, the voice on the other line was super pleasant and accommodating. I asked for an egg white omelette with spinach and feta cheese---not on the menu---and they were more than happy to oblige.They were also very accommodating when we requested a late check-out time of 2:30. No problem. That was just an extra perk that they did not have to grant but did. They earned our business and loyalty right there. LOCATION Pike Street is just about three blocks away and Pikes Market is walking distance. Nordstroms, Macy's, Sephora, Rite Aid, Tiffany, Cartier, Coach, Barnes and Noble, etc...ALL are walking distance.The hotel location is just great for me. I walked all over and had a great time.
