Booked through bookings.com and managed to get a decent rate of \u00a3176 for 2 nights including full english breakfast. I was travelling on my own so I had a single room which costs less than a double. The room was (or should that be is, I'm sat in it now typing this) a rectangular shape, with floor to ceiling windows stepping out onto a shared balcony with the two adjacent rooms. It looks out onto the street which is very pleasant and populated with three storey townhouses just off Baker Street around 3 minutes walk from the tube station. Very comfortable bed, very clean bathroom, TV and ironing board with tea and cofee making and all the usual hotel equipment. Towels are provided (they aren't everywhere) and the breakfast is of good but not outstanding standard. Possibly the best thing about the hotel is the location being very close to central london and right next to Marylebone High Street where there is a wide selection of bars, restaurants, shops and supermarkets. If you are staying here for any length of time I'd recommend eating at the Gunmakers Pub around the corner, the food is absolutely exceptional and very reasonably priced. But back to the hotel, it surpassed my expectations, dont get me wrong, its basic but its good basic, rather than shabby / unkempt basic! Another great addition is the free Wi-Fi - superb signal throughout my stay and I've basically been online for two days without any problems whatsoever. That's got to be worth something. People in previous reviews have complained about the noise, all I'll say is this, its London, London is a noisy city! The street is relatively quiet although you will often hear sirens, so I'd always recommend bringing earplugs. But no way is this a 'noisy hotel' . Overall rating is four star not because its of Hilton standard, but purely based on its value for money, location and cleanliness.

The location is perfect! A short walk takes you to the Baker Street Underground Station, and you are then only two stops from Oxford Circus and three from Piccadilly Circus! Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum is right across the street. Approximately two or three blocks over from the hotel is a cute little shopping street with little boutiques and some nice mid-range restaurants. The included full English breakfast was delicious and made to order. I's a nice free way to start a day of sightseeing, and it was very filling. The rooms are small, but not so small as to be uncomfortable if you like the person you're staying with. Plus, my room was only used for sleeping and bathing, so size didn't matter. The room included a television, hairdryer, an ironing board and iron, and an electric tea kettle. There was no alarm clock in my room, so make sure you have one with you just in case. My only complaints are the walls are tissue paper thin, so a light sleeper like me hears everything. It didn't help when our neighbors came in intoxicated at 3am the first night there. On the plus side, the road the hotel is on is very quiet, so no outside noise to compete with. Unfortunately, the shower was worthless. I hardly felt clean the entire time due to the slow trickle coming from the shower head. On the plus side, you also have a bathtub so alternative bathing is available if you aren't in a rush. I just had trouble when it came to rinsing my long hair. I was on the top floor, so it may not be so bad closer to the ground.

There are several places to grab a quick sandwich (such as Pret-a-Manger, EAT, and Tesco Express), as well as banks with ATMs and a Boots on Baker Street. There is also a supermarket on Marylebone High Street. But the most important thing about the location is that the hotel is a five-minute walk from Baker Street station, which is on five different Tube lines so you can quickly get anywhere in London. And there is an internet cafe at the corner of Marylebone and Baker Street. The only real negative was the lack of furniture for storing clothes. I had to shove my clothes into a cabinet designed for a small fridge, while my daughter put her things in the night table and my husband used a desk drawer and the shelf on top of the closet.
