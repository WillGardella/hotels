{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nothing fancy but it will do for the price Clientele mostly Japanese or other Asian. A handful of Brits, Euros and at least one American -me. Many hotel staff spoke very little English. They weren\u9225\u6a9b rude, but not overly friendly either.I took the lowest price available so I got an unrenovated room that was very basic and unimpressive. I think if you pay more the renovated rooms are nicer but still small. My room had no coffee maker but had a little hot pot and a couple teabags provided. Bring some powdered coffee and you\u9225\u6a92l be set. Water pressure in the shower was good. My floor had a vending machine that sold cold beer for ~US$3.50 a can.The lobby is not particularly opulent but it\u9225\u6a9a bigger than a lot of low cost Tokyo hotels and there is actually a fair amount of lobby seating for meeting business associates. If the main lobby is full, try North tower across from the 7-11. Its lobby is on 2 and has quite a few chairs, usually open.Regarding location. On my Tokyo map, Shinagawa looked like it was way out on the edge of town. It\u9225\u6a9a not really. Even so, there is little or nothing for a Western tourist to see there. I think that\u9225\u6a9a why I saw so few westerners at this hotel. It\u9225\u6a9a easy to get to things from the hotel on the train; but if this is a trip of a lifetime I recommend springing for a big name US hotel up in Shinjuku or maybe Ginza. The JR station practically adjoins the hotel lobby, and even though it\u9225\u6a9a called Japan Railroad it\u9225\u6a9a more like a subway train coming every 5 or 10 minutes, not every half hour like a US commuter train. Take the Yamanote line to Shibuya and Shinjuku in one direction (about 20 min), Ginza and Tokyo metro station in the other (10 to 15 min). You can grab the Metro at any of those to go elsewhere.I took a bus in from the airport but leaving took the JR Yamanote line to Tokyo station where I got the Narita Express to the airport. Narita Express has assigned seats. I got my ticket at Tokyo station. ~US$30 one way. Runs every 30 to 60 mins. Follow the signs in Tokyo station.100V AC power in room worked fine charging my US laptop  digital camera, but it\u9225\u6a9a only 2-prong sockets so bring one of those 99cent adaptors if your power supply has a third prong. A hair dryer is provided.No free in-room internet access, at least at my rate. I bought the American style breakfast for ~US$11 each morning upstairs in the Yahoo caf\u8305 and it included use of computers with internet access after. It\u9225\u6a9a that or you hit the McDonalds downstairs for US$6 but then you still have to buy a coffee or something for another $5 in the Yahoo caf\u8305 to use the internet so I opted out of the McD route. Printing was around 50 cents a page in the Yahoo.

Typically, they didn't have room in their small apartment to put us up, so they booked two nights for us (Friday/Sunday) at this hotel. On Saturday night we stayed at a resort southwest of Tokyo.We arrived from Narita airport by Airport Limousine Bus at a cost of 30,000 yen per person. The bus trip was relaxing and our considerable luggage was handled from airport curb right to our room.We stayed in the North Tower which apparently is the oldest part of the 3-tower hotel. It looked a little old but it seemed to us to be clean and well-maintained.The room was quite small and the washroom was smaller, almost like a cabin with a step-over door threshold. The bath tub was small but deep. The hot water was very hot. You have to be careful with it or you could get scalded. There was plenty of flow from the shower head. I got the feeling the water feed lines must be bigger than the standard North American 1/2 copper pipe.The toilet had a high-tech bidet seat which was nice to try.The double bed seemed to be standard size and it was comfortable.The room was very clean, but I suppose if you wanted to give it the white glove inspection you could get a finger dirty if you looked hard enough.We left 4 suitcases with the hotel, at no cost, between our two nights there and we felt our belongings were secure there.The staff had the typically high standard people expect from Japanese hotel workers. We found them all to be friendly and helpful and very courteous.At the base of the three hotel towers is a 2-level(?) shopping mall, a bowling alley, and many restaurants.

For my purposes, the location simply cannot be beat because Shinagawa Station, which is literally across the street, is on the Yamanote loop and is also a Shinkansen station, which I use to travel to southwestern Japan. The hotel is not without its problems though. Be aware that this is a huge complex with four separate towers, as well as an aquarium, a movie theater, and a bowling complex. Throw in the usual shops and restaurants, and all you really need to complete the picture is a strolling mariachi band. The towers vary greatly in quality. On a previous stay I had the misfortune of staying in the North Tower, which in my opinion is nothing more than a dirty little business hotel with tiny rooms in dire need of renovation. Or better yet, demolition and reconstruction. Since then I always request a renovated room in the Main Tower, preferably on the higher floors. My room on my most recent visit was approximately 200 sq feet (10X20), with the bathroom occupying about 33 sq feet of that.

I've stayed at the Shinagawa Prince three times over the past three years: the first two experiences were great (4/5) and the most recent was mediocre (2/5). The reason is easy to explain: we were assigned a different tower to stay in; your tower will dictate your experience. As others have noted, this is a huge complex that has a surprisingly convenient location just south of Tokyo's core, next to the large Shinagawa JR station. It has plenty of on-site food options, shopping, entertainment and four, significantly different hotel towers that were clearly build as expansions over the years. My experience dealt with two towers: the Annex Tower (formerly known as the Executive) and North Tower (previously known as the Annex Tower). It is a sprawling complex. Oddly enough, all four towers have their own reception desk (where you have to check-in) but are considered the same hotel by the Prince Hotel sites. The current Annex Tower is everything you'd expect from a solid, upscale business hotel in Japan: small, clean room but decked out with all sorts of nice high-tech perks --a pleasure to stay in. The North Tower offers an experience of what a standard business hotel room must have felt like in the 1950s --dark, aging, and feeling sketchy. I can't even believe they're the same hotel; interestingly enough, it is the one tower that is not connected to the rest via indoor walkways. Apparently the East Tower (the former Main Tower and clearly the first of the four to be built) was bad enough to warrant a major renovation which was still going on during our visit --I sincerely hope the North Tower is next on their agenda. NOTE: As you may have guessed from my review of old and new names, it is possible to be assigned the North Tower instead of the Annex Tower because, until recently, the North Tower was called the Annex Tower. Make clear you want the good one (Annex) when you make the reservation!Once you get past the room issues, the complex is still pretty good once you find your way around. For food they have a variety of good options: there's a food court that offers all sorts of great cheap eats (I'm partial to Japanese curry); the Yahoo! Cafe in the lobby of the Annex Tower offers a great breakfast (Japanese, which we loved every time, as well as Western) in addition to internet access; for formal dining or just a bar with a view there's the highly recommended Top of Shinagawa, located on the top floor of the Main Tower (39th floor, formerly the New Tower). Additionally there are several formal Japanese restaurants, what appears to be a Polynesian themed restaurant, and several places to buy snack-items. Just outside of the hotel complex there are even more quick eat places on the way to the JR station. They also have several entertainment venues, including a movie multiplex (all in Japanese) and a bowling alley/arcade. There are a number of shops that cover clothes, tourist nicknacks, and convenience store items. This is clearly a place aimed at locals as well as visitors. So there you have it, the hotel offers a good location, a fairly non-tourist variety of things to do, but a strikingly Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde problem with its towers.

We were in the Executive Tower and I must say at first glance I was not blown away, but the place grew on me. Before making the trip I was more than a little irked that we had to pay an extra $30.00 per night to have a double bed, and I still find this outrageous. Having said that, our bed was more like a King size, and although the room was on the small side, as others have said, your there to change and sleep. Each day we were given clean kimonos and slippers. My personal favourites were the gadgets, think Japanese ingenuity. Heated toilet seat, with a built in bidet (never used one before, but loved it) and the heated mirror in the bathroom which stays clear no matter how hot the shower. Oh yeah, another thing I loved, the shower was amazing. So strong, great for reviving after a day of touring. As others have said, the hotel complex is right across from Shinagawa station, and once we figured out the train and metro system - not that complicated - we were away. Most staff speak a little english, more than enough to get by. If you stay there go across the street to Wing, a department store, and go down to the basement and prepare yourself for an epicurean carnival. Lots of different counters that sell all sorts of food ready to eat ,and locals buy before taking the train home. It is worth it to splurge and go up to the top floor of the New Tower to eat or have a drink. The view is really breathtaking, but beware, if you only have a drink in the bar there is a cover charge, roughly $5.00 U.S. per person that no one mentions until you see it on the bill. You make take your breakfast that is included in the roomrate there if you like and still benefit from the view. We are not tea drinkers in the morning (the hotel only supplies teabags) but you can buy these coffee kits in the shop, 3 for about $5.00.Finally, let's talk about the food court. Personally, I found the selection a little limited, but I highly recommend the first counter to the left as you enter. They specialize in Ramen and it was amazing. What's interesting about this place is that you place your order by selecting what you like from a ticket machine. You make your selection, (lots of photos so don't worry about not speaking Japanese) pay your money into the machine, take your ticket to the counter and give it to the cook, and he in turn gives you a pager. You find a table, and when your meal is ready the pager goes off, and you go and collect it. All in all, this was a great place to stay.

Recommended if seeking a basic place to sleep while exploring this lively city.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR875048798", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "motutoopua"}, {"Content": "sorry but i dont agree! i guess we all have different standards and experiences but our room which was not in the executive tower was small, dirty and in desperate need of a refurbishment! carpet was in such a state that you would not want to walk on it without shoes let alone socks on your feet.

Great location, directly at the Shinagawa station and I had a wonderful room (compared to Japanese standards) in the Executive tower. Be aware there are many different rooms in this hotel, depending how much you pay and what requests you have, you are booked in at least 4 different places. The Executive Tower is probably one of the better places. The hotel is very, very big and ditributed over many buildings with differenent entrances. So make sure you are at the right reception to check in. The room I had was more than 20 sqm (~200 sf) big and nicely equipped. The bed is a double but very hard as always in Japan. But still very ok. Internet access is available, after a modem is installed in your room (high speed + flatrate, around 10 US). I was a bit unlucky, because just this one day, it stated to rain heavily that morning, so that I could only run around the hotel and look at the leasure entertainment - such there is plenty of it.

The hotel is in a great location, with a short walk across the street to the bustling Shinagawa train station, where one can easily access the Yamanote loop around Tokyo, the NEX train to the airport, and trains to Yokohama. Shinagawa is located to the south of Tokyo, about halfway around the Yamanote loop, so it's only a few minutes either way to the Ginza, Tokyo Station, Akihabara, Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ikebukuro. Shinagawa is mostly an area frequented by business people who work in the many surrounding high-rises, but is home to a nice aquarium next to the Prince complex. The hotel is quite large, with several high-rise complexes of its own. I would recommend the New Tower or the Executive Tower, which are both a bit more expensive, but also newer and more accessible. The older buildings have tiny, slow elevators, and are geared to smoking business travelers with small suitcases, so I wouldn't recommend them. The hotel staff is very courteous and professional, and although no one has a perfect command of the English language, the staff are very obliging and helpful, and are used to dealing with visitors from all over the world. The hotel has many amenities available within its complex: a well-stocked Convenience Store that is open until midnight, several adjacent clothing, shoe, and variety stores, a large bowling alley, a Yahoo Internet Cafe (500 yen for coffee, but you can use the computer as long as you like), many in-house and adjacent restaurants, a swimming pool (charges apply), and hourly bus service to the airport (the staff will load your luggage for you, taking great care with your things!). I would recommend booking with breakfast (a bit pricey, but worth it) if you go through the hotel, since you will enjoy a good buffet selection of both Western and Japanese fare, and may not have to eat again all day. As for the rooms in the New Tower, the views are interesting, especially if you get above the 20th floor, and if the smog over Tokyo doesn't blur your view. The rooms are not large, but are clean and adequate. Amenities include a safe, a small refrigerator, heated toilet seat with bidet, built-in hairdryer, kimonos, slippers, and tea service. The carpet, TV, bedspreads and curtains are becoming a bit shopworn and have not been upgraded since I have been coming to the Prince, but everything is in working order. Bathtubs are small, as are the Japanese people, but the plumbing all works perfectly. Air conditioning is very adequate and even chilly if you want it to be. There is very little drawer space, but a closet with a folding door will hold your suitcases. The cleaning staff are also very pleasant, and will likely greet you as you pass by in the morning.I have considered staying in other hotels on my visits to Tokyo, but always end up booking at the Prince. The price is right, the location is superb, and the staff treats you well. I'm sure there are many other much more luxurious hotels available, but I like to save my money for everything else there is to buy and see in Tokyo. I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Shinagawa Prince if I get back to Japan again.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR132288177", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Roserad"}, {"Content": "Ok'ish I guess Great location as opposite Shinagawa Station which is the JR Yamanote line and Subway.

Since I've stayed in a hotel in Tokyo before, I understood going in what to expect in terms of size, i.e., if you want to pay a reasonble rate, expect to only have enough room to sleep, otherwise expect to pay a fortune to get a room scaled to American expectations. Since we were in Japan to sightsee and visit with family and friends, we had no intention of staying in the room other than to sleep.With these expectation, what we really wanted was a room and hotel in decent shape in terms of upkeep, cleanliness and a good level of service. We weren't interested in mini bars or room service. The Annex tower provided just that with twin rooms that fit barely more than the beds, small nightstand, small desk and chair and dresser. Although the bathroom is small by American standards, it was bigger than my last bathroom in Tokyo, where I couldn't fully stand up in the shower. The shower/ bath was small but usable. And the toilet was Japanese superior with two flush strengths, adjustable bidet and heated seat. There was also a fridge and TV with free and pay channels. No internet in our room, but they only charge \u697c500/day for wireless in the lobby. Please keep in mind that all comments relate to the Annex Tower. The quality of the upkeep was great: clean and in perfect shape. The twin beds were small, but at 5'10, I had no problem sleeping comfortably. The pillows, as reported previously, were very hard. The service was top notch: I requested certain room changes and they bent over backwards to accomodate me. They also stored one of our bags for a week for no charge as we traveled to Kansai.If you want to spend time enjoying Japan by staying inside your hotel for a good portion of your time, then the Annex Tower is not for you. The rooms are larger and more luxurious in the Executive Tower and smaller and less well kept in the Main Tower.All in all, I think the Annex Tower was a great value considering the unavoidable premium charged for hotels in Tokyo", "Date": "Apr 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR792496774", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Depressing Rooms in Annex Tower ...

No room service or mini-bar (though an empty refrigerator in which to store your own items). Weirdly prefabricated tiny plastic bathroom. And the hardest pillows known to humankind.

The minuses: For some reason, our travel agent had booked us for a twin room. When we asked for a double at check-in, they were unable to accommodate us. I found out later that most of the rooms in the new tower are twin rooms. Normally, this wouldn't bother me except that we were paying $172.00 US per night for a twin room. We could not adjust the temperature in our room. It was a bit warm and the air-conditioning did not work well. The Shinagawa location was great during the day, but the whole area was pretty lame at night. Maybe if we had gone to the other side of the station, we would have seen more, but instead we hopped on the Yamanote line and went up to Shibuya for entertainment.
