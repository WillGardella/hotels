The person at the front desk told us that we could drop off our bags in the baggage room and come back in a few hours because check in was at 3pm. The response was so automatic and so cold. He told the same thing to several other fellow travellers who tried to check in after us and they were upset as well. He offered no brochure telling us where to go to eat, or what sights to check out first. It was business as usual for him. The great thing about this hotel is that it is walking distance from 2 metro stations - Europe & Rome - so it was very easy getting around. The room was clean and nice. However, my sister and I would not stay here again because of the lack of customer service.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "north west england", "Title": "\u201cAsk for room 65\u201d", "Author": "cumbriancouple", "ReviewID": "UR127417119", "Content": "Brilliant location in peaceful neighbourhood situated 2 minutes walk from Rome Metro.

The Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge are within walking distance (a good walk). The standard doubles are very small but thats to be expected in a city. The rooms were well serviced and spotlessly clean. We were initially in room 37 at the rear on the third floor and asked to be moved because when you opened the window you were met with the back wall of the nearby railway station which you could literally reach out and touch. The reception staff (in particular Alex) bent over backwards to get us moved to another room (65). Although still at the rear this room was on the 6th floor and was set back from the station by about 50 metres, it also had a small balcony and amazing unobstructed views of The Eiffell Tower. You do get noise from the railway but it never bothered us. We got a good deal through Travel republic paying about half the going rate.

Room 53 was exactly like Room 52, but just a little bit smaller These are Premier Rooms overlooking Rue de Berne with their own Balconies. it was just like coming home to a place you know and trust and are happy at. - The Bathroom is a bit on the small side but it works, one downside with the bathroom is when you have a shower however careful you are water still ends up on the floor, due to the small screen over the bath!! - i laughed as i remembered it from the previous visit. The Breakfast room is in the basement of the Hotel, and is a little tight on Space, the breakfast is priced at around 9 Euros for one but you can have as much or as little as you want, the morning pastries and rolls and cold meats + Cheeses are all excellent, Tea , Coffee, and fruit juices are also available. Transport links are excellent with Rome metro Station (Line 2) being the nearest station at a Three minute walk away, Two other Metro stations are only a five minute walk away, I managed to walk to Galleries La Fyette on Boulevard Hausmann in less than 15 Minutes Flat!! from the Hotel.

We got the metro in from the airport for around 9 euros each rather than the 50-70 we were told a taxi would cost. This was easy and quick. Once you arrive at the Rome Metro you are only 2 mins from the hotel. Walk out of the metro, up the stairs, turn 180 degrees and it is the first road on your right. It is slightly confusing as the hotel is on the Rue de Berne but the road you turn right on is the Rue de Moscou. This road forks after about 50 metres and the Rue de Berne is the right hand one. As we arrived in the dark and the rain it would have been good to know this first so I thought I would mention it so others could avoid getting confused/wet! The hotel staff speak good English and are polite and helpful. The room we had (room 65) was on the back so there was a small amount of train noise, but not too much. The room was fairly small but I have been lead to believe this is the case with most hotels in Paris, and it was big enough for what we needed and had tea/coffee making facilities and a good shower which is always a bonus on arriving home after a long day of sightseeing! The great bonus of this room was it was on the 6th floor and had a great view of the Eiffel Tower (from a small balcony) that was always good to come home and see each evening. We stayed for 3 nights and paid around \u00a3300. This was a deal on a popular hotel website that was supposed to be 50% off. Paris is expensive and this did include breakfast so was a really good deal, but I'm not sure I would have paid the full \u00a3600 - you could probably find something more central and posh for this amount! The breakfast was good, with lovely pastries including croissants, pain du chocolat and pain aux raisins as well as cereal, yoghurt, fruit, and some hot breakfast which was scrambled egg and sausage. There was tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and juices too so plenty of options and the breakfast room was pleasant, always clean and not too busy. It was about a 20-30 minute walk to the Arc De Triomphe in one direction and Louvre in the other but a good idea is to get a metro pass. We got a 1 day pass (around 6 euro) and used it loads and got quickly and easily to our destinations without too much walking. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you can get it at the right price as it is a good base to explore Paris with plenty of restaurants, boulangeries and patisseries nearby and I would definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Paris.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDo stay here\u201d", "Author": "louise4444", "ReviewID": "UR124813932", "Content": "My husband and I have just spent three nights in this hotel.

The hotel itself was clean, but the rooms were incredibly small, very stuffy and HOT. I could hardly sleep because of the heat, and I couldn't find a way to turn it off. Even when put on cool, it blew hot air. The street the hotel is located on, is not actually on ANY maps that we looked at, therefore making it quite difficult to not only try to navigate, but also give taxis directions to get back to the hotel. They had no idea where it was and if it weren't for their GPS, we would never have been able to get back to the front door of the hotel. It is conveniently located to two train stations which is nice. There are some great bakeries nearby with delicious pastries. The staff at the front desk wasn't so helpful, no friendly. I asked one man in the evening if the bar was open and he looked at me as if I was a lush and had the most absurd of requests. When i asked if he had wine, he said gruffly, \"we do NOT have that!\" No wine in Paris, weird. So I asked for a beer and he went into a tiny little mini fridge to pull out two Heinekens and said \"This is all we have!\" and slammed them on the counter.

We took a gamble on the lastminute secret hotel and were very pleased when this came up as the resultant accommodation :-) We drove over from the UK and found a secure carpark just round the corner, literally 3 minutes walk away (the carpark was a little steep at ~\u20ac20 per 24 hours but very safe compared to the street parking where we saw several drivers using the bumpers of the other cars to figure out where they were in their parallel parking, a norm in Paris it seems). Nearby there are plenty of restaurants and if you use the tripadvisor app you wont even see them all as there's so many. Two metro stations are within a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is down a very quiet road on the frontside and the back eventually backs onto the train lines. Please dont let this put you off, our room was towards thi side and the only times we noticed any noise was when we weren't talking and had the television and AC off. All of the staff were very helpful and spoke great English. Notably, we bought a Disneyland ticket from a website and needed to print the confirmation out. The lady covering the evening shift was more than happy to do this even though the hotel sell tickets themselves and probaby make a slight cut from those tickets. Reading reviews of Paris hotels we were aware that rooms were smaller in general than other European cities, room 25 was an adequate size for the two of us with enough storage and space beneath the bed for our bag (please note that it was a large holdall style bag though so rigid suitcases wouldn't fit). The only downside was the bathroom which was small. The door opened inwards pretty much onto the sink and then pushed further...onto the toilet. However, it was clean and hot water was delivered instantly. The rooms look great (loads of photos around so i wont go on about that) and they have a safe, wifi, lcd tv, etc, etc, no complaints at all. For English speakers there's only 2 English tv channels which are BBC Worldwide news and CNN if I remember rightly. The TV has a built in DVD player though so bring some along if you plan on spending any amount of time in the room. Unfortunately the reception desk does not have a library to borrow but then again...they would probably be in French anyway! As a warning to any families, and a heads up to any couples, channel 70 is a free to view french 'adult' channel after 10.30pm ;-) We were very pleased with the stay and would definitely return, we didn't manage to do everything in 4/5 days in Paris so a return is almost certain.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA clan room in the center of Paris\u201d", "Author": "sorrentomagic", "ReviewID": "UR117418033", "Content": "I was amazed on how this little hotel has Made huge improvements for clients.

There is also shuttle service available back to the airport for 17 Euros each - just a bit cheaper than a cab. Everything we needed was within a 5 minute walk. Our room was at the front of the hotel - we could open the windows and enjoy the fresh air. We definately will consider this hotel next time we visit the wonderful city of Paris.

The rooms were great and the size one would expect in Europe (Tiny) but had a nice little closet. We had a premium double and the bed was larger than our queen in the US. We were on the 5th floor on the street side and it was perfectly quiet. The street and area is lovely. We walked to Opera, Printemps (10-15 min walk), and even the louvre. The ONLY downside is the area actually has quite a few homeless folks. During the day it is not bad, but at night it is a bit offputting to be walking by a little homeless colony down the street sleeping/drinking. Kind of smelly, though they did not bother or beg. The area is very convenient, though, with metro stops Rome and Europe basically at either end of the street. We did not eat much in this area - mostly used it as a home base in the morning and evening before and after long days exploring the city. Would stay there again - but the homeless folks really did put a damper on things - You get that in a lot of cities, though.

If you pay in full, you get a few euros off and also breakfast included. We arrived at hotel cervantes from a long journey that started in London, stopped in Amsterdam for a night and then arrived in Paris after a 3.5 hour train ride. We were very lucky that hotel cervantes was ready for our arrival and we were able to go to our room immediately. The checkin process was seamless, the staff at the front desk was very knowledgable and polite. They all spoke english very well. We stayed in room #15 for four nights. The rooms are reminiscent to those on a cruise ship. Very small, but they have everything you need. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean, the bathroom was small but the shower had great water temperature and pressure. They also include a hair dryer that worked fairly well. The windows opened up generously to let in the cool paris breeze. The hotel does have Air conditioner but we opted to open the windows so get some fresh cool air. Please note however, the hotel is near some train tracks so you will hear some noise from the trains wizzing by. I am a deep sleeper so this didnt bother me much. Our stay included breakfast which was phenomenal! We missed it once because we partied late and slept in, but it was definitely worth waking up for. Breakfast is served from 6-10am every day. It includes eggs, sausage, fruits, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, cereal, croissants that were excellent, danish, chocolate croissants (to die for), coffee, milk, cream, fresh apple and orange juice. Its a small dinning area but very well maintained, constantly refreshed buffet and deeeelicious! Although Hotel Cervantes sits to the north side of Paris it is very easily accessible by train. It's about 35 euro by taxi from Charles de Gaulle airport and only 12 euro from The Gare du Nord train station (we did both, thats how I know). When its time to see the sights, the hotel will give you a map of the city (which will become your best friend). If you walk up the block you will find the \"Rome\" train station which makes all the sights completely accessible within minutes. You will have to change trains a few times depending on which direction you're going on but DONT be afraid, its really easy to master. With a little planning the night before, you will be just fine. Near Rome station there is also a nice litle market where you can buy food, toiletries, snacks, wine, produce and etc. The Wine was super cheap! All in all, I definitely recommend Hotel Cervantes to anyone traveling to Paris. I am very satisfied with my stay there. I recommend the following sights: Sacre Couer Cathedral (get ready to exercise), Notre Dame, Seine River Cruise, Louvre, Chateau Versailles (plan to be there a whole day), Shopping, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: the sunset under the Eiffel Tower. The sun sets around 10:30pm and around 11pm they light up the tower and its absoultely amazing. Take a few bottles of wine and get ready to watch the tower light up in the night sky, its INCREDIBLE! Oh.. Dont forget to enjoy the food! Dont worry about gaining a few pounds, you'll definitely walk it all off! Another tip: Get a Paris Visit Metro Pass... they have them for 1, 3 or 5 days. Its about 30 euro per person for the 5 day ticket. So thats about 6 euro a day, very cheap and much better than paying for tour buses and taxis.

Tiny shower room was fine, not helped by the sloping ceiling. No shelf in the shower room to put toiletries, nor hook to hang clothes. Shower stall was impossibly tiny (I'm 6 ft tall and kept hitting the ceiling and walls) and ... because of the lack of a shower curtain, impossible to keep the floor outside the shower dry! Breakfast buffet was delicious, though options were slightly limited. (essentially continental breakfast components, plus scrambled eggs and sausage.) Caveat: The hotel is adjacent to the rail yard of the Gare St- Lazare, so you hear and feel the trains from your room. As long as you keep the windows/doors closed, the noise isn't a problem. And after a while, you don't notice the \"tremors\" either. With windows, close, you do have to use the air-conditioning, which was effective.

We had a room on the 5th floor with a small balcony. The room was so tiny, especially by US standards (of course) but the bed was HUGE, definately a king size bed in a tiny room was a little weird. But it was a comfy bed with good pillows. Nice little flat screen and desk. Closet had enough room and hangers. The bathroom was a little too small and the shower was awful and the \"door\" kept NO water out from getting all over the place. Not enough room on the vanity for much at all either which is hard when traveling with toiletry/makeup bags. The room location on the quiet, small street was nice because there was NO street noise for the 3 nights we were there and always had the windows open. Not much of a view, but nice having a balcony. The location is great with 4 close metro stops (Europe and Rome being the closest). Just a short walk to Place du Clichy for lots of restaurants and sites. We rented a car for the morning we left to drive to Beglium and Luxembourg at the Gare St. Lazare station area (Avis) and it was easy to walk with bags to pick up the car. Driving in Paris is no worse than driving in NYC, just FYI. Might be a bit daunting for those who are not used to chaotic, close driving though. Breakfast every morning was really good and in a nice, quite, clean breakfast room in the basement. Yeah, there's not much of a view but they had BBC news on the flat screens each morning which was nice. Fresh breads, croissants, juice, great coffee, meats, cheese, etc. Really enjoyed it. I would definately stay at this hotel again. The staff was helpful and as nice as could be for French people (they really are all unpleasant people and not just to Americans....I think unpleasant in general). Didn't use the bar or internet area. Oh, and we used our Bank of America World points to pay for this hotel.

At check in i tried to speak only in French and the woman receptionist spoke back slowly in French instead of automatically speaking in English as so many people do. I find if you try to speak a bit of their language they appriciate it more. Our room was 601 next to the lift on the 6th floor. We knew the rooms were small before arriving so were not too dissapointed with the size. Everything was spotless as the hotel has had a full refurb in 2009. Breakfast was really good. A choice of pain au chocolate, croissaants, danish pastries and bread rolls. Add to that cereals, fresh fruit salad, yoghurts, cheese, hams, sausages and scrambled egg. Also fresh fruit juices and tea and coffee. Very impressed. The location of the hotel was the biggest plus we felt. At the top of the road ( Rue de Berne/ Rue de Moscou) just cross the main road was the Rome metro underground where we found that most stops on the metro were no more than 1 change away. Just further along the main road over the train lines was a lovely street full of amazing restaurants. I am a chef and i was really impressed with the food. It's only a 10-15 min walk to the Moulin Rouge and another 10 minutes to the trendy district of Monmarte. We purchased the 5 day Paris visite card zone 1-6 and we must have saved a couple of hundred euros easily. We travelled from CDG, to Fontainbleau, Chateau Vincenne and all over central Paris. It cost 47 euros and you get discounts into many places also. You must do the bike about tour (Check out things to do) Cost is 30 euros and it lasted 4 hours with the lunch break.

Having been to Paris 3 times before I am aware that standard of Paris hotels most certainly do not match hotels in most other places.

The hotel Cervantes is absolutely brilliant for Paris standards, a million times better than I was expecting!

As the hotel has recently been refurbished, the decor is modern and boutique-ish, making it very fresh and clean.

The room is tiny by North American standards (we had the Standard Double) but had a very contemporary and function design with pretty much all of the essentials you would need. The bed was comfortable and had clean sheets. Various hooks were placed on the walls so that you could hang up your purse or clothes. It also had a mini bar fridge, safe, LCD TV and free wireless internet. The bathroom was a bit tight but it had everything (toilet, shower stall, sink) and not a lot of the hotels do. The only downside was the air conditioning. We were staying on the top floor and Paris had temperatures of 33 degrees or more for the first couple days. We had already turned up the AC to the max but it was still pretty hot and unfortunately, the answer we got from the staff was that their AC was already on but it was just too hot. Fortunately, the room had a fan so we were able to plug that in and was fine. This really only lasted for a couple days. The rest of the time the AC seemed to be quite adequate. As for the staff, we had a mixed experience and found that it was luck of the draw, depending on who was at the desk when you had a question. Our experience ranged from extremely helpful (i.e. giving us thorough and detailed directions and drawings to get to a different metro station and giving us excellent recommendations for nearby authentic french cuisine) to short one word answers. The breakfast included with the room was great. While it is the same thing every morning, it was still prepared deliciously and the pastry was fresh every morning. I wouldn't suggest eating it every day but its definitely a great alternative if you need to rush out early in the morning and just need to grab a quick bite to eat. All in all, I found we got pretty much what we were looking for with the price we paid - a clean and comfortable room, a convenient location to the Metro as well as a street filled with a variety of restaurants for you to choose from. One piece of advice - if you plan on taking the airport shuttle to the airport, make sure you ask the front desk to help you with booking it sooner rather than later as it tends to get filled up. Same thing with getting a cab to the airport ( if that's what you want, pending on the number of people, the cost is pretty comparable and a cab is more direct since there's no other pickup or stops at the other hotels). Hope this helps!

The receptionist immediately called the cleaner who informed her that she had knocked and announced herself before entering my room, which was not true. Then the receptionist asked me \"why didn't you have the do not disturb sign on\" and \"well what do you want me to do\". I was further upset with this response. First, that the cleaner told a different version of what happened, and then the indifference of the receptionist. I had expected an acknowledgement, apology and assurance that this had not happened before and would not happen again, instead of made to feel worse.

Everything is very clean, nice and tidy, incl the rooms. My room happened to be pretty spacious for European standards especially for when I was traveling alone. The design was quite easy on the eye, not too overly avant-garde.

Get the carnet, a 10-ticket packet, a good value that has no expiration date. Other tips in your Paris trip: -they offer shuttle service to the airport, 34 euros for two people. Usefull if you need to get to your international flight in time. -you can walk to Sacre Cour from the hotel a good 30-40 minute, start in the morning, stop by the Moulin Rouge for some pictures, then take the metro back to the Rome station from the Anvers station near Sacre Cour. -make use of their FREE internet access near the lobby, to map out your walking directions to restaurants or other places in Paris. -It rained one day and we decided to eat at Scarpetta an Italian restaurant adjacent to the hotel; service was ok, the food was enough to quell your hunger. Keep this option in your back pocket in case of a rainy day. -be wary of your camera battery, I kept running out of battery power in the middle of the day in Paris-- there's so many photo opportunities all over the city/museums/tours. -there is an English option for the automated Metro ticket machine, so don't be afraid to use it to buy your tickets, the metro subway train system is reliable and is a very good way to get around the city. -when coming from the CGD airport, I used the Air France bus which took you near the metro station Charles De Gaule Etoile after two bus stops (approx 45 min to 1 hour), board the train to the Rome metro station (only 5-10 minutes away). I used the bus instead of taking the Metro from the airport to avoid Gare Du Nord station, a big hub where you would transfer. It is a breeding ground for pick pockets/thieves, not particularly good place to be in when lugging your luggages from the airport. -avoid the Welcome Restaurant near the Tulleries stop, the French guy in there is anti-tourist, so rude!

We booked our room through Hotels.com and chose this hotel based on its location and price. We found that the price through hotels.com was substantially lower than we could get either through ringing them directly or through their own website. As we were in a car, we needed parking but the hotel doesn't have any. Fortunately there is a bit parking lot just by the Rome station up the road, which was 23.50\u20ac for 24 hours. We got there to a pleasant enough reception, parked the car and went to our room. The first thing we noticed was the constant sound and vibration of trains trundling past. My boyfriend, who is a light sleeper went to the reception to ask if there was any chance of a different room. The receptionist was very rude and it made him quite angry - she point blank refused to accept that it was a problem. She then said I could have a room directly above our current one as an alternative - something that was pretty ridiculous. (It turned out that we were wise not to take this option, as they were renovationg the two floors directly above that one! - although the sound of drilling was still apparent 2 floors down!) .Worst of all she refused to let him discuss it with the manager, thus preventing him any escalation of his complaint. To be honest we would have gone for another hotel if it wasn't for the fact that it would have completely ruined our brief stay. The trains stopped at about 2 am and started at 5am ish. The breakfast was good though and the reception area was contemporary, although the rooms seemed a little tired and traditional - perhaps all the building works will sort this out? So to sum up, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is deaf or only needs 3 hours sleep every night. If you have to come here, I would make sure that you pick a room at the front of the building - ours was a standard one, so perhaps you can get a more restful nights sleep if you have a superior one?

Several hundred meters down the street is a large postal sorting facility, but otherwise the neighborhood is largely average-Parisian-residential. In Paris, little is more than a 5-10 minute walk from a Metro or point of interest, and for this reason the Hotel Cervantes was a wonderful value for someone with a taste for trendy boutique-hotel style but without the interest in paying for those with the highest profit margins.

I spent a long time searching around for hotels reading reviews and comparing prices and I finally plumped for this one and I have to say I was very pleased with my choice. First of all the location is great. It is in the 8eme arrondissement of Paris which is about a 20-25 minute walk away from the arc de triomphe and the champs elysees. However there is a metro station (Rome) literally a minutes walk from the hotel at the end of the street. The metro is fantastic and can get you anywhere in no time at all with trains coming along every couple of minutes. Its a little crazy at first but get yourself a good map of the metro (we picked up a free one from the airport) and you soon get the hang of it. As well as being near the metro stop there is also a Supermarket just around the corner from the Hotel as well as a main street with a range of restaurants etc. At the end of the day its almost impossible to stay somewhere that is near everything, as long as you are near a metro stop you can get everywhere easily and quckly and the area this hotel was in was nice and quiet and seemed safe even late at night. The room had everything we needed. It wasnt massive (as most rooms in Paris are not) but it was clean, the double bed was comfy, there was wardrobe storage, a safe which was free to use, air con, a mini bar (we didnt get anything from it but used it to keep cool some drinks we got from the supermarket!), a tv with a dvd player (most channels were french but there were a couple of english speaking news channels) and the bathroom whilst being quite small was modern and clean with a very good shower and a hairdryer and towels provided. Also the hotel has free wifi access throughout which was useful. The hotel in general was nice there was a small bar, a computer with free internet access and an outdoor covered terrace. The staff were all friendly and the ones we encountered on reception all spoke very good english, Julie being especially helpful and pleasant. Check in is at 3 o clock, we got there early but there is a luggage room where you can leave your luggage. We had breakfast included in what we paid which was really good. Nothing special but enough to get you going for a day of sightseeing. There was Tea/Coffee/Fruit Juice, sausages and scambled eggs, cereals, selection of french pastries and bread, cheese and ham, yogurt, fruit. Breakfast is 7-10 and you can even get it brought to your room between 8 and 10 for no extra charge. Whilst it wasnt 5 star by any stretch for what we paid it did exactly what we needed. I looked at cheaper ones which didnt look too nice and obviously there are more expensive ones but for a short sightseeing break where you dont really spend too much time in the hotel other than sleeping then it was perfect and id definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Paris on a budget. The only slight negative I could say about the hotel is that the street it is on does back onto some train lines. Our room was near the back so it was possible to hear trains going past but it wasnt really loud or that frequent to be honest and unless you are a really light sleeper then it shouldnt be a problem, it certainly didnt cause us any problems as we slept like logs after lots of walking about. That is the only bad thing I could say about the hotel and like I say its a very minor issue but thought it was worth mentioning. One general tip I would give anyone arriving in Paris via Charles de Gaulle airport who deosnt have transport to the city centre organised is to use the trains rather than a taxi. We used the trains and they were so simple to use. We bought a Paris Viste pass for 3 days, zones 1-6 which as well as covering the centre of Paris (zones 1-3) also covers the train to and from the airport. This was 39 euros each and gave you unlimited travel for 3 days. Taxis from the airport range from about 50-70 euros i think so getting the train is much better value. The Paris Visite passes can be bought for more or less days and you can just get them to cover the city centre and not the train to the airport and obviously the price changes accordingly. In terms of this hotel you simply get on the train at the Airport and take the RER line B to Paris Nord station (also called Gare du Nord) and when you get to here the La Chappelle metro station is a walk next door and its on the Blue 2 metro line which Rome station is on (the one closest to the hotel). Its about 30-35 minutes from the Airport to Gare du Nord and then about 5 metro stops from La Chappelle to Rome which is about 10 mins at the most. To sum up, if you are visiting Paris on a short break and are on a budget and want a nice mid range hotel close to the sights in Paris that is clean easily accessable then id strongly recommend this hotel. Ive gone into quite a lot of detail but really just wanted to get across how good this place was for what we were after and hopefully the review and hints will be helpful to anyone else lucky enough to be visiting this absolutely wonderful city.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cAn ok hotel !\u201d", "Author": "ItalGrecoLon", "ReviewID": "UR25280674", "Content": "My company uses this hotel. The rate is 95 Euros, but I have seen the same rate advertised, so doubt it's anything special. It's a non smoking hotel.

Unless you're short, you will not be able to lie in the tub. However, the shower is powerful and suited my needs. The hotel offers free wi fi in the rooms which is perfect. Breakfast is included and whilst not a huge choice, it's clean, very fresh and really, there's enough selection to set you up for the day. The location is good, there are some 3 Metro's close by and Lazare station 5 mins walk away. This suited me since I needed to take a bus to my office. If you're coming from the airport by train, the blue line runs straight to Rome metro which is 5 mins walk from the hotel. Place de Clichy is 5 mins walk away, so ample restaurants in that zone. You can see the top of Sacre Coeur from there. What I like about the area is that you're not the ' tourist hub ' so prices tend to be more localised, yet sightseeing spots are close by. Negative points : St Lazare is close by and trains run under the building. I could faintly here them. I could hear people walking in the room above mine and doors closing. I'm a heavy sleeper, so this was not a concern to me, but if you're a light sleeper, consider this. The train cannot be avoided, but noise within the hotel itself, what I will say, and this is my 2nd stay here for 1 week periods, people are generally sightseeing or business people. I never heard televisions, loud music or drunks. After 230, it's pretty quiet with people getting up early the next day. Miserable reception staff by and large.

It didn't have to be the best since we were a little tight on budget and since I figured we'll be spending most of the time outside anyway. I did my research and found that the reviews for this hotel was overall good. And so I booked it. When we got there it seemed that it has been updated since the interior looks alot better than the current photos online. But as we roamed the city by foot and subway(we stayed in Paris for 6 days), I realized how inconvinient the hotel location was. We saw better hotel locations close to main attractions and market places for almost the same price. If I would have known this I would have paid a little bit more for another hotel w/ a better location. Also, I knew the rooms were going to be tiny but it was so small that we couldn't even unpack our 2 big luggages since there was no room in the closet. And so we had to lay them on the floor and it took up most of the space in the room. Overall, this hotel was okay since it was fairly clean but if you're visiting Paris for the first time I would suggest staying close to the main attractions and/or market places as you will save money for making your own food (we made our own baguettes & paninis) and you'll save time.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cCervantes - A bad experience\u201d", "Author": "Skytalker", "ReviewID": "UR7299612", "Content": "We intended to spend Easter in Paris.

First day we had a premium double which wasgood, then moved in the double, but we assume that was actually a single room arranged as a double.

Actually parking is possible in the parking Europa, which is a public parking, close enough to the hotel, at a rate of 21,5 EUR/day. Very bad subway connection to the main attractions of Paris.
