If you are just looking for a place to sleep, with a great location, and a helpful staff, it is O.K.

Comparing to other hotels classified in top 5 on tripadvisor site (or with other hotels we have stayed in for the same amount of money), this hotel never deserves its place. It is supposed to be modern, but we agree with the only reviewer saying that it is rather cheap and already looks like it has not been renovated for a long time (excepting the breakfast room, which is better than the rest of the hotel).

The potential downside: we had a duplex,  the stairs are split  steep - they would not suit the slightly infirm or uncertain, or those with poor eyesight. Lighting in the living room might also be too low in the evenings for readers with fading sight. But these weren't major problems for us (and we're in our 50s!) Outside - it's the centre of a European capital,  as of Nov 08 there is still building work going on opposite during daylight hours - but it wasn't too noisy,  we were out most of the time; the bin men do bang around outside at midnight - but no more than in Paris or Barcelona;  the bells at the nearby Monastery might disturb you briefly at 06:30.... But on the upside: the main room was wonderfully spacious, high  airy; the kitchen (locked away behind what just looks like a storage room door) with fridge, micro  two electric rings was very handy - especially as there are no other coffee making facilities; the bathroom was clean  bright with a powerful shower; the bedroom area was quiet  comfortable. This is more a small apartment than just a hotel room. Staff were very friendly  chatty,  the location was great - just a few minutes walk from Metro, stores, supermarkets etc and not much more from galleries, palace, cathderal.

The hotel is what could be described as 'boutique' and the decor is unusual, but we loved it. All our rooms were generously sized, the couples all had rooms with kitchen facilities, which of course we didnt use with all the bars and restaurants close by. The hotel is very centrally situated, and there was a small amount of noise from people in the street as they returned to their beds, but it wasnt unbearable, and we expected worse in a city centre. The breakfast was included and had a huge selection - we were very impressed as we had not expected so much to be on offer - fresh fruit, cereals, meats and cheeses, and freshly ground coffee.

Even after staying there a little while it seemed always very confusing to get back to the hotel. There is a laptop on the front desk for guests to use which is nice, though you are standing there with the desk clerks and feel sort of rushed to hurry up and finish.

We saw this hotel rated here and emailed the staff about a stay less than a month before...they were prompt with their replies and very helpful. You will not get a notice from them once you have booked and they do not charge your credit card until you arrive. It was hard to find them as they are in a very small side street about five minutes from Plaza del Sol. The upside is that it is relatively quiet at night as opposed to hotels directly on the plazas. We booked the attic suite which had ample space for our multi-day stay, including a small kitchenette with a stove, sink, countertop and frig. We had to ask for plates, knives, pans, etc, upon arrival. Sometimes its too exhausting to eat out and you can go to a small deli around the corner or the large supermarket at El Cortes Ingles down the block to get provisions for a small meal in your room. We arrived at 8 a.m and unfortunately there was no place to wash up or change clothes since rooms aren't ready until 1 pm. The am receptionist was a bit cold and distant and told me I could change in the small bathroom next to the breakfast room. In her favor, she said we were invited to eat breakfast that a.m. The breakfast is self-served from 7am through noon...a real plus. The hotel caters to a lot of Europeans, so count on cold cuts, toast, pastries, potato tortilla and fresh fruit and juices as the typical fare. The coffee and tea was served by an automated machine which did fine. They played Euro trance music during breakfast which is not particularly soothing for the older set (which was a lot of the guests at the time we stayed). They offer the Spanish dailies and the major English daily for news. The decor of the lobby and rooms is quite 70's modern with hard surfaces, bright red colors and spare industrial materials that are arranged in a nice minimalist way. If you stay in the attic you'll need to watch out for the slanted ceilings. My husband really banged his head on one. There are some problems with sound insulation within the hotel. You can hear every door slam...but the bargain price of a little more than $200 for the suite made it hard to complain. Of all the receptionists, most are professional, but not very warm or forthcoming. One man never said hello in the five days we were there! However, there is one longtime receptionist, Luca, who was a true asset for the Room Mate franchise...he was so helpful and warm in his manner that he may have just put the others in a lesser light.

While I most prefer small places of charm and character like Villa Rosario where we stayed in Ribadesella, I also like larger places of stripped down asceticism like Monumento San Francisco in Compostelo, and even utilitarian places like Vincci Puerto Chico where we stayed in Santander, all on our recent trip to Northern Spain. And I even like super modern, trendy, hip and youthful\u9225\u651ahich is what this place was. It\u9225\u6a9a a member of the Room Mate chain which originated in Spain and has expanded rapidly including one of their newest, Grace, in NYC, and another, Waldorf Towers in South Beach, Miami. Madrid has four of them, though at the rate they\u9225\u6a99e expanding it may be more by the time I post this. The magazine they left in the room said they were building 25 more in the next year. Laura is located up a hill slightly behind the opera house and it\u9225\u6a9a the location that\u9225\u6a9a the most off putting of any aspect of the place.

Even the stairs themselves are interesting. Each is a half step, alternating the place where you must put your foot from the left to the right\u9225\u650fot good for a person like myself with problem ankles and knees who most often ascends, and especially descends, one step at a time, placing both feet on the same riser at once.

I\u9225\u6a93 pleased to say I survived all this without mishap, but I admit I\u9225\u6a87 not knowingly book similar digs again, even for the flaming orange accents.

No clue what that was all about, but it was arresting. What I didn\u9225\u6a9b like was that this loft bed, was by virtue of the small amount of space available, pushed next to the wall causing me to have to shimmy in and out of bed if I didn\u9225\u6a9b want to wake my husband to let me out like a regular person. Bathrooms follow the white minimalist formulaic pattern with stainless steel small vanities and black bubble floors that can be laid of a piece. I suppose you have to do somethings simply if you\u9225\u6a99e going to erect 25 new minimalist places in the next year in parts unknown. The breakfast room and the breakfast were very nice with more pix of QE1, orange, black and white d\u8305cor, Chilewich placemats and all the standard offerings, all of which were included in the standard room rate which turned out to average 155 euros per night, though higher one night and lower the next. Truly not a bad rate for a clean, interesting hotel in the center of a major city. I\u9225\u6a87 not return, but that has more to do with me than the hotel. For young, hip, agile under 50 somethings, I\u9225\u6a87 say it\u9225\u6a9a a pretty good deal. But I\u9225\u6a87 investigate the Madrid locations of the other members of the chain before booking this one. It may be that the others are in better neighborhoods and still afford the same trendy vibe.

We were, as it seems many people are, upgraded to a duplex even though we had booked a standard room. That was a nice touch. However, the bed was in a loft where the ceilings were very low and the air was very stuffy and too warm. (It was unseasonably warm for October.) We couldn't open the balcony doors because of street noise and safety concerns, so we tried to put the air conditioner on low, but it would only blow hot air. When I inquired about this at the desk, twice, the staff told me this was the hotel setting and would not explain further. I overheard another guest complaining about this as well, so something must have been wrong, but they did not apologize or make any attempt to remedy the situation, which was frustrating and made for a very uncomfortable night's sleep before our flight. The design is funky and the room had great light. The very design-y stairs were cool to look at, but I would not want to climb them after an evening of drinking! As others have mentioned, while the design looks cool now, it seems like it will not age well. It's very cheaply constructed, which is why it's so affordable for a city center hotel, which we appreciated, but it will probably be pretty banged up in a year or two. Also, the bathroom is teeny tiny. I kept banging my elbows against the shower glass trying to wash my hair. It's pretty much the exact size of a tall person. Toiletries smelled nice, though.Fantastic location, easily accessible to Plaza Mayor, metro, other central sights. Free Internet access was a big perk, especially given the low price of the room. I also liked that you were rewarded with a low rate for booking 30 days or more ahead on the hotel website--we paid only 108 Euros for the room, which included breakfast. Breakfast was plentiful. Nothing hot, but I don't like hot things for breakfast anyway. We ate fresh fruit, yogurt, tortilla, fresh juice, coffee, and were very pleased with the selection. The heating problem was a bummer, and hopefully it has since been fixed.

Although the staff was very pleasant, there is very little interaction and it felt very hands off. This might be a good thing for some travelers but I was hoping for more of an experience and this was more of just a place stay. There aren't enough common areas to meet and get a feel for the other visitors and it felt isolated inside of the hotel. The design of the hotel, although contemporary in it's direction, is fairly cheap and lacking in anything memorable. The general finish, polish, luster, is simply not there and the design felt rushed and because of this, the materials and construction methods used, will not age well and I expect the interior of the hotel to age poorly and look rather worn within a few years. I would definately hire a better designer next time and try to design an entire experience and not just a nice pattern for the wall paper. The breakfast was very nice and the juices were amazing. The area is great, very central, but at the same time it felt secluded and tucked away. One thing that I must really object to is the hotel conducting construction while there are visitors. A good bit of the hotel was being built or remodeled while we were there. We were not told that this would be the case and the first thing we saw when we walked in was a huse plastic tarp hanging from the ceiling, with dust surrounding the entrance way, and a cheap paper sign pointing to a makeshift reception desk. That alone is just unacceptable, I mean I don't get a chance to travel much and you want it to be special, all of these things added up to something sub par. I would not stay there again. I must say the next hotel we did visit was absolutely perfect and definately did exceed all of our expectations.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR225635611", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "unit11"}, {"Content": "Good looking Laura Spent a week at the Room Mate Laura with my girlfriend. I was immediately impressed by the attractive lounge  reception area. The room was also very stylish  spacious. The balcony,whilst not big, was a nice place to relax. We certainly didn't feel cramped. The weather reports  free apple left everyday was a nice touch.The location of the Laura was very impressive. Everything noteworthy in Madrid was located within a 15/20 minute walk. It was also located close to all the Metro stations. Unlike other reviews, we found the area very quiet  had good nights sleep.The staff were amongst the most friendly we have encountered. They always said hello  were a great help when looking for football tickets or restaurants. The room was spotlessly cleaned everyday. The breakfast on offer was of a good standard  replenished every few minutes. It was great that we could go down so late in the morning.We did have a few complaints. The beds are very hard. The bathroom was plain compared to the rest of the room. A bath would have been nice. Some of the plugs didn't work and looked dangerous. There was no written information on hotel services in the room. We had to ask for everthing at the reception (how to avail of the internet,etc) but this was compensated by the friendliness of the staff when we did ask for information. Also building and drilling work began unannounced during our last day. Would've been nice to have been warned as we were woken up by the drilling.Overall, Laura is a very pretty hotel in a great location with brilliant staff. With a few adjustments she could become a supermodel of a hotel.Ps. Bring a map as our Taxi driver didn't know where the hotel was.

I found the hotel website whilst looking at hotels on various sites. I was instantly attracted to the modern chic feel to it and it seemed a good location to explore the city. It was my boyfriends birthday present so i booked the penthouse suite for our 3 night stay at a discounted price of 81 Euros per night (about \u62e255). I got a discount as i booked over 30 days in advance directly with them.When we arrived in a very hot Madrid we found the hotel really easily, the closest metro stop is Opera and it is literally 2 mins walk. The Hotel is just off a small square which has a church, a couple of restaurants and another big hotel. The entrance/decor etc is just like it is on the website and very impressive. The staff on reception were fantastic and very friendly from the second we arrived, they all spoke perfect english and are happy to help with any query. Our room was superb, a large kitchen/dining area, a large relaxing area with plasma tv, minibar and sofas, a good size bathroom with double shower and a wonderful bright bedroom overlooking the square. All decorated very minimal and chic. It was well worth the money i was gobsmacked!! Breakfast was buffet style, served till noon everyday and had a great choice of cereal,fruit,toast etc. It was always fresh and nothing was ever running low or empty. the spanish omlette they served was very moreish!It was in a perfect location too, everything was within walking distance and easy to find. The hotel is in a quiet area but very well lit with street lights so we never felt threatened when coming back in the early hours.

Check in was effortless and quick and in no time we were off to our duplex room (\u9227?90/night including breakfast booked on hotel website) on the ground floor. First impressions were good. A large duplex room with white minimalist d\u8305cor, featuring a large design mirror and a mezzanine which has its own bathroom encased in glass. On closer inspection the faults started to appear. First off the air-conditioning was not working and it took the hotel more than 24hours to get it to work. At 32c in Madrid at the time it can get VERY hot in the room. As we requested a smoking room ashtrays had to be ordered from reception. The desire of the hotel to be a design boutique hotel has not been followed through on. The glass bathroom had a lot of white paint smeared on the glass and did not come with toiletries. The main bathroom was simple and clean (at least on the first day, more on that further below). However the fixings were cheap and the again attention to detail was lacking. The tiles were pained over (badly) with white gloss pain making it look cheap and not so boutique hotel. The mini bar did not contain a bottle opener and again reception had to be asked for support. Now it should be noted that the staff were very courteous throughout and helpful.The bed was large but not very comfortable.The breakfast is a simple buffet affair. Unfortunately no hot options were available and at times there were problems with items not being replenished quickly enough. Housekeeping was not the best. One day the bathroom was only selectively cleaned and towels were taken but not replaced. This and the lack of air-conditioning for 24 hours were the biggest problems we encountered.Overall Room Mate Laura is centrally located (expect some noise from the outside), has stylish rooms and with a bit more attention to detail could be a good mid price hotel. However if you have ever stayed at an international boutique hotel you will come to realise that this property has not yet achieved what it set out to do. In its current format it is very hard if not impossible to justify \u9227?190 a night for a room.I should state that when I mentioned the problems we had during our stay the hotel immediately dropped the price to \u9227?50 a night and apologised.

The staff were also helpful, as others have mentioned - on the day we left they were willing to open the restaurant early for us to have breakfast (our flight was in the morning). The fact that it had no bar or restaurant made it a no-fuss hotel, and with so many facilities nearby there would really be no need.

I saw pictures of the decor and fell in love with the place. It is very cool decor... but I have to be honest, I did miss a gym, pool and room service like other hotels would normally have. The breakfast service also wasn't great, dirty plates lying around, etc. But as far as other hotel rooms go - it's very cool. It's more like a small one-bed apartment really. so in a nutshell, i would say:if you're looking for a funky place in the heart of the city - GO! if you love your little luxuries like room service and pools/jacuzzis.. don't.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR181513289", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PQOTD"}, {"Content": "Cool Place Except the Jack Hammer Outside I was traveling with my girlfried for two weeks and decided to stay here while in Madrid. We picked this place becuase it had a great write up in the New York Times.  Upon arriving we were impressed with the lobby, room, and location. It was more than expected. While checking in they also gave us a room upgrade which we thought was awesome at the time.  Our stay kind of took a downward turn at about 7:00 AM the first morning when we were awoken by jack hammers right outside our window. I understand hotels can't stop construction for guests, but a little warning would have been nice. We also thought it was amuzing that they put us in the room directly above the jack hammer. We questioned whether the room we were given was truely an upgrade.  We complained about this situation, but were offered no sympathy or help.  If visiting Madrid we would definately stay here.

A friend and I stayed at the Hotel Laura about a month ago for a several-day visit to Madrid. Our experience there was wonderful. First of all, we were warmly greeted upon check-in and upgraded to the duplex level room at no extra cost. The room was huge considering what we paid; substantially bigger than our New York apartments. I believe the same type of room has been described before: living area on first floor, complete with bathroom, walk-in kitchenette, large couch, breakfast table, balcony with street view, flat screen wall mounted TV, and closets; and bedroom, desk area, and more closet space upstairs. Yes, perhaps the staircase is a little tough to master, but the room has a great setup and you can't beat the amount of space. The furnishings are not at all opulent, but they are trendily attractive (think IKEA) and the space is very pleasing to the eye considering its cost.The free breakfast is really fantastic--most free hotel breakfasts (at least in the states) consist of bad coffee, instant oatmeal, bagels, and some sorry looking fruit. This breakfast included cured meats, cheeses, a Spanish omelette, a wide range of juices, breads, and much more. Two very small gripes: first of all, the hotel advertised a free wi-fi connection, and maybe it's the fault of my computer, but we couldn't connect (and the man at the desk at the time was of very little help). Second of all, the room could have had a couple more basics in the kitchen--we wanted to have a bottle of wine and some snacks before heading out but there were no wine glasses, corkscrew, silverware, or plates. However, considering the amount we were paying it's okay to let that go.Overall, it's a wonderful budget/boutique hotel in a great location, the perfect place for young travelers looking for a cool, affordable, place to stay!", "Date": "Mar 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR450053348", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BDM"}, {"Content": "Noisy Hotel...       room 209", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR510203928", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "margarida"}, {"Content": "All \"fur coat and no knickers\" Went to Madrid for second time in 3 months with 2 friends and stayed here based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm afraid my confidence in Trip Advisor reviewers has been shaken by this hotel as I didn't find it anything like as good as many others. It has some good points but it places far too much emphasis on quirky style but lacks many of the basics I expect of a decent hotel. Like many other reviewers we also had a duplex room, this time on the ground floor, with the bed downstairs. The upstairs space had a ridiculously deep sofa at 90 degrees to the flat screen TV and was frankly a waste of time. The stairs have already been commented on before and I agree with those who feel they are a health and safety hazard.Good points: nice staff, good location, good bed, good shower, bathroom small but ok.Bad points: 1 key between 3 guests, no additional copies available; pointless upstairs space; no tea/coffee facilities in room or even in hotel except at breakfast time (I know there are lots of places nearby but sometimes you just want to chill out in the hotel or room); only one ironing board for hotel, which was unavailable for hours because another guest had it but reception didn't know/care where it was; uncomfortable chairs in room. There was just nothing that made us want to spend anymore time in the room than was strictly necessary.In summary this place falls a long way short of what I consider a 4 star hotel to be, I would say 2 stars would be more appropriate.

Also strange providing kitchen but no utensils, had to ask for 2 cups and saucepan (no kettles) to make tea. All minor quibbles though - this is a good hotel with helpful staff in a great location.

We had two plasma TVs and a second bathroom on the upper level with a toilet and basin. The lower bathroom had shower, toilet, bidet and basin.The included buffet breakfast was more than acceptable although we would have liked a slightly wider choice.Only two slight negatives:The nuns in the nearby Converito de Las Descalzas Reales were awakened, along with the rest of us, by clanging bells at precisely 6:30 a.m. The ringing did not go on for long and we managed to gett back to sleep again afterwards.Also there were workmen digging up the small cobblestones around the hotel.

This hotel has a wonderfully central location and exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Breakfasts are super (the best oranges ever!) and the rooms are spotlessly clean. Very comfortable beds. The price for the central location is the noise, however, which seems to go on throughout the night. And right now they are doing major (and I mean major)roadworks right outside the hotel, and the road-digging starts very early. The rooms are fun and quirky (we were apparently 'upgraded' from a duplex to a 'superior duplex' - does everyone get upgraded?) but the the layout was a bit weird - the 'sitting area' was upstairs, though there were no comfortable chairs or sofa - you had to lounge on what was basically another bed, there were certainly no bathrobes, as promised in the blurb, and yes, there is a kitchenette, but not a spoon or a cup or a plate or a saucepan - so you're a bit limited as to what you can do in it. Small bathroom and not the greatest shower either - one of those that is difficult to get either not too hot or not too cold. Nowhere to hang your coats when you come in from outside (well, unless you totter up the very steep stairs to the cupboard that's located in the 'sitting area'). I hate to be critical because the staff were so wonderful but it just wasn't very comfortable. I'd like to think we'll be back - but I suspect that we won't.
