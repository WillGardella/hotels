Location is great since it is not directly on a major thoroughfare with lots of outside noise. Only noise we did encounter was from the free-way on 1 side of the hotel, so you might want to stay away from that side if you can help it. The suite was typical Homewood with cleanliness a top priority. Lovely kitchen with attractive dinnerware and nice cooking utensils. 2 TVs with even a DVD player with the TV in the living room area. We didn't use the pool or the hot tub, but we did investigate the area and it was lovely. If you are on a tight budget this place is worth paying a bit more. You do have breakfast available and a \"light\" dinner with beverages and salad. The dinner is comparable to what most people serve at home: salad, bread, main course, veggie. We took advantage of it both nights we were there and were quite pleased. By the way, from reading one review, I guess some parents were not very responsible with their children at the breakfast. I did not experience this, in fact the hotel staff were very careful at the evening meals to be quite attentive when the children started to get a little out of hand. One problem I had with this hotel was the breakfast choices. I can't say that a nutritionist was on board to help with the offerings. The only dry cereals were both sugary (fruit loops, frosted flakes). Carbohydrate heaven (bagels, english muffins, bread, waffles), yogurt (none of this was fat free or low fat), fried potatoes, scrambled eggs with peppers (not a great morning food), and white looking sausage patties. There was apples and bananas and some juices. Sorry , but if these were my choices 3-4 days in a row I would gain 4 pounds even with walking miles in an amusement park and leave with high cholesterol. There was no edible protein with the choices from this spread. The Hamptons at least offer low fat yogurt and healthier dry cereals with oat bran or wheat flakes. I'd like to see all of the Hilton Chain be a bit more consistent with their morning breakfast fare. Sugar free syrup was available and skim milk, but if you use both these products on the high calorie unhealthy choices, what's the use? Granted, I am sensitive to food now that I just went from a size 16 down to a size 10 this past year on a nationally known weight program. But why should I be positive about a breakfast that I can't eat because it is mostly unhealthy choices? I'd stay there again, and buy my own yogurt, Cheerios, or whole wheat bran flakes if need be.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Harbor, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location - but watch out for the elevators!\u201d", "Author": "magwiech", "ReviewID": "UR124565827", "Content": "Nice, clean, spacious room at a reasonable price.

This Homewood on Marbella Palm Ct. is in a cluster of three hotels which included a Hilton Garden Inn, this Homewood Suites and a Marriott property. Although easily accessible and convenient to most any Orlando entertainment venue, they are isolated and not in walking distance of anything. Homewood and the Hilton Garden Inn share a nicely landscaped pool and other amenities such as a fitness center. We stayed for three nighs in a king studio suite which was more than adequate for the two of us including a full kitchen, a dining table, sofa, desk, nice size closet, safe and a bathroom with shower (no tub). Don't know if other rooms might have a bath tub. Parties of more than two might prefer a one or more bedroom suite since in a studio, the bedroom is not private. We were also given popcorn on our first night. Homewood offers a full breakfast every morning with the standard staples of hot or cold cereals, fruit, yogurt, bread, english muffins, pastries, bagels and waffles with a rotating selection of eggs, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy and so on. This particular Homewood had some of the best breakfast attendents I have seen. Tables were cleared promptly, cleaned and the food area was always kept spotless and well stocked. The only thing I can think of is that there were no cold cuts or cheese for our European visitors. Homewood also offers a \"light\" dinner Monday thru Thursday. On the Monday we were there, they offered a fresh salad with choice of dressings (Ken's) plus bratwurst with peppers and onions on a roll (if you want) and large potatoes like steak fries, except they weren't deep fried. No dessert. On the Wednesday we were there, they offered meat ball subs. Again, the meat balls were prepared in a nice tomato sauce with onions and peppers and a fresh salad was available. They also had something like tater tots. No dessert. Lite dinners also included your choice of beer (lite), wine (red or white), lemonade, tea and I'm really not sure about other beverages. The evening dinner attendants were also very prompt at cleaning tables and restocking food items. Our room was cleaned and refreshed every day and towels were changed when we wanted. One warning I would mention. This hotel has a booth that sells Disney and other tickets. Their ticket prices are higher than you can actually get at the parks. They say the premium is for the convenience of not waiting in line at the parks. I say, get to the park early and there are no lines.

The kitchen contained a full size fridge, stove top, microwave, dishwasher and utensils/mugs/cups/plates. We didn't do any cooking however we stocked the fridge with drinks and treats (to take to attraction parks). The attraction desk is convienent and prices are a little less then purchasing at the parks directly. Instead we found a company that sells only park tickets and tours in Orlando. It is only 7 minutes from the hotel and offers discount tickets with no fees or gimics. See www.orlandofuntickets.com. We purchased tickets locally at their office however you can purchase online. The price quoted online was price charged at their office. The hotel is located approx. 10 min drive to Disney entrance, SeaWorld, Aquatica. Hotel offers shutlle but we never used it. There are few hotels in the area however no restaurants in walking distance. We highly recommend to rent a car. Best deals appear to be with Dollar. (tip-sign up for their email notices to get all car promotions.) The pool was a great size to keep eye on children. There is a walk in shallow area for young kids.Pool and hot tub closes at 10p.

We did call back after leaving and had found the confirmation information which had a confirmation number, but no price. We also had a note with who we talked to when we booked the room and the price and called back with this information and they agreed that the person we talked to does work there and they may have agreed to the price but we had no proof. So my suggestion would be to request that they send the price with the confirmation number and/or when you check in you make sure that you ask the price and have them put it in writing(at check in they did not have us sign or initial anything regarding price as other hotels do).

The next day we left our room shrotly after eight and left a tip on the pillow with a request for extra towels and amenities ( seeing that we were travelling with kids who just loved the pool ). We got one extra bath towel. Upon arrival there were three washcloths in the bathroom. That was the only day we had that many washcloths. Everyday it kept dwindlingand dwindly until the final day we got only one. Thank goodness after this observation I went out and purchased washcloths for my family's use . I left a tip on the second day and still no changes. There was a penny on the bathroom floor from the night of arrival until the day of departure. The carpet was never vacuumed and when we returned to our room at after five one afternoon the dirty linen and garbage was still piled high outside our room door, the diswasher was still going and sink was left with bits and pieces of dried salad.

The laundry facilities were clean and well kept and most of the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. I got a soda from the vending machine that had expired and the lady at the front desk graciously changed it and apologized. My son borrowed the basketball and while at the pool another guests took it from him. I was told by the lady at the front deask that he was responsible for it and would have to pay. I asked how much it would be and was told the management would get back to me. Later that evening the manager calle dnad advised that he was aware and the there would not be a chrge. We were very grateful for this kind gesture. The breakfast was ok and we ate dinner one night and my sons enjoyed the fettucini. Another good thing is that the room was ready upon check-in.

We booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and from the pictures available on their website etc. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by friendly guy at reception. Everyone was so tired after the long flight but he went through checking in very quickly and within no time we were all in our rooms. The rooms were brilliant. all the couples had a large bedroom (with the biggest bed we had ever seen & the most comfortable) and also a sitting room and kitchen seperate to the bedroom. Both the bedroom and sitting room had large flat screen tvs with variety of channels. The family of 4 had the same kind of room except for 2 beds in the bedroom. All rooms have a kitchen area with microwave, full size fridge, dishwasher etc. This was a brilliant add on for all of us as we could stock up on food and drink. Breakfast was ok. You need to be down early to get the best of everything but the children & the some of the adults (\"they were like \"big Kids\") loved the mickey mouse waffle maker.

When we travel with the kids, we have one key requirement: We want a suite with a separate living area that has a pull-out sofa bed and, most importantly, is separated from the bedroom with a solid door that can be closed -- otherwise, the separate living room area is useless. Our one bedroom king suite had just that (see attached photo). We enjoyed the free continental breakfast each morning. You can make your own Mickey Mouse shaped waffles, which the boys loved. Previous reviewers have complained about long lines to make the waffles, but we never had to wait. We ate breakfast early each morning so we could get to the parks when they opened and we were not there during one of the peak Disney weeks but, whatever the reason, we we never had to wait to use one of the three waffle irons. In addition to the waffles, they had a variety of other rotating items throughout the week -- eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, hash browns, cold cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, bagels, toast, english muffins, donuts, muffins, juice and coffee. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety, given some of the complaints I've seen here. As for the food at the evening manager's reception, which is available Monday-Thursday evenings, I again do not understand some of the complaints. Sure it wasn't gourmet, but it was perfectly edible and our kids were fine with it. We ate dinner for free at the reception during the 2 nights of our stay when we did not have dinner plans. One night they served tortellini with garlic bread and salad, and the other night they served enchiladas with rice, re-fried beans and salad (on the 2 nights we had dinner plans elsewhere, meatball subs and stuffed peppers were on the menu). If you are a gourmond, eat elsewhere (there are tons of restaurants within a 5-10 minute drive). But if you want to fill your stomach for free and save some time while you are at it, the reception is a perfectly workable option. The room was clean and comfortable. When we left early each morning for the parks, we requested early housekeeping service from the front desk and each day the room was made-up when we returned mid-afternoon for the boys' naps. The pool area was clean and they have a nice jacuzzi. The carpets in front of the elevators were stained, but this seemed like a localized problem in a high traffic area. Otherwise, the entire property still looks new (it's about 2 years old). As others have mentioned, the hotel backs I-4 and some of the rooms front the highway. Our room overlooked the side parking lot, but you could still see the highway (see the attached photo). You could indeed hear traffic noise, especially if you stood close to the window. But we found that by leaving the fan on the A/C unit in the \"on\" position instead of the \"auto\" setting where it circulated on and off, it created enough constant background white noise to mostly drown out the traffic noise. You could still hear the occasional loud motorcycle go by, but the noise never woke us up. There is nothing within walking distance of the hotel, so you need a car. The heavily developed section of Palm Parkway (with several hotels and restaurants) runs from County Road 535 to Lake Street. The Homewood Suites is on the other side of Lake Street, across from some currently undeveloped open lots. The free Disney transportation picks up in the morning and returns in the evening, so it only works if you are going to spend the entire day in the parks. If, like us, you need to come back mid-day for naps, it is not a viable option. Downtown Disney is less than a 10 minute drive. It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the parks. There is a Winn-Dixie grocery store less than a five minute drive from the hotel if you want to stock the fridge in your room. With a AAA rate, we paid less than $100/night for this room, which was not only a tremendous value, but a fraction of what we would have had to pay for comparable accommodations at a Disney hotel.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best places I have ever stayed...\u201d", "Author": "pickytraveler2011", "ReviewID": "UR108397562", "Content": "I was in the Disney area for a conference...all of the conference attendees stayed at Coronado Springs, on Disney property, and I choose to stay at the Homewood Suites a few miles away...totally worth it.

We spent two days in Disney World and since the hotel provides a free shuttle we had planned to take it to save the $14 parking fee at Disney. The shuttle runs 3 times in the morning (8, 10, 12) and three times at night (5:30, 7:30. 9:30) and at 11:15 if the park is open late. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the return times too much since we had been at Disney many times and I thought we might want to leave earlier, especially since it was not crowded.

We were torn between this Homewood Suites and the Embassy Suites just a short distance down the road, which we've LOVED for years. We felt that the 2-bedroom suite at Homewood Suites would give our family more room to spread out, which would be worth the extra money. We did like the hotel quite a bit. The location is great -- very convenient to Disney and plenty of other restaurants. The 2-bed suite was very nice -- the bedrooms were a very good size, and the bathrooms (yes, 2 baths!) was larger than my bathroom at home! The room was VERY clean and the staff was very friendly. We had originally booked the suite for 2 nights, and although we were unable to stay in that particular suite for a 3rd night when our plans changed, the staff were very helpful and accomodating in helping us move to a smaller, 1-bedroom suite for the last night of our stay. However, there were some DEFINITE downsides. The 1-bedroom just does not measure up in any way to the Embassy Suites 1 bedroom in terms of size or furnishings. Also, the free breakfast is NOTHING compared to the Embassy Suites breakfast. For example, one morning at the Homewood Suites, there was one chafing dish of (obviously powdered) eggs with peppers and onions (which my kids would not touch), some greasy sausage, and a couple of Mickey-head waffle makers for make-your-own waffles... with people lined up 6-deep to use them. We ended up making-do with stale bagels and getting lunch at the Park. At the Embassy Suites, however, we were able to get made-to-order omlettes and all kinds of other goodies, which filled us up for a day of Park-hopping. :) So, while the hotel was not bad by any means, it was not stellar either. It was not worth the extra $$ to get the 2-bedroom here vs. the 1-bedroom at the Embassy Suites.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cANY REQUEST IS A PROBLEM....\u201d", "Author": "travelforyou02", "ReviewID": "UR99470016", "Content": "Things were not operative....No bulb in work light,, tub stopped up AND bathroom door lock was broken.

I am a 40 year old mother from Connecticut. I stayed at the hotel with a 3 year old and two adult grand parents. Prior to our stay, we requested adjoining rooms. When we checked in, we were given rooms that were on the same floor but far apart. When we asked for closer rooms (which would have made child care easier, etc.), THE MAN AT THE RECEPTION DESK WAS RUDE and TOUGH and he was not able to accommodate our request. ANOTHER THING TO BE WATCHFUL ABOUT was that we were quoted $125 a night on the phone/Internet prior to the stay, but were charged a higher rate at the end of the stay. This is deceptive. WHEN YOU CHECK IN WATCH THE PAPER WORK THAT YOU ARE SIGNING TO MAKE SURE THE HOTEL IS NOT CHARGING MORE THAN WAS QUOTED. Also, we had a clogged toilet. When we called reception, they said that they would send down a plunger to the room. It took an hour to receive the plunger. Also as someone mentioned, they were scarce on the toiletries. (this was not a big deal the main complaint again was the rude nature of the employees at the front desk). Also, DO NOT PURCHASE DISNEY TICKETS FROM THE KIOSK AT THE HOTEL b/c they are not upgradable. For example, we purchased 2 day Disney tickets from the hotel. We decided to go to the parks for a third day. When we were at Epcot on the third day, and purchasing tickets for the third day, the woman at Epcot asked if we had purchased tickets for any prior days. We said yes, but when we showed the tickets we had purchased from the hotel, the woman at Epcot said the tickets were not upgradeable. So we paid $87 per day as opposed to $67 if we had bought 2 day tickets directly from Disney to begin with. Also, the prior review about the hotel being right on Interstate 4 was correct. It is littleraly right on the highway, so IF HIGHWAY NOISE BOTHERS YOU AT NIGHT, IT IS LOUD.

We are picky when it comes to hotels, especially with cleanliness and worn out rooms. I had read a lot of reviews before booking a hotel, and we could not have been happier with our selection. We stayed in a one bedroom suite, which was perfect for our needs. The hotel supplied a playpen for our son to sleep in, which we set up in the bedroom. It gave us the separate living area to use at night after he went to bed to watch tv without disturbing him. It was nice having the full kitchen in the suite. We bought groceries at Winn Dixie when we arrived, which was only a 2 min drive from the hotel, and made our breakfast and lunches in the room. The hotel room was very new and modern and very clean. We found it very quiet. The hotel appeared to be at full capacity, but we never heard anybody in the hallways, or noise from other rooms. I noticed some guests on here have complained about noise from the highway, but I have to say that we faced the highway and could hear very little traffic noise. My 2 year old slept right through the night each night of our stay, so that should tell you something. The housekeeping staff was excellent with changing our garbages and refreshing our towels on a daily basis, and a very friendly bunch. They even found a way to track down what room we were staying in to return my son's shoe after he dropped it in a hallway without us noticing. Most hotels would have just sent it to a lost and found, but I thought that was a really nice touch. Whenever I called the front desk for something they were very polite and took care of our requests very quickly. If you plan on visiting theme parks then this is in a terrific location, especially for Disney. Downtown Disney is about a 5 min drive, and the Magic Kingdom less than 20 mins from parking spot to parking spot. At around $100 or so per night, this hotel is an exceptional value being that close and convenient to Disney. For the 5 min extra drive just outside of the Disney gates you save big time money and get a really great room. There are tons of family friendly restaurants just a 5 min drive to the end of the Palm Parkway. If you like Mexican I highly recommend Chevy's, we had a great meal and excellent service there. There are several shopping outlets nearby. The Lake Buena Vista outlets are 10 mins away, same with the outlets on Vineland, and the Prime Outlets near Universal are just 15 mins away on the highway. The pool area was really nice with a walk in shallow end that my son loved, and a nice hot tub, basketball court, and fitness room on site as well.

I always do a ton of research and try to have an open mind, and thought I had found a pretty good deal. This Homewood Suites was mediocre. The front desk staff was very friendly and mostly helpful and the outer appearance was good. The room was spacious for us, and it was nice to have a kitchen to cook our food! The problem started with housekeeping, or lack thereof! The second day when they supposedly came to refresh the room we were left without dishsoap, the floors were not vacuumed, and leads me to wonder if any detergent was used to wipe the counters. I never called, as I had already called about the NON-existent water pressure in the shower. Which was immediately rectified. My second complaint was the \"free\" breakfast and managers reception. The food was HORRIFIC! The managers reception meal for us was Manicotti that tasted as though it had been microwaved a few times and then placed onto the buffet line after it had cooled completely! It was not even fit for animals! The breakfast wasn't any better. The only good thing were the waffles, that you had to wait for 20 minutes to get to. The powdered eggs were worse than what they serve at the hospital I work at, and the sausage was cold. I am pretty sure the food industry people should shut that portion down for things not even close to temperature!!!! I can't understand why someone would even bother to offer 'free' food if its going to be this bad just forget it!

It was a pleasant surprise to get there and see a reasonably clean suite with all that we were looking for (an equipped kitchen, a comfortable and clean bathroom and a linving room separated from the bedroom). We stayed there for 5 days during the Christmas break in 2010. The only catch is that we had made reservations for a two queen beds and when we arrived at the hotel they didn't have one available, so they put us in a one king bed with a sleeper sofa, offering to change rooms on the following day (which we refused due to the hassle of moving luggage instead of enjoying the day in the amusement park). My personal thought is that the booking system and/or the hotel front desk people aren't very organized. The hotel room was neat but the kitchen table was small (only two chairs). We used the sleeper sofa for my children and the king bed for my husband and I. The bathroom was cleaned everyday and toiletries efficiently replaced. Our room was facing the highway, but we slept well evry night (no noise at all or maybe we were too tired to listen). The breakfast was average, but it was included in the room price, as well as the evening meals from Monday to Thursday (fast food style with a choice of salad). It got very crowded after 8am (we tried to wake up early to have breakfast and then drive to the parks). We were very pleased with the morning waitress (her name is Najat), always smiling, helpful and swet with our children. The laundry room was pretty busy in the evenings and the front desk wasn't very helpful with providing change for the washer and dryer machines (sugestion: have a coin change machine at the laundry room). We drove everyday to the WDW parking lots (about 15 minutes drive) and the hotel location was very convenient (and it's worth paying the parking fee of $14). It is necessary to have a car to stay there because if you want a grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants, etc, you will definetely need a car to move around.

I was like, \"Where is the food?\" Tip: Go and buy breakfast items at the Winn Dixie instead. Dinner was absolutely horrendous. No flavor and not enough variety! It taste like cafeteria food at a nursing home. After two nights of that, we ended up eating out and purchasing food at the Winn Dixie. A little wear and tear with the furniture and inside of the bathroom. I'm not trying to nick pick because I love staying at Homewood Suites. However, I felt like this particular one was cutting corners in housekeeping, food, and amenitites.

I have been in some pretty fantastic Hilton franchises, and, as an HHonors member, the hotel always knows what I like before I get there. For example, I prefer to be in a quiet area, away from the elevator, on a high floor. Now, I must assume that the desk personnel here are somehow passive agressive. I got the expressway-front room on a low floor, right next to the elevator. So, your HHonors status cuts no ice here. 1. About the location: It is off of the \"new\" Palm Parkway, next to a Residence Inn and a Hilton Garden Inn. I chose this property because of favorable experiences with an excellent Homewood in Fort Myers. The Homewood is right next to the e-way. Now, I don't mean, near it. I mean, my room was 75 feet from the traffic lane of an 8 lane (at least) freeway, (I-4) that has noisy traffic day and night. about a third of this hotel's rooms face I-4 directly. The room is separated from the traffic by a two-car-deep parking lot and about 15 feet of grass. Now, the I-4 isn't up on a hill, or down in a ditch. It is the front yard of this hotel. Harleys and semis and cars with no mufflers. 24/7. 2. More on location. There is no walking distance restaurant, or anything else. In fact, there are no sidewalks on Palm Parkway that would let you safely walk somewhere. The hotel literature in the room says that a plaza, with an overpriced grocery store and some restaurants, is \"walking distance\". Well, I suppose, if you walk in the road, and are in really good shape. 3. More on location. The Prime Outlets--the really high end Orlando Outlet Mall--is \"across the street\" But of course, the \"street\" is I-4. To get there, you take a circuitous 3 mile drive, through endless and confusing intersections, and it takes 20 minutes if there is not much traffic. At 5 pm, it took us 45 minutes. This is a very congested part of Orlando and every drive everywhere is a challenge. Don't be talking on the phone or texting, people drive crazy here. Now, back to the hotel: Cleanliness. I agree with the other reviewers about the dirty carpets in the hallways, elevator lobbies, and lobby. When I read that review, I was skeptical. But once I got here, I was grossed out by the filthy carpet. You sure don't want to be walking around her barefoot. It appears that the light colored carpet has never been cleaned. Or even vacuumed. As for the room, there was plenty of mold in the shower/toilet room. There really is no ventiation in there, so the shower steam just keeps it moist in there, and there was mold on the tile grout both on the floor and the walls of the shower. Of course, that could be remedied with a brush and some bleach water, but this place seems to adhere to the \"five minute lick and a promise\" cleaning. Seriously, the guy who cleaned our room spent 5 minutes. They put a card on the bed, \"if you want your sheets changed more than every third day, please leave this card on the bed and we will do it...\" And some stuff about \"being green\", and about how you should reuse your moldy towel. Well, even if you ask, they WILL NOT change your sheets until the third day. Doesn't matter the reason; they just aren't going to do it until you are scheduled. More on the cleanliness issue: I agree with the poster who found the dust and dirt in the room. This may be a new property, but unless they actually start cleaning the rooms, this place won't be a Homewood much longer. Homewood folks: you need to do an inspection ASAP. Food: The breakfast sucked. Period. I have enjoyed these free breakfasts at other Hilton properties. But, don't bother with this one. It was just plain nasty. The only redeeming quality of this food was that it was free. Of course, you may not want to eat it; this place draws a lot of people with little kids, and there is a lot of sneezing, coughing, and touching of the food by the little tykes. Eggs were cold(not to mention tasteless, and I suspect, powdered), and this morning, it was \"turkey patties\" instead of sausage. I didn't actually see anyone eat them, but lots of folks spit them out. They did have those \"make your own\" waffles. The line was an hour. We ended up getting our own breakfast food and making it in the room. So, if you are thinking, stay here because breakfast is free, skip that thought. Oh, and PHONE CALLS: The placard in the room says that all local calls are free, 'except....\" $3 for a .2 minute call to make a restaurant res. This hotel seems to be back on the phone system guest rip off bandwagon. So, overall, this hotel was noisy, both from within and without (noisy drunk guests and screaming kids, and, of course, the freeway). It was dirty--and I don't have high cleanliness standards. I do think that if somebody is actually going in there and really cleaning, the MOLD on the tile in the bathroom might actually get cleaned up. It is poorly located. And, worst of all, it was MORE EXPENSIVE than most of the dozens of other Hilton properties in Orlando. Like I said, I can't think of a single reason to stay here, unless your uncle is one of the owners. Mark my words, this hotel will be an Econolodge soon. I can't believe that Hilton will keep them in its stable.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Gem!\u201d", "Author": "adolson", "ReviewID": "UR87813665", "Content": "We decided to stay at this hotel because the convention hotels were sold out and the cost was 89 a night with AAA.

Few CONS: the unfriendly front desk lady who was there when we first came in. Though she \"chaged a little\" after that, she wasn't as friendly as the rest.

Normally we stay at Staybridge Suites properties so this was the first time at a Hilton extended stay or suite hotel. We arrived around 8pm the day of our check-in and were greeted by a professional and friendly front desk agent. We had booked a studio King bed suite, but to our surprise we must have been upgraded to a one room King suite... this was awesome! The hotel looks and smells like it is brand new. Yes there are a few signs of wear and tear here and there and the hallway carpets could use a cleaning soon, but that is to be expected when you run a hotel very close to a theme park and have very little down time in the busy months to do deep cleaning and repairs. I would almost bet that they will do repairs and deep cleaning in the late fall or winter months. Anyway, the hotel is very brightly lit inside and out and is decorated with a modern touch. The kitchen had granite countertops, cherry cabinets, dishwasher, stovetop, garbage disposal, cabinets filled with pots, pans, toaster, coffeemaker, utensils, storage containers for food, plates, etc. The refrigerator was full size... the only disappointment is that it does not have an icemaker like the Staybridge Suites properties do. The living room area was rather spacious with a sofa/bed, easy chair, ottomon that serves also as a coffee table and a nice size flat screen tv with a dvd player. The bedroom had a king bed, two nightstands, dresser with a flat screen tv on it, a nice size closet with full mirrored doors, in room safe, vanity and sink which was very spacious and well lit, separate room for the shower and toilet. The bedroom area is separated from the living room by a door. The shower has a crescent rod which gives you extra room inside and the area is brightly lit. The only complaint is that they do not have a bathroom fan in the shower area and it gets very steamy and wet in the area from the shower. Hotel towels were new and very fluffy and the soap, shampoo, etc. was Nuetragena products which smelled nice. The bed itself was very comfy, high, and soft... but not too soft. They offer you hard and soft pillows on the bed, we asked for a few more and they had no problem with that. Each day housekeeping would clean the room and give us coffee, tea, and popcorn which was nice (same as Staybridge Suites). The housekeepers seemed very accomodating to your needs and requests, THE ONLY NUISANCE I found was that they were inconsistent with their daily cleaning- some days they would forget to leave soap or shampoo or towels or dishwasher soap. We would always alert the front desk and got what we needed but it was a bit of a pain in the butt sometimes. The tv has a decent selection of channels, but I would have expected a better variety considering that it is a Hilton property. The breakfast area is rather big and I never found it to be too crowded or not maintained properly. My only complaint with breakfast is that it doesn't start early enough and ends too early as well. I understand that some people get up early to go to the parks, but some of us stay at the parks late and would like to have a late breakfast and breakfast ends at 9:30am which is early compared to other hotels. The breakfast offerings were rather extensive with danish, bagels, donuts, cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, usually two hot offerings each day ( omlettes, hash, bacon, sausage, eggs). The best part of breakfast is that they have made to order waffles. You can make your own waffles and they offer two kinds... the regular square kind or Mickey Mouse (head) shaped waffles... that was really cool. The hotel website said that the hotel offered made to order omelettes and eggs but they simply had pre-made (probably frozen) products... this was somewhat of a disappointment. Overall though, breakfast was good. Parking can be a problem at this hotel as it seems like they only have enough spots for exactly the number of rooms they have... meaning, if you arrive late at night you have to search and search for a spot and it is probably in a non-desirable area of the hotel and not close to an entrance. The hotel is located right next to I-4, but we never heard any traffic noise from our room and we always knew how traffic was flowing on I-4 before we left the room. My only big complaint about the hotel is that it is definitely off of the beaten path. It is on the Palm Parkway which in Lake Buena Vista has hotels, restaurants, and shops on it... HOWEVER, where the hotel is located is a newer undeveloped section of the Palm Parkway and there is literally NOTHING around you but undeveloped land. You cannot walk to restaurants and shops, plus it is quite a drive each day to State Road 535 which goes through the heart of Lake Buena Vista. Still, because the hotel was new and offers a lot it was not bad being quite so far away. We were still close to Downtown Disney which was awesome. OVERALL- 1. The hotel is like brand new and is very clean. 2. The breakfast is quite nice. 3. The Mickey Mouse waffles were awesome. 4. The suites are quite spacious. 5. The hotel is off the beaten path and further away from the rest of the hotels and restaurants in Lake Buena Vista. 6. There is nothing around the hotel as far as restaurants and shops ( just undeveloped land). 7. Parking seems to be at a premium when the hotel is busy, sold out, or if you arrive late! 8.

Three months before my visit to Florida, I made guaranteed reservations for 3 rooms at this hotel. Upon arrival, I was told that they type of rooms I had reserved were not available. The front desk clerk (Francescka) lied and told me that there was no difference between a suite and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suite. (The next day I overheard her tell another guest a completely different story.) Instead of being put in the deluxe suites that we reserved, we were given 2 regular suites and a studio suite. I asked to speak to the manager. I was told that he would call me in my room. Of course, he did not call. I later found him and explained the problem. The manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name is Thomas McGrath. He shrugged and simply said the rooms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything that he could do about it.

She did not even bother to ask if we wanted to speak to a manager. Upon returning from vacation, I contacted Hilton International to register a complaint. They asked the general manager of the property, Tony Keathley, to contact me. Although Mr. Keathley sent me a generic e-mail indicating that he had been asked to contact me, he never responded to any of my questions. NEVER! Upon analysis of my hotel bill, I learned that not only were we not given the rooms that I guaranteed with a credit card, but we were charged a HIGHER RATE for smaller rooms. Since when can a guaranteed reservation be changed so that guests are charged a higher rate for smaller rooms? In response to the lack of professionalism and lack of communication, I have registered a complaint with the attorney general for Florida.

This is ironic in that I saved a full page add for Homewood Suites, from the USA Today, showing a full buffet, This was nothing of the sort. Most days, it was hit and miss as to if there was food in the steam tables. Some days there were pastries, some days there were not. I have been to economy motels that have had their act together better than this. As far as the evening reception, we visited one night, to find one side full of frozen hamburger patties, that had a weird grey color to them.

Have been going back and forth to many different sites to find the best rate offer, I was down to 10 hotel... This hotel was not one of my choice, reason being that there's no pictures, and no rating at all since it's a very new hotel. Don't really trust anything that doesn't have any review or pictures. Close to maybe 2 week prior to my vacation, the pictures from this hotel is finally posted on most of the major websites, ie: Expedia, Travelocity, sell off vacation, etc... Rates on their main web page was $89.00 with smoking rooms available. On Expedia, they have a lower rate but smoking room is not guarantee, so I decided to call them to book it and see what kind of rate they can give me. The lady on the phone was very nice and patient, she offered me a Studio King Size bed with smoking for only $69.00. I wanted a one bedroom, but with that rate, Studio it is. Later I found out that we also get the follow: FREE BREAKFAST FROM MON - SUN, FREE PARKING, FREE WIFI IN THE ROOM, FREE INTERNET IN THE LOBBY, FREE SHUTTLE BUS TO DISNEY, FREE DINNER MON - THUR. I've read a lot of other review about this hotel. Everyone seems to complaint about the breakfast. To be honest with you, I think they've improve. Who ever said the table was dirty, blah blah blah blah blah and that they don't refill the food, stuff like that. I have no problem with any of that. The tables might not be cleaned right away after people leave, but there's only 2 people working and what do you guys really expect? This is only a 3 star hotel, and this is FREE... if you want a better service ... then why don't you visit a 5 star and pay 6 times as much? I am sure they can do better... but with the rate that we are paying and with free breakfast? this is not bad at all ... IT'S a GREATTTTT hotel... Dinners are not the best... I mean if you have kids.... they would love the food and the service... but if you are looking for a full meal and stuff... they are just not for you ... but I've eaten there like twice... and the taste are not bad at all ... just not the kind of food that I would want to eat on a vacation. PEOPLE! DON'T EXPECT YOU GET RIBS AND STEAK FOR THE RATE OF $69.00 A NIGHT WITH FREE BREAKFAST/DINNER OFFER.... I have to admit that the location is not the best though, or let's just say that if you are not planning to rent a car to go around, don't stay at this hotel. Since this is a new hotel, it's basically located somewhere far in the woods (I'm guessing there's going to be more things build around it at a later time) but for now, you'll see no cars, malls, shopping center, restaurant, in a walking distant. There's no restaurant in this hotel either... so if you don't have a car... don't stay at this hotel... Shuttle bus service is not the greatest either... here are the schedule going to 8:05, 10:20, 12:25 and pick up times are 5:30, 7:30, 9:45. If you miss the bus... it's a two hour wait in between. Plus, this shuttle bus ONLY takes to you EPCOT... but if you are planning to go to other parks, you can exchange buses at EPCOT.... Taking a taxi will cost you $25-30 from EPCOT.

What I got was an oversized hotel room, more like a studio at that. Biggest gripe was the location of the TV. From its position (and limited (due to mount) turning ability), there is not a clear view from either the bed or the couch. Service at checkin was terrible. I wont even bother you with my rant. The breakfast has limited hours (6:30-9:30) so get up early and get their early! I went down at 9am and everything was nearly gone. Nothing looked fresh or appealing (pics attached). Just powdered eggs. home potatoes, and some sausage patties that looked like they have been out since 6am. They were out of juice; only water and coffee. I took about 10 bites and left. Luckily it is free; I would never have paid for it. No service either. As with the sister property - no one spoke to me all. Final peeve was the lack of hot water. It was warm but I like a nice hot shower. If hot water is your thing then get up early for that too because you may not have it if you are lazy like me at 9:30. Not the best property in the Hilton chain. WiFi was free as is the parking (although the wired internet in the room did not work). NOTE TO ATT CUSTOMERS: Really bad coverage at this property. If making calls and using your phone (like an iphone) are important - go elsewhere. Never a good signal and often it went out completely.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood Place except for Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "eduncanz28", "ReviewID": "UR45450978", "Content": "Nice hotel except for breakfast. Check-in no problem. Checked in Fri. night after going to Disney. Clerk says breakfast is 7-10 on weekends. Arrived in lobby at about 9:15 am Saturday to see most tables full of dirty dishes and many food bins empty at breakfast bar. Girl at breakfast area states it is normally staffed by 4 people, but today they only have 2 working. Breakfast is very basuc. Don't count on this breakfast if you are in to healthy eating. It mainly consists of sausage, eggs, toast, egg beaters, cereal and waffles. There is also milk, juice, yogurt and coffee. Whole oranges were present this am. Cereal consisted of Rice Krispies. When I pointed out empty Cheerios bin, staff said no more Cheerios were available. On Sun. morning I once again arrived at the breakfast area around 9:15 am only to be greeted with a significantly worse scene. There were now obviously more people staying at the hotel, as long lines of people were standing in front of all food bins, many of which were empty. In addition, every single table was either occupied or cluttered with dirty dishes. Ended up eating on hearth in front of fireplace since no table was available. Asked to speak to manager - desk clerk says she's busy working on the breakfast situation, that she just became aware of the issue, and can't speak to me. I replied to the desk clerk that the same breakfast issues were already present yesterday, but the clerk could offer no further assistance. Breakfast was basically the same except no fruit whatsoever. Still out of Cheerios. One positive about food area is coffee and hot tea are available 24 hrs/day. Room itself was very good overall except one kitchen cabinet door was quite loose and living room air conditioner struggled to get room cool. Bedroom A/C worked well. Parking was very good - free and secure-appearing. Location is great for Disney. Turn right out of hotel and go 2.5 miles for Wal-Mart Supercenter. Grocery store next to McDonalds off I-4, exit 68 is very high in prices.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "sapish", "ReviewID": "UR41621380", "Content": "Very impressed with both this hotel and the personnel.
