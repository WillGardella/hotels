I can either sleep with the window open (it's noisy outside) or with the poor air conditioning on (it's noisy inside) or not at all. Which explains why it's now 11.50pm, I desperately want to sleep... but can't. Like most Paris hotels, this one is horribly overpriced, so suitable for Company Expenses and little else. Would I pay my own money to come here ? No. Would I bring my family here ? Hell, no. It comes with one complimentary feature: Wi-Fi in your room. That's it. If you want a glass of water, fine, that's 5.50 Euros from the mini-bar. The hotel has a bar that (according to the literature) is open from 12am until midnight during the week... but at 10.20pm, it was impossible for me to buy a pint. The place was locked up tight, and the receptionist just told me \"It is closed... But you have a mini-bar, non ?\" Honestly, it isn't a bad place, I couldn't ever award it one-star... but it's hellishly overpriced, the rooms are comfortable but horribly hot, and it's location is far away from everything.

A 4 minute walk takes you to the Pereire metro (Line 3) and Pereire-Levallois (Line C) RER stations. The area around the hotel is quiet, but not dead. There are shops, restaurants and bars all nearby - a great place to relax after a good long walk around the city during the day. If you want a more lively area, you may wish to look at hotels in the Latin Quarter of the city. It takes approximately 20 minutes to walk to Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but if you want to save your legs, you can hop on the metro and be there after a few changes (if it's wet, the metro is a life saver).

We flew into Orly and it took about 20-30 minutes in a taxi to reach the hotel. The perriere area where the hotel is located is nice and chic and so much quieter than the opera areas etc and the champs elysees! After hours spent on foot battling through the crowds it was a bit of a blessing to come back to Perriere and the quiet hotel! We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite which was a great size considering hotel rooms are always notoriously small in Paris. Bed was huge (two twins pushed together) and quite comfy. Beyond expensive mini bar (standard) and nice views of the parisian street below. Only criticism of the room would be the tiles in the bathroom - which was basically a wet room with bath AND a huge shower (rarity) but they seemed to be slightly unstable and in desperate need of resealing/regrouting! The l'occtaine products were a lovely touch though, as were the macaroons in a hotel ampere box! Staff all seemed very friendly and gave us maps etc which we constantly used throughout our stay. We went to Disneyland for the day and used the train which took about 40 minutes on the RAR - would definitely recommend this! The hotel also offered us the chance to prebook tickets there but we had booked them before we got to Paris. The main sights are about a 20 minute - 30 minute walk away, depending on your pace - staff will give you directions and its a really pleasant walk down a pretty much straight road! TOP TIP: Don't get the hotel breakfast! Although everything is expensive in Paris..what is offered for 17 euros is definitely not worth it!

It was in a wonderful location in the 17 arrondissement, which is very chic, and it was very near both a metro and RER station.( I mean, a one minute walk). The breakfast is expensive, but we didn't try it, and the award-winning restaurant was closed for August, which is to be expected. There was a Monoprix around the corner, where we bought breakfast. The staff are multilingual,although some of them speak better English than others. (I spoke French the whole time, so this is based on the conversations I heard at the desk). There is a smell of what I think is vanilla orchids throughout the hotel. It's strong in reception, where there are a lot of orchids, and seems to be very slightly piped through the air con, (which is very good and also very quiet). There is a different, musty smell on the first floor corridor, but the carpet there is scrupulously clean. (Cleaning a carpet can actually release smells: it needs to be shampooed until the smell has gone). This is the only reason I'm not giving a rating of excellent. I feel it might be unsuitable for anyone with asthma. I did hear the receptionist talking about hypoallergenic rooms, so maybe they don't pipe the flower smell into the other building. (There are two buildings, the Villiers and the Ampere). The beds are very comfortable, but the huge double is actually 2 singles shoved together with a sheet spread over them to make one huge bed. This is common practice in France, but might be annoying for honeymooners. You can ask for a 'lit matrimonial' if you want an ordinary double, but I'm not sure how many they have. The room, a 'classique', was reasonably spacious, (very big by Parisian standards) and the shower was out of this world. Adjustable massage shower head, speaker in the bathroom, and, best of all, L'occitane toiletries, which left me with super soft skin. One thing I hate is unadjustable temperatures, as I like an ice cold rinse to close my pores. (I feel cold otherwise when I go out). This was perfectly adjustable. A caveat: the glass panel needs to be aligned with the edge of the bath, and even then, there is a fair amount of leakage onto the floor, but they are very generous with towels. (If you are a tiny, French-sized person, that may not happen). The best thing of all was the electronic blackout blind, which leaves you in total darkness, thus assuring a very good night's sleep. ( I am, I should point out, the lightest sleeper ever). My one quibble, and it is a small one, is that the receptionist couldn't post my postcards for me because they weren't stamped. I found it extraordinary that a) he didn't know how much a postcard cost to post abroad and b) that he couldn't take it off my credit card afterwards. That said, French newsagents sell stamps (timbres), so I bought the stamps at the airport and posted them there. Perhaps that's the normal practice. They were happy to print out our boarding passes at reception, and they called a taxi for us, which arrived promptly.

Very relaxed, calm. The room was a good size, with a big bed, a couch, big bathroom and a good view of the garden from most rooms. It was very clean and had everything needed. Minibar, French tv (with a few channels in English), complimentary safe, complimentary wifi (although you need to go to reception to get it activated), laundry service, room service - everything needed. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were great. Only issue was broken A/C (only in our room) - this wasn't fixed during our stay but they provided us with a desk fan and offered us free drinks at the bar and free breakfast for the duration of our stay. Which is fantastic customer service! As for the bar, restaurant etc. it is very expensive - 5\u20ac for a lemonade! Breakfast is 17\u20ac per person per night (for us 51\u20ac a day!) - it is very expensive but I loved it! A great selection of pastries, bread, fruit, yohgurts, eggs, bacon, sausage. A buffet style with a relaxed yet formal feel. It is rarely busy and generally quite quiet. With patio garden tables as well as indoor tables, you get a choice. The staff are all very friendly, and they didn't hesitate in helping us asking for directions, ordering a taxi for us, sorting out any issues we had. Even as you passed them in a corridor you always got a \"bonjour\" and a smile - which makes the difference. I think, though, one of the best things about it is that it is not touristy - it is real Paris. It is very easy to get to the tourist sights, though. The RER will take you to the Eiffel Tower, Les Hotel de Invalides, Notre Dame and the metro will get you everywhere else! The French Metro system is very efficient but take a few moments to get your bearings with it as you do need to make 3 or 4 changes if you want to go somewhere. When it comes to transport, I recommend getting a carnet - which is 10 journeys for 12\u20ac and you can purchase anywhere. Sometimes the Metro stations are not staffed, use the self service! It is very simple and you can work your way around it with very little French. If you want to site-see then I recommend the L'Open Tour (The Yellow Buses).

The hotel went under new management last year I think and just does not provide the same value for money and the rooms are starting to look Jaded. One of the previous benefits of booking the Ampere was the buffet style breakfast that had been included in the price. This was not only a nice touch but also a convenient way to start the day before going out to explore wonderful Paris. This time round the hotel was expecting us to pay 18 euros each for this and although nice it is certainly not worth this. The rooms are now in need of renovation and starting to look very outdated with their early 1990's heavy bed covers. I have stayed in the Ampere happily for many years but just began to feel that this year the hotel management are starting to take their customers for granted. The room air conditioning was bearly noticeable and the carpets looked stained and tired, the wooden desktops in need of varnishing. Put simply the rooms are not horrendous but they are certainly not in keeping with a modern 4 star hotel.

It was the only seat in the sunshine, but two staff members insisted that we move to another seat which was about 15 feet away but in the shade, apparently it was the outdoor seat seat for the bar.

Facilities: We booked well in advance and provided our contact details yet the hotel failed to inform us before arriving that they had the plumbers in and there was no water from noon to evening the whole time we were there . They didn't think to perhaps offer a couple of bottles of water in the room that might have been used for washing hands and faces or even to drink. They'd also torn out the bar near the lobby for renovations but hadn't set up any alternative facilities. I'll never get used to the fact that most European hotels seemed to have dispensed with any sort of welcome for their guests. Many don't even have doormen or bell staff and you're expected to fend for yourself hauling bags out of the taxi and up to your room etc. This place was no exception. Reception and Room Check in was fairly painless (for us, another pair of guests seemed to be quite worked up about something) and we went up to our room which was non-smoking with a garden view as requested. Don't bother though, its not worth the premium. Room size was about 18 - 20 sq meters which is quite nice for Paris. The bathroom however was tiny, and due to the water problem, the toilet would not flush for half the day. The paint on the walls was peeling in places and the bedspread and carpet had definitely seen better days. There were traces of mold at the edges of the window and in the bathroom. The desk and other furniture were of cheap materials and were chipped and scuffed. They also use those cheap refillable bottles for their generic toiletries so remember to bring your own. There were no dressing gowns or slippers and when we asked at reception they snootily informed us these were not provided in our room category. However they did deign to send some up about an hour later so my hunch is they just don't have enough to go around or are saving on laundry bills. Incidentally, the reception closes at night (there is an on duty clerk who hides in his office) and you have to swipe your keycard at the door to let yourself in to a darkened lobby after 11. Breakfast: Our price included it so we dutifully went down to find a selection and presentation that was modest and bland. They clearly don't think its a meal their guests should enjoy as much as just fuel-up on before pushing off for the day. The restaurant was clean and well lit though. The highlight of the stay however was when we came back from wandering in the city to find a pack of half-eaten mixed nuts and a bottle of half-empty mineral water on the table. It seems someone from house keeping had decided to have their break in our room and helped themselves to the mini-bar? My girlfriend was quite put-off by this and I must say I didn't hide my feelings either when speaking to the manager. He promised in true Clouseau fashion to \"launch an investigation\" and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine - a mini bottle and not a full one! Language: They do speak English but retreat into pretending not to understand when you have any questions or complaints. Luckily we're both fluent in French so when they threw up their shoulders in the famous gallic shrug and pretended not to understand, we switched to that language just to be helpful. It may have caused some dismay behind the counter. Summary: If we hadn't booked, paid for and expected a 4 star we would have been less disappointed. The hotel clearly over-sells itself and then fails to deliver. Or perhaps we just have high standards being used to the amazing hospitality you get all over Asia and the Far East. To be fair a couple of the reception staff were quite friendly, the rooms weren't smelly and all the switches and things worked. But the incident of finding someone had picnicked in our room (and god knows what else) really put us off.

I stayed here with my wife and 11 year old daughter for 4 days in a superior triple room on the 4th floor overlooking the road. Overall I would say it is pretty good at just about everything, but not excellent at anything, nor poor at anything. In a city full of hotels that have at least some drawbacks that makes The Ampere stand out. The location is good because it is next to the Metro and RER for easy access to everywhere. Also, I did feel safe at night walking around the neighbourhood, which is relatively quiet. Many reporters have commented on the Bistro next door, which is very good - make sure you book your table the day before. The room was just about large enough, the beds were comfortable (and I'm not a great sleeper in hotels generally) and everthing was clean. The bathroom was re-stocked with Loccitane products daily, although the bath was tiny. The shower was the preferred option, and the toilet was in its own room. The window had a motorised blackout shutter, which was extremely effective at eliminating all noise and light. You will need to use an alarm to wake you up because it could be 11am and it will still appear to be completely dark. All the hotel excpet one floor of bedrooms is non-smoking. The breakfast room is typically busy, with overspill into the courtyard (if dry) and the bar area. Once again, the breakfast is good but not great - a self service buffet of decent variety. The buffet quickly runs out of everything and the replenishment is not always that fast, so if you see something you fancy it's a case of grabbing it there and then or maybe waiting a while. The service at the front desk is very good - if you ask for help I cannot imagine that you would be left wanting. Nothing is too much trouble and their English is excellent. We didn't use the bar in the evnings, so can't comment on that. It's easy travelling from CDG and Orly airports - head for the RER Pereire Levallois (on the C1 line towards Pontoise) and the hotel is just around the corner. From CDG take the RER to St Michel Notre Dame, then take the C1 RER towards Pontoise. It's as simple as that and you even get a view of the Eiffel Tower along the way. Access to the main sightseeing spots in Paris is also good, being on the direct RER line to the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame, etc. Enjoy your stay here - we did and we'll be happy to come back.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mandaikia", "ReviewID": "UR8090985", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading comments from previous guests and found most of the comments are true - this is a lovely hotel.

On arrival we were asked would we like to upgrade to a room (26A)over looking the garden which we did at an extra nightly supplement, the only complaint I would have there was a bath with a shower hose but this was fixed to the lower part of the wall so if you wanted to shower it meant holding the the shower head over you while trying to wash yourself which had water spraying all over the place. It was easier to have a bath and use the shower head to do your hair while sitting, I dont know if other rooms had proper showers or if this is the case in every room. Otherwise the hotel was spotless breakfast was served upto 10am in the dining room or 11 in your bedroom and the staff were more than helpfull. Periere was the nearest Metro station and we had no problem getting around. As other reviews have stated it is quite expensive to have soft drinks or water in the hotel but the supermarket is on the next street and just a couple of minutes walk you can buy a 6 pack of coke for 2.25 euro and a small bottle of water for 35cent. A lot of resturants do good deals on a 3 course set menu with a bottle of wine or try the Latin quarter we had a lovely 3 course meal for 15 euro each and ask for the house wine your in France and its good. Just one other word of warning we used Paris shuttle (not the airport shuttle service) to collet us from the airport as this was a cheaper way to travel from Beauvis airport directly to our hotel by shaing a cab but we were brought to Euro Disney first this added another 96klm to an already 78klm journey then on our return journey to the Airport the driver was an hour late collecting us and we thought we would miss our flight and check in time.

Excellent 3 course meal with coffee and wine for 30 euros.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNot quite 4 star\u201d", "Author": "J051", "ReviewID": "UR5536026", "Content": "After reading the great reviews on Tripadvisor we booked this hotel. Not too sure why everyone is rating it! We stayed here for two nights at the end of July. It's in a nice quiet area of Paris and not far from the Metro station. The room was clean and tidy and so was the hotel. Breakfast was terrible and very disorganised. There were never any plates or glasses and not even any food in some cases! I would rate this hotel a 3 star. ps. don't take anything out of the minibar - its 6 euros just for a soft drink.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leven, Fife", "Title": "\u201cWonderful little hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5456871", "Content": "We stayed in the Ampere over a weekend in July 2006. The rooms werent overly large, but the shower room was a good size and we had a lovely view over the garden. Breakfast had a reasonable choice included in our tariff, and we found the piano bar and garden to be a lovely spot to have a late night drink after hitting the sights of Paris. The area the hotel is in seemed to be an upmarket residential street, but you could walk to the Arc de Triomphe in about 15 minutes. Whilst the hotel isnt in the centre as such, the nearest Metro station is less than 100 yards away (Pereire) and you can quickly reach most areas by Metro. In addition, we flew with Ryanair to Beauvais and their bus terminates at Port Maillon is only about 15 minutes walk from the hotel One word of caution, the minibar in the room is automatic - soon as you remove the drink its charged to your account - and it costs 6 euros for a bottle of Kronenbourg. A tip would be to visit the \"Monoprix\" supermarket nearby - reception gave us directions, its only about 150 yards away, where you can buy 4 cans of Kronenbourg (bigger bottles with a higher alocohol content) for 2.60 euros and a bag of ice only costs 1.20 euros to cool them down. Another tip is that upon arrival we were told we would have a room overlooking the street, but for an additional 50 euros a night we could have one overlooking the garden, we declined the offer and got a garden room anyway. As for price we paid about \u00a385 a night thru lastminute and found it to be excellent value - published tariff by the hotel is 210 euros a night. Overall I would thoroughly recommend the Ampere, just avoid the minibar!!", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ampere Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d251733-Reviews-Ampere_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$171 - $337*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">102 Avenue de Villiers</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "251733", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c7/22/c722067f77cbd4034b24d078562256e56large.jpg"}}
