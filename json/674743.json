Around the corner is the Canal St. metro station. Also nearby is a HSBC and Bank of America. As for food, you just won't go hungry here. And if Asian food is not your thing, then Little Italy and Soho are nearby. Grocery wise, there's a Whole Foods on Houston and somewhere probably closer is a Trader Joe's. I don't consider this a large distance to walk. Safety-wise, the immediate area is fine. Now if you go further east there are some neighborhoods that I'd not walk alone at night. Just use your judgment. The hotel room itself is clean, but very small. Just enough room really for two people. Oddly enough, I think the bathroom is as large as the entire bedroom. You do get a small fridge, but ours was rank, so we did not use it. Toiletries provided include: shampoo, conditioner, body wash...hair dryer was also provided. Wifi was adequate, but not so much for video streaming. Noise level was ok, but bring ear plugs if you're sensitive. We had a third person with us, and they provided a cot at no extra charge. The service was good. There's really nothing to complain about. This is a nice boutique hotel that gives adequate service. I'd recommend staying here.

It is simple and clean, and the location was perfect for access to Soho, Chinatown, and the Village. The 32 inch flatscreen tv had more channels than I could ever need. The front desk staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful. I wanted to bring the bed home with me, and the tile in the bathroom was a nice touch. Some have complained of the subway noise, but it was irrelevent for me being on the 3rd floor. The vendors on canal street seem to have annoyed some people, but I hardly noticed it except to be amused. The only thing I can say is that if you are sensitive to noise bring earplugs to sleep, because the honking can be excessive at times.

The hotel and rooms are clean and have a very modern, IKEA like look. There is no gym/pool/restaurant...etc, rooms were small but I didn't spend much time in the rooms anyway so it didn't bother me. I was a little shocked by the rumblings of the subway below during my first night but got used to it, if you're a light sleeper this may be a big problem! The staff was generally nice, though one gentleman that worked there was a fairly abrasive and unfriendly. Location: Location is excellent as it's close to a bunch of the subway lines. If you're looking for a place to get away from all the other tourists in town this is the place for you -there are other little boutique hotels sparsely placed in the neighbourhood, but definitely no big chain hotels. For all the foodies out there, the hotel is a very short walk to little italy, chinatown, and all the soho/lower east side restaurants/bars, and a 20-30 min walk or quick subway ride to greenwich village. Nightlife: The immediate area is a bit dead at night, which is a bit surprising as it's so close to Little Italy & in Chinatown but there are lots of late night restaurants/bars/clubs in surrounding neighbourhoods. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel if you just need a place to sleep at night and not looking for all the bells & whistles that chain hotels offer.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cUnderrated, great value\u201d", "Author": "joopy86", "ReviewID": "UR36149674", "Content": "I took a chance with Azure recently when I wanted somewhere to stay downtown that was in a great location, inexpensive, and clean. After reading numerous tripadvisor reviews and comparing prices, locations, and all I settled on Azure, despite the number of recently negative reviews that popped up regarding this place. When I checked in, I'd expected the worse -- but was pleasantly surprised by how great my stay was. I should say, however, that I'm a native New Yorker; which might factor into my lack of complaints about the noise/size of the place. First of all, ANY place you stay downtown will be noisy, particularly on one of the major arteries of traffic in the city. Having stayed at the Soho Grand a few blocks away, at almost triple the price of Azure, the room was not that much smaller by size, although Soho Grand had a closet while this place did not. The bathrooms were spotless, the bed (I had the King sized room, which was only $20 more expensive than the Queen) was large and comfortable and spotless, and the space was maximized to best possible use. Is it a fancy hotel? No. But as the adage goes, sometimes simpler is better. What you can expect is a small, 80's esque lobby with some brochures and a polite, helpful person that will smoothly check you in and out. The hallways and lobby is a bit shopworn, but the rooms are perfect and clean and the bathrooms have huge, overhead shower heads with great water pressure. If you know the city well, you'll know that there's nothing more fantastic than a clean, comfortable place on Lafayette with walking access to Soho, Tribeca, Chinatown, and the Lower East Side for under $200.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johnstown, pa", "Title": "\u201ca great hotel\u201d", "Author": "smilesMAKEtheWORLD", "ReviewID": "UR26016471", "Content": "I had a wonderful two night stay.

My friend and I chose the hotel due to location and price; BTW, it is NOT located in Soho, rather it is in the heart of Chinatown. However, we overlooked the location because we had planned to visit Chinatown during our stay. The hotel rooms are tiny, comparable to what a prison cell may feel like. The shower head in the bathroom had the force of a light drizzle and went from cold, to scalding, to cold, to scalding. The worst experience of the trip was when the hotel maid cleaned our room and \"mistakenly\" removed a new pair of boots I had purchased the night prior at Shoegasm. When the \"error\" was brought to the attention of the staff (Johnna and Julie), they chose to believe their staff over a customer who had paid $850 to stay there for 2 nights. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? Neither manager I spoke with, Julie or Joe Ngai, were helpful and instead maintained their staff did not see the boots while cleaning the room or sifting through the trash. And instead of offering a reasonable refund (less than $100), they demanded I file a report with NYPD less than one hour prior to my departure from the city, which would be forwarded to their insurance company. I am still waiting on a resolution on this matter; however, I am not hopeful as the staff is sticking with its own and the manager, Julie, refused to verify there were no boots in my room or luggage as offered. I am highly disappointed in the staff's response to my incident and I do NOT recommend the hotel for anyone due to my experience.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSmall but nicely formed\u201d", "Author": "randomtask", "ReviewID": "UR11239098", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 nights. Location is a fairly busy corner of Canal St - a great base for exploring downtown Manhattan. Soho, Tribeca, East Village are all within walking distance. Positives - new, well presented rooms. Great shower only bathrooms. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Helpful and laid back staff. Free internet access if you've got a laptop (ask reception for a cable). Complimentary bottled water and tea/coffee. Pastries and fruit provided in foyer daily. Excellent location for seeing the lower half of Manhattan (the best part, away from tourist traps around midtown) Negatives - very small rooms, even by NY standards. Our twin was really the size of a single. TV was temperemental - not a key concern for me but a bit disappointing, Not much storage space for two people, nowhere to really store luggage away and no in-room safe (currently). Can be rather noisy too - Canal St is a busy traffic hotspot and the sound isolation isn't really the best if you're given a room facing the traffic. As long as you can get past these negatives and are prepared for a compact space, it's a nice handy place to stay in the lower part of Manhattan.
