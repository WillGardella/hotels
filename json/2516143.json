You can tell that they are trying. The motel is surrounded by a chain-link fence, and there is a security guard on duty at night. When I saw the disclaimers on the rental agreement, I asked the clerk what sorts of things went on there. He shrugged and gave me a telling look. I said, \"I probably don't want to know!\" He said, \"No, probably not.\". (I was just too tired to look further for a better place. I got a room upstairs for more safety, and removed EVERYTHING from my car.) Pros: clean room & bath; typical small, thin towels, but they were clean; NO BUGS!! (we had fresh fruit from a fruit stand, and the juicy litter from same, and no nasty visitors to help us eat our bounty); attentive management; extra security; very low price for LA; free parking; loud a/c fan (believe me, you want this) Cons: sketchy neighborhood; REALLY loud road noise (even with the loud a/c fan and a sound machine turned on high, I could still hear the 18 wheelers); separate fee for wi-fi (but unlike another reviewer, I had no problems with the connection); very small room (beds were against the walls. Thank goodness there were no bugs!); no refrigerator; no counter space in bathroom. Bottom line: I don't expect much from a Motel 6. There wasn't anything about the room itself that would have been a deal breaker. However, my main concern in renting a motel room is that it be safe for me, my family, and also my car. Like I said, the management is definitely tryng to provide this, but I still would not stay here again. We used the wi-fi to find a better room in a better location, (for a whole lot more money!), and checked out the next day.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price.\u201d", "Author": "2CachePirates", "ReviewID": "UR100914468", "Content": "This hotel is exactly where you need to stay if you want a clean room at a great price.

We had bottom floor room, next to what looked like the managers unit. No other rooms were available, even on the top floor. The room was ok, except for all the noise around and above us from Partygoers. The floor above us would creak everytime somebody walked on it, so this family of 3 didn't get to sleep, even with an 8 mo. old baby. The WIFI internet was lousy!!! It only connected at minimum wifi speed, even being close by the office. I called tech support for the Wifi service & they said it might have something to do with my laptop. I knew my laptop accessed my wifi at home that same day before we left, and then they told me it had something to do with their equipment? They acted \"rude\" over the phone. So, I essentially paid $2.99 for unlimited Wifi for nothing. The laptop connected to the router there but never obtained an IP address. So, we decided to leave in the middle of the night around midnight - we arrived around 10pm so 2 hrs. before that. The office people were ok/nice then, but when I turned in the keys to the office lady as we were leaving, I told her why we were leaving. She acted like I was an idiot for asking about a refund and never got one, because of our troubles. They never told me upfront about the \"1/2 hr. - if you don't like it, you get your money back\" policy. You don't just do that to a paying customer - it's almost like she ignored my complaints - not a friendly people person. The bed & tv were ok. After we got home from vacation, I called Motel 6 customer service about our experience. They said they'd look into fixing our problem and I haven't heard anything since then. We were going to use Motel 6 for the rest of our vacation, but because of that experience, we won't use a Motel 6 ever again.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "redirtgurl", "Title": "\u201cWould NOT recommend\u201d", "Author": "redirtgurl", "ReviewID": "UR17024358", "Content": "We were looking for a cheap place to stay on our way through LA -- because we were only going to be sleeping there, we figured it would be okay. I have stayed at many a Motel 6 that was fine. This one was not. Yes, area a little sketchy. But they had a TON of security and it felt safe. Close to Hollywood, etc. so the location for the price is good. But, the room was disgusting -- truly. It smelled terrible -- like barely covered over smoke in the bedroom, and like barely covered over sewage in the bathroom. And, most disappointing of all, one of the beds in our room was so warped that it visibly sagged in the middle while the corners were up in the air. So annoying.

The motel is located right next to I-5. Our room was on the back side of the motel and you could hear the sound of traffic all night long. The parking lot is guarded at night, and it appears that the area is rather rough, as there are numerous signs posted on the property that lists all the types of illegal activity that are prohibited on the property (e.g., prostitution, drug sales, etc.). The entire property is fenced, with the exception of the entrace driveway. We were required to show IDs for both adults who stayed in the room and the desk clerk made copies of them. The room was very basic, towels were thin and there was no clock in the room. The desk clerk did offer us a wake up call.
