The hotel is in a great location just off Union Square, close to a Walgreens (24hrs) for those pesky little midnight needs and a Starbucks if one insists on drinking that nasty coffee. The hotel is full of character, with a literature theme. Small reception, small bar/restaurant area serving breakfast in the morning and meals later in the day. They also have a free glass of wine or 2 in the evening hours. All very civilised. We were in the larger style King bed room, flat screen TV, amenities in bathroom, hairdryer, amble wardrobe space, lighting pretty good and air/heating was quick when turned on. Room had no issues - all good. Free wi-fi throughout hotel which was pretty fast and easy to use. Gitanjali (on reception) was lovely and responded quickly to my few requests. Lorenz (General Manager) was quick with responding to emails, was friendly and very accommodating. We will not hesitate to stay at Hotel Rex next we visit San Fran.

I have stayed at the Rex my last two visits, and both were marvelous experiences. This is a lovely intimate hotel with a courteous staff that knows you after the first day. Located near Union Square, it is conveniently situated for access to all sections of the city. Without exception, I have found the staff to be pleasant, friendly, and professional. The rates are reasonable for such an immaculate hotel, which has prompted me to stay a day longer than planned. They no longer have a restaurant, but food is served in the artsy Library Bar, and there is plenty of excellent eating nearby. In short, I find the Hotel Rex to be the right size, in the right location, with attractive prices, and an excellent staff. In my five visits to San Francisco I have stayed at smaller hotels, and this is my favorite on every level.

You have no choice but to get your car off the street and into a parking garage around the corner after you off-load your bags. The hotel valet will do the job for you for $40 a day, but that means every time he brings your car around, be prepared to tip him a few more bucks. I chose to just drive around the corner myself. It's easy. The rooms do not have air conditioning, but they come with a pedestal fan and it's enough to take the musty-hotel smell out of the air in minutes. The bed was firm and sheets were awesomely smooth fine cotton. NEWS: As I was leaving, at least 10 new mattresses were arriving by truck. So they are keeping up with new beds. The bathroom was squeaky clean! But typical of San Francisco and many other California cities, they have water restrictors on the showers. When are people going to realize that it takes a certain amount of water to get the soap and shampoo off your body. Whether it gets washed off fast under a normal volume stream of water, or whether you have to stand under the shower head for four minutes with the water running -- all they are doing is wasting your time because the same amount of water is used.

The building is old, the elevator is tiny and it is in the heart of the all the action a tourist could want. If you want to stay in a modern building this is not the hotel for you. The elevator is tiny. The stairwell is crammed and the steps and floors are uneven. But that's all part of the charm. Our room faced Sutter Street and there was considerable noise every night. Everything from the traffic to rowdy crowds to the garbage trucks and street cleaners. Fortunately I'm a fairly heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me at all. The room was perfectly serviceable with a modern TV and a typical minibar. One of our favourite features of the hotel was the 5 o'clock wine tasting in the lounge. It was great to start eacj evening with a couple pre-dinner cocktails and sample some of the local vintages. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. They made some great recommendations for dinners and handled all our reservation needs. The valet parking is quick and not too pricey. Valet parking costs slightly more than some of the close by lots but you can come and go as many times as you like throughout the day so if you're in and out it a few times a day you'll probably end up paying less. The only problem is that the service isn't available between midnight and 6am which meant we had to get creative on the last day to make sure the car was available at 5am so we could make our flight. Union Square is tourist central. Almost obnoxiously so. If you're there to shop and sight-see you'll love it.

The location is central and seemed safe, but slightly less unique than other more eclectic parts of the city. The hotel however more than made up for this in its charm. I really felt like I was their target demographic (30's, single, interested in a bargain food truck burrito, Michelin star ratings, a proper cocktail, or a relaxed pint with equal enthusiasm). The rooms have a (and I mean this in no way derogatory light) a lived in or almost slightly shabby comfort. More of the old familiar sweater than the latest trendy frock.

But...we may have stumbled into a bad weekend for not only Hotel Rex but San Francisco as well! The Oakland Bridge was closed down into the City for reconstruction, so the entire city was a bit off. THE GOOD: A perfect location near Union Square in a clean, fairly trendy area. Personelle that loves to take care of you and remembers yours and your dog's name. Pet friendly and with that said rooms are very clean and you would never know they allowed pets! Nicely decorated and good amenities such as an honors bar in the refrigerator that is nicely stocked AND you can use it for your own items without fearing charge like some hotels! Windows that open! Nice comfortable little bar with great wine free of charge in the evenings. Quick and efficient room service. Pet is free and they even provide a bowl of water and food dish. Large TV and lots of channels and even a IPod dock. THE BAD: We were in room 601 and there was a very loud clunking noise (sounded like the ceiling was falling in) constantly. Don't know if it was the toilet above us or what? It would wake us up from a sound sleep! Although the bed was very comfy, the pillows were overstuffed and we both woke up with a bit of a sore neck! THE UGLY: Where the Bridge caused a problem for the city...a broken pipe and fire alarm caused problems for the hotel. The trek to and from the 6th floor with a dog the first night of stay was no fun! That said, this was no ones fault and the staff tried very hard to compensate for the problems and it was very appreciated!

A lot of older hotels call themselves \"boutique\" when what it really means is old, musty, with a few second hand antiques to give them character. Hotel Rex is the real deal. The staff is top flight and very knowledgeable. Our room (sixth floor in the back) was quiet and neat as a pin. Some other reviews have commented on the room size. I've been in hotels with very large rooms that waste the space or provide cookie cutter decor. Our room at the Rex was of a good size, but even better, laid out in such a way as to make the best use of the space. My wife and I both had our own night tables and reading lamps, and the writing desk had lots of drawers. The decor is fun without being cutesy. The bathroom, while on the small size, as very clean and well-supplied. It was the kind of room you can enjoy being in because of its furnishings and layout. My only suggestion would be another shelf or two in the bathroom because of the limited counter space. And you can't beat the location--depending on your willingness to walk uphill (its always uphill in SF)! you're minutes from Union Square shopping, Chinatown, and Nob Hill. The only reason I didn't give it five stars...about 10:30 on Friday night the fire alarm went off. Nothing seemed amiss so I called the front desk--no answer. So we got dressed and trudged down six flights of stairs, join our other roommates on the sidewalk while the fire trucks rolled up. The alarm malfunctioned and the staff seemed to be a little befuddled on how to fix it. After a while, we walked back up the six flights because the single small elevator was way too backed up.

We weren't disappointed and neither will you be if you stay here. The hotel itself is small, not boutique small but it's definitely not high volume. The rooms are very neat, well presented with an interesting literature based theme. The hotel is also quite green focused (as is the way in San Francisco), however I was pleased that the 'green' options were that, optional and I did not feel pressured by any means. Hotel Rex provides you with the usual amenities such as cable & a mini bar and we were encouraged by staff to use the mini bar for what ever we needed and to just remove any mini bar items we needed to. What set them apart for me was one particular night of my stay. I had to make arrangements for my girlfriend and my 7 year anniversary dinner. Both the bellman and the concierge helped me greatly going through a number of options for me as well as providing me a reservation at a fantastic nearby restaurant, Palominos. With a great seat along with a wonderful walk along the pier I owe all the boyfriend points I earned to the staff at Hotel Rex.

Service at check-in was efficient and the staff was pleasant. We enjoyed our free glass of wine in the evening in the bar area. We slept soundly - very quiet rooms. The next day we enjoyed walking around Union Square. We caught the Muni bus back to the CalTrain terminal for our train back to Mountain View.

This was not a bid, I was paying for the hotel upon check-out.

Since our class of room was unfortunately occupied, they offered to put us up in the executive suite for two nights if we'd be willing to stay in the double for one night. I thought this was fair and agreed especially since I did not know if this was their's or priceline's fault. The next day, upon preparing to move, we discovered that we were not getting the suite, but instead the room we should have originally had. The suite was and always had been booked. Needless to say I was annoyed. Now to be fair, the hotel did more than make up for the inconvenience by offering us complimentary parking for one night, breakfast for three, and a discount on the room. If this was the end of my experience, I probably would have given the hotel 4 stars. However, that evening, we asked the front desk the best way to get to Fishermans Wharf from where we were in Union Square. We were assured that a cab would be at least $20 and that the most economical way was the trolley line. 90 minutes later on the trolley to go 2-3 miles showed me the cab was probably the best bet. That evening the $9 cab ride we took in absolute gridlock showed me they had no idea what they were talking about. The next morning, the girl at our complimentary buffet breakfast forgot to keep checking the food and practically everything ran out. This for a buffet they charge I believe $15 or more for. The final straw was at checkout. We had a very early flight and at 4:30 in the morning, a friend of ours discovered she had been charged for the entire mini bar at $200. This was after the hotel offered to empty it so that she could use the fridge. Instead of resolving this quickly, the front desk needed to delete each and every item individually. Ugh!

All the staff was very helpful and friendly. Our room was decorated in the same Bloomsbury style as the rest of the hotel. It was fairly large with two double beds. The only drawback to my stay here is that on two separate nights, our neighbours were very noisy around 3-4 a.m. and I had to call reception. The walls are thin in the hotel.

We had my daughter and a friend of hers, both 12 years old, with us. We all enjoyed it very much. The hotel is funky and small, with a literary theme. There are quotes from famous authors on the stair landings and the bar/restaurant is called \"The Library\". We liked our room a lot, which is to be expected as we had one of the two suites the hotel offers. There was a good-sized living room with a foldout couch, a good-sized bedroom, and two bathrooms. The bed was comfy, with high quality sheets. The bathrooms were well-appointed as well. We had no problems with cleanliness but my wife's boss's room was full of dirty glasses and such when he checked in, so one cleanliness star deducted for that. We saw one other room that was not terribly small by San Francisco standards but a couple of the people there with us mentioned that their rooms were shoe-box sized. If you like a larger room, you might want to check on this when you make your reservations. The location is excellent - on Sutter just a block or so off of Union Square. It's pretty hard not to have fun in that neighborhood. There's a free glass of wine for each guest offered in The Library at 5:00 each day. Our first night there, they had a string quartet followed by a jazz singer to accompany the wine. This was really nice and we enjoyed both acts a lot. They offer light food and cocktails in The Library as well as the wine, and the bartender is good at what he does. If you stay here, don't miss out on this. Employees were all very friendly and willing to help with whatever we needed. One of the guys working the front desk had his dog there (a pug named Max) who delighted my daughter and her friend. (The life of a hotel lobby dog is one we can all aspire to in our future lives.) I don't know exactly what the company paid for these rooms, but my understanding is that they were quite a bit cheaper than The Four Seasons and such. If that's the case, then I'd say the Rex scores pretty high on the value side of things. Bottom line: This is a really great place for people who like hotels with character and individuality. It's not wildly luxurious but it's plenty nice and the employees really make staying there a great experience.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cI would stay nowhere else in SF\u201d", "Author": "KileOzier", "ReviewID": "UR89055820", "Content": "Seriously, from the moment one enters, one is welcomed...and from the second visit, one is welcomed by name.

Our room was large for american standards, the bathroom was also large, clean with a good shower and a good quality hair dryer.

Breakfast was not included in our price but we chose to eat breakfast in their restaurant every day (except 1) and we found them to be substantial. There are other places close by to eat though. I would definitely stay again oin this hotel So a bit about San Francisco. Union Square is a shoppers paradise with Macy's in the square. I recommend you visit the Cheesecake factory in Macy's. The restaurant is worth a visit for is decor - but the cheesecakes are huge and the cocktails we had were also very good. In one of the side streets just off Union Square there was a small diner called Maccos which served delicious food at lunch time and very good value for money. we ate there 4 times. it has tables and chairs in the streets and the street has gates on so just look for it - opposite the cafe in union square itself. Tour buses leave from Union Square and we used these to familiarise ourselves with San Francisco. Travbelling across Golden Gate bridge and every other area in the city. There were 4/5 different trips adnyou could get a reduced price for 48 hours - they gave us an extra day free. The cable trams are a must but these cost 5$ per journey. You can buy a daily ticket for 13$, a 3 day ticket for 20$ adn a 7 day ticket for 26$ - extremely good value. These tickets allow you to travel on the cable cars, buses, trams and muni (underground system). A trip to Alcatraz is a must and th etours are very good. You need to book these before you go as they do get full. There are other ferry trips and we went over to Angel island and also caught the ferry to Sausalito which was a lovely town - I think you can drive here.

We arrived seriously jet-lagged from our London flight to be checked in by a really friendly guy who was able to accommodate our higher floor request. In fact all the staff we met were a credit to the hotel, as they really were a helpful and friendly bunch. The hotel is situated 5 blocks up from the Powell Bart station, which makes it ideal to get to / from the airport \u2013 I am glad we took the BART instead of a Airport shuttle as it worked out a lot cheaper and was really no hassle at all. The walk from the station to Sutter Street was as I said only 5 blocks and not that steep an incline. Overall the hotel is really central to all the Union Square action, being only minutes walk from the BART, Metro, Cable Car and F-Line trolley as well as numerous good restaurants \u2013 I cannot recommend Fino (Italian) and Colibri (Mexican) enough, as well as Sears Fine Food for breakfast. The room itself was on the 4th floor and was furnished to a high standard, including a very handy IPod docking station as well as a good size flat screen TV. Size-wise, it was more than spacious enough to meet our needs, with good storage and plenty of floor space. The queen bed was super-comfortable and certainly got the thumbs up. The en-suite bathroom was again a good size for a hotel, with a bath / shower, and was kept well stocked with the requisite toiletries. The room was maintained to a very high standard throughout our stay. The hotel also has free WIFI which is always a bonus We were fortunate enough to arrive just in time for the nightly free glass of wine between 5PM and 6PM from the hotel bar \u2013 they were serving a Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio whilst we were there, along with 1 red. The wine was served in the atmospheric, low lit lobby bar, which was like walking back into an Agatha Christie novel. The bar also offered a happy hour, which I think ran from 5pm to 7pm. This was a great way to start the evening, and was full with tourists of all nationalities and locals alike. We had breakfast in the onsite Cafe Andr\u00e9e on our final day which was great. The portion size was more than adequate to see us through lunch time as well, and I can thoroughly recommend the smoked salmon hash. If you are a hotel guest, you can partake in the free coffee on offer back in the lobby bar until 10 Am. Overall I cannot fault our stay and felt the hotel offered really good value for money. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a base in Union Square, and on our stay would certainly return ourselves should we visit San Francisco again, which we would very much like to !", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester England", "Title": "\u201cCentral no frills hotel with great staff\u201d", "Author": "olivespencer", "ReviewID": "UR80367012", "Content": "Good central location to union sq.

They gave us good advice and made recommendations; they answered all our questions, and made us feel like we were \"home\" during our stay with them.

We reached Hotel Rex after a nine hour drive and was welcomed by their friendly staff. We walked into our room and realized it was a bit warm but thought it could just be us and spotted the a/c switch so we thought to turn it on a bit later. As the night progressed it became unimaginably hot, I called the front desk and realized a/c is not available in that specific room. We were so exhausted we couldn't think to move to another room after we just finished unpacking. So we thought we'd request to be moved next morning. At 3am it was like a sauna in there and couldn't bear to sleep. It was ridiculous. We opened the window and that didn't help and didn't like the idea of sleeping with the window open anyways since the room was by the fire escape. At 3:30am we couldn't stand it and asked to be moved immediately. The front desk moved us right away to a room with a/c which shocked me and made me think why they gave us this horrible room in the first place if other rooms with a/c were available. We moved into the new room and realized it was significantly cooler, we didn't even need the a/c, and less noisy. The next morning I spoke to the manager about our problematic night. He was very understanding and friendly and immediately took responsibly for the room. I was very impressed and obviously we were compensated for that night. So we would say our experience was very positive after that first night. Our advice is DO NOT stay in the rooms by the fire escape. I noticed that there are other reviews on this site that has the same complaint, I wish I read those beforehand. I think it is not right for Hotel Rex to be letting these rooms out when they are unacceptable and when there are perfectly good rooms available. I think if we didn't have that first night experience I would have to agree with the majority of the reviews that the hotel is a pleasant place with friendly people and a nice restaurant.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cWonderful boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "cattivojo", "ReviewID": "UR48455035", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Rex while attending a conference at a bigger, much more expensive hotel a mile or so away in the financial district.

The staff is the best anywhere, the hotel is comfortable, and the location is great. The rooms are fairly large for SF and the beds are comfortable, although I was told on this past trip that they're in the process of replacing them in some rooms. I will warn you that this hotel is nothing fancy, but if you're looking for a home away from home it would be hard to beat. You can check in or out in 5 minutes and not have to stand in line. This means you can stash you luggage and be out enjoying the city quicker. There is a wine reception in the bar area each evening which includes live music on Friday nights. Free coffee, tea, and newspapers in the morning, in the bar area. The business center is there, but tucked away and hard to find (it's labeled The Library). The restaurant, Cafe Andre', is actually very good and worth a try if you don't feel like going out. We ate there with friends this trip and the food was excellent. This hotel is about a block and a half from Union Square, two blocks down from Nob Hill, around the corner from Sears Fine Foods (fantastic!), and half a block from the Powell Street Cable Car line. So what's wrong with the place? Not much, but there are a few nit picky items. The wireless internet is slow which can make remote access not usable, but standard e-mail and web browsing is fine. This is an old building and we noticed on this visit that, at least in our room on the sixth floor, the floor under the dresser was not level (at the dresser door stayed closed). There are some areas of the hotel, mostly stairwells, that remind me of the unsettled nature of the ground in the bay area, but I've stayed there when there were minor quakes and never knew until someone told me about them later. Anyway, if you don't need to be pampered but are looking for a hotel in SF where the staff treats you like family, where you will actually meet and speak to other travelers (at the wine reception), and where you will begin to feel like a local, the Rex is the place. Oh, and if you're lucky you'll even get to meet Max (ask the staff).", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cA home from home in San Fancisco\u201d", "Author": "welwyncambridge", "ReviewID": "UR47986510", "Content": "Booking computer a bit quirky, but the excellent staff soon sorted the problem out.

You expect to see Bogart and Bacall sitting at the bar and all the men wearing hats like in some 1940s film noir.

All the staff are friendly and happy to help and suggest things to do and see and places to eat. We stayed in a double double (room 205) which was a good size with comfortable beds and good furnishings. Bathroom was ok - small and a bit basic but the shower was strong and the water hot, so no real complaints. The room was very quiet but I can see that something at the front might be noisier as Sutter Street is active pretty much all the time and there is a nightclub next door. Every evening they offer free wine (one glass) of excellent Californian wines and the lounge/bar gets pretty busy with interesting guests and locals. Bar food is also available and reasonably priced. The great attraction of this hotel is the location - only minutes from the shops in Union Square and a bit further to Market Street. You can also get on the cable car at the corner of Post and Powell much easier than waiting at the end of the line if you want to do the touristy things. We stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute at this lovely, stylish and charming hotel. Had breakfast next door at the Persimmon Restaurant which is clean, well run and serves a great selection in very large portions. Can't wait to go back sometime - highly recommended. Travellers tip. Rented a car from Avis on Post Street (pre-paid in UK to get very good rate), but had to endure a great deal of hassle as they try to upgrade you to something bigger and more expensive and sell optional insurance that you don't need. There were four of us and they insisted that we needed a 7 seater. Ignore the selling as the car we had booked was big enough for our family and possibly a couple more at a squeeze.

We booked directly in the hotel website and got a very good rate (much better than those found in Expedia or Booking). The hotel is ideally located just 1 block from Union Square. That is great for your first or second visit to SF, but maybe too touristic if you're coming for business or if you want to avoid the tons of people that daily walk Sutter street. We stayed in room 213 or 214 (don't remember very well!), which was pretty large and comfortable. It had a king-size bed with a very nice flat big TV. The bathroom facilities were ok, a little smaller than the room. It seems they preferred to give this extra size to the bedroom instead of making the bathroom wider. I would have done the opposite! The hotel offered complimentary wifi Internet access which is something I really appreciated. I hate paying the ridiculous amount many hotels want to charge you for a few hours of Internet access. The quality was pretty good, and the speed good enough. Our room faced Sutter street, and it was just in the first floor. The window was not very good, so we had a lot of noise during the day and at night. For those who can't stand it, you'd better ask for a room facing the interior patio. Worse view but much quieter. We didn't ask for a room change. We got too late at night, and (fortunately), both of us sleep quite well , so we didn't care much. We didn't try either the breakfast, lunch or dinner. With that many options around the hotel, we thought it was a better idea not to do so. For those Starbucks lovers, you can find quite a few of them just a few meters from the hotel.

We were disappointed with the size of the room and although the decor was styled 'boutique' found it to be dull and gloomy rather than vibrant and modern. (See photo of room). A friend who was also staying at the same time as us however found that the room size was fine for a single person. Decor wise the walls are a dull yellow with all paintwork green. In the bathroom the walls are custard yellow with green paintwork and lilac floor tiles. Windows and doors have been repainted numerous times and look like our own did before we got double glazing. Reception staff are very friendly and helpful but I don't know how they can see to do their work it is so dark where they are based. There is also a very old dog sometimes around Reception (does not mind a bit of attention), however he is allowed to sit on the chairs in the vicinity. The beds were comfortable with 3 pillows on each, lighting was dim as is usual for hotels but there were lights above the headboards of the beds. The wardrobe is very small, only one side for hanging clothes which also held the ironing board , 2 robes and the suitcase holder; all of which had to be removed to try and fit the clothes in. The other side of the wardrobe should have had three shelves but we only had one in ours. There was an old long unit which held the television, underneath was the fridge on one side and 3 drawers (which stuck) on the other. It was very cold when we were there (San Francisco in August is like the worst of an English summer ) - lots of tourists were wearing jackets with San Francisco on - like us they had probably thought California in August would be hot and sunny but the low cloud makes it COLD! It was even four days before we could see the whole of the Golden Gate bridge. It is really strange because you can see Sausolito which is quite close and it is lovely and sunny there. Anyway back to the room - the heating (yes we needed heating!) is very noisy (probably an old system) and I wouldn't be able to sleep through the rattling it was making. There was no safe in the room so we had to put valuables in a security box at Reception and keep asking for access whenever we needed it. There was no coffee maker. The bathroom was well lit and nice and bright;with a magnifying mirror and hairdrier . Shower head was fixed to wall and was a decent strength. There was a full length mirror on the back of the bedroom door. There was an extending washing line over the bath which we made use of - only drawback was it took 3 days to dry things. We did not have the free glass of wine as we were always out and about but it is a nice gesture and enjoyed by many I'm sure. Things we enjoyed while in San Francisco and would recommend: Alcatraz But trips are booked up well in advance so book at least a couple of weeks beforehand - longer if possible to get a good time. I would suggest going in the early afternoon as the low cloud seems to clear by then and you get the best views, but the cloud does come back in later in the day (around 5pm when we were there) Wine country tour Very enjoyable, not just because of the wine but also the tours are interesting and you get to spend some time in Sonoma where you have lunch. Sealions on pier 39 Great fun to watch them sleeping, swimming and shouting their heads off! Boat trip to Sausolito Also a lot of people had hired bicycles to ride over the Golden Gate Bridge and got the ferry back. Whilst in Sauslito we got the local bus to Muir Woods where the giant trees are worth seeing. Nightime: Duelling pianos downstairs at Foley's Bar in O'Farrell Street. Not recommended Open top bus tour - nearly had our heads blown off. The bus does not go slowly and as mentioned above SF is very cold. I looked around the bus as we went over the Golden Gate bridge and everyone had their heads down, eyes closed or were burying their heads into their companion's coat! I felt like I couldn't breathe properly as the wind was taking my breath away so covered my nose and mouth with my hands. AVIS car hire at Union Square Avoid this company/office like the plague - we waited THREE HOURS to collect a car we had booked )along with numerous other people who were in the same position). Interestingly the manager had preprinted $25 disount vouchers to hand out - we assume therefore this happens quite often. We had a long drive ahead of us and Avis complelely ruined one of our valuable days in California.

Check in was easy and having a car booked for the airport when checking out was great. The room was cleaned efficiently. The best part of this hotel is the location. It is central to the shopping district and very close to cable car, trolleys, bus and subway transportation. If you go to San Francisco, this is a great area in which to stay. There is some improvement needed. The hallways and public areas look a bit worn and shabby. I visited the Hyatt where I could have booked a room for just a few dollars more and was impressed with the cleanliness and the overall condition of the public areas there. The elevator is very small and slow. The two of us could barely fit our bags and ourselves on board. The room itself was very tiny. There were no drawers to store clothes in, although there was a wardrobe. However, there was not floor space to store bags, so the only place to put them was in the wardrobe, which then limited the space to store clothes. The bedspread in the room had cigarette burns in it, although I thought the room was non-smoking. After cleaning the bathroom one day, the room attendant left a dirty cleaning rag (looked like an old, ripped up bath towel) in the middle of the floor. We were on a room toward the back, so didn't get street noise, but had one tiny window which looked out over HVAC units and the grafitti on the building next door. Finally, there was a gift basket addressed to someone else in the room when we checked in. I took it to the front desk and the clerk said \"Oh, that's where that went!\". I thought that seemed a little odd that in a small hotel, they couldn't send a basket to the correct room. Overall, a decent place to stay with good service.

The room we booked (through priceline) was, yes, small, but not uncomfortable small. BUT... there was no air conditioning, I was not aware that all of the rooms in the hotel did not have air conditioning. The person who assisted us with our luggage said that it gets rather cool in the evening so we should be okay. Upon entering the room, it was very stuffy, we were able to open the window and a small fan was in the room, however this did not offer much relief. The room was in the back of the hotel, and no breeze or air flow came through the window, even though the temperature in the evening was cooler outside. Besides the temperature issues, the room was very nice and clean. I did not hear a sound from any of the other rooms at any point during our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, with one exception. We had a rental car which I chose to valet ($35 per day w/ unlimited in/out privledges), slightly expensive but worth not having to deal with parking, etc. Here begins my 2nd and final \"complaint\"; The day we checked out we had to leave rather early, around 5:30am, I called the night before to inquire about the process to get my car that early. The person working at the front desk was definitely not friendly off-the-bat, and said that the valet is not available that early, and I would have to retrieve my car myself, gave the impression that there were no alternatives. Ok, I understand I'm leaving earlier than the average guest, however, from a customer service standpoint this person did not offer any alternatives. Perhaps they retrieve my car that evening and park on the street in front of the hotel, I'm sure I cannot be the first guest to have this special request. In any case, I thought this was a poor representation of the hotel, and again I'm paying for a valet service. The morning of check-out, the person working the desk was very nice, I mentioned having to get my car, and she asked if I made arragements the prior evening, I explained what happened and she did apologize and said they should have moved my car and had it ready for me this morning. I did appreciate the apology, but I still had to retrieve my car myself (a block away, uphill). Upon my return to load the car, the front desk person came outside to tell us that she put on a fresh pot of coffee if we'd like to grab a cup for the road. I thought that was a nice gesture to end our visit on an up note.

I always believe you get what you pay for but if that was true with the Rex we would have paid a lot less than we did. At first we thought the room wasn't too bad, a bit tired and shabby but the staff seemed friendly enough and the location wasn't bad. Problems started the first night when the room was very stuffy and the air-con controls didn't seem to be doing much. We've stayed in a few hotels with terrible air-con over the years so pretty much just accepted that this must just be another. However on our second night we got back to the hotel - this was a typically cold San Francisco summer night. We walk into the hotel and the place is like an over, when we get back to thye room it's even worse. A pretty uncomfortable night followed and I then went to reception to complain about the heat and the air-con not working. The reply? 'Oh your room doesn't have air-con'. It turns out the controls we'd been playing with were for the heater! This staggers me so I ask why not and I'm told that there's one room on every floor with no air-con so they gave it to us! As we paid up front with Expedia this just smacked of getting rid of the worst room to someone who's already paid. So we got moved and now had air-con but an absolutely tiny room.

Just to help you with our opinion \u2013 we are a 33-34 year old married couple from the bay area. Location: The place is very good walking distance from Union Square. We took a $6 cab ride to North Beach from the hotel \u2013 which is definitely not bad at all. The only downfall is that Union Square is full of homeless people. Don\u2019t be shocked if you get approached by 6 panhandlers every time you set foot outside the hotel. This is not a downfall of the hotel\u2019s location, but the location in general. Price: Very, very good. We had a rate of $132 per night and it was worth EVERY penny. We were able to check in early. Upon check in we were greeted VERY VERY nicely in comparison to other high-end hotels in the area. We were also upgraded to a king bed suite room. Very nice on their part. Also included is a 5pm happy hour free glass of wine at the hotel bar. Very nice. We met a nice couple in the bar. Comments on the hotel: The d\u00e9cor has a French flavor. The bar area is filled with a comfortable ambiance and has gorgeous paintings and well-known novels aligned in the front of the bar entrance. The elevator is very slow and small and needs to be updated \u2013 but as I say this\u2026it might take away from the hotel and its antiqueness. The room was VERY clean and spacious. Love the simple touches (CD alarm radio with a couple of CDs next to it and the Aveda bath products).

The bathroom was a bit small, but well appointed. The water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water, even at 8 am. Our room was on one side of the hotel with not a very nice view, but to be honest, I didn't care. It was quiet. I'd rather have little view and a peaceful room as I'm a light sleeper. The elevator was small and slow, as I'd read in other reviews, but it's an old hotel so I didn't mind. It's part of the charm when you are staying in historic style places. There was a note about it being replaced very soon anyway. When I was tired of waiting, I just walked up or down the stairs and stopped to check out each floor if I needed a rest. Best of all were the very friendly and helpful staff. I really appreciated all the help they gave me. They were warm, friendly, knowledgable and professionable too. I chose this hotel based on location, on reviews I had seen here, on their website and 2 other review sites, for the Friday evening Jazz performance. However, our plane was delayed, so we were unable to attend the entertainment. Funny thing was I discovered several of the employees attend the Art Academy. We talked extensively with the female bartender who was one student we met. Everyone was exceptional, even the housekeepers (of course tipping well helps too). Bravo! The only things I could complain about are the lack of a swim pool and hot tub, which would be nice to soak in after a long day walking, site seeing, shopping, beach going, etc. Also, the restaurant was closed for remodeling on the weekend, but there was a small continental breakfast put out for the guests. However, the food went quickly. And anyway, there are pleanty of good restaurants to go out to very nearby for any sort of meal you might want. So, who cares? I especially liked the intimate bar-library- lounge area. Very homey and comfortable. Free glass of wine each evening for adults and juice or soda for the kids too. Might be nice to see a little snack for children, such as cookies, or cheese, crackers and fruit. Good selection of top shelf liquors. I might suggest they have out a few games perhaps to keep people entertained and staying in the bar to drink and order more snacks, especially children. Plenty of books to borrow tho in there. And be sure to check out the drawings on the walls. One last thing... This hotel is about a half block away from the Powell St. Trolley. I suggest you get a multi-day Muni pass and take full advantage of riding the trolleys and buses as walking up and down hills get difficult when loaded down with luggage and shopping bags. You can buy them at the airport, train and bus stations and a few other locations. Well worth it if you are in town for a few days. Beats paying $5 per ride on the trolleys. Also beats driving, paying very high gas prices, and paying high rates for parking. The Hotel Rex is part of a small group of boutiques hotels. Check out their website: http://www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/hotel/13 . I have yet to stay in the others, but am thinking of trying another for my next trip out there in June. But I may just come back to Hotel Rex as it's pretty hard to beat them.

There's free wireless internet in the rooms and a free business centre with two computers, printer etc. So all that's really positive. On the down side the rooms are a bit musty / dusty.

First, the negatives. You'll be a little disappointed by your first impression of the Rex because it's being kind to say that the exterior is nothing to write home about. The seven-story hotel has a single tiny, slow elevator. Be prepared to use the stairs. Next, our room had two full-size beds and we added a rollaway - add our four suitcases to it and it became arguably the most crowded hotel room I've ever stayed in. Water pressure in the shower - my personal pet peeve - was spotty. At times the water slowed to a trickle before starting back up. Now the positives. The lobby is elegant and I can't say enough about the helpfulness of the staff to provide both information and advice. The front desk found us a doctor who paid us a house call to attend to my sick son at 9:00 p.m. (just don't ask how much he charged). Extra towels were delivered almost before I hung up the phone. The room itself, while small, was top shelf. Furniture and finishings were gorgeous. The bathroom was large and fully renovated with up-to-date fixtures. The room air conditioner was relatively quiet and the thermostat actually worked, giving it a leg up on many hotels. There are some reviews on this forum that complain about the street noise, but our room faced west and it was as quiet as a tomb at night. I also really appreciate that there wasn't a bellman constantly holding out his hand for tips. The help was always available, but it was unobtrusive. For tourists, it's hard to go wrong with any hotel in the Union Square area. But Rex is less than a block from cablecars, a drug store, a nice 24-hour diner, several coffee shops, etc. Overall, it's an entirely charming boutique hotel with a staff that knows the true meaning of customer service. If you're looking for new or spacious, this is not the right place. It's also probably not the best place to take small children.

The location also means that daylight is at a premium in the hotel and the general lack of direct light was amplified by some very earthy coloured decor (presumably because of the style being sought). This is particularly pronounced on the stairs. There is no natural light and the artificial light is not overly bright, yet they have laid brown striped carpet which makes it very difficult to see the edge of the stair tread. With the elevator problem making recourse to the stairs for descent (even at four floors up) a more frequent then usual occurrence, particular care had to be taken. The room, whilst generously proportioned and quiet, also lacked daylight and was not brightly lit artificially. It was a bit depressing. The bathroom/ shower was good for such an old building.

Nice size bathroom too. Somehow, I lucked out and had a window air conditioner, but I am not sure if all rooms have this. Service - Front desk staff are attentive and hardworking. Cafe Andree has great food at surprisingly low prices. Even room service was inexpensive. The business center is convenient (no charge), and my room was promptly cleaned every day. Price - At $175 per night booked on the Rex website, I received a voucher for a full breakfast each morning and tickets to the Asian Art Museum. Well worth it, no regrets.

The king-sized bed was comfortable, and the room was clean and welcoming. best of all, for anyone who has been annoyed by traffic noise when staying in the Union Square area, our room was quiet and peaceful and we had two of the best nights' sleep in a hotel that we ever had (we did have a room toward the back of the hotel, the ones near the street might be noisier). The staff was helpful and friendly to a fault, and the breakfast at Cafe Andree located in the hotel itself was wonderful. Except fot the size of the room, i would have given Hotel Rex 5 stars. Located only one block from Union Square, the area has great restraunts and eclectic shopping opportunities. Don't use the valet parking($39 a day), instead park at the Sutter/Stockton garage (two blocks away $36 for two days). Good job Joie de Vivre group, this hotel is a winner.

It's hard to know what you'll get sometimes that way -- pictures can lie. In this case I was not disappointed. The place is good-looking, comfortable and clean, the staff are friendly, kind and helpful (I was late checking in but the complimentary wine hour was extended for me) the location is central. Most places you'd want to go are walking distance. The room was quiet. My room didn't have a view but I was actually grateful for that -- facing the street can mean endless noise and if I want a view I can walk outside and get one. It was nice to be able to sleep in without the sound of traffic.

Very convenient location near Union Square and near lots of art galleries. The staff are friendly and our room was clean. The room was a bit on the small side, but similar to a size you would get in Europe. The room faced an alley, but that was okay because it made it quiet at night. The hotel is probably better sealed against noise. There's no parking in the immediate location, but there are garages a block away. One of the cheaper parking garages is the Sutter/Stockton garage two blocks away. One thing the hotel does need to do is better enforce the no parking area just in front of their door. It's supposed to be for unloading/loading of luggage for guests, but there were cars parked there all the time. But the hotel staff were nice enough to go around the block where I had stopped to help with luggage.", "Date": "January 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pismo Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite Hotel anywhere!\u201d", "Author": "Gourmand", "ReviewID": "UR2970604", "Content": "I travel to San Francisco quite frequently and have for decades. Hotel Rex is my favorite hotel anywhere. This boutique hotel has the best staff anywhere too. They sent the bellman out to run 7 blocks to the local Godiva to buy me chocolate covered strawberries and then he came to my room, embarressedly sang me happy birthday and gave me the strawberries. I will never forget this. I'm sure not everyone gets this type of extraordinary service on their birthday but I had a party of people staying there. Ever since, all the staff from the reservationist to the valet have remembered me! But I have been told by the staff there of the extraordinary lengths they will go to make the guests stay perfect, and you just would not believe it. One desk clerk went home to get her baby carrier for a guest because they had forgotten theirs! They are trained to go that extra mile and they do! The rooms have down comforters and a great decor of muted Lauren type linens. The rooms all include a CD player and they supply you with a nice jazz CD if you forgot yours. Breakfast downstairs at the Cafe Andre is superb and the brioche french toast out of this world!!! The lobby is extraordinary with a gorgeous bar at one end. Everything is done to perfection. For the price you just cannot go wrong! Highly recommended by someone who goes often.

They are located in Union Square about 4-5 blocks away from Marketplace St. Also Chinatown is about 5 min. walk away.

This boutique hotel had excellent service. The rooms were small, but very quaint. The bathrooms were immaculate, the bedsheets were very nice, and the toiletries were adequate. We were able to stay in 2 rooms over our 4 night stay since the last night were able to get a cancellation and not have to leave (they were pretty booked that w/e) Again the service was excellent. If if wasn't for the great service, we would not have gotten another room at last minute..as well as good restaurant recommendations.. The downstairs lounge and restaurant is just like the pictures show. A 1930s speak-easy(sp) jazzy type feel which was very relaxing to wait in or have drinks with freiends. Close to Union Square but far enough not to be barraged by the tourists and the noise. I would recommend this hotel...Very well priced and a thumbs up if you're looking for a good value boutique hotel! An added bonus is that the larger hotels are all local Union workers, and it turns out they were striking that week. Man were they loud - as well as harassing these poor tourist visitors who had no clue that they booked during time of strike. Luckily - the Rex is not Union ran, so we did not have to hear or deal with the strikers.

Check in was slow as the friendly sole person on reception kept being interrupted by the telephone. The room I was assigned was on the 7th floor and was very attractive and cosy. However it had NO air conditioning, just a tiny black plastic fan, and being on the top floor it was stuffy. I upgraded to an Executive King which was larger and had air conditioning. I found the rooms very attractively and cosily decorated with warm vibrant colours. The high speed internet access worked a treat and the toiletries were Aveda. Service was at all times very friendly and seemed genuinely so. You get a free glass of wine in the inviting bar between 5 and 6pm. NO tea or coffee making facilities in the room was a bore, and room service was slow (over 30mins and 2 calls to get a pot of tea) and the one meal I ordered was luke warm. Noise from adjoining rooms (and above) sometimes seemed intrusive. Overall despite my criticisms I would say that the friendliness, literary historic styling, location and general FEEL of this hotel outweigh its shortcomings and I would definitely recommend it (providing you get an air conditioned room!).", "Date": "November 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, England", "Title": "\u201cColourful and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "avevers", "ReviewID": "UR2806358", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in September.
