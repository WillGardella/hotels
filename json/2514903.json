The hotel was highly rated and reasonably priced (for paris). The best part of the hotel is the location, just a few blocks from the amazing latin/german quarter. Lots of good restaurants, bars in this area. Plus the Gardens are just 2 blocks down the road. The gardens are simply amazing, one of the highlights of our trip was simply relaxing on the many benches. The tourist bus system \"le' open\" was just a block also so it is a easy way to hop on the double decker bus to hit all the tourist sites. The hotel itself was clean and pretty nice. It is older and the parisian fashion shows. rooms are small, beds are small, tv is small, but the bathroom is really small. It doesn't help that I am a big dude either but my wife is tiny and she felt the same way. We never ate anything from the hotel so I can't comment on the food. We always grabbed something in one of the cafe's in the morning. The room was stocked with some water, beer, soda, chocolate, etc. Enough to get by if you need something to eat/drink. Be careful when reserving your room, I thought i was reserving a pantheon view room instead i reserved a garden room. My fault though. I had to pay up another 50 bucks to stay in a room with a view per night, which we did bc the view is pretty awesome. Looking out the window onto the pantheon and plaza was amazing. i remember the bed being comfortable and I slept well. The elevator is scary and i used it only once, we walked the stairs the rest of the time there. So bottom line, if you want american style hotel with big rooms/bathrooms you won't find it here but you will find nice people and good/clean accomodations.

We travel extensively, and would not rate this hotel quite so highly. We stayed on a balcony, street-facing room in December. First, the fixtures and bedding have not been renovated in an excessively long time. The beds are at the point where the mattresses are sagging. The sheets on top sandwich old blankets between them. The inner top sheet on our first night had holes in it. The quality of the towels varies from reasonable to threadbare. There were industrial-grade plastic \"twist-ties\" holding a lamp together. The daybed cover had been patched with similar-patterned material. Etc. Some other points regarding the room. It was of a reasonable size for Paris - larger than my usual Paris hotel. The bath was not exciting, but was in better shape than the sleeping room. The heating (in December) worked quite well. The location is a mixed bag. Yes, our room looked directly out at the Pantheon, which my wife greatly liked. However, that is a very large square with a parking lot. At night, drunks tended to gather there. Unfortunately, one night, this became an extreme problem. There was a significant number of youths hanging out and drinking beside their cars. They would scream intermittently, particularly at passersby. Even with the windows shut, it was impossible to sleep. Eventually, around 3AM we called the desk. After some more time, the drunken party was removed. However, another (related?) party returned some time even later, and it was quite noisy again. Amazingly, this was in December. The desk staff were very friendly. However, we did have a problem with restaurant suggestions. We asked for some help with a restaurant for a special evening. The desk person set up a reservation at a hotel-restaurant, where we were surrounded by American tourists. As my wife specifically asked for a very French restaurant, this was inexcusable. (Yes, our French is quite reasonable.) Afterwards, I went on the web, and found that that restaurant had previously appeared on our hotel's blog. Very strange. All in all, the hotel is \"OK\", with the view of the Pantheon being the main attraction. However, be aware that the Tripadvisor ranking should be somewhat lower than its current ranking of 30.

There is a fridge but no freezer so you won't have ice - this is fine if you don't need/want ice. The TV is small and is hidden in a cupboard so you have to open the cupboard to watch TV. Now you have an idea of how small it is. I have stayed in cheaper hotels that are more spacious, at least enough to feel somewhat comfortable. If you are staying on your own, this place is great! As a couple, not so much. On a good note, this place is very nicely decorated, the detail is amazing, even the bathroom looks gorgeous and this is really what sold me, so in that sense it was worth it to stay in a hotel that was so beautifully done. On an even better note, the hotel is literally next to the Pantheon. In fact you could have one of the hotel rooms that actually opens its windows to the Pantheon. Everything is closeby, bakeries, fast food, cafes, laundromats and you can connect to either the RER (airport) line or a metro line. You can walk to many nearby districts such as St Michel, see Notredame, walk towards the Seine River...

The first night, we had a triple room overlooking the Pantheon, as my teenage son was with us, and after he left for University the next day, we were moved to a classic double with balcony. The first was much better. Most France hotel rooms are tiny, and this was too. But very well appointed and the best thing I liked was the whimsical wallpaper. Beds were quite comfy, there was a safe and hairdryer in the room, and the first room had a two-part bathroom, which I like. The second room was miniscule, and we could't even open our bags without blocking the doors! But still a nice room. The staff all spoke English, and were helpful, even recommending and helping us make dinner reservations at a nearby fine dining restaurant on the last night (we didn't want to travel too far). The hotel is a short walk from the Luxembourg RER station, and well connected overall. Lots of cafes and eateries in the avenue nearby. At night, you can sit at the foot of the Pantheon and see all the way down the avenue to the Eiffel Tower! We didn't avail of the breakfast, so can't comment on that, but when we wanted a Champagne bucket with ice and glasses, they were obliging.

The shower has a small glass partition and the floor will get wet, but towels can take care of that. Why don't they place shower curtains?

Firstly, the physical location and the ambience of the area are lovely...it is clean, open, and well provisioned with coffee shops,dre dries, little shops etc. (in one of the little side streets the children thought it looked like Diagon alley out od Harry Potter!).

It has 3 sets of double doors leading onto a long narrow balcony with excellent views of the Pantheon, discretely lit at night, and of Sacre Coeur in the distance.

Oh and free WIFI was invaluable (especially during that bedridden day) If I ever return to France I Will be locking this hotel in! The only things I would suggest for the hotel to improve are to have an ironing board and iron in room (not needed for me, but others would like), and a longer shower screen (though when in france, have a nice long bath!!!)

The balcony overlooked the Pantheon and you could see Sacre Coeur in the distance. It was a very relaxing experience for one last night in Paris and I would definitely choose this hotel again.

They had sprinkled rose petals on our bed - which was a cute touch as well. The location could not be better. You are very close to the RER station which means taking public transit from CDG to the hotel, couldn't be easier. Tip --- if you are coming off the RER, go left out of the train it brings you closer to the more convenient corner to go in a straight-shot up to the hotel. From here you can to any of the major sites anywhere in Paris within 1 or 2 connections max. The hotel was very clean. There was a convenient mini-fridge in the room with good closet/drawer space. There is an amazing bakery if you hang a left out the front door and another immediate left. At the top of the street - across on the right - a little patisserie with fresh OJ and croissants, baguettes, etc. Banks very close as well as restaurants, gelato, creperie and Illy coffee bar. To address a couple of complaints that I often read about on the review for this hotel: 1) small rooms and 2) firm beds: 1) Our room (32) although not massive, was not that small; I've stayed in far smaller in NYC; it was the size I expected for an old, restored property in the center of Paris that isn't part of a major chain; 2) the beds are firm - but not grossly uncomfortable firm. There is no Eurotop, which may make it seem firmer to some, but I have slept on far firmer in other places in Europe. I would not let this be a prohibitive factor for you unless you have serious existing back problems, in which case finding the perfect hotel bed will always be a challenge - sometimes they are too soft too! My only two remarks (not complaints as there are far worse things that could happen in a hotel) but to be fully transparent in my observations: 1) the showerhead left something to be desired - it didn't spray evenly (even when we tried to change it) and with the Euro-style tubs, well it makes it hard to have a shower without getting the whole bathroom soaking - but this is not unique to this property based on my travel experience. 2) The wall behind the toilet paper holder was patched but not sanded/painted. That's it. Otherwise, wonderful stay, excellent location, good price.

I decided to splurge a little as we wanted to end our holiday on a bright note, having had rather negative experiences at other Paris hotels in the past, but this turned out to be an expensive disappointment despite all the other glowing reviews in TripAdvisor. The hotel has a good location, being right opposite the Pantheon, and I understand we were probably not given the best room as we were only staying one night, but the room was quite small, and the bathroom was almost two thirds the size of the bedroom - quite sizeable for a bathroom. The furnishings were really eccentric - when we decided to stay in a boutique hotel, we knew the furnishings weren't going to be sleek and modern, but what we got seemed like an ugly mix of mismatched furniture. The carpet had seen better days, and the lighting in the room was atrocious - (probably 20W) energy saver lightbulbs that made it absolutely impossible to read in the room at night!!! The wallpaper was also a hideous choice and the decor made the small room feel even smaller and quite oppressive. The safe had been locked by someone else and the TV wasn't working. To be fair, when we informed the reception, he offered some suggestions and it turned out that the aerial cable had been unplugged, so the TV worked after that. But worst of all, the small room had a bottle of perfume with 'perfume sticks' to scent the room, and the sickly sweet smell was so overpowering that it was the first thing I noticed when I entered the room. In fact, it was too much so I had to move the bottle to the bathroom, but still, I could not sleep much all night because of the suffocating smell and the heat.. I ended up having to open a window to let some air in. The hotel should really consider that some people do not like, or are sensitive to overpowering perfumes before inflicting such pervasive 'aromatherapy' on unsuspecting guests. The tiny lift was also very slow, but any attempt to use the spiral staircase to go downstairs/upstairs resulted in a unique, drunken experience - without the alcohol. The staircase sloped towards the middle, which had a rather disorientating effect on anyone trying to use them. We did not have breakfast at this hotel - at this price, we didn't want to pay any more for breakfast! We had a perfectly serviceable breakfast at a cafe behind the hotel.

There is also an RER train station next to the Luxembourg Gardens and several metro stations all within a five to minutes walk of the hotel. We were always greeted warmly by the hotel reception staff and assisted many times with helpful advice for trains, buses or shops.

It was facing the inner courtyard and therefore very quiet until after 8 am when workers arrived for some nearby renovation work, but that was fine as we were leaving for our breakfast and excursions by then. The only downside of our stay was that the standard room is very small by Australian standards. The double bed and our luggage virtually filled the room. The room decor is pleasant enough, but a little tired and in need of brightening and better lighting. Thankfully the en suite bathroom was a reasonable size, with a bath and included shower. There was one other small irritation, but only for one day. The lift broke down and while it was being repaired we had to endure several ascents and descents of five floors via the narrow and steep staircase. Great for fitness fanatics. Thankfully it did not coincide with having to haul our almost 30 kg bags up or down. The hotel breakfast is Continental (croissants, bread, toast and jam, omelet with tea or coffee) and well prepared, but several Euros dearer than the nearby sidewalk cafes.

Upon our arrival Valerie, the lady at reception took our bags and told us that she had put us in a room with a balcony. The recption area is very pretty, very boutique-hotel. Valerie gave us a few touristy maps and went through how to get to the main attractions. The hotel is right next to Luxembourg metro station and a ten minute walk to the Notre-Dame station, both of which are very well connected, so are useful for getting to the sights. The hotel also gave my boyfriend a little box of marzpian treats for his birthday! The room was lovely, like alot of the reviews say they are quite small; the little corridor where the wardrobes are is a bit of a squish for two people! But the bedroom was lovely, very clean and the windows are large so it was bright and airy. The bathroom is isn't huge but a perfectly good size for two people. It looked like one of our hand towels had pollen on it, but we didn't complain as it was so trivial. The little balcony that we had was lovely to stand out on and there was two little chairs and table to sit at. One morning we had breakfast in bed which was very tasty and no more expensive than it would have been in a cafe. All the staff were very helpful and patient as I tired to remember my A-level french. The check-out time was 12 o'clock as well which was very decent and we were able to leave our bags at the hotel until we had to go to the airport. There are lots of little restuarants in the area as well, The Crepe places is delicious (get the one with vanilla ice cream, apples and salted caramel!) We had dinner one night at the restaurant nearest the hotel, I think it had Pantheon in the name. We ate very late at 11pm as we'd been up the Eiffel tower, but the resturant sat us down and we had a lovely bottle of wine and steak with french potatoes and veggies. The portions were huge and it was only 50 euroes for both of us to have steak and a bottle of wine! Delicious, with free water and bread.

The Grands Hommes didn't work for me. You are paying for location and a big bathroom. If anything goes wrong, don't expect them to help. I got in to Paris on a very hot Monday evening (35C) and the a/c in the room didn't work. I went down to the desk to ask if there was anything they could do. They could have the maintenance man look at it tomorrow morning. I'm serious it was like a sauna in there. Well, you can sleep with the balcony door open? We do it all the time in Paris. Finally I asked him to come up and look and see if I did something wrong with the thermostat, but he said he could not in any circumstance leave the desk unattended, as he was the only employee of the hotel there at the moment. So finally he called the hotel next door to see if they had a room for me, and they did, but then, they called and said it was taken. So I went up and fiddled with it, but got nowhere, finally I went down to the desk and sat there for a half hour and he called the hotel next door and voila! the room that was taken is now open, so they sent me next door for the night, but I had to come back over for the next 2 nights. It was kind of a nightmare, So then the last night I'm there, there's a different guy on the night shift, and again, he is the only one in the hotel. The elevator is broken, which was not too bad, as I was on the 3rd floor, but I pity the poor folks on the 6th floor. Anyway, I called down for a wakeup call, and there's no answer. I let it ring for 5 minutes, and no answer, so I go down the stairs and he's outside having a smoke with the guy from the other hotel. I tell you, for 200 Euros a night, I expect the only guy on duty to answer my call, especially when the elevator is not working. So my take on this is I'm really not too impressed with the managemant of the Rive Gauche Hotel chains, and the Grands Hommes is way overrated on this survey. If you have no trouble mechanically, it's a pretty nice place.

Additionally, the hotel was within easy walking distance of several RER/Metro stations, which made it easy to navigate the city and a convenient base for our stay.

Our room was quite functional, containing a television, small refrigerator, desk, and 2 closets, despite its small size. Cleanliness generally was excellent; we noticed only a bit of dirt on the walls and some worn carpet. Free wifi was available but a bit slow and spotty in our room. Our only mishap: no hot water was available one morning due to malfunctioning equipment; the hotel was quick to apologize, and the problem was remedied within several hours.

Just the act of writing down his request with the plan to truly follow through was something I never expected from the staff at ANY hotel. I find that although it didn't pan out the way he had planned (eventually it did in its own way), this thoughtful act was truly heart-warming and greatly appreciated. Also, if you are the sort of person who must have their morning coffee, the continental breakfast can be brought to your room and it's quite delicious, a classic petit-d\u00e9jeuner with caf\u00e9 au lait, freshly baked croissant, brioche, and baguette with fine jams or honey, even dried fruits! We took breakfast here every morning! And to this day I miss that little pick-me-up whenever I have a look at my measly Dutch breakfast of a cheese sandwich and cup of coffee! Lastly, if you are looking for a nice view in a top location, look no further! The Panth\u00e9on was right outside our windows, and the area around the Jardins du Luxembourg has many shops and places to get a bite to eat or just sit at the outside terraces for a drink, not to mention you are in easy walking distance to many of the great places found in the nearby arrondissments. The only negative comment I have about this hotel (and this I believe is more of a personal taste opinion) is that I often had difficulty sleeping a refreshing night as my pillows were not supportive enough....but as I have TMJ, it's probably just me! I'm pretty much used to sleeping on a slab of hard foam. hehe. Still, in the end when we were asked (as a joke) to stay another night by reception, I swear I would have agreed without a second-thought if we didn't already have our train tickets! I was truly rather sad to leave. So, if you are looking to stay at a place with a fantastic view in a fun location, where the staff is outgoing, cordial, friendly and thoughtful, and the rooms and reception are immaculately clean, this is the place for you!

Just a five minute walk down the main road directly in front of the Pantheon (place du Pantheon) stood the Notre-Dame and all other main attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre were only a short Metro trip which is very easy to use and similar costs to the London Underground.

We could not have been happier. While in Paris, returning to the hotel was like returning \"home\" and it was a relaxing and beautiful room. We some reviews before booking concerning the size of the room. We stayed in room 22 overlooking the Pantheon, a Superior booked through their site directly (which was a great idea pricewise). The room was much bigger than we expected after reading reviews. If you want a big screen tv and need to do jumping jacks and cartwheels in the room you should think about a city other than Paris for your visit. We have to thank Pierre-Louis personally for his dinner reccommendation, Les Marie Verte, which was cozy, delicious, and the proprieter was warm and inviting. It was like dining in the French countryside at the house of a friend. Fantastic! In my opinion, it's no surpirse they have so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor and other online ratings agencies.

Purpose of our trip was for a much needed husband-wife romantic getaway without the kids! Our requirements were to find a hotel in a great location, with a cozy room, and with staff that was helpful. We did extensive research and determined ahead of time that we wanted to stay in the Latin Quarter. We settled on Hotel des Grands Hommes based on our research and other reviews, and we are very glad that we stayed here. For starters, you cannot beat this location. You are across the street from the Pantheon and you can literally walk just about anywhere in Paris from this location. From our hotel we walked to Eiffel, Notre Dame, Arc, Louvre, Luxembourg Gardens, and every major attraction, monument, etc. Additionally, you are off Rue Sufflot which is full of bistros, shops, and great coffee shops. There are great restaurants in the area and you are literally steps away from great monuments and history. We were torn between staying here and at other more \"trendy\" locations and we are just so glad we chose this area. You cannot beat the location. Second, the staff at the hotel was beyond wonderful. They were friendly throughout the booking process and even more personable and helpful when we were there. They really went out of their way to be helpfula dn truly made it a wonderful stay. Finally, the room itself was terrific. We stayed in room 34 which faced in toward the courtyard. We were initally torn between the courtyard facing rooms and the ones that face the Pantheon. The rooms are essentially the same size, only difference is the view. My advice is this - save yourself a few Euros and get the courtyard rooms. They are quiter and quite honestly, when in Paris you will spend your time outside, so the view is not that important. We found our room to be romantic and perfect for our needs. They were clean, nicely appointed, and more than enough. If you are from the States, be warned - like all rooms in Paris, they are small. That said, as a husband and wife looking for a romantic getaway without the kids, the size of the room didn't matter - we had lots of fun :-) You really can't go wrong with this hotel.

This hotel, along with a few others, is owned by the same owner and we have now stayed at 3 of them based on the great experience at each one but this location was outstanding! First, we were upgraded to a junior suite with full balcony overlooking the Pantheon. The decor was somewhat overdone but very PARISIEN decorated in Empire style in very beautiful shades of browns and plums. The room was very clean and comfortable and we had the option of having breakfast sent up to the exterior balcony or eating downstairs in the historic cavern beneath the hotel. We had already stayed at the sister hotel next door and found Hotels Des Grands Hommes to be much quieter. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that I can remember where the Manager greeted each guest by their name. I found this to be a very personal service and one that truly made the customer experience an exceptional one. Of this group of boutique hotels, Hotel des Grandes Hommes was truly our best choice so far. All are quite lovely but this one is conveniently located near an excellent bakery, fantastic Thai restaurant, wonderful wine boutique and several excellent restaurant choices. It is also very close to Les Jardins du Luxembourg if you are a walker or running or just like to take in some beautiful scenery. The Pantheon is across the street so there are some tourists in the area, however, still quite an historical site. Otherwise, it is not quite as close to the main center of action as, perhaps another sister hotel, Hotel Jardin de L'Odeon, but this is still my favorite so far! I recommend booking in advance online to secure a reduced rate reservation (no cancellation option though). You can save a LOT of money using advance booking and still get a very beautiful & comfortable room along with very convenient location in Paris!

Maid service was excellent (they even tastefully arranged the toiletries!) The elevator is very small, but serviceable. The view looking down the staircase is a vertigo inducing thrill.

Honey and assorted jams were also at your disposal. This is not a five star all inclusive luxury hotel and spa, but the service was superb, the value excellent, it's tucked away in a quiet clean neighborhood, and the friendly staff made the experience a joy! There are a number of decent restuarants close by, and a great little neighborhood of small shops (corner style grocery, bakery (yum), meat market, fruit stand, etc.... just a block away.

They put up with our clumsiness in French etiquette with a smile and understanding. Directions were given cheerfully when asked, recommedations were always spot on, and a friendly smile was welcome when we dragged ourselves in at any hour. As first time visitors of Europe, we were pleasantly surprised by the congeniality of the Hotel staff.

One was with a street vendor near Notre Dame Cathedral that sent us on an 8 block search for a Metro entrance that was 20 yards from his booth (in a pouring rain). The second was on I'Ile St. Louis when a group of waiters at the La Brasserie de l'Ile St Louis made it a point to be rude and discourteous to us. Rick Steves recommends this eatery, but I beleive that you must speak at least passable French in order to enjoy any kind of meal there (we were charged 9.4 Euros for two Cokes, and it was made plain to us that we were not welcome there.) However, the Isle St Louis is very charming, and has the very best ice cream shop on the planet, bar none! (Rick is right about that!)

After expressing our disappointment I was, somewhat reluctantly, given my friend's room and she a room on the floor below which at least had a sofa but it could scarcely be described as a separate seating area.

Much worse was the difficulty in attracting the attention of the night porter. We had to wait for 15 minutes to be given our keys when we returned to the hotel at about 10.00 pm and then, an hour or so later, there was absolutely no response when phoning down to reception to ask for a taxi. Looking out of the window we saw the porter joshing about with friends in the square and smoking a \"fat\" cigarette. We wanted a taxi and it could wait but if a guest was endeavouring to summonse emergency medical help it would be completely unacceptable. The hotel website speaks of the square being tranquil in the evenings. Our experience, admittedly on a very hot night, contradicts this as until well into the small hours there were groups of loud youngsters fooling around, playing music etc. Intermittently there was also, and I simply could not explain it, a curious high pitched whine in the square at night. If it was one of those devices meant to be audible only by young people and to disperse them, it failed on both counts.

Some general thoughts: THE GOOD: --As many have stated, the location is excellent. It is an easy and enjoyable walk to many sights, resturants and transportation options. The location alone could justify its price (which, while not ridiculous, is still a bit expensive for the hotel itself). --The rooms feel rustically Parisian with charming details like beamed ceiings, toile wall paper, and fanciful headboards. This was very important to us in our search for a hotel.. we did not want to be in a cookie cutter chain hotel. --The front desk was friendly and helpful in their services. --The maid service was solid and it was great to come to a consistently clean and set bedroom and bathroom each day. --Beautiful lobby. --Great WiFi access in the rooms. THE NOT AS GOOD: --While the rooms are certainly rustic in its Parisian charm, it still could use a little bit of an update, in my opinion. The carpet is clearly old and could use updating. I generally don't walk barefoot in the rooms of any hotel rooms but this was especially the case at Grande Hommes. --Our room was also MUCH smaller than we had anticipated (and we're from NYC and very familiar with small spaces). While it was comfortable and suitable for our needs, it was a bit of a disappointment at first to see how small the room actually turned out to be, considering we paid for the second nicest option for a room, thinking that this would provide more space. I can't imagine what the most affordable room options must be like! --The television is really old and has maybe two functioning channels on it (French language speaking). But then again, I suppose one isn't in Paris to watch television. RANDOM: --Overall, we did not really see our room as a place to really revel and be delighted in as soon as we walked in each day. But it was a suitable, charming enough room for us to relax in that happened to have an EXCELLENT location. --If you are into really good food and are wary at eating at the tourist traps that line the sights, I hiiiiighly recommend that you purchase a pocket-sized book called \"Clotilde's Edible Adventures in Paris\" by food blogger and cook Clotilde Dusoulier. We ate at 8-9 different recommendations from her and were blown away by EVERY one of those meals. Simply outstanding. A stone's throw from Grandes Hommes is a restaurant called Les Papilles.

I have never seen such a clean room and bathroom, coupled with exquisite design that was not too over the top, but definitely matched the ample size of the room and the fact that this is Paris. Fabric walls, detailed hinges, and a comfortable bed.

The staff was very helpful, check-in was a breeze, plus cabs arrived punctually. There are restaurants nearby, and it is about a five minute walk to Blvd Ste Germain and less to St. Michel.

The Pantheon makes a great landmark for finding your hotel! We booked the Deluxe room with either a view of the Pantheon or a balcony. We ended up with a balcony and to be honest it was not worth the extra money because the balcony was not great and only overlooked the tiny courtyard, so you felt on display to all the other rooms. I suppose I had in mind that a balcony might provide a view of something external, if not the Pantheon. The hardest part was that the room was very hot and stuffy with the only option to get air was to open the balcony doors during the night (not really a smart thing to do in a hotel where the balcony joins other balconies and appears to be easily accessible). So we suffered the slightly suffocating feeling in an already tiny room. This is definitely a problem that the hotel needs to address. Otherwise it certainly was clean and quiet. Breakfast was nice because the lady running it was very friendly and helpful, but I'm not convinced that the buffet breakfast is really worth the 10 euros each. I could be wrong, but I have a feeling you could do better by getting breakfast out, and at the very least explore breakfast possibilities in Paris to enhance the experience. Finally, the staff were okay, but I didn't really get to experience the 'wonderfulness' that appears in the reviews here concerning staff. They were mostly good, but to be honest I didn't take to the girl who served me initially. Maybe I was tired, but she came across as a bit 'snooty' and slightly arrogant. Not a good start because the first impression is usually the one that lasts. At another time they tried to charge me for a Perrier from the mini bar, which I have no idea how they arrived at that because I always avoid the mini bars for obvious reasons. I'm sure it was a simple mistake, but it didn't help the experience. It was good, but I consider it to be abit over-priced for what it was, and our room was actually a Spring special!

I cannot agree with the previous poster about location - OK it is a long way from the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, but who can complain about walking distance (10 mins) to the islands and Notre Dame and opposite the Pantheon. All the sites in Paris are not on top of one another. There is a good choice of bars and restaurants nearby. There was some noise one evening outside the Pantheon that disturbed some of our party, but nothing too problematical. Our real problem however was that one of our party made the mistake of leaving her purse out in her room whilst we went out to dinner instead of locking it away in the safe, which she obviously should have done. However on our return someone had entered the room and taken 300 euros, despite reception being staffed 24 hours a day. This was a surprise given our experience thus far with the quality of the staff and marred our stay. Initially the staff on duty at the time were quite unhelpful, but later the manager of the hotel was very helpful in assisting our friends in reporting the theft to the police etc and providing complementary breakfasts.

The hotel is small and charming and gave us just the experience for our first trip to Paris that we were looking for. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and nice and they will gladly speak English if you need them too. Pierre made us feel like we were the most important guests in the world! Our room was the \u201cdeluxe\u201d on the 6th floor (this is the top floor of the hotel), and we had a balcony. It was too cold to use, but we stepped out a few times just for the lovely views. We were directly across from the Pantheon and in the distance, we could see the Sacre\u2019-Coeur\u2014beautiful, especially at night! The rooms are small but extremely comfortable and well organized. There was a closet next to the bathroom with hanging space on one side and built in shelves on another, along with a safe. There was also another small closet full of shelves when you entered the room. The TV was high up on the wall and easily viewed from the bed. Speaking of which, the bed was extremely comfortable! The bathroom is small and can really only hold one person at a time. The shower did have a partial glass door to block some of the water, but we usually ended up with water on the sink and floor anyway. Toiletries are provided, fresh towels, etc. There is a hair dryer that comes with the room as well and works very well. The rooms are extremely quiet; we cannot recall hearing other guests, not even in the halls. I believe there are only 4 or 5 rooms on each floor. The elevator is tiny so it will hold 2 people with luggage and 3 without. It was somewhat slow, but this never was a problem\u2014we never found ourselves waiting for other guests to get on or off. One thing I did not know about beforehand (but which was not a problem either) was that guests give their key back to the front desk anytime you leave the hotel and pick it from them when you re-enter. Again, this was never an issue, no matter the time. Someone is always at the front desk. They also have a small ice machine in the lobby and will happily send you off with a bucket for your room. We never went down into the dining area so I can\u2019t comment on the hotel breakfast. Internet access was included with the room and was fast. Comments on earlier posts indicated that the Internet speed was a concern. Hardly. The Internet was faster than we had expected. In fact, it averaged around 6Mbps per second, that's about three times as fast as standard DSL. It was more than sufficient for all of our needs, which including a nightly video chat with our son. No hiccups, no glitching. It was awesome. There is a wonderfully delicious little bakery (boulangerie) close to the hotel\u2014kind of on the street behind it\u2014so we had ate pain au chocolate every morning, along with assorted other bakery items. Croissants in Paris are amazing! We loved this hotel, found it so relaxing and comfortable, and it was in a great location. We used the RER train to get to and from the airport and had no problem walking to and from the hotel with our luggage. The metro was also close by, as were several places to eat that were very good as well.

I booked the hotel through the American Express website several months in advance. The rates for the winter were a substantial savings over the summer or holiday periods. A couple weeks before the trip I sent an e-mail to the hotel confirming my reservation and asking for directions from the RER. The response from Valerie was fast and professional. I even coordinated flowers to be delivered to the room prior to our arrival. Valerie arranged for everything. Our flight was an hour early arriving and we got to the hotel a little early. No problem said Farrah, she was able to get us checked in a little early so we could freshen up and begin the day. Since we were early, the flowers had not yet arrived. She took me aside and she had them placed while we were out sightseeing. The hotel is easy to find, when you exit the RER, find the McDonalds on Rue St Michel. From this McDonalds on the corner, you will see the Pantheon and head up the hill and in three short blocks you are at the hotel. The lobby is well lit, the rooms were incredibly clean and the bathroom was very spacious with a large soaking tub and shower. We had a king size bed, and there was still room for two pieces of luggage. The room had two sitting chairs and a desk. The heater worked great and at night, we even turned it off and let the cool air come in from the plaza. The entire staff was most accommodating, ensuring that we had appropriate information for trains, subways and the night before the transit strike, they gave us a headsup so we wouldn't be stranded. We had breakfast a couple days in the basement. If you don't want the breakfast, at least take the time to go downstairs. It is a pretty neat little area. I would recommend the Comptoir de Pantheon restaurant that is on the main street coming up from Luxombourg Gardens. The food was always hot, fast and tasty.

The room was large by Parisian standards and decorated very well we had a view looking straight onto the Pantheon which was amazing. We also had a balcony, which added a lot to the experience even if it was too cold to have breakfast on.

From reservation to check-out, our experience with the front desk was easy, efficient, and pleasant. They were helpful with making and confirming reservations, and also with recommendations for local restaurants, bakeries, and useful french phrases. We took the RER B from CDG airport, walked just a few short blocks to the hotel, and found a small but elegant lobby (with plenty of seating). We were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 2pm. We anticipated this, so we used the spotless bathroom in the lobby to freshen up, stored our luggage in the lobby, and explored the city until around dinner time. We were upgraded to a Pantheon view-room (still standard room, though) and were impressed with the quality and cleanliness of the room (which had all of the basics- safe, tv, minibar, etc). And of course, there was the wonderful view of the Pantheon. Yes, the room was small, but there was enough room for all of our luggage. My only complaint about the room is that there wasn't enough light. It was fine for getting around, but it was almost impossible to read in bed unless you were right next to the little lights at near the headboard. Some additional ambient light would have been very useful. The bathrooms, however, were sparkling clean (and very bright, I might add). As someone who is pretty OCD-ish about things like that, I couldn't have been happier. The first night seemed very cold, until we realized that the thermostat was set to about 50 degrees F (we fixed that quickly). We took advantage of the free Wi-Fi in the rooms to confirm locations, restaurant hours, etc. We stored our daily goods from the markets in the small mini-fridge. I cannot comment on the breakfast, as it was not included in our package (we reserved a non-breakfast package off the website for a great deal), but there are plenty of boulangeries and cafes within a stone's throw of the hotel. Our favorite restaurant was very close to the hotel- Les Papilles on r. Gay-Lussac (reservations required)- a small restaurant with only one option for dinner, a daily changing 4 course menu for 31 euros. Our meal was sublime. I also recommend Marche Biologique on Sunday mornings (on Blvd Raspail near r. Sevres) for lots of eating goodies. Location was great- we walked as far as the Tuileries gardens/Louvre, but used the subway for when we were pressed for time or for when our legs were tired (to the Eiffel Tower- although on a nice day, this is also walkable [discosure- we are in our low 30s]).

Even though the Pantheon square sometimes was busy with traffic, the room was insulated well enough where we hardly noticed any noise, so we slept very well. The wireless internet connection in our room came in very handy. We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist (merci beaucoup Farrah - you are wonderful) who spoke good English and helped us with directions around Paris. All the people who worked at the hotel around the clock were friendly and courteous and our room was nicely cleaned and sheets changed every day. We did try their breakfast the first morning and there was a great selection of fruit, cheeses, croissants, jellies, and some cured meats. Coffee was great, though I dont think you will find bad coffee anywhere in Paris! Some observations on the neighbourhood: Plenty of cafes selling great sandwiches to go (handy for a quick lunch), a BNP Paribas with ATMs, & pharmacy all on Rue Soufflot. There are also small supermarkets in the area where we bought fruit & juice for our on-the-go exploration of Paris. We ate a couple of times at the Comptoir restaurant and the food was decent - good portions for the price (watchout, the salads are humungous and will easily feed two). We were dissappointed with the crepes at Crepes A-Go-Go which were way too sweet for our taste for breakfast. Having the Luxembourg RER station located at a convenient walking distance was a plus and that's how we travelled to/from CDG as well as to/from Versailles. Of course, don't miss a visit to the Pantheon; the tour to the upper levels of the Pantheon is well worth it. And close by, Rue Mouffetard is also a fun street to explore. There was also a small church on a street north of the Pantheon square that was holding classical music concerts which we discovered by accident - it was a delightful treat. Not to be missed sights like Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle and the Seine are all within comfortable, enjoyable walking distance.

We had first-class service from the moment we checked-in with Roman at the front desk. We had booked a Superior room with a view and originally they had assigned us a room on the first floor. Roman knew we wanted a great view and he arranged for us Room 41 on the fourth floor, overlooking the Pantheon. We loved our room - it was comfortable, clean, larger than most other Paris hotel rooms in this category and full of Parisian charm. The view from our picture windows was amazing! The bathroom was very clean and had a large tub (not the mini ones we've had in other Paris hotels). Pros - The hotel lift fits 2 adults and 2 large bags easily. We had a peek at the Standard rooms and strongly suggest you spend a bit more and get at least a Superior room. The extra space and view makes a world of difference! The staff are wonderful. Thanks Roman especially, for making us feel so welcome and all your wonderful suggestions for restaurants, sights and even booking the airport shuttle for us. We loved the many great restaurants within walking distance from our hotel. We strongly recommend L'Atlas at 12 Blvd St-Germain for fine Moroccan food, our perennial favorite Le Bar A Huitres at 33 Rue St-Jacques for the most amazing Fruits de la Mer and Miramar at 17 Rue St-Jacques for roast duck and noodles.

It is located in the 5th Arrondisement, Latin Quarter, directly adjacent to the Pantheon. When you look down the street, you can see the Eiffel Tower in the distance. It is across from Luxembourg Gardens, which are a lovely place for a picnic. The RER stop from the airport is (Line B) is right there, so we didn' t need a cab. It's walking distance from the trendy Place St. Michael which is full of restraunts that are open late, and close to Notre Dame. This hotel is also in the low to moderate price range I was seeking, but without giving up the charm and comforts. I was worried a hotel like this didn't exist in Paris, but I finally found it and highly recommend it. The service was great. Our French is terrible, but everyone at the front desk spoke excellent English and was very friendly. They upgraded our room to a superior free of charge because it was our honeymoon. That was a great suprise! They also ordered our cab for transport to Orly airport to leave, since the RER doesn't go directly there, just to CDG. The room was so lovely and charming, just like in the pictures! It had an amazing view of the Pantheon through a big view window. The walls were covered in lovely wall paper and the high ceiling had exposed beams and crown moulding. The bed had drapery on the wall behind it, beautiful bedding, and was very comfortable with lots of pillows. Everything looked new and was spotlessly clean. The large bathroom had a bidet and towel warmer, and a fancy enclosed shower. The a/c worked great, and I didn't hear anyone in neighboring rooms once. The breakfast was fine, but I recommend eating in one of the many local cafes or the craperie on that street. It's also fun to visit the nearby outdoor market Moufetard and take a picnic to Luxembourg. The breakfast room, like all the common areas in this hotel was nice. The only drawbacks to this hotel, and pretty much any hotel in Europe, was that the elevator was small and slow (but at least they had one).

Some travel tips for Paris: Bring a light jacket (it was very cool during our stay in the middle of June) Buy a Paris Museum Pass - if you're planning to visit multiple museums and landmarks, this is a deal, but it's worth it in itself because you can override the long queues at most of the museums including the Orsay and Louvre. It's 45 euro for a 4 day pass and was worth every cent. Buy a Metro Pass - purchase a metro pass only for the number of days you need and the zones you know you will travel. Unless you're planning to visit Versailles or use the RER to get to and from the airport, you don't need more than zones 1 - 3 to see all of Paris's landmarks. Do as the Parisiennes and enjoy your meals with time to spare. Learn a few phrases in French, like \"je voudrais\" - I'd like and please and thank you.

Each one of the six or seven staff members I encountered during my one-week stay was fluent in English and willingly accommodated my inept French speaking skills. I can't say enough about how well-mannered and accommodating the folks at the Reception Desk were. I booked a standard double room to ensure having sufficient space and was pleasantly surprised, on checking in, to hear that my room had been upgraded - to what I did not determine, and did not really care, since the room was far more than adequate for one person. The bathroom was very special, both in decor and in spaciousness, with, for instance, a separate, lighted nook built into the wall for one's toiletries, alleviating the crunch that occurs on having to place everything on or above the sink. The shower and tub fixtures were excellent and versatile in delivering plenty of hot water with no plumbing problems. The lavatory was in a separate room. The built-in closets and shelves were very spacious and were configured much as one would find them at home. Opposite the bed was a sliding glass door giving access to a small balcony with a table and two chairs, which, in warmer, drier weather would have been wonderful either for breakfast in the room, or an after-dinner glass of wine, reading, or simply relaxing after a long day in town. The room decor was truly exceptional and beautifully integrated, from wallpaper, to carpet, to painted doors and molding. There were two bed-side tables, a small desk and chair, and a separate table for a small TV set. One could hardly ask for more. Above all, the room was QUIET - acoustic isolation was superb, and that is a quality I seek and value above all. Interestingly, and quite strangely, the hallway was always lightly scented with the pleasant fragrance of, yes, chocolate! I was unable to detect that aroma in my room or any other area of the Hotel, however. The breakfast area, when full of patrons, did feel somewhat crowded, but le petit dejeuner itself was quite enjoyable, with a reasonable variety of items. Nevertheless, I've had more varied and substantial breakfast fare at other hotels in the same price range as the Grands Hommes. The location of the Grands Hommes was excellent in regard to proximity to certain key Paris sights, such as the Pantheon (directly across the street), Musee de Cluny (highly recommended), Luxembourg Gardens, etc. Granted, the nearest Metro station was several blocks away, but that was offset set by the nearby RER B station down Rue Soufflot, at the Luxembourg Gardens. Most importantly, the location opposite the Pantheon meant that the Hotel was never exposed to the maddening, insane traffic noise that one must suffer at so many other hotels in Paris. The location contributed to a much more quiet experience overall, and especially in the evening, when a good night's sleep is absolutely essential. Finally, on leaving, the taxi ride to Charles de Gaulle airport Terminal 2A took only 30-35 minutes. Bottom Line: book it, pay more for a larger room, and you'll always look back at the wise decision you made to stay at the Grands Hommes.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat view\u201d", "Author": "Winkie77", "ReviewID": "UR15105997", "Content": "Really nice room.

We were not disappointed at all, and instead were totally stunned at its romantic, convenient, and safe location next to the Pantheon in the Latin Quarter; its wonderful staff (2 women and 1 man that we met, all of whom were warm and friendly and spoke excellent English); clean, spacious rooms (neither of us had been to Paris but had heard how small the rooms would be--I believe ours was a complimentary upgrade and was very comfortable); and just a great overall ambiance and quality feel. Our room had a great view of the Pantheon, we had plenty of good hot water, the hotel architecture was beautiful, and as mentioned, the hotel staff was friendly and surprised us by upgrading our room to a larger size overlooking the Pantheon. Our only inconvenience, which is minor considering how very much we loved the hotel, and which seems to be common in Paris, is that the shower was mostly unusable at normal heights due to only a small glass enclosure between the tub and sink that didn't totally seal, leaving water running onto the drainless floor unless we took a bath or brought the shower head down almost to the rim of the tub. However, this probably wouldn't even be a problem without our water-wasting American habit of standing underneath the shower instead of \"bathing\" by holding the shower head in hand!

This was our first trip to Paris, and we were beyond pleased with the hotel. We spent a lot of time trying to decide which hotel we were to stay at; checking numerous web-sites, and reviews. First, no matter which web-site you check, the reviews of the hotel are consistent. All web-sites rate the hotel highly, and most all who stay are very pleased. Second, the hotel was spotless, and upon entering for the first time, the lobby is beautiful and classy. The photos of the hotel on the websites are accurate. The hotel looked as good as the pictures they posted for advertisement. The staff is extreemly helpful and courteous. They attended to our needs immediately, and spoke English, in my opinion, very well. I did speak a little bit of French, but they let me off the hook, and always spoke to me in English. We had no trouble communicating with them. As for the size of the room; understand that hotel rooms in Paris are not big at all, compared to American standards. However, I felt the rooms were plenty big. We had a room with a balcony, so it was lovely to sit on the balcony and look at the Panthenon. You have about 2 feet of walking space arount the perimeter of the bed. A large writing desk and chair where the TV sits, with about 2 feet on either side. In our room (#51) we had two nice sizeable closets. One with multiple shelves and a mini fridge where we placed all our folding clothes, another closet, where we put our hanging clothes, and it was also large enough to hold our suitcases. The bathroom was plenty big. Only one sink, but it was large enough for both of us to be getting ready at the same time, and we didn't feel too crowded. Overall, I recommend the hotel highly.

We stayed at this hotel in no small part to the reviews we found on tripadvisor. We had a great time in Paris. Overall the hotel was great. The staff spoke English which was wonderful as our French are extremely limited. We found everyone to be friendly. The check-in and check-out procedure was as expected with no issues. We stayed in room 54. I saw some of the comments from other travelers and they were mostly confirmed in that the room size is small but adequate for our stay and as expected for European standards (our hotel room in our London visit was pretty small as well). Everything was kept clean which is most important for us. There are a few things to note. First of all regarding the location. It's true that the Metro and RER stations are not right at the doorstep like they might be for other hotels however having both the RER and Metro nearby was very convenient since it provided more options. We ended up using the RER to go back and forth to the airport and used it mostly to get out and see the sights (after transferring to Metro stations). I would not recommend airport transfer using the RER for anyone with a lot of luggage that can't be easily transported up and down stairs, or for anyone with kids. Otherwise I personally found it convenient and cheap! A few words of caution. Don't count on using an iron. The only iron in the hotel is at the basement, next to the elevator and besides the restaurant. If you must use it, avoid the mornings when people are going back to forth to breakfast and you are in the middle of it trying to iron your clothes (like I was :)) I would recommend that a portable ironing board and iron be made available to guests on request. A minor nuisance as I only needed to use it once, but still something to watch out for. Next I found out that unlike with most hotels you turn in your key to reception when you leave your room and retrieve it again when you return. That was fine with me although what was strange is that to retrieve your key you just walked up and requested the key for room XX. There was no confirmation that it was your room, you were just handed your key. Theoratically I could have asked a key to whatever room I wanted (assuming that someone was checked in) and could have gotten it. Again, not a big deal, but it struck me as odd and unlikely something that would have happened in a US based hotel. In a similar fashion, when I checked in they didn't request any ID, I just walked up, said my name, and was handed a key. Very different from US based hotels, not better or worse, just different. There was one nuisance and that is a couple of times during my stay I would leave at 9 am, come back at 5 pm and either the room was in the process of being cleaned or in one case it was half done but the person had left in the midst of it. Maybe coincidence but I started hanging the tag that indicates \"please clean the room\" when I would leave and didn't have that issue anymore. That was only a minor point. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would definately return if and when I come back to Paris. It was a comfortable stay, we liked the location of the hotel and he staff were all courteous and helpful. Oh, and if you do stay at the hotel I recommend going to \"Crepes a Go Go\" a great little crepe place a couple of blocks away from the hotel. Loved the staff and the crepes were awesome!

Our arrival at the hotel was just before 9:00 am after a long flight from Brisbane, our first impression of the exterior and lobby was excellent. We were aware before arrival that we would not have access to our room until 2pm so were able to leave our luggage and return early in the afternoon to check in. As other reviews have stated the rooms are small (even the superior ones) but adequate with storage provided in a built in wardrobe with a safe. The bathroom was a good size with a large vanity and shower/bath tub, and of course all the necessary equipment - hairdryer, magnifying mirror and plenty of towels. Our room and the public areas of the Hotel were spotless, and the cleaning staff would always greet us if we met in the hallways. We opted to have breakfast in the Hotel as a croissant and coffee at a nearby cafe was 8 Euros each, and McDonalds is out of the question. A plentiful supply of coffee, fresh pastries, muesli, yoghurt, fruit, toast and toppings for 12 Euros was good value, and served by welcoming staff in a charming room. The front desk staff were proficient, but lacked warmth - no friendly conversation, at times we felt as though we were a nuisance, as they were busy and seemed unapproachable, so we only had contact with them on check in and departure. We did ask at check in - for recommendations for organised tours of Paris, but I felt that I knew more about what was available than the Clerk. Improvements - the reception staff could be more informative regarding Paris and the facilities within the hotel and understanding guests needs. For example on departure we discovered that there were powder rooms in the lobby, these would have been wonderful to use when we arrived at 9:00 am directly from 30 hours of travel.

Both rooms were decorated beautifully and very clean. No views from our rooms but this didn't worry us as we were out all day anyway. We arrived at the hotel before 12 noon but our rooms were not ready as checkin time is 1.00pm.

All in all, the hotel was good, not great. I think it's easy to build up your expectations based on others' opinions/reviews, so maybe mine were a little inflated. I booked directly with the hotel, which was far and away the best price. Based on the price I paid, I was happy. If I had paid their standard rates, I would not have been. The two main problems I had were actually with the service, not the room. -We flew in via redeye. When I booked the hotel, I requested an early check-in, and was told they could not guarantee it, but would make every effort to have a room available as early as possible. When we arrived at 10, we were told to come back at 2. When we came back at 2, we were told the room had not been cleaned, but that they would 'do it right now', and we were told to sit and wait in the lobby, which we did - for 40 minutes, with no apology. This, in my opinion, is not acceptable. -The second and more serious problem was our returning to our room one afternoon to find the door propped open, and no housekeeper in sight. Apparently they had just left the door wide open after cleaning. My wife went down to the desk, and was told 'relax, our hotel is very safe'. While this may be true, it was a truly shocking response. Again, no understanding or apology. And I think it goes without saying that despite how safe or unsafe the hotel may be, there is at a minimum a privacy and respect issue, whereby a hotel should not leave a guest's room open. This seems like hotelier 101 to me, and really just basic common sense. Aside from those two issues, the staff was very courteous, and helpful. Some other general thoughts on the room (we booked a 'superior'): -As should be expected, the room was very small. If you have more than one large suitcase, you will have trouble storing it. We had to put ours under the desk to be able to walk around the bed. -The shower is insane, as is typical in europe. No curtain/door, so expect the floor to have half an inch of water when you're done. Get extra towels for the floor, or bring your flippers. -The bed was comfortable - we slept great here. No noise problems. - Location is great. Beautiful views of the Pantheon. Lots of restaurants nearby, but less of the elegant little places like you find around Saint Germain. Definitely feels more catered to students, as it should given the location. All in all, I would say the issues we had were probably unusual, and that as long as you know what you're getting, this hotel is very good.

The reception staff were extremely helpful, spoke fantastic English and humoured us through our poor French (rather than making us feel silly for trying!) and assisted us with everything we needed. The room was lovely- tres Parisienne, and they had put us in a room with a balcony in front of the Pantheon and two sets of double doors opening out. They had also left some sweets and a note in our room wishing us a happy anniversary. The street is a bit noisy through the night but it shouldn't bother you too much if you're used to city living. The location was great. Close to many restaurants (some of which were really good) and shops, nice and quiet at night and we felt very safe. A few really good underground cocktail bars as well. Very quick walk to the Seine (ten minutes?) and good metro access (closest station was Luxembourg where you can take line B direct to and from CDG airport in about 30 min). Only negatives were that the pillows were quite uncomfortable, and we found the room really hot. It appeared that the heating was underfloor as there were no radiators, and the dial on the wall said it was on the lowest. So it was quite hot throughout the evening when trying to sleep. We didn't try the breakfast, as 12 euros is quite a lot, but the breakfast room was really lovely.

The room is modest in size but it's not too small. It was a really charming room, with the toile wall paper, trimmed doors, and decor. The room for 2 had a nice size bed, I think it was 2 doubles stuck together. It wasn't the plush kind of bed we are used to in the US but I was exhausted from sightseeing all day and jet lagged that I slept like a stone anyway. Also, what's great about the room is that you don't hear any noise from the other rooms. The hotel is in walking distance to everything. The metro isn't too far and there are tons of great restaurants near by. I read about Le petit pantoise on one of the reviews so I tried it. The food was amazing! I see why people rave about French food. We also tried ATELIER MAITRE ALBERT, which is near by. It seemed very trendy and it was always packed. It has modern, minimalistic decor. It was as if I was dining in a restaurant in NYC. The food was good but I think Le Petit Pantoise was much better. I love the Latin Quarter, where the hotel is located. On Saturdays, there is a farmer's market with just about everything. Also, there is a great boulangerie - Eric Kayser. The Parisiennes were lining up out to the sidewalk for the fresh baugettes and pastries. It's a great place to start the day with a nice croissant and coffee. Becaues it's a college town, there are tons of ethnic eateries too. The only small complaint about the hotel is that it's up on the hill. After a full day of walking around and sightseeing, the hill that was waiting for us at the end of the day was dreadful. However, when you stand front of the Pantheon, you can see the Eiffel tower straight down the avenue and it's quite a view.

Everything the other reviewers have said about this hotel is true. The Hotel des Grands Hommes is a smart, stylish hotel on a grand piazza facing the Pantheon and has beautiful decor, nice clean bathrooms, lovely downstairs lobby, helpful and efficient staff, etc.. Our balcony looked directly onto the Pantheon and was stunning. The traffic noise was not bad at all. I really loved the hotel but feel that it is important to note for future travelers that the hotel is uphill from the nearest Metro stop - about 15 minutes away. If you are European and used to walking so much, well ok. But the average American (like me) may not be and after walking around Paris all day, it was a bit exhausting to emerge from the Metro and then face an uphill walk to the Hotel des Grands Hommes. Frankly, at the end of the day, my feet were tired and it was generally dark, cold and drizzling rain and the last thing I wanted to do was trudge up that hill again, past the Sorbonne with all the student- types loitering about. As much as I loved this hotel's decor, etc... I think that for my next visit to Paris, I might rather stay somewhere a bit closer to the Seine and a Metro stop- such as the Hotel Louis II (newly renovated and about 100 ft. from the Odeon Metro stop).", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate", "Title": "\u201cSuperb experience at Hotel des Grands Hommes\u201d", "Author": "123AC", "ReviewID": "UR11466492", "Content": "Cannot fault our recent stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes.

Absolutely no faults - and I can find them if I have to. 10/10 for everything. A management team and support staff that should be very proud of themselves. Superior 3* hotel. LONG REVIEW: Part of the fun for me when going away for a break is to research my hotels, and I tend to use the Trip Advisor website as my first port of call to get a general feel. And I am glad to report that again, the write ups this hotel received do truly reflect it. We stayed 3 nights from 28 Nov - 1 Dec 07 inclusive, and stayed in room 54 which was unfortunately - and I would like to strongly emphasise it was the only down side to our stay here - at the back of the hotel. Hence, no view of the Pantheon! :-( We reserved some months ago via the website directly and got a good deal which included breakfast each morning. HOTEL The building is very pretty and faces straight onto the Pantheon. The Hotel Pantheon (part of the same chain) is right next door. Reception is tastefully furnished and check in desk discreetly tucked away to the left. Staff very curtuous, efficient and helpful. Our room was on the 5th floor. OK - it was small but we didn't care. Size isn't everything just so long as it is clean, comfortable and pleasant on the eye. And that it was - tasteful, clean, crisp and fresh as was the bathroom also. Loved the light fixtures by the bed. Plenty of toiletries and fresh towels each day. Bed was super comfy, windows could be opened for air in both room and bathroom, adjustable thermostat, mini bar was well stocked (bit expensive though - half bottle of champagne was a cracking 24E!!), and there was also a safe and a hairdrier. TV had BBC world. Without a shadow of a doubt, this has got to be the cleanest hotel I have every stayed at. Each morning when heading for breakfast, the corridors were a hive of activity with the maids setting about their business - and the entire establishment reflects this. BREAKFAST As we had the brekkie included, we actually only had breakfast on 2 of the 3 mornings there (had a lie in on the Saturday and so missed the 10.30 cut off). The breakfast room is in the basement which is sooo cute. Cavernous. Although on the small side, it did surprisingly always seem to have at least a table free for the new arrivals. You could help yourself to juice, cereal, fruit, yogurts, toast, jam/butter, dried fruit, 3 types of cheese and 3 types of salami/ham. Once seated the waitress would bring you a basket of fresh baguette, hazlenut bread, mini croissants and pain au chocolate. If you wanted anything such as omlette or eggs, you could have but there was an additional charge (on average 2-4 euro per item ordered). To be honest, what they offered as standard was already absolutely fine. LOCATION Great location. We actually walked everywhere whilst in Paris - so much that I don't think we got the full value of the Carte Visite Paris which we bought and is mentioned below. Anyhow, it's a 5 mins stroll down to Notre Dame from the Hotel, and from there if you walk along the bank of the Seine, you can get to the Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomph (at a leisurely pace) in about 45 mins. Obviously, if you stop off at the attractions in between (Louvre, musee Dorsay, etc it will take longer). EAT AND DRINK NEARBY Near the hotel there are indeed lots of bars, cafes, brasseries and restaurants - including a McDonalds and Quick fast food outlet if you are that way inclined. Also within the immediate vicinity is a pharmacy (which I needed on Saturday morning - ahem, to go along with the medicinal lie in!!). Just thought I'd mention it. As you are only a 5 mins walk to the Latin Quarter and St. Severine, you MUST go there at night as there are simply lots to choose from. Look for Cafe Rim - Italian - which was very popular the night we were there with groups waiting up to 20 mins for a table. Good sign. But all in all, there are so many places, it's hard to choose. One thing I noticed - lots of Savoie restaurants serving cheese fondue!!! TO GET THERE When we arrived at CdG airport (terminal 3) we took a short walk over to the train station which was in another terminal. Literally 5 mins walk. There we bought the Carte Paris Visite ticket which opens the doors to the whole Ile-de-France network : Metro, RER, Buses, Trams, SNCF overland suburban trains, the Montmartre funicular, Montmartobus, Noctilien and the Optile bus network - depending on the zones you choose of course (Zone 1 to Zone 3 or Zone 1 to Zone 6). You can buy it for either 1,2,3 or 5 days. We bought it for 3 days and for Zone 1-6 as CdG airport falls into Zone 5. The price was 38.50E but obviously the price will vary depending on exactly which one you opt for. As mentioned above, we walked everywhere so I don't think we got the full value - but not to mind. FYI a one-way ticket CdG-Luxembourg is 8.20E. There is also a taxi rank outside Quick fast food. ++ At the moment, there is a big wheel located at the place de la Concorde so at early dusk it's an idea to make your way there for a quick ride on it with a bag of warm churros to keep your hands warm!", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Toadman", "ReviewID": "UR11138845", "Content": "Wonderful hotel next to the Pantheon.

Sadly , when you see highly rated hotels on this website you tend to expect them to be everything to all . Biggest disappointment for me was looking forward to drinking a bottle of wine from my balcony and watching the sun go down over Paris. I booked the most expensive room ( Deluxe- number 1), assuming i would get the best view but ,sadly whilst this was very ornate and large it was on the ground floor overlooking the street: tip: book superior with balcony if you use the hotel website. Also the breakfast room is small (about 6 tables ) and located in the basement although pleasent enough. . Breakfast is poor by international standards- usual continental fare but no cooked breakfast available. If you book early on the website & get a deal including breakfast then take it or if you can't be bothered to get up in the morning and go search out your breakfast then take it. Otherwise for half the price you can get a much better selection for half the price at numerous bars , restaurants , cafes and crepe bars less than 100 yards away- most open extremely early. On the plus side the staff were excellent. All spoke English well and check in and check out was quick and efficient. Hotel is very plush , surprisingly quiet (even on the ground floor) - air con means you can shut the window if you want + heavy curtains. No tea and coffee making facilities but that seems to be the norm for hotels in Paris. Location perfect. Couldn't fault it for the money and despite my small criticisms wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Paris unless i received a very high recommendation from a close friend - and only then if they came in the top 20 rated on trip advisor! Tips: 1)Get one of the passes that allows you to use the metro /rer for a few days- you can then hop on and off without scrabelling for euros or thinking of the price and sometimes you just wan't to bet from A-B as fast as possible. 2)If you want to walk up the Eifel tower, get the right leg(s) of the tower-- some are for lifts, some for walking. 3)Visit Mont Martre - outside of the central tourist sights but beautiful.

Price - the hotel website was the best deal; the staff we very prompt and courteous in describing various options; we decided that \"breakfast included\" was better than an early-bird discount. 3. Breakfast - small, but very adequate cold \"buffet\". We might have found a better value outside the hotel, but the convenience, bottomless cups of coffee and Marika's warm and cheery welcome made this a far better option. 4. Staff - always friendly, approachable, accommodating and helpful 5. Accommodation - rooms were small but immaculate; the ensuite was pristine. We stayed in a standard interior room which had no view but was quiet. We stayed in a superior room (extra 30 euros) which had a spectacular view but could be noisy into the early morning hourd if we left the window opened. Both rooms neded more shelving for clothing. 6. Cable TV - BBC and CNN kept us informed. There were other stations in Italian, German, Spanish and French. TV \"size\" was not an issue. 7. Free WIFI - we brought our laptop; the internet connection was perfect. A convenient way to keep in touch with family, local news back home, to store photos, to confirm attraction information, etc. Local internet cafes were 4 eu/hr. 8. Cheap telephone - 10 \"Euro cents\" per minute to North America; direct dial 9. Access to airport - we took RER commuter train to hotel for 8 euros; the stop was a 10 minute walk to the hotel; We took \"Parishuttle\" back to the airport (19 eu/pp) since the escalators from streetlevel only went \"up\" and it was rush hour.

While small in size, the room was exquisitely decorated with fine furniture, an open beam ceiling, and upholstered walls in a Toile de Jouy pattern. This was a boutique hotel in the truest sense of the word. There was none of the bland and uniform decoration typically found in chain hotels. Instead, there was sheer style that constantly reminded me that I was in Paris! The hotel\u2019s location on the Place du Panth\u00e9on was ideal for exploring the city by metro or on foot. It was just a five minute walk from the Luxembourg RER station, which traveled directly to Charles de Gaulle airport, and a fifteen minute stroll to Notre Dame cathedral. The hotel was also well situated for dining out. There were many delightful places to eat nearby, including inexpensive sandwich shops and creperies, ethnic restaurants, and those that served traditional French cuisine, such as \u201cLe Coupe Chou.\u201d There was a fabulous boulangerie around the corner, an Amorino ice cream shop, and a patisserie called Dalloyau which made wonderful macarons. Along the Rue Soufflot, I found basic but vital amenities such as a 24-hour internet caf\u00e9 and ATM machine. Finally, I would like to comment on the staff at the H\u00f4tel des Grands Hommes. While a recent reviewer felt the service was somewhat \u201cimpersonal,\u201d I must disagree. I conversed with several staff members during my stay and all went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful.

This was perfect for us as we flew into CDG from Edinburgh and out of Orly to Avignon.No taxis, no rip-off, no 'scenic' detours. Brilliant. The hotel itself is realy, really good value for money. We stayed in some very expensive hotels in Southern France, but not one of them could compete with the view we had out of our room. The hotel gave us the central room with the large balcony which looked straight onto both the Pantheon and Sorbonne in the background. We drank Reinhart champgne on the balcony while watching everyone coming and going from the Pantheon and the Luxembourg gardens (connected to the Pantheon by a beautiful street which the Pantheon dominates). The rooms were very tastefully decorated. Classical motifs swirling on the felted walls, with wooden beams elegantly holdng up the roof. The bed was comfy and spacious. The room itself was typically (Parisian) compact, but not obtrusively so. The staff were helpful and friendly (chatty even at 6 in the morning as we flew off to Provence). On behalf of my wife and I, I want to thank the staff and the owners at the Grands Hommes for ensuring the first few days of our honeymoon were so memorable. Your hotel is everything that a Parisien hotel should be: friendly, warm, beautiful to look at, and, above all, classy. We will be back.

We have stayed in a number orf different small or \"Boutique\" hotels in the Latin Quarter on Paris' left bank over the past 20 + years, and have nothing but good things to say about our stay this time. While the rooms are small by American standards, this is quite normal and expectable for small hotels in Paris. If you want an American style hotel there are plenty to be found, but you will really miss out on something special. After all, aren't you going to Paris to experience the real thing? Furnishings were antique and lovely; beds were firm and comfortable for my bad back (not always the case in Paris); and the bathrooms luxurious with plenty of hot water. The rooms are air conditioned (also not always the case in small Paris Hotels). We decided to save some money by taking rooms on the back of the hotel, but many of the front rooms have terraces or balconies which look out onto the Pantheon right across the street. Maid service was very good. The breakfast, served in the \"cave\" or in your room is an extra 12 Euro per person (about $16), but it is \"all you can eat\" from a sumptuous buffet of fruits, juices, yogurts, cereals, charcuterie (deli meats), & cheese. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, croisants, pain au chocolate, and baquettes are served by the staff with butter and jam at the buffet. The staff was very courteous, deferential, and helpful....fluent in English, but very accomodating and polite in allowing me to use my somewhat less than fluent French. In addition to the Pantheon being right across the street, The Luxembourg Gardens are down the street, Notre Dame and The Jardin des Plantes are a ten minute walk, and the Louvre is a pleasant 20 minute stroll across the river and down the bank past the \"Bookanist\" stalls. Great restaurants abound all over the neighborhood, but Brasserie Balzar on Rue des Ecoles, our personal favorite, is worth the 5 to 10 minute walk and the cost ($70 to $90 per person with wine and coffee). This is not the first time we have done business with the hotel's parent company \"Hotels Paris Rive Gauche\". They own several hotels in the neighborhood, offering other options at primarily the 3 star level (one 2 star). The also offer a beautiful apartment between the Pantheon and Place Monge which we rented for one week at the beginning of our stay, and enjoyed immensely (but you have to enjoy doing your own shopping and some cooking). We have also stayed at their \"Hotel Residence Henri IV\" which offers mini-apartments with a small kitchenettes. That was lovely too. Booking direct with the company's website is very easy, and they offer a variety of discounts. The rate listed in the room was 255 Euro/night. Not including the breakfast we paid 121 Euro/night ($160). So what are you waiting for? Allez-y!

After a thorough review of hotels we decided on this hotel. The position was perfect if you are arriving from Charles de Gaulle as it is 5 minutes from Luxemboug Gardens RER station and there are no transfers. If you are arriving at Orly there is only one exchange. We actually experienced three rooms. We had booked the lowest price and although the room was spotless and beautifully decorated, it was small and at the rear of the building so we asked if a superior front room was available. Although not large by North American standards, the superior rooms are definitely worth the extra dollars if you are spending a few nights or more. We stayed in two rooms for the remainder of our stay and both were very comfortable. In each case we had a balcony and the rooms overlooked the Pantheon. We had very little night noise and that suprised us as we were so close to various Sorbonne buildings. The hotel is part of the Rive Gauche group and the Hotel Pantheon adjoins this hotel. All seem to be of good standard but we did not see any of the individual rooms at other hotels in the group. The furnishings are of a superior standard. As an Interior decorator I enjoy staying in pleasant surroundings but at an affordable price. The Grand Hommes is a small Parisien styled hotel where attention has been paid to every detail. The walls are covered in fabric and there are antique pieces in the rooms. Bathrooms vary in size, but function very well.

The room itself was delightfully furnished and the very comfortable bed had lovely linen. However as usual in Paris, space was at a premium. There was nowhere in the room to open 2 suitcases so we had to put one in the bathroom. And the view over the shabby internal courtyard was particularly uninspiring. So our final night in Paris had none of the romance I expected, and certainly no views of the Pantheon. The breakfast room (a vaulted cellar) was charming but cramped and claustrophobic. We were lucky in finding a table but others were not. The hot water urn was boiling and releasing its steam into this very small space. We should have gone out for breakfast.
