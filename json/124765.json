The view of the city is amazing, the food quality and choices are very good and the staf is very friendly and accomodating.

Located right on the Powell Street cable car route and one block from Union Square, the hotel is ideal situated as a base for either a business trip or vacation. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful starting with the doorman and continuing to the housekeeping crew. Everyone smiles and greets you as if you were their only guest. A nice, unexpected touch at a big (big-city) hotel. We arrived late on a Monday afternoon and were given a northwest facing corner room with wonderful views of the city including portions of the Bay Bridge, Coit Tower,and Alcatraz. The appointments were simple, functional, and comfortable, especially the wonderfully comfy bed. If you are an Elite member of Marriott's Guest program, be sure to visit their Concierge Lounge. The views of the city to the south, east, and west are spectacular and the continental breakfast features freshly baked croissants and pastries along with the more traditional morning fare. We really wished we could have stayed longer but, since our schedule called for an early departure on Tuesday morning, we had too little time to fully enjoy this first class hotel. We are already looking forward to a return trip and will definitely stay at this gem of a Marriott.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairndow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStandard Business hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "Katy1234585", "ReviewID": "UR126828088", "Content": "Standard business hotel in central city location.

Basic breakdown of the property as the location is your typical higher end Marriott property. Pros: Perfect Location: I prefer Union Square over any other area of the city. Much more centrally located than the Wharf where most tourists seem to stay. VERY close to all the Union Square shopping and restaurants. Cable car runs right next to the hotel on Powell street. Service: From check-in to housekeeping this is a highlight of this property. One of my buttons on a sportcoat I brought came off one evening. I had it laid on my desk. To my surprise after the housekeeper had cleaned the next day she had sewn the button back on! Now that is way beyond any expected service. Doormen are great for hailing cabs. Huge Lobby: Unlike many of the other hotels in the city this property has a large lobby perfect for meeting up with others or just hanging out. As others have stated the the rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom is on the very small side. Otherwise this is an outstanding Marriott property.

We came out to San Fran for business and booked at the Marriott Union Square, in the Club Level Rooms. The bump up in price from a standard room is by far and away worth every little penny to upgrade. The cost to upgrade every day we were there was less then breakfast would've cost at the hotel and we were able to enjoy the \"Club\" throughout the day! To begin, our plane was 45 minutes early arriving and we made our way to the hotel, in the hopes that one of our five rooms might, on the off chance, be ready. Here we met Susan, who was incredibly helpful, sweet, fast and nice! She moved some things around and found us not one, but two rooms that we could start with- which was beyond helpful to throw our bags in before our first appointment. We ran up to the \"Club\" quickly after that to grab a water and met Daniel, who was one of the team members in charge of the club at the time. He continued the trail that Susan had blazed with being incredibly helpful, with all kinds of hints to get around the city, what to do, what to do, what to maybe avoid and things that were definitely must-see items. It was also helpful to run into Daniel because he let me know that the car service that we booked for the following day could actually be backed up a half an hour because the traveling time was not as long as the company had told me to plan for. We were helped, several times, by the entire team at the front desk, and the bellmen, with directions of how to get where we were going, how to find the nearest cable car stop and how to get to the destination we were trying to find. They were always at the ready to help each and every guest. Every single team member at this hotel was nice, helpful and efficient. The Club level breakfast was awesome! Scrambled eggs, homemade oatmeal, toast/bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, coffe/tea - just about anything you'd order from room service. We did not get to enjoy lunch there any of the days we were there, nor what they had around dinner time, but snacks and dessert were great and it was always helpful to be able to run up and grab a water/diet soda, etc throughout the day at the drop of a hat. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the beds were wonderful! I'm not a great sleeper at hotels to begin with but the beds were very comfortable and I actually got a great night's sleep. I understand that because we were on one of the \"club\" floors that we had a room that was high up above all the traffic noise below, and the room was pretty quiet as hotel rooms go. I read many accounts of the bathrooms being on the small side and I would say this is the very tiny, only bad thing about this entire hotel, which is really saying a lot. The counter space, at least for this lady, is really quite small and there really isn't much room for make up and toiletries, etc. They even had more room to move it over, but it is located about five inches from the shower. I did find, if you move the shower curtain over to the opposite wall, which seemed like the sensible thing to do, that it gave you the feel of having more room and not being pushed out by the shower curtain. This hotel also has a computer in the lobby to print off boarding passes, etc and was efficient as well! All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful hotel, it's in a great location to cable cars, restaurants, stores, shopping etc that I'd stay here again in an instant. The team that works here represents their hotel very well and they should be proud of how wonderfully they represent the brand. (I work in marketing, can you tell?). But I'd tell anyone looking for a great hotel, that this is a terrific place to stay!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - Great location!\u201d", "Author": "BlkBetty", "ReviewID": "UR125944790", "Content": "This is a great Marriott.

This stay was at the one on the corner of Sutter and Stockton STs. The hotel is a nice property with doormen opening the doors as you enter and exit. Staff was friendly and attentive. The lobby isn't much: basic space to support check-in, check-out, a bell desk, and access to a restaurant. The rooms are comfortable with a cushy bed, flat-screen tv, desk, and great views (if you are on a high floor). Space is a bit tight. The room had a feeling of a long, narrow galley. I was disappointed that there wasn't a place (other than the desk) inside the room to eat. The closet was also small. Rather than a bar across the entire closet, there were to bars running from front to back. This allowed the closet to be more narrow. This might work well for people with roller bags. It was a nuisance for me because I have a hanging bag. Once the bag was suspended across the two bars, hanging clothes had to either be hidden behind my bag or placed in front, limiting access to the bag. Tolerable, but annoying. Most frustrating was the size of the sink in the bathroom. It was tiny with limited space for tools (hair brushes, shavers, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.). And using it I felt cramped by the shower curtain on a curved rod that caused it to insinuate itself into the space for the sink. I couldn't get it out of the way enough to not feel cramped as a shaved or brushed my teeth. Maid service was attentive. And, as a frequent stayer, I received nightly turn-down service: closing the curtains, a brief tidying up of the room, and leaving two chocolates on my pillow. My Marriott status also entitled me to the use of the Concierge Lounge. The lounge served a breakfast of oatmeal, cold cereal, scrambled eggs, the usual unripe fruit (cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple), and good pastries. The croissant were crispy and flaky. There were scones, pain au chocolate, and various fresh sweet rolls. Orange juice was served at breakfast. Coffee, and a selection of teas, soda, and beer are available throughout the day. The afternoon snacks were disappointing. Turkey and ham sandwiches on focaccia, a hot appetizer (e.g., mini vegetable spring rolls that were mostly fried dough with limited vegetable filling), a tiny vegetable \"salad\", and a cold antipasto tray that usually included slices of sausage, cheese, and olives. A later dessert included an assortment of three mediocre cakes and brownies. A nice feature is that the lounge is open all day even when food is not being officially served. Soda, coffee, and tea remain available. Between meals, mixed nuts, pretzels, and freshly baked cookies are also available.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "khobama", "ReviewID": "UR125461207", "Content": "Very pleased with the modern look of the place.

This time, however, was different. Instead of the double queen room I occupied on my previous stay, my wife and I stayed in a Single King Bed room with a view, and I felt like the room was much smaller than I anticipated. It served its purpose to give us a nice room to sleep and keep our stuff in, but everything was tight and cramped. I had to get dressed out of my suitcase in the closet, because my wife used the ottoman on the side of the bed to hold her suitcase, and the dresser drawers were way too small to hold a week's worth of clothes. I was pretty disappointed, because I was expecting a much larger room with the price I paid and the memory of the spacious double bed room. The sink in the bathroom was small with very little counter space, as noted in other reviews on here. We could also hear our neighbors in the next room when they were coming and going and also when they were talking at a normal volume in their room. We could hear a baby crying from a room somewhere around us as well. I can understand a little noise from neighboring rooms in a hotel, but this seemed a little loud.

Room was clean, view of the bay bridge and the Starbucks across the street. Its location however is good in Union Square. Allows you to walk just about anywhere you want to go, but parking is over priced and is only valet. I recommend it if you are over night or two, but if you want more luxuries, stay at one of the other Marriott's in the city.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Clean Rooms - Strong Rec!\u201d", "Author": "BornaTravelinMan", "ReviewID": "UR117981053", "Content": "Stayed at San Fran Marriott for 4 nights with children - quick trip to San Fran.

There was even enough space for an armchair and leg rest at the window area. We took a bay view corner room package and cd see a bit of the Bay in between the tall buildigs. But SF was generally foggy thruout our stay. The room was bright with large bay windows and with a contemporary modern decor. We found the room and bathroom clean and very comfortable. There was a gourmet coffee maker too. The vanity in the bathroom was rather small which made it a bit difficult to place our things by the sink. Other than that we were very pleased with the room. There's buffet breakfast downstairs which is reasonably priced. We found the location very convenient. The hotel is right at the cable car stop, across from two 24hr diners - Sear's fine foods and Lori's diner, across from walgreens, around the corner to Union square, chinatown, Macy's, Apple Store, boutiques and other shops. We walked down to market street to take the F tram to Fisherman's wharf and used the $2 ticket to transfer onto a bus from Ghiradelli square back to Union square!

So, no complaints with the rooms or service - All was fantastic and served the purpose of this trip. But, on routine vacations - we will surely stay at one of the more economical Marriotts. Also, they did not have connecting rooms, but they did manage to place us in rooms off the main hallway, in a cul de sac type of setting - private, with a door separating from main hallway. This was very nice.

I completely agree, and more on that later. The location was brilliant, uphill from the main Union Square action (Macy's and all those shops, including the skate rink as it was winter). The streets were lined with shops around. The tram stopped right next to our hotel. Also about a 6 - 8 min walk to the famed tram turnaround area. We liked it as it was very safe, bustling with life, food and shops. No wifi in room but the starbucks across the street has free wifi. Lori's Diner Chain also diagonally across the street. The very very popular Sear's Fine Foods is also across the street. We had a room facing that road and literally could \"monitor\" the length of the queue before we braved the wind to line up! This would be a great business hotel I feel, but served our purposes well for sightseeing as well due to its location. Only downside of the room would be the sleep quality. The bed was way too soft and caused a little bit of a backache for both of us. But other than that, the room was very decent sized, with great Marriott quality fittings and finishings as always. A side note for anyone who may be deciding between Union Sq and Fisherman's Wharf, do stay at UnSq! We went to the Wharf for sightseeing and it didnt even take up half a day. It was extremely touristy! Nothing much to do and looked like it would have been a dead town once it was dark! Perhaps not the safest to be. We were VERY happy that we did not choose to stay there.

While the location was quite ideal, I can say our stay was only fair. When we checked in early, they were kind enough to find us a room on the 29th floor (second to top floor). While we checked in, we got to listen to a front desk associate rudely talk to a person she was checking in who indicated that he had booked a different room than he was given (her response to him was essentially \"prove it\" instead of trying to help resolve the situation). When we got to our room we were initially pleased although disappointed that the concierge lounge would be closed until the next evening around dinner time. My husband and I then went out for the day and evening and when we returned that night, realized the possibly worst problem with the hotel... weddings on the 30th floor. It was 9pm when we arrived back to our room. The music was loud as could be and our room was shaking. We figured, wait til 10pm before saying anything... but we were on east coast time and every tired so we decided to call and ask when the wedding would be over. We were informed it \"should\" be ending at midnight. So obviously, we could not stay in our room! That is a serious flaw in the floor plans of the hotel as the rooms under the ballroom are not usable to sleep in when a party is going on directly above. So, to their defense, they did help us move our room and our belongings (which was much appreciated) but by the time we re-unpacked and got settled it was already after 10pm (or 1am EST) and we were very tired and acky from our long flight. The next morning, since there was no concierge lounge open for use, I ventured downstairs to ask about the other dining options in the area to which I was informed by the exceptionally rude front desk lady that \"we aren't giving you a voucher just because the concierge is closed, that is standard marriott.\" Well first of all, no it isn't. Second of all, I never even asked about a voucher or the concierge lounge, I only asked what dining options were available in the area. I guess I would sum it up to say if all you are looking for is good location and a nice looking clean hotel, this is a great place.

Check-in went well, and the staff we met in the hallways were very friendly. Our view was only of the building across the street, but when you're in San Fran, who wants to stay in a hotel anyways? The bathrooms were nice, the linens were fabulous, and the decor throughout was fresh and colorful. We got a steal of a deal; make sure you push for discounts. I was quoted different prices each time I called, but they made the right choice and honored the lowest deal I was quoted.

We had reserved our room 3 months prior to our stay, had paid in full at that time, had a voucher and confirmation for our stay, but the hotel had no record of our reservation. This kind of thing happens and I completely understand that it can cause problems in what may normally be an efficient check-in system. However, when things go wrong that are so obviously the fault of the hotel, I have certain expectations - the least of which is an apology. What we got was a long and frustrating check-in experience which included the constant re-typing of our names into their compuer system and the handing over of an inch-thick printout which we were asked to look through to see if we could find our names. Honestly - there were thousands and thousands of names in there for all sorts of different reservation periods and although the names were listed alphabetically within each list there were hundreds of lists (not related to reservation period as far as I could tell). After getting off a long flight, this isn't what you want to be doing for half an hour or more! Eventually we were told that we'd be treated as \"walk-ins\" but wouldn't be charged. Gee thanks for that. All I can say is that our experience should act as a deterrent to anyone who actually wants to \"walk-in\" and expect a decent reception! For our \"sins\" we were assigned to what my husband referred to as the janitor's closet on the lowest level of the hotel. I can fully endorse the other comments that talk about the plumbing noises and noise from the fitness centre. The funniest aspect of our room was that the closet was so small that the double sliding doors were each more than three quarters as wide as the closet - so there was hardly enough room to fit your arm through the gap when it was open at its widest! When we asked to change rooms the next morning (we had booked a king room but had ended up in a twin) the best I can say about the attitude is \"rude and very begrudging\". We were informed that there were no king rooms available, nor any queen rooms so we were stuck with the twin beds but still wanted to move to a less noisy location. You'd think we'd asked the woman at reception to hand over her firstborn! Eventually we were grudgingly given a new room - only a couple of floors higher (so definitely none of the views that had been described by others on this site) but at least it had a more standard layout (could actually open the cupboard doors for example) and it was quieter - only the traffic noise to contend with. Naturally we had to move our own luggage! In summary, the location of this hotel can't be faulted, nor can the housekeeping. The rest of the staff need an attitude adjustment and the rooms could definitely do with some soundproofing.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh, pa", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "lulupitt", "ReviewID": "UR54610904", "Content": "The front desk was great.

The Staff were great found us a room on the 19th Floor with views of Nob Hill and partly of the Bay. The rates were very good value and included Executive Lounge access on 2 days. The public areas on the ground floor are large and well furnished. Our room was a King not too large but certainly adequate, the views as mentioned were quite good for downtown San Francisco. The room was well furnished, almost new, very clean with a smallish bathroom. It did suffer somewhat from noise from the room above, more from the bathroom than anything going on the in bedroom. The whole Hotel seemed well adapted for 4 star accomodation. Every member of Staff we came across was very warm and helpful, from the Bar Staff, the Door Staff to the Reception Staff. The Hotel is about 5 mins walk from Union Square, just one block away and is on the corner of Powell Street, therefore easy access to the Cable Cars. You could walk to Market Street for the Trolley buses in 15 mins easy. Never used the Bart so cannot say how far that was. We did not have dinner at the Hotel, we did try the breakfast in the Executive lounge but found Lori's Diner on the opposite side of Powell Street to be our preferred choice. I know we didn't pay for the Exec Lounge, which is probably a good job, because having stayed at many similar Hotels in the Marriott chain and other chains, we found the Executive lounge of poor value. Only open for breakfast and the evening, yes you did get access to a computer and internet free (internet was otherwise quite expensive), breakfast was complimentry but not a wonderful selection available, and evening snacks were very small in size and small in quantity and yes you could have free soft drinks and coffee but the glass of wine came with a cost of $8 per glass. We did use the bar are most evenings, quite unusually, because it seemed so relaxing with great attentive staff. There was parking and valet parking available at the hotel which we didn't use, I don't know the costs. Overall, excellant, 4 star accommodation and very good rates very close to a popular part of San Francisco.

Hated Fishermans Wharf, it's full of cheap cr*p, total waste of space. HATED it. Alcatraz was excellent. Lombard street was just so charming, well worth the hike up one mother of a hill. I lost weight in SF! Walk to North Beach from Union Square, through Chinatown, you get some really good views of city. Go to Vesuvio bar next to the Citylights bar, it's where Jack Kerouac and other 'beat generation' names used to hang out apparently - we had a good time there!

I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Excellent. A few blocks from the shopping of Union Square and the nightlife on Geary street. TYPE OF ROOM: Standard Room. BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Excellent bed, high quality linens, and perfect down pillows. LIGHTING: Good lighting in bedroom and bathroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: This is the downside of the room. The bathroom is tiny and there is barely room to put a toiletry bag. They did a good job with the space but it is so small. The shower has good water pressure and can be made consistently hot if desired. TOILETRIES: Bed & Bath products\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Very good. CLEANLINESS: Hotel is 3 days old and very clean. A/C: Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use CLOSET SPACE: Average size, but may be too small for 2 people to unpack all items. STYLE OF ROOM: Very comfortable room and some nice style. COMMON AREA: Lobby is small and not really a place to hang out. Looks like a hip boutique hotel as opposed to a Marriott. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Room was exceptionally quiet but could hear a loud car go by occasionally. Definitely worth getting a high floor for less street noise. FOOD: Room service food quality was mediocre. TV/INTERNET: TV has many channels. Internet is available for $12.95 SERVICE: Staff are nice. One person sent me the wrong direction making me late for a meeting in the city. SUMMARY:Definitely one of the best Marriott experiences since it is brand new, looks less like a Marriott and more like a boutique hotel.

And what a room it was!! The other desk clerk seemed friendly and the concierge, bell hops and doormen were AWESOME!!! They always had a warm greeting and a smile on their face; very accommodating and helpful! My room was AWESOME!!! It didn't have the best view, but it wasn't horrible either- I was in room 1203. It was great because it had it's own little alcove entrance. The room was pretty big (king bed) and I immediately fell in love with the colors and decor. The bathroom is tiny in size, but also liked how it was decorated. The water pressure was perfect!! Maybe even a bit too much for the faucet at the sink. The toiletries are from Bath & Body Works. I loved the headboard on the bed-- it had two little reading lights that gave just enough light to read, but not enough to disturb the person on the other side of the bed. They now have flat screen tvs in the rooms. There was a nice sitting area (chair/ottoman) near the bay window in my room. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! I don't think there is a better spot in the entire city. It is less than 100 ft from the Powell/Hyde trolley and has a Starbuck's on one corner and a Walgreen's on the other. There were a lot of dining options in any direction once you walked outside. As far as the renovation is concerned, the only thing I noticed is that the front (the facade) is covered and there is scaffolding at the entrance of the hotel. I never heard any construction noise (but.. I wasn't in my room during the day). I was not at all inconvenienced or troubled by the renovation-- I can't wait to go back when they are done to see what it's going to look like! A small, but sort of important note: The elevators were very quick! I never had to wait more than a few seconds. Very nice when you come back and all you want to do is go rest in your room. I have been in hotels that I have had to wait more than 10 minutes for an elevator. I was traveling on my own (single female) and always felt safe in the hotel and in the surrounding area. Again, it was great that the trolley stop was basically right outside the hotel entrance. Some travel tips if you go: 1. Get a Go San Francisco card! I saved over $50 on attractions- I paid $79 for a 3 day pass and did: Wine Country tour , biked the bridge to Sausalito , City Bus Tour, Wax Museum, and the Alcatraz tour. You can purchase online, in advance. 2. Grayline tours (and probably all tours): Definitely ask for a DETAILED description of the actual tour. I took two Grayline tours (they were on my GoCard) and neither one really matched the brochure description. The City Bus tour and the Wine Country Tour. 3. I was told not to miss going to Scoma's and Boudin's for lunch/dinner. Both places were ok, but not worth the $$. I had Fish and Chips at Scoma's (Sausalito)- $24- way overpriced and nothing special. To be fair to Boudin's, I did NOT have the chowder; I had Jumbo Shrimp and Chips ($24.95)- the shrimp was tasty but again, not worth the money. 4. Get a pass for the trolley, MUNI, cable car system-- very convenient instead of having to carry around change and/or money for the fares. A 3 day pass (which I bought at Walgreen's) was $18. 5. If you are looking for the Real World San Francisco house, it's at 953 Lombard (not on the crooked section-- it's between Leavenworth and Jones and.. it's a very steep walk back up to Hyde- where the crooked street begins!) Again, I cannot wait to go back so I can stay at Hotel 480 again. It seemed like they had a lot of return customers. Each time I spent more than 5 minutes in the lobby (waiting for shuttles/tour buses), people were constantly saying Hi to the employees using their first names. It reminded me a bit of Cheers- where everyone knew each others names. I had nothing but an amazing experience at Hotel 480 and highly recommend it! (Definitely check out the discount hotel sites- hotels.com, travelocity, etc. for a reasonable rate-- I was happy to get it for $110 a night, but feel it's worth at least $200-$250!)", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson, Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding hotel - best bargain for a 4+ star in SF-Enjoy it while you can\u201d", "Author": "PVTraveler01", "ReviewID": "UR23706805", "Content": "Have stayed at this hotel when it was the Crown Plaza.

The location can't be beaten--it's about a block north of Union Square and just a few blocks from Chinatown (North Beach is also walkable if you can handle the steep hills in between). While I can't complain about the room--it was nicely appointed and clean--there were two major points of contention between the hotel's website and my experience. First, the hotel's fitness center is NOT OPEN. It's being renovated for the foreseeable future, which I hadn't known in advance (it would have been nice to be apprised of this!). The front desk said that they had made alternative arrangements with the 24 Hour Fitness located five blocks away, but that 480 guests would have to pay $5 per day to use the facility. I was horrified that they expected guests to pay for something which was supposed to be included--especially in light of the fact that it's WAY more inconvenient to use some strange gym than to just run downstairs to the hotel's own fitness center. When I expressed this, the manager offered to give me 2 days for $5, which I accepted (and by the way, the gym itself was pretty nice, but if you're a runner or a walker, you're SO much better off exercising outside because you get as much of a workout --no kidding, this city has some SERIOUS hills--and simultaneously get to enjoy exploring the city). I was still irked, though, that they charged me anything at all for something that I was promised when I booked (though I see that they've changed the website recently to reflect the situation). Secondly, there is no wireless access in the guestrooms at all. If you want to access the Internet, you have to pay $10/day for a high-speed connection, or you can go sit in the lobby and pay $5 for three hours of wireless. Can you get more stingy? Considering San Francisco's supposed to be one of the most \"wired\" cities in the country, the fact that the hotel doesn't even provide wireless coverage in its guestrooms is disappointing. A better option than the $10 high-speed connection is to connect to the wireless network of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel (located across the street) which is only $7 per day and sent a pretty strong signal over to my guestroom (and probably all guestrooms on the south side of the building). Overall, the staff were fantastic, but these flaws left me feeling somewhat disappointed. Had I known these issues before booking, I would have adjusted my expectations (and knowing them now, I'd still probably stay there again if only for the unbeatable location), If you don't require in-room wireless or the use of gym facilities, I'd highly recommend the 480, but if you do, you might want to look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lower Mainland BC", "Title": "\u201cGood value for price\u201d", "Author": "Jmbradle", "ReviewID": "UR14328718", "Content": "We got a great cheap price -- $160/nite.

Having stayed here before the change and now for 5 days after the change, I have a comparison that is not very favorable for the new ownership. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION Before I go any further let's state the obvious. You cannot beat the location of this hotel, regardless of who owns it or what name is painted on the outside. Located one block north of Union Square, right on the cable car line and with ample public (read - much cheaper than the hotel parking) within a block - visitors to the city will appreciate the central location. We parked the car on arrival and had absolutely no need to use it for the whole week until departure. Now the not so good news.,, Hopefully it's just the pains of transition causing some service issues but I have to say the majority of negatives with our stay were associated with the service. We had troubles with housekeeping opening a door clearly identified as \"Do Not Disturb\", phone calls from engineering at 6am about problems we never reported, etc. We were here with MacWorld and selected the hotel because it claimed free internet access for conference attendees - this was not so. This may be a problem with the MacWorld folks though. But once connected for the internet \"broadband\" - you're better off taking your chances on a modem. The internet access is terrible and in tremendous need of upgrade. The onsite restaurant is outrageously overpriced even for Union Square. We recommend Lori's across the street for a more reasonable (although not gourmet but still good) breakfast or lunch. We're hoping the sad state of the hallways on the 9th floor were due to intended/scheduled remodeling because if not - the condition of that floor is not anything a $199 a night hotel should be proud of regardless of it's location. Minor issues like a TV that continually shut itself off and on again can be overlooked if it wasn't for the $199 a night price. Speaking of the TVs - the small TV provided is kind of strange considering most major hotels upgrades to flat screens and larger models. Having said all that - We hope that this hotel gets it together and may try it again for a one or two night stay in the future to see if things improve. It would be such a waste to have a hotel with such a great location and enthusiastic staff to be hampered by a lack of infrastructure maintenance and management.

I had a guest with me and they even automatically asked her what her name was, just in case we lost keys and she needed to get in. Room - they honored our request and put us on the 20th floor with a nice view. The windows span the wall and give you a very expansive, airy feel. The room is cozy, but very clean and tastefully decorated. We got a king bed that was rather comfortable - wasn't the best of the beds I've slept in, but not bad. There were a couple of annoyances, however. First, valet parking at $43 + 14% tax (almost 50!) is just absurd. The second night, I found local garage parking for about $26 overnight. Secondly, internet service in the room is restricted to wired only. Normally that would be fine, but my gf and I both had to do work and were using separate computers. Without wireless, we couldn't do that at the same time. All in all, this hotel is great, beats many 4 stars that I've stayed in before, and is well worth it (especially given the low fare we found using priceline). I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Union Square Hotel Choice\u201d", "Author": "LasVegasMike", "ReviewID": "UR11027650", "Content": "Crowne Plaza, Union Square, San Francisco.

We got the BART from the airport to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was shortish walk from the station but we found the hotel very easily. We had booked the hotel through priority points and I think may have got an upgrade because of this.

There was some noise at night and you could hear the cable cars going up and down sometimes but I think that is what you expect in a big city! We had a wonderful time in San Francisco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we ended up walking nearly everywhere as the queues for the cable cars were ridiculous.

We had breakfast at Sears fine foods one morning when we were up early and it was really good, thankfully there was no queue as there was one every other morning.

It was one of the few hotels still available for the VMWorld conference, so we took it at a rate of $210 a night. When we arrived, we found the parking garage and pulled in. We were quickly told that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any help with our bags if we stayed in the parking garage, but the nice man there offered to bring the car around front for us so that we could go check in then get our bags. This was greatly appreciated after our nerve wracking trip from the South Bay to the city. (We stayed the previous two nights in the south bay to visit some friends). My husband and I gathered up our few items we wanted to keep with us at all times, and walked down the very steep (and slippery, BE CAREFUL!) garage area to the stairs outside to enter the hotel. When we arrived inside the lobby we saw the lobby packed with airline employees waiting to check out. There were probably 50-75 people ahead of us in line. My husband sat down on a bench with our items and I waited outside for our car. Our car arrived about 15 minutes later just as all the airline employees were boarding a bus to apparently go to work. As I helped the bellman unload the car, my husband called to let me know we were checked in and ready to go. The Crowne had upgraded us to a junior suite on the 23rd floor. The view from the room was absolutely spectacular, we slept with the curtains open every night so we could see the beautiful city lights. The room was quite nice and spacious. The bathroom was against the back wall, next to that was a small table and chairs for eating or playing cards. There was a rather large living room area with a sofa, coffee table, a chair and a television in a cabinet with some drawers and a refrigerator. Beyond that was a half wall separating the living area from the sleeping area. Directly in front of the bed was a desk with a light and outlets ready for your laptop. The room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable with plenty of blankets and pillows. Internet was not included in the price of the room. It was $10 a day for internet access, or $35 for the week. I understand that this is typical in upscale hotels, even though it frustrates me. That being said, when I pay for internet access in a hotel, I expect enough bandwidth to be able to conduct business (VPN access). The download speeds were frequently less than 200kbps, which is totally unacceptable. This was one of the recommended hotels for the VMWorld conference, which is a computer-related convention. A hotel should expect high internet usage when they are a participant hotel for a high-tech conference, and be prepared to handle it. Even on Thursday night, when most of the conference participants had left, the bandwidth still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exceed 310kbps. My expectations for $10/day internet access are much higher than free WiFi in non-premium hotels, and unfortunately the Crowne Plaza didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come close to meeting those expectations. We opted not to use the room service available, since the cheapest thing on the menu was a $22 hamburger that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem all that special from the description on the menu. A morning pot of coffee was $7, and a basic breakfast was over $15. Instead we went to the grocery store and bought a few staple items and frequented restaurants in the area. Most of the staff members we ran in to were very polite and friendly, especially the housekeeping staff. Parking was somewhat of a fiasco. It took a minimum of 15 minutes every time we needed our car, sometimes closer to a half an hour. At one point one of the door men got rather testy with me and told me I should call for the car before going downstairs, otherwise we should just go to the garage ourselves to get the car. (Which was fine with me, less tipping!) Not only did they expect a tip every time we got in or out of the car, the parking was $60 a day. (Yes, I said $60 A DAY). I understand real estate is at a premium in SF, but $60 a day?!?!? Again, no choice we had to pay it. When we went to check out my husband mentioned the problems with the internet, and how important it was for him to have internet access, he was met with a snide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and handed a receipt. Overall the room was lovely and most of the staff were polite and helpful. Would I stay here again? Maybe. It surely wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be my first choice by any stretch. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important for computer people to have reliable internet access. If it were free, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain, but considering less expensive hotels have better internet access this was a big disappointment. The room service menu being SO highly priced also put us off a little. The parking, well honestly it was kind of disastrous for us.

The hotel was predetermined, but I was still apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here. On arrival from the east coast on an early flight, I was greeted at the front desk by Jeff. He was pleasant and efficient, and had me on my way to my room in minutes. My room was on the 16th floor, and although I would have preferred higher, it was all that was available. On the floor, in addition to rooms along the main corridor, there were five or six alcoves, with additional rooms off of them. To get to my room, I had to take a right, right and another right off of the elevator. This layout really cut down on the corridor traffic noise, but the room backed up to the noisy elevator shaft. The room itself was a king room, small, and dominated by the bed. There was also a chair and ottoman, large bureau, desk, and closet. The bathroom was small but efficiently laid out>>but if my wife were with me, there would have been a turf war over the bathroom size. The large window looked out over Powell St, and had a side window that opened, letting in fresh air. Street noise was heard, even with the window closed, but not as intrusive as the always present elevator noise. The room itself was immaculate...under the bed, behind the endtable, everywhere. Possibly the cleanest hotel room I have ever been in. Back to the bathroom for a minute. Nice toiletries, plenty of clean, fluffy towels, and great water pressure. Tub/shower was very narrow, and water got all over the floor after each shower. Maybe the addition of a curved shower curtain rod would diminish the cramped feel. The beds are really trumpeted, both on the website and in ads around the hotel. While comfortable, I didn't find it warranted the bragging. The lobby was functional and clean, and several in our group used the concierge, finding her helpful. As far as location, it was convenient to everywhere. Union Square was one block awayand Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39, etc is just a ride away on the famous cablecars that go right by out front of the hotel. I did not use room service, or the restaurants at the hotel, but did note that the food provided by the hotel as part of the conference was very good. I decided to attack the debate about breakfast restaurants I read about in the SF forum. I went to Lori's Diner across the street on the first morning. The food was excellent, and plentiful, and the waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful. As I walked around the area after breakfast, I noticed about 20-25 people standing on line in front of Sears Fine Foods one block away. The next two mornings, I went to Sears for breakfast, didn't have to wait, and the food and service were exceptional. Prices were comparable. My vote in the debate would be for Sears, but you can't go wrong with either. Bottom line, the hotel was everything it presented itself to be on the website and in hotel literature.

Large room which was clean and well appointed. The hotel is located in a great area for a tourist but beware, there are homeless everywhere in the Union Square area of San Fran.--all day and night. Never did we feel uncomfortable near the hotel, though. Union square blocks away. Chinatown starts about 4 blocks away. Great shopping everywhere. Short walk to Bart. Busses all around. Trolley right outside front door. Touristy but if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your first time to SF, you need to take it. Take the Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf trolley. Not a bad walk to the convention center but if you are planning on coming back with bags of stuff from a trade show, try the Pickwick hotel a few blocks from the convention center instead. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boutique hotel so the vibe is different and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper. Positives: nice little goodies in room (soaps, eyeshades, clip to hold drapes closed,, etc). Large room. Nice pillows/duvet. Good sized bathroom (not big but not tiny). Excellent pressure/heat in shower. Very quiet (you can hear cable car bell during the day only) We were on the 11th floor on the Powell St side They try to make your stay comfortable with a relaxation CD but it's a spoken word thing which was rather annoying. CD player bedside Negatives: They were supposed to be luxurious soft pillow-top beds and I wonder if our room was missed. The bed was hard and not pillow-topped. I complained when we checked out but never heard back from them. They need to replace the straight shower rod with a curved one. Shower feels cramped (considering the location of the grab bar in the tub). $40/day to valet park the car. There is supposed to be a $30 lot down the street but we arrived in terrible traffic, it took 45 minutes to go 3 blocks due to a parade, so we just pulled into the valet since we found it first. CD player/clock bedside was so bright it lit up the room at night. The restaurant in the hotel too expensive. $21 for Sunday breakfast. Across the street is an average faux 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diner (Lori's) which is overpriced: $9 for a plain omelet. Down the street a few storefronts was a very good looking restaurant (Sears Fine Food) with a small line at 7am on a Sunday. We went to eat there at 9am and the line was down the block. We didn't have time (or patience to wait) but my guess is the food is excellent. Prices were great. Menu listed Swedish pancakes, French toast, etc. We found a hotel next door to Sears (Chancellor?) which had a breakfast menu posted outside. For about $12 we had excellent omelets with fresh vegetables/nice meats with real potatoes (not frozen) and excellent coffee in a nice environment. Up Powell 1/2 a block is a Japanese place which had an excellent lunch.

For starters, the rooms are relatively spacious, at least by San Francisco standards. The location is excellent. And the rate was relatively inexpensive by San Francisco standards. (I was fortunate enough to qualify for a corporate rate that was about 40% less than the hotel's standard rack rate.) To top it off, the view from my room on the 23rd floor was outstanding. (Rooms on upper level floors with views of San Francisco Bay command a slight rack rate surcharge. But the surcharge is apparently waived for some corporate-rate guests.) My dislikes about the hotel: A very bland, uninspiring decorating scheme, which seems to be highly typical of most Crowne Plaza locations. Inadequate air conditioning in the lobby, elevators, hallways and other common areas. (The weather was unusually warm during my stay, with temperatures in the mid 70s.)
