These days, a lot of hotels are trying to be conservative and replace their shower head to limit the water volume. But this doubletree does not disappoint me on that. We had no problem with the hotel at all during our stay. There is a small fitness room with adequate equipments to burn your extra energy. There is no free WiFi in room, unless you are Gold and above with HHonor and not book through priceline/hotwire (the frontdesk staff is well informed about it). Nonetheless, you can have free WiFi in the lobby. A microwave oven is provided near the frontdesk for your convenience (for the popcorns they sell, but they will let you use).

I placed a bid on Priceline hoping to get the Courtyard in Solana Beach, but got this hotel instead. Was a bit disappointed since Solana Beach has a bit more going on and how that hotel included wifi in the bedrooms. In any case I got a nice hotel in a nice area for a great rate of $58 and change a night including taxes. I was very happy that when I called to request early check in how the operator stated I could come at anytime and the room would be ready. I usually expect to maybe get a room 2 hours at the earliest, but was able to check in hours earlier. Parking is free, and check in.check out was fast and easy. They gave me the cookie without even bringing it up. I have a sweet tooth and yes their chocolate chip cookies are delicious. I just wish there was a tray of them in the lobby or a different worker there so that I wouldn\u2019t have them thinking I was a pig (I only had 4 during my 1 night trip). Service was fine, but I rarely had to talk to anyone about anything anyway. My room was smaller than I expect it to be, but the bed was comfortable. The only problem that I had with the room was that in order to get hot water to come out of the sink, I would have to turn the tub on to the hottest seating for a minute, turn that off, than go back to the sink and then hot water would come out. I was also able to hear a bit of the freeway noise from my room, so that could be a problem with someone who cannot sleep with any noise. It also would have been nice to have had a little fridge in the room, but for 1 night I didn't need it. The amenities I saw included a nice pool and Jacuzzi opened until 10 or 11PM. I wanted to use the Jacuzzi, but never did. Despite the fact that you have to pay $10 to get wifi in your room, it is free on the ground floor so I spent a little bit of time in the sports bar to go online. It is a bit of an inconvenience not to have the internet be complimentary in your room since these days we rely on it so much (and no I don\u2019t want to spend extra money for a breakfast and internet package in case management is reading this hah). They have a large restaurant too (never ate there), but around dinner time I only saw one person eating there. A few people did make use of the sports bar area since it was Sunday night football time and the bar\u2019s happy hour (beer and appetizers were at reasonable prices until 7). The surrounding area of the hotel is interesting because it seems to be largely in a business area with large office buildings surrounding the hotel. Nothing is within a few minutes walk except for an AM PM. I was familiar with the location of the hotel since I did live in San Diego for a year. It\u2019s in a very affluent part of San Diego with a lot of families, shopping, and restaurants. Everything you could possibly need is within a 5 minute drive, and there is also a complimentary van that will take you to nearby places if you don\u2019t have a car. All in all I had a nice, one night stay. I probably would have been a bit disappointed in the hotel had I spent the regular price, but since I spent less than $60 the price was right. Wouldn\u2019t have a problem returning if I got the hotel for the same price. Not having wifi in the room was a bit annoying like what other reviewers said, but not getting a complimentary breakfast wasn\u2019t a big deal to me. Similar hotels don\u2019t offer a breakfast either (unless you had a certain package) and when some do have it, it really is very, very continental with just your usual cereal, breads, coffee, and bananas. $16 for a breakfast buffet at a hotel actually doesn\u2019t seem to be that much for a hotel restaurant. In any case I would rather save a bit of money rather than spending a few dollars more just for a cup of coffee, a bagel, and a banana.

However, I do recall that the windows to the room opened. The hotel has a large pool, small work out room, and medium size restaurant. Some of the equipment in the workout room did not work and the treadmills could use some refurbishing. Nevertheless, they were free and I used them almost every day. The hotel provides free headsets for the exercise equipment TVs, but no cleaning supplies to wipe down the equipment. The hotel offers free warm cookies upon arrival - not a perk that I care about. I'd rather have a breakfast coupon, which they obviously provided to some guest. Several in my group said they received them and they weren't even Hilton members. Some guest were even giving them away in the elevators as they had too many and couldn't use them. When I asked about the coupons to management, they said that they had made some mistakes when distributing them to guest. Speaking of breakfast, the hotel buffet breakfast was quite pricey and the area can get crowded. There was a wide variety of dishes. On a good day, I'd recommend breakfast on the terrace and ordering a la carte. There was one particular waitress whose name I think was Becky. She was exceptionally cheerful and provided great service on the mornings that I visited the restaurant. The location is great and has easy access to I-5 and is about 20 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from downtown Del Mar. You can also get to Del Mar by taking the back roads and avoid I-5. Great option. There are several grocery stores - VONS, Ralph, a Rite Aide and other shopping and dining centers nearby. I'd recommend going to the Marriott hotel across the street for dinner. The group I was with had one bad experience. Pedro who worked the front desk and also served as the hotel's shuttle driver was assigned to drive our group to the office each morning. Although I had a rental car (parking is free!), I elected to go with the group each morning. One morning, he was running late checking in guest. We had to tell him three times that we were ready. Although the meeting location was less than 10 minutes away from the hotel we didn't want to be late. The group complained about his driving that day. He drove very fast, made sharp turns and speeding over the office parking lot bumps -- with 15 people in the van. Some people complained loudly in the shuttle about the driving as he had not driven that way on previous mornings. It did not have any affect on him. We assumed he was upset with our reminders that we were late. Either way, I would never use their shuttle service again and would recommend to management that they not permit him to drive in the future. Our group asked that we mention it to management so I did. Management said that they would address the issue. There is a business center, however, the computers had to be rebooted several times. Their software obviously had some glitches.

The food is good and the multiple large TV's indoors and gas fireplace tables on the patio make it an appealing spot to hang out and enjoy some drinks.

The Doubletree was very close to to our client site and convenient to Route 5, so getting to and from the airport was easy. A car is required to get to the beach, or shopping and dining.

The hotel is conveniently located about 20 minutes from Sea World and the San Diego Zoo and there were plenty of restaurants, both high-end and casual, for easy meals. Entering the hotel's parking lot is slightly tricky, but if you miss the first driveway, you can turn at the next light and enter via the business park entrance. The front desk staff were a joy to deal with and everytime our kids walked up to the desk, they were readily presented with warm chocolate chip cookies (yummy). The hotel and our room were very clean, but I was disapointed with the lack of a safe in the room. Most rooms provide a safe, so I took it for granted that there would be one and I was sadly mistaken (lesson learned). I've read several reviews complaining about the thin walls, but I can't say that this was my experience. Additionally, we asked for a poolside room (which we received) and the view was great. Our kids could play in the pool while we watched them from the room. Speaking of the pool, it was great! It had plenty of room to move around, plus there was a small wading pool and a separate jacuzzi. Since the hotel is located within a business park, there weren't very many families staying here, so we didn't have to deal with a gaggle of screaming children. Don't get me wrong, we traveled with our kids, but they're older and I just don't have the patience for young, screaming kids. My only complaint (of the pool) is the landscaping. The jacuzzi sits right beside a huge palm tree that drops flowers and other matter into the water, making it difficult to soak without becoming covered in this stuff. My only other complaint, is the elevator situation. Both elevators have a rear door that is used by the cleaning staff. I am not above riding on an elevator with service staff, but I DO NOT appreciate being packed in like a sardine with 5 maids and their laundry carts. The elevators (comfortably) fit 5-9 adults (9 being on the generous side and only if you have no bags). As I rode down from the 4th floor, the elevator stopped at each floor and the maids ( who failed to use common sense) just kept shoving themselves in with their carts. I had to paste myself up against the wall to avoid having my feet rolled over by one of the carts. I appreciate efficiency and making the most of a space, but that should not come at the expense of guests. Our room rate included daily breakfast, which was pretty good. I can't say that the food was anything to brag about, but it was convenient and the servers were very attentive. Also, the free parking was great!! Most of the area hotels charge anywhere from $15-30 PER DAY for parking.

I was not comfortable giving that to her and have to wind up paying $50 to have my pillows shipped to me. We don't have that much money..sad, but true as is with many people now a days. So, I told her I'd try to find a friend that was heading to the area and have them come get them in the next few weeks. I found someone and called Deanna back to tell her (the 2nd week they were left there) and she got all mad and said that she needed to know what day my friend would be there and I told her that she was going to call me when she knew what day she could head over. Deanna said \"well, I need to know what day she is coming. Thank you\" and she hung up on me!! GREAT customer service! She also said that they could not hold things longer than 3 weeks. Well we were good on that time frame then. That was a week and a half ago. Today, I called to inform them that my friend would be by to get them this afternoon. And Deanna pretended that she didn't know who I was, and tried to tell me that I must have stayed at a different Double tree hotel..what the?? She continued to play stupid and said she would call me back. When she called back, she all of the sudden DID remember me but said that the pillows were shipped last week. I asked if they were shipped free of charge because I never gave a CC # and never consented to that. She said that someone called and gave a CC# I told her that no, in fact no one ever did and asked what the Fed X tracking # was and she said they could not find it. I said that they had never been shipped then. She again said she would call me back. Never heard from her called and talked to a manager..who said they would call me back and hung up w/o even taking down my phone number. I waited an hour and called back and called Deanna out on the fact that she was annoyed with me and therefore got rid of my pillows. She said again that they couldn't find them but they were shipped last week by Hannea at the front desk...RIGHT! She asked if I wanted them to send me 2 of their Down pillows and I said no, I want a check for my $200 pillows or a 2 night complimentary stay.

We've stayed both as a couple and with teenagers. We are very practical travellers and really like great value amenities as well as feeling like we are valued guests. If you look at my other reviews, you'll see that we look for practical amenities as well as great customer service. First of all, even though it's a \"business center\" location- who cares...it makes it less expensive and they have free shuttle service to approximately 4-6 miles. We love just parking- for free!- and never having to use our car 'til check out! THANK YOU TIM & BRANDON! You guys are awewome!! So, it's a given that we love the free shuttle. We also love the free cookies (thanks Barbara for always giving us extra!! :) as it saves us money from buying desserts- especially with teenagers in tow :) And they also provide free water bottles & apples which also saved us a little $$$ too (does eating apples cancel out the fat/calories from eating their decadent, sinfully delicious cookies????) The free parking is great and much appreciated. I've read several other hotel reviews and man oh man, hotel guests (myself included) HATE having to pay extra for parking. You'd think they'd get a clue! So kudos to DT DM for offering this nice perk! The best tip we got on our first visit was from our shuttle driver, Tim when he took us to Torrey Pines State Park in Del Mar (Conveniently located 1.5 miles away from the hotel). Ever since he introduced us to this gem (shame on me for being a SoCal native and never exploring the great hiking they offer here!) we go there every time we visit DT DM. A+++ The hotel is very nice & clean, but I really wish they'd enforce the no smoking outside the front doors. Fine if you wanna smoke, but please don't force me to get lung cancer by blowing your nasty smoke in my face! San Diego REALLY needs to follow San Luis Obispo, which I hear is like the first 100% smoke-free city!! Good for them; I hope other CA cities follow suit...for our health & children's health! Pool: First time we went, very cold water. The next few times, nicer & a bit warmer. They only have 1 jacuzzi and it's pretty much kid soup all the time (they could still heat it a little more in my opinion, but it's better than other pools I've been in). B-/C+ But they really need to put soap in the pool bathrooms, both the men/women's didn't have soap, YUCK! My only complaint (but it's w/ all hotels) is when these parents bring their little kids/infants in the jacuzzi. They need to have an adults only jacuzzi or 16+ and over (and enforce it). It's really hard to relax w/ screaming 'lil kids splashing water at you (or heaven forbid, pooping & shutting it down!). Rooms: First few times we got a one bed room in corner and it was really noisy (traffic), the last time we got two beds in room in better location which was way quieter, so that's what we'll be requesting from now on. Very clean, standard room. whhile comfy, I do wish their beds were bigger. It's really hard to get a good night sleep in a double bed. So from now on, even when travelling as a couple, we'll be getting the two bed room. Rooms: B/Beds: D Nice amentity: they'll accomodate you if you have special needs. I needed fridge/microwave for my meds (and they normally charge), but didn't charge me. I hate being nickel & dimed so this was very appreciated and another sign of great management! A+++ Housekeeping: Pretty good, they provide extra towel, replenish whatever you ask for, etc. A Business Center: Nice 'lil perk - even though there's only 2 computers- it's free & they let you print stuff for free. Wow, nice classy service. Way to make us feel valued! A+ Gym: Small, few machines/weights. We never used it, but there's a water cooler in there which is nice so you don't have to drink warm tap water (or just go to front desk & they give you free water bottles). C Overall, I think this hotel is best for: 1. Business Travellers 2. Practical couples who want great value/bang for their buck Note: July 2010 they're undergoing renovations of their restaurant area Special thanks to: Barbara- a total gem (hope your cut is healed!) Ramaz- what a gentleman, always calling us as we check in to ensure everything is to our satisfacation Tim- a very well mannered shuttle driver- total sweetheart Brandon- another great shuttle driver who's a total sweetheart We had less interaction with (but also positive experience): Tom & Kent Overall, this DT is very well managed. Every time we do our little SD escapes, this is the hotel we'll be seeking out to be staying at. We are LOYAL customers and have told all of our friends how wonderfully well we've always been treated (yes, the cookies do help! ha ha!).

It's not a hotel I would have chosen without it, as it's in an industrial park and a bit of a drive from the sites we wanted to get to in La Jolla and MB. They had a decent rate and it looked ok, so we thought we'd try it. The front desk clerk and the manager of the hotel refused to honor the rate because \"it was too low of a rate for them to do it.\" ?!? They were rude and uncooperative. Phoned Hotels.com to enforce the rate. They called and were unable to get the mgt. to cooperate. Haggled with them for 2 days and then called Hilton Honors. Someone up the food chain finally slapped them up side the head and got them to comp the breakfasts we were entitled to. BTW, couldn't ck out because we had paid in advance and it was non-refundable. They really had us. Hilton Honors and Hilton Mgt. was superb in their customer service and communication. Will stay at the Embassy Suites in La Jolla or another chain in Del Mar before coming back here -- better location, better breakfast, nicer rooms and better service for about the same price. Ridiculous that I should have to spend one minute of my vacation with rude staff who are intentionally breaching a contract because they're too cheap to honor it.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, and serviceable hotel\u201d", "Author": "KLMChicago_IL", "ReviewID": "UR58890535", "Content": "As my business in San Diego was in North County, the Doubletree Hotel San Diego/Del Mar made for a very convenient location, and turned out to be a very satisfying stay.

The hotel itself is beautiful, but expensive. The rooms, landscaping, and personnel were all very nice. There is a small resturaunt that serves wonderful food, but the hotel is within walking distance to a mall with a bunch of other restuaunts. Let me start off by saying that I have never had to change hotel rooms during any hotel stay. My huge gripe was regarding my room. I checked in around 9PM and was placed on the 2nd floor near the elevators. The floor to the room vibrated as if there was some sort of ceiling fan on the floor below. I was extremely loud, frequent, but sporatic. By 10:30 PM I couldn't take it any longer and told them then while I was already unpacked for tonight that 1st thing in the morning I would need to change rooms. When I went down the next day to change rooms there was a list of people who called and complained about the noise because the front desk person referred to a list taped to the phone. My new room was still on the 2nd floor. The vibrating noise was not as loud and the floor did not physically move, but I could still hear the noise. Later that day, I saw they had placed another customer into the room I vacated earlier. I couldn't believe that someone else would have to endure that noise/vibration so I voiced my concern to the new front desk person. She said that they knew about the issue and it was a problem with the elevators and they were considering converting the rooms into conference rooms. I told her that they should fix the problem and NOT place people paying good money into those problematic rooms. She just shrugged her shoulders. I could not believe that no one from the corporate Hilton office is aware of this issue! This speaks very poorly for Hilton quality and I strongly feel if they were aware of the situation, it would be resolved. I placed a complaint with Hilton and am awaiting a call from the site manager. So while the hotel was nice, until they resolve the 2nd floor elevator/room issue, I would not recommend this hotel unless you can obtain a room on an upper floor.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Viejo, California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Value!

Public beaches in Del Mar are very close by and the hotel is right off the freeway. The hotel was clean and safe and the rooms were as well. I believe the majority of the rooms are set up with one queen bed and a sofabed with very, very few doubles or kings (if they have any at all). So the maximum comfort load in a room would be 2 adults (sharing a queen) and kids who are willing to sleep on a sofabed (my oldest thought it was cool). If Dad had come it would have been really tight for space though. They have an outdoor pool that the boys loved. The front desk staff weren't any more than cordial though. They didn't seem to care about being overly customer service-oriented. But we didn't need a lot from them so it wasn't a big deal. We didn't order room service and there isn't a regular restaurant there (only open certain times) but that was okay b/c there are plenty of restaurants in Del Mar to choose from and a kid-oriented one up the hill (Pat and Oscar's where kid's eat free on certain days).

Nice Neutrogena toiletries including face wash & a small tube of sunblock. The parking can be tight. What I decided is that as you pull in if you look for the perpendicular line that goes along the aisle those spots seemed to be smaller. Head toward the far side of the lot on the freeway side, or actually on the side of the hotel, and the spots are a bit wider. The narrower spots aren't awful, but if you need to un-load items from the backseat of your vehicle it's tight and you have to be really careful not to hit the neighboring car.

The hotel web rate was $139.00. The hotel is located near the 5 and 56 freeways so its very convenient to alot of tourist locations like Torrey Pines State Park. Importantly, this hotel is located near a business park. There is a Marriott and Hampton Inn across the street. I checked in on a Friday afternoon. There was a little bit of a wait but the clerk was friendly upon check-in. Priceline was mentioned when I asked for a room on a high floor that was quiet. Fortunately, I did get a warm cookie. I was given Room 355 which is down a long hallway and with a view of the business park and the 56 freeway. I could hear car noise when sitting near the window. So the clerk was friendly but really did not honor my request. The lobby area is relatively small. They have a gift shop right next to the front desk that sells soda and munchies. It is nothing special. Off of the lobby was a bar, restaurant, and meeting rooms. Down the first floor hallway was the pool area, fitness center, and business center. The pool area was nicely designed although one hears traffic from the 5 and 56 freeways. The fitness room was equipped with a bunch of aerobic equipment and free weights. The aerobic equiptment had small tv's which made the work out go faster. There were free weights to use but no weight machines. My room was adequate but nothing special. The room came with one queen bed, a desk, and a couch. There were two telephones but no refrigerator, mini-bar or microwave. I don't see it as a family friendly hotel. Also, one pays $9.95 to access the internet. On the plus side parking is free. The bathroom was nice with Neutrogena products. Towels were fluffly and soft. I thought it was strange the bathroom door was a track that you had to roll to close. It did not roll very smoothly and made the door hard to close. It was kind of a weird set-up. The hotel offers room service. Prices were expensive so I walked up the street to the local supermarket. They had lots of prepared foods so it was easy to grab a plate of food and walk back to my room. There were other food places in this mall including nicer restaurants as well as Subway like places.
