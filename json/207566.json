This is among the several Best Westerns all over Paris, in fact there are several others that are closer walk to Champs Elysees so if this is the only consideration then you may consider booking in one of those. The front desk are nice enough the guy gave us a map but not but overly helpful in terms of advise on getting around, for first timers we needed a little more help and perhaps asked them but they were a little brisk though not really rude. Also although they confirmed they had booked us an airport shuttle, the person on duty the next day when we checked out said it had not been booked and we were forced to take a cab to the airport which was very expensive from the hotel- about 40 mins with no traffic. The hotel has free wifi and an internet point where you can surf free for the first hour. The room is small with a small balcony and good enough for 2 by European standards. The sheets, towels, bathroom were all nice and clean. Our main complain was the safe in our room did not work and although we repeatedly requested it was neither fixed nor changed, it simply did not feel safe to leave our cash in a stapled envelope in the reception as they suggested. The breakfast was very basic- bread, eggs, bacon, some fruits and croissant- no cappuccino. They may consider upgrading it as most tourists like to have a full breakfast as they are rushed to sightsee all day long. They did have a tea time buffet but we did not have time to check it out. The good thing about the hotel was the minibar was free- although it had no alcohol- just water, soda and chips its quite uncommon and a nice gesture by the hotel for weary tourists with no supermarket nearby. In addition they also had in room free tea/coffee ingredients and good toiletries. The AC worked well too.

Understanding that the hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the US I knew we needed 2 rooms for myself my wife and our 3 teenage children. The days of sharing one room were over. With the weak dollar I was also looking to get the most bang for our buck. I was able to arrange 2 rooms one with a queen bed and the other room had a queen and a roll-a-way which my daughter said was very comfortable all for a reasonable rate. We arrived via Eurostar and as soon as we got off the train we were like fish out of water. With only my high school French to guide me we managed to find the information desk in the Gard Du Nord station. We purchased a 3 day metro pass so we were able to hop on and off the metro all day long, including busses. I suggest, the bus from the train station which takes you directly to the hotel. We were not aware of this and wound up dragging our luggage on the metro. As we exited the metro station we were at the Arc de triumph with is an amazing site as you come up from the metro. The Hotel is about a 1/4 mile down Friedland on the left hand side. We checked in at 4. Everyone who worked at the frontdesk was extremely helpful and were eager to reccomend places to eat. They gave us maps of the city. We had breakfast included in our room rates. The breakfast was plentiful and about what you would expect for a European continental morning meal. The hotel had an afternoon snack / meal which was ok but we are vegetarians and alot of what they served had some sort of meat in it. The location of the Hotel is perfect. The elevators a little clostrophobic for even 2 people. We chose to walk up and down as often as we could, except when we needed to bring luggage up and down. We had superior rooms which I believe are a little bigger than the standard rooms, but it was worth the extra money. The hotel was well kept and clean. I would reccomend staying here again on our next trip to paris. Contact the front desk direct to see if you can get the best rate and if travelling with children of any ages, let them know because they were very accomodating. After we checked out they held our luggage for us until we returned as we wanted to get in every last minute in Paris we could. We then took the bus back to the Gare Du Nord station which took about 20 minutes. One last piece of info. Everyone we met and interacted with in Paris were nice and helpful, but you need to try and speak some French first. If the parisians think you are just expecting them to speak Englsih just because you think everyone should speak English; this is not happeneing.

A little hard to find though. It took us over an hour of walking around before we found it. We should have taken a cab (our own fault)! Once we did find it we couldn't believe how easy it was to get too. The hotel staff were so polite and engaging. Every time we came in from a time of sight seeing there was someone different at the front desk. But all of them were so helpful. We stayed in one of the upper rooms overlooking the street. The room was huge. The bathroom was huge and had a towel warmer and bathtub. We had two windows that were heavy duty and kept out the noise but were wonderful to open in the morning to hear Paris coming alive. The room was clean, the bathroom was in excellent condition. The internet was free and worked in our room. The hotel is very quiet which is nice when you have been out all day. Some of the best features of this hotel. It is very close to the Champs Elysees and the metro. They serve a complimentary continental breakfast that can be served in your room--so every morning we had breakfast in bed. A lovely array of croissants, breads, butters, jellies, yogurt, coffee, tea or hot chocolate. They also served a complimentary light dinner buffet at the Best Western just a minute walk down the road and across the street. This buffet included an assortment of cheeses, meats, breads, and pasta or vegetable dishes. It also came with either tea, water or juice. This saved us a ton of money. There is a pharmacy on the first floor of the building the hotel was in--that was convenient for toiletries. The lift was small but could fit me and my husband plus our backpacks. I have been in smaller in Paris. There is a small refrigerator in the room, two night stands next to the bed, a small writing table, and a TV. This hotel in not located in a part of Paris that has a lot of pedestrian only streets. These streets around the hotel stay pretty busy. So you won't find any specialty shops around, like cheese, meats, breads, or chocolates. You have to stay on a pedestrian only street to experience that. But just a short walk over to the Champs Elysees you will find many little delis and grocery stores. So we were able to stock up on cheeses, yogurt, and breads to take back to our room. I would definitely stay here again. It is a little pricey, but we wanted to splurge a bit our first few nights in Paris.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent room and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "cdolan51", "ReviewID": "UR110611412", "Content": "Very good location not far from Arc de Triomph and Champs Elysses.

We highly appreciate his help! Next, the room was huge by Parisian standards and was very comfortable. The view was great and although the breakfast was not as great as other reviews, since their breakfast room was under renovation and we had been given breakfast in our room every morning, still it was hearty and filling. Although, the choices were limited to croissants, bread, tea, coffee, juice still we couldn't complain and had a good time. Never used to the tea time buffet since were were out all day visiting the gorgeous city of Paris. The hotel was also very helpful in keeping our luggage for 2 days when we were away visiting Burgundy and when we returned to Paris, everything was perfect and we were given the same room we had requested. The only con was a receptionist in the evening whom we had asked for directions to Laduree in Champs Elysees and he told us off saying he was busy and would speak later. Also, never use the hotel phone since we had called a friend on cell in Paris and were charged tremendously for the call! But that is something we didn't know... The walk to train station is beautiful and there are many stations close by--like Charles du Gaulle Etoile, Ternes, George V.

The room was large for Paris and the bath room of generous proportions. Very clean and fairly quite considering the location. Managed to sleep soundly the bed was comfortable but considering what we did each day I think I would have slept well on the floor. Now the advantages of this hotel over others - Complimentary glass of champagne - although we didn't actually get round to it. The breakfast buffet covered all bases with limitless cooked food , continental breakfast, bread, croisent,cakes,cereal, yoghurts, toast and fruit accompanied by cofee tea and choice of fruit juices. The buffet tea served in the evening. Tried this one evening and although limited was great if you were on a budget or in our case having to leave home at 3 in the morning to catch our flight by 7 in the evening after a full days sightseeing- too tired to go out to eat. The free mini bar containing 4 500ml bottles of water / coke and two cans of fruit juice was a great touch to take with you when sightseeing.

We were only a 20 minute walk from the Grand Palais and the Monet exhibition, the main reason for our trip! The Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay were also little more than a 30 minute wander down the Rue du Faubourg with all of its designer shops and outlets to browse \"en route\".

The hotel itself was wonderful too. Our room was a great size for a four star hotel, very clean, and recently renovated. We were in a superiour room on a non smoking floor with windows facing three directions. the first room we were shown was across from the elevator. That one was dark without much natural light and felt cramped. Our room was completely different- filled with light and very spacious. The tea time buffet is now in the hotel itself (no longer need to go across the street) and was an awesome bonus. We could overhear some patrons occasionally complaining that it was the same every night or not enough for dinner but that was not the point of the buffet for us. The point was to have a quick snack to tide us over between a long day in paris and going out for dinner. Some cheese and meats to calm our hunger- not to satiate it! With that in mind, we loved having tea time in our hotel. The staff were very gracious and the hotel manager was beyond helpful. We were using best western gift cards from canada and when we went to pay with them they wouldn't work in his computer. he spent at least an hour (maybe more) on the phone with the international office (the paris office was closed) sorting it all out and never seemed agitated or annoyed about it.
