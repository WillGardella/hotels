After having read some of the reviews and because of the bargain price (79 pounds/night for a triple room) we were mentally prepared for some hostel-like disastrous accommodation, but we have found a real gem instead! We arrived at London on early Friday morning and the hotel was just a few minutes walk from the St. Pancras International railway/metro station, situated in a really calm street and there were also lots of small shops and restaurants nearby. The hotel had a cosy hall and a pleasant atmosphere with soft carpets everywhere. All the hotel staff was very nice and friendly. It was absolutely no problem to leave our luggage in the hotel before the check-in and again the whole day after the check-out. Our room was situated on the top floor and there was everything that a tourist might need to stay overnight. The toilets and shower/bathtub were in the corridor on our floor and everything was very neat and clean. Our room was large, with a wash-basin, a plug adaptor, a TV and facilities to make our tea/coffee. The beds were comfortable and we heard no noise from the neighbours. In fact, there must have been other people on our floor (the hotel had no vacancies), but we never saw anyone nor had to wait for the shower or toilet... We had a great time in London, were very satisfied with the Avalon hotel and will definitely come back there again!", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cWORST NIGHTMARE\u201d", "Author": "avalonyuck", "ReviewID": "UR17806524", "Content": "I have traveled many places and have stayed in all types of accommodations, and the Avalon Hotel was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in. It was worse than camping in a wet tent and more uncomfortable than sleeping in my car. Upon check-in we were asked to pay immediately. I have learned from this experience to always ask to see a room before paying. We were in a room with two twin beds at the very top floor. To get there, we had to climb a very narrow staircase, where duct-tape was literally holding one of the railings together (a serious safety issue, especially when climbing up the steep stairs with luggage). As we entered our room's hallway, I realized immediately we had made a terrible mistake. The wallpaper was stained and peeling as though the roof has a serious leaking problem. The ladder to the attic was hanging half way down in the middle of the hallway and we had to go around it so we wouldn't hit our heads and for some reason, there was a coffee pot sitting on the floor. When we stepped into our room, we found even worse things waiting for us. On each bed were two badly worn-out towels and a bar of complimentary USED soap. USED!!! Both bars were unwrapped, with grey and cracking edges -- the words imprinted on the soap were also worn down which is what happens to USED soap. The bedspreads were obviously unclean as there were pieces of dirt and other debris on them. The floor of the room was sinking in, and there were even weak places that felt like holes in the floor under the carpet. The carpet was not clean (more debris), and was terribly stained. There were 4 large mosquitoes flying around the room. The room felt damp and looked moldy. There was mold on the walls, especially toward the ceiling. The furniture had not been dusted or cleaned in sometime. The window would not open or close all the way properly (plus one pane had a huge crack/hole in it). For some reason, there was a plate and fork sitting on the dresser -- both of which did not look clean. The drinking glasses were also not clean, and one of them had dried toothpaste SPITTLE on it. The toilets, located across the hall, were just as bad -- doors wouldn't shut all the way, the linoleum was badly bubbled, and the tile was missing off the walls and the walls were moldy. The room with the tub was even worse; very unclean and stained. Apparently there was a shower somewhere on our floor, but we didn't even bother investigating. When we asked for our money back, we were told that it would not be given back immediately, and the management would decide about giving it back later (through the course of the conversation, we were led to believe no money would be given back). We were told that we should not expect much more than what we got because we were paying budget hotel rates (68 pounds, which was approx. $140 American dollars). The man was also not concerned about the used soap or unclean appearance of the room -- said that he can't help what the housekeepers do or don't do. Bottom line, after a lengthy conversation, we realized it was either stay here or sleep on the streets (there were no other hotels in the entire Russell Square/Euston Road area that had any vacancies -- we checked, believe me!). While all of the above is more than enough to send one running and screaming from an establishment, we were truly stuck. As if all of this isn't bad enough, I am pretty sure the sheets of my bed had not been changed after the last guest -- the sheets smelled of cologne which I do not wear. We slept, or tried to sleep, in our clothes so little of our skin would touch the sheets. At daybreak we got up, grabbed our luggage, and got out of there. We left a note for management with our complaints and also asking for at least half of our money back. I doubt very seriously we'll hear anything back from those people. I am embarrassed to say that I even stayed at the Avalon Hotel because it made me feel dirty and itchy. It took me two days to get over the creepy-crawly feeling, and I still feel like itching when I think about it. Long story short, don't stay here. I am wondering if London has a government department that declares certain public places \u201ccondemned,\u201d and if so, I\u2019m wondering why this place hasn\u2019t been investigated; the Avalon Hotel is dirty and creepy, but more importantly it is very unsafe what with the taped-up railing and holey/weak floors.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Konstanz, Germany", "Title": "\u201cBasic with a capital B\u201d", "Author": "MaximoLider", "ReviewID": "UR16290670", "Content": "Ok, it's clean. Ok, they are friendly. And the location is not too bad (close to St. Pancras / Euston train sations). Unfortunately this is pretty much everything positive i can say about this place. It is basic - very basic even for London standards. The furniture looks like either someone disposed it or they got it from the salvation army, rooms are tiny, walls are thin (you can hear almost everone else coming and going) and the window did not close properly, i would not want to stay here in winter. Bathrooms and toilets are shared. Fifty pound (what i paid per night) will get you something more decent, with private facilities, even in Central London.

The location (Cartwright Gardens) is fantastic, and the room was perfectly serviceable -- small but clean. Breakfast was also very good.

I no longer stop at the Avalon. They are uncomfortable, shabby (not chic), cold and unaccommodating.

This is the absolutely basic accomodation and this fact takes travellers not familiar with London by surprise. The room and the bathroom were tiny and in need of some extra dusting, plaster was peeling, one of the faucets was leaking. Linens were well-worn. There were no things like shampoo. The walls were certainly far from being soundproof, which was a problem, since a public bathroom was next door from your room. We were asked to pay immediately upon checking in. There was nobody at the front desk in the morning. On Sundays, breakfast is served at 8:30, so you are out of luck if you are an early bird. The bottom line - this is a students' accommodation for a hefty price ($160/day for a triple room with a bathroom).
