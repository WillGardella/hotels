We were in New York for a wedding and spent little time in the room. Like most New York hotels the rooms are tiny, but have all the amenities I was looking for: A nice bed, internet access, an iron and ironing board, and a helpful front desk. We showed up a couple hours or so before check-in and the hotel was able to finish cleaning a room and let us check in early so we could start getting ready for the wedding. The front desk was helpful with directions and suggestions for bars and restaurants in the area. The bar right next door is a Philly cheesesteak place with a very nice selection of beer on tap. It was a good place to wait for our room to be ready. Overall this is a very good hotel for NYC. It doesn't get an excellent rating for minor things: the room size is small, there is no restroom in the lobby, and there is no mirror in the bedroom which makes it a little more difficult for 2 people to get ready at the same time.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "EJPel", "ReviewID": "UR126603898", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for four nights in celebration of his 40th birthday. Before our arrival I emailed the hotel and asked them to put a bottle of champagne in the room for when we arrived. They responded with a really welcoming email and as requested, the bottle was on ice as we were shown in....what was better is that they did not charge me for it either! The hotel itself was very clean, had a lovely standard of decor and the staff were absolutely fantastic. They provided a map of the city, and an information sheet that included recommended restaurants near by. While the hotel does not provide food, complimentary pastries, tea and coffee were provided each morning in reception. One tip would be that the Urban Standard double room (the smallest rooms) are very small, fine for a one night stay, but when I saw it I decided to upgrade as for four nights it would have been too small. However, the upgrade was so much cheaper than what it would have been when booking online so worth booking the urban and then upgrading on arrival. The hotel is in a prime location, a 5 minute walk away from the Empire State Building and comfortable walking distance to Times Sq, 5th Avenue etc. I would recommend The Mave highly, it was perfect for the price and the staff made it all the more enjoyable....oh yes and the showers were lovely, really hot water at all times!", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5 NIGHT STAY\u201d", "Author": "VORDIE67", "ReviewID": "UR126514986", "Content": "What can i say!!!, This was a fantastic hotel in a smart location, It's in walking distance to the entire local and national treasures. the staff were fantastic in offering help & assistance and went out of there way in making sure we were at easy with the fast pace life style of New York.

Let me give a summary of the pros and cons of The MAve: Pros: - Good service given by the staff in general. All staff is courteous and helpful. Especially Pablo and Armando, they were extremely patient in giving directions to restaurants and stores like Holister, A&F and Macy's. Pablo gave me several suggestions for dinner and suggested that I should purchase a 2-day hop on and off bus tour to have a better overview of the city. - Room is clean. The staff who cleaned my room did a marvelous job. Toiletries and towels are replaced. - Bed is comfortable - Walking distance to Macy's and Time Square. I did a lot of walking and hardly use the subway. You need a pair of good walking shoes if you want to visit NYC. - Nearby subway (line 6) - can take line 6 to 59th Street Lexington Ave and walk to 5th Ave and Madison Ave for shopping - Easy to use coffee machine in the room. You can also have a nice cup of hot black or green tea in the room. -Shake Shack - can take a 5 min walk to Shake Shack for a nice burger. This is the place that you must go to for a burger when you are in NYC. Cons: - The aircon in the room is noisy - Room is not soundproof - you could be woken up by the garbage truck in the morning. - Breakfast items were the same throughout my stay at the hotel. Don't expect varieties. You will be fine if you don't mind muffins and croissant for breakfast. Nevertheless, the coffee served at the breakfast area is good.

Pros: very clean and new, lovely bathroom, free wifi, comfy bed, breakfast included (see below). Cons: only one elevator in operation, which was quite small, fitting only about 4 people (without luggage). Sometimes I had extensive waits (especially at breakfast time) and took the stairs instead. There wasn't a fridge in the room either, and I would have liked to have been able to keep milk/drinks cold. Also there was a lot of traffic noise. My room looked over 27th St and at times it was really noisy with honking and trucks. I wore earplugs to bed. The breakfast each morning consisted of coffee, assorted pastries and muffins. If you want a more substantial breakfast there are a number of cafes and delis nearby. If there had been a fridge in the room I would have kept milk in there so I could have eaten cereal for breakfast and taken a muffin for a morning snack!

Luckily we managed to get an earlier flight and only needed the two exta nights, there was no problem cancelling the extra nights we provisionally booked. They were patient as we tried to find the extra money to pay for the room. The hotel is in a good location, close to subway stops. The Flatiron building is right near by, the Empire State Building is a five minute walk, times square a little further. We even walked to central park one day. The room had everything we needed including fast wifi! Parts of the room were a little worn around the edges but it was modern, fresh and clean. The room was a king size and an ok size but that's standard for the area. It was perfectly adequate but upgrading to a king would be worth the money. I can imagine the queen is a little small. The breakfast was a nice idea but didn't work for me, by the time I got there at 08:30 it was demolished. You either have to squeeze standing up in the Lobby area or take it back to the room. But it is complementary so can't really complain. Even though there is no restaurant on site they do provide room service from a nearby restaurant, never tried it but menu looked promising.

The location on 27th and Madison is excellent and a short walk to Madison Square Park, which is one of the greener small parks in NYC--lots of hyacinths and a great hamburger/shake stand. There are lots of good restaurants near the hotel and the staff provides you with a list and short description of each upon check in. The Hotel Lobby: This is a tall, narrow hotel---clean with a sleek, contemporary design and petite. This isn't one of your same/old, same/old chains, and the staff pay attention to the little details. For example, they send you an email before you arrive to see what kind of drink and nibbles you would like to have in your room upon check in---all complimentary. The Room: I'm a light sleeper and find street noise an issue, so I switched from the larger room I had reserved facing 27th to one in the back---all done without any problem. The room was small, but ingeniously designed with all the necessities: good drawer space, a desk with free internet, a double or queen bed with a very comfortable mattress and nice linens, a good-sized shower with high-end toiletries (great scent), and excellent lighting in the bathroom for applying make-up. The hair dryer was under the sink in a roll-out drawer---another example of the clever use of small spaces. There's even a petite gym on the top floor of the hotel, which was nice since the space was a bit tight for doing yoga. The Staff: They were wonderful, always ready to help, gave great advice on places to eat and things to see, and were very friendly.

I was given a room on the Fifth floor right next to the stairs so I was concerned about noise however I never heard a sound from the halls which was an extremely pleasant surprise. Room was a basic square with king bed and hardwood floors. Temperature was very good although the unit was loud. Bathroom located right next to the door --- small in size but everything was extremely clean and the walk-in shower was well designed so that surprising little water collected outside the opening.

Also wireless was free and strong signal.

The real problem is the noise: our room faced the avenue, which is well traveled by taxis and Mack trucks. Also, the heating/AC unit in the window sounded like a jet taking off, and the air in the room was extremely dry, causing real discomfort.

If it were not for them, then I would have to give this hotel only 2 stars. We booked a room with a queen size bed - well the bed was queen, but the room was most definitely not! Even by NYC standards (and I have stayed there many times) this room was small, with a tiny bathroom. Please be aware that the pics shown on the hotel website and many of the web portals is the Penthouse suite on the top floor, and shows absolutely no resemblance to the room we were shown into. The hotel offered to show us another room (which to be fair was marginally better, but still very disappointing). So we had no real alternative but to upgrade ourselves to the larger room featured on their website (at a ADDITIONAL cost of $125 per night + tax). So, at that point we thought we were settled - wrong! There were no instructions for the air conditioning units, so we tried for hours to get some heat before giving up and calling reception. The guys were helpful and we achieved some warmth within the half hour. Other stuff - the safe was not secured down at all (we could have just walked off with it! - so we had to carry valuables with us everywhere we went (not ideal - especially in NYC). The \"power shower\" wasn't (only half the shower heads actually worked). The room was on the 12th floor (so no traffic noise) but only one of the two elevators was working for a significant part of our stay (so we often had to wait for an age to get to our room). Breakfast - well forget it - it is a joke! A few bread rolls and pastries and some juice and coffee, served on a table at the back of reception, which you had to take back to your room to eat as there was no space to stand. Half the reception was being renovated, although we never saw anyone working on it during all the time we were there. Last adverse comment to make - if you are used to large fluffy bath towels - forget it. The biggest towels available to us were large size hand towels.

CONS: - Rainfall shower not bad but would have liked for it to have been more powerful and for the water to have been hotter as it was just warm. - No coffee machine provided in our room despite it being advertised on the website. - Would also prefer the option of having tea AND coffee in the rooms as coffee is not everyone's preference - but I have found that it is difficult to find establishments in New York that serve tea anyway. - We got the \"Urban room with a full sized bed\" which is the most basic room at the hotel. This was adequate for my friend and I as we weren't really in the room much and we only had one suitcase each. It is quite a tight squeeze so I would recommend getting one of the larger rooms if you've got a lot of luggage etc. As this room size does not provide much space for your luggage or drawers/hangers to unpack you clothes into.

They offered to help us with dinner reservations, arranging taxis to the airport and stored our luggage securely and for free after we checked out on the last day and came back for it later on.

Walking around the area you feel much more like a local, it's quieter and much less touristy than Times Square, but still conveniently accessible to most places by the 2 subway stations within a 5 minute walk (28th Street on the 6 line just to the east and 28th Street on the N&R lines to the west). We ate out locally a couple of nights - the Park Avenue Bistro (which provides room service for the hotel) is particularly recommended, and the Shake Shack just down the road in Madison Square Park does great burgers in a fantastic setting.

The place has some style, the free wi-fi, flat-screen tv and iPod dock are nice touches, and the staff is friendly and helpful--but in the end, the selling point is a clean room in a prime Manhattan location. We are former New Yorkers coming back for a visit, and we just needed a place to sleep and leave our stuff in an area convenient to everything we wanted to do--and this fit the bill. We had the most basic room category, which has a full bed--not a queen, as another reviewer said--and is about the size of a decent walk-in closet. But that was fine--we knew what we were getting into. The room was very clean, with crisp white bedding and a modern bathroom. A couple downsides: the humidity in the room was never quite right, so the sheets often felt damp, and the blinds let in a lot of light come morning. We got a lot of use out of the free wi-fi and certainly appreciated that amenity. One suggestion I would make is not to have such sharp corners on the beds in such a tight room, which invites people like me to smash open a toe on them. But whatever, I am clumsy. The part that concerned me was when I asked for extra pillows to elevate my foot and a staff member (who had come very quickly with band-aids and antiseptic wipes) told me there were no extra pillows in the entire hotel. Seriously? In a hotel? To be fair, he managed to produce some fairly quickly after that. Despite any such issues, overall it was decent value in the amazingly overpriced world of Manhattan hotels.

I have traveled a lot and this hotel had some of the best staff I've ever met (at par with many 4-5 star hotels I've stayed at) and the design of the rooms is superb -- right in the heart of NYC. This is a small boutique hotel that was completely renovated within the last year and no expense was spared. I was very surprised to find out that our standard (non-upgraded) room included: - queen bed with pillow top mattress - plasma tv with cable box - free wireless & wired internet (nice perk!) - gorgeous bathroom with designer sink, glass shower & rain shower - very modern design, furniture, art, etc. - free breakfast (coffee + snacks) - 5-10 min walk to park, bars, shopping, subway, restaurants & bars I've stayed in NYC before and paid nearly double the price for hotels that weren't anywhere near as nice as the MAve. Yes the rooms are small, but this is NYC, if you want a larger room you'll need to stay in the suburbs or pay at least 2-3x the price somewhere else. Before staying at this hotel I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and I don't think that people are comparing apples to apples on some of the negative reviews (ie: yes the room was tiny compared to places I've stayed in the suburbs.....but it was also about double the size of a 5 star hotel I stayed in Hong Kong). So here's my view on a few of the negatives that people have mentioned: - Rooms are small. Yes they are, but the hotel posts the size of their rooms on their website so that's up to you to decide. Personally I didn't go to New York to sit in my room, we were out all day shopping and taking in the sites and I can tell you that after an entire day of walking the spacious shower and pillow top beds felt like heaven! - Traffic is noisy. Personally I didn't have a problem sleeping and wasn't woken up by any noise, but I'm guessing that if you haven't been to New York before then adjusting to the noise of traffic might be hard - maybe ask to stay on a higher floor further up from the street? So this isn't really a downside of the hotel, it's just something to get used to about NYC. - Breakfast is bad. It's a continental breakfast which means coffee and baked goods (which were actually really good). If you're looking for a larger meal or something different, there are a few cafe's less than 5 mins away or room service. I did find that the coffee wasn't that great and let management know, a few days later they emailed me saying that they have changed to a new brand of coffee....you can't ask for better response to customer feedback than that. Also, keep in mind that the breakfast is free! - No fridge / restaurant in hotel. This is true, it's a small boutique hotel without a restaurant, but there are several places to eat nearby and room service is available. The rooms don't have a fridge (a bit disappointing) but the hotel staff was able to keep our stuff in the hotel fridge and brought us buckets of ice every day.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cWe were so pleasantly surprised by how...\u201d", "Author": "Swaban", "ReviewID": "UR70405067", "Content": "We were so pleasantly surprised by how great our stay was at the Mave for a weekend in late April!

We alwasy got help with information/ reservations/ advice from the warm, courteous and engaged staff. They made a real difference and were always ready with some advice/ help when we needed it. Complimentary coffee and pastries were made available first thing in the morning- which really got us moving. The location of the hotel was great for us, just 2 blocks from the Flatiron Building, which meant we could easily access subways and taxis for journyes up and down town. Really convenient, and there was a coffee shop for breakfast 2 doors away and a deli one block up. All in all, we definitely recommend the MAve, great value and made our chill out time in the Big Apple incredibly comfortable.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBoutique hotel this most certainly is not...\u201d", "Author": "RBB1982", "ReviewID": "UR52779625", "Content": "I booked our stay at the MAve through Expedia. The rate appeared to be good. The hotel was listed as a new boutique hotel in the Flatiron district of NYC. We opted for a \"Urban Double\" which included continental breakfast and taxes. So far, so good. Upon arrival, our reservation was not listed (apparently an issue with the way Expedia place bookings with the hotel). Not an issue as there was a room available - however this is a little concerning during a busy period! We were advised by a very friendly member of staff at the check in desk that breakfast would be served in the back lobby between 7 and 9am daily. The lobby had been bright and modern so I was a little surprised by the old lift in the lobby which was not in keeping with the theme (whatever that theme was!). The room was located on the 7th floor at the front of the building. So we were facing Madison Avenue. Not ideal as this is a very busy road. First problem is the size of the room...I am aware that space is of a premium in NYC and frequently the room sizes are small - however this basically only just fitted the double bed and drawer unit. Most of the window was taken up by an air con/ heater unit which was not only obscuring the view of the busy road but also amplifying the noise coming from said road - quite considerably. The temperature felt arctic in there so we turned the heater on - and - as expected this was noisy enough to compete with the road noise. So, we put our bags down...On the bed as there was no floor space for them both without obstructing both the bathroom and main room doors. There is a small area to hang your clothes - an ironing board (but iron available only from service desk- useful), a luggage rack which you couldn't open as there was not enough room for it, an en suite bathroom which was clean and satsfactory, but again, certainly not up to the \"Boutique\" hotel standard I was expecting - more travel lodge. The bed was very comfortable which was a great plus. The TV which although I don't spend very much time watching - was on the wall adjacent to the bed which in such a narrow room gave you terrible neck ache just to look at even only for the news! The main light is incredibly bright and against the white walls was harsh for tired eyes - they have no small lamp in this size room... So - sleeping was comfortable and clean but not in any way \"Boutique\", \"A Sanctuary\" or \"Relaxing\" as promised by the hotel. Down to the \"Continental breakfast\" which was included in our rate. On the way down in the lift we noticed people taking food back to rooms which we thought was a little strange, until we actually got down to the lobby and realised that quite literally in the back of the lobby is a table with a paper cloth on and some paper plates with a selection of mini pastries, flasks of coffee, milk, paper cups, paper plates, paper napkins. If I had booked a stay at a motel or budget hotel - I would be perfectly satisfied with this. However, for our romantic mini break in a \"Boutique\" hotel - this is not what I expected. Did I actually have to pay for this as part of my rate? I really hope not...We took our cold coffee and mini croissant, out on to the steps of a lobby across the street. This was not as I had pictured before we came! In summary - this hotel would be the perfect budget option for young travellers looking for a central location. Unfortunately, neither the price tag or the website describe it as such. This place could have been a gem. It is in a great location in the cool Flatiron district. Not far from the Empire State Building or from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the garment district, and a short walk to Soho/ Nolita areas. If only it didn't promise what it clearly doesn't deliver! This hotel is over priced and over ambitious. If you get a cheap rate and expect nothing more than a Premier Inn or Travel Lodge - then this place is for you. If you are looking for a boutuque hotel for your romantic mini break - go to another hotel.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North England", "Title": "\u201cNew York is an amazing place and this is an amazing place to stay while there!!!\u201d", "Author": "Misslje", "ReviewID": "UR52733084", "Content": "We stayed at the MAve hotel over New Year and had an amazing time.

They really couldnt do enough for you and went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we had a fantastic stay. Annetta in particular was so helpful to us while on our stay. The staff told us of loads of great places to go eat, booked a helicoptor tour for us and even helped us out when we had trouble with our Airport transfers once we had checked out of the hotel. (The company we used for Transfers was Super Shuttle- I would reccommed that you dont use this company as we had alot of trouble with them!) The Hotel is situated in the Flatiron area of New York which is really close to the Empire State building.There is no bar in the Hotel its self but there are loads of nice places to eat and drink near by. Its a 15min walk to Times Square, and is really close to Masy's department store! The location for us was perfect. On a whole i cannot reccomend this hotel enough.

Could have stayed cheaper elsewhere but this hotel offered a free breakfast and had good reviews. Free breakfast was a few pastries on a plate and coffee, if you were early enough or they were all gone. A few times there wasn't even any milk for the coffee and we had to wait while reception went down to the shop to buy more. I don't drink coffee so we ended up having to buy breakfast everyday anyway. I asked reception where I could buy stamps to send postcards and he offered to put stamps on and send them for me. This was over 4 weeks ago, I have been home for 3 weeks and still there are no signs of the postcards. There 5 in total, and I'm quite annoyed that I could have just done this myself. Especially as it cost me around US$15 for the postcards and 30 minutes writing them! Reception were very polite and bell boys were very friendly. Glad they had umbrellas for guest use as it poured the first day we arrived, and then snowed! Shower is a major OHS issue. There is only half a pane of glass covering the shower and no door so the entire bathroom floor gets covered in water, making it very slippery, and then the floor towels are soaking wet and there is nowhere to hang them so they can dry out. It won't be long before someone slips in these bathrooms and gets injured.... Would probably not stay in this hotel again unless I got a good deal.

The MAve attracted us first with its great location near Madison avenue and it is not far away from our previous hotel Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers at 7th ave. As our taxi stopped in front of MAve, someone opened the door and helped with our luggage in the trunk. I was surprised when I saw the front desk lady even came out to help. This was definitely the first time of all my hotel experiences. We felt so welcomed. Also on the same day we came back someone at the front desk came out and opened the door asking if we needed any help with the luggage- this time we didn't carry any luggage so we were fine. He said sorry and closed the door while we were still paying the taxi fees inside the car. It was not rude and once again we felt so welcomed. The service really amazed me!! I don't want to talk much about the room. It was not spacious but as I said the guest services at MAve was superb...that's all I care. I travel a lot every year and my taste of hotel becomes very picky. In the last three months, I stayed at Crown Plaza Time Square, a few Marriot, Disneyland Resort, Bentley, Sheraton, etc . Room size is not what I'm looking for because you spend most of your time sightseeing in the city all you need is a comfortable bed to sleep in. Think about in such a busy area in New York City, every square of space is expensive and you don't expect your room to be that spacious. The noises - hotels in a good location all have problems with noises. What I don't like about hotels in Time Square is the noises and lights coming into the room in the morning when you want a longer sleep. MAve seems it has no problem with the lights - our bed does not face a window =) When you arrive here, front desk staff help you with your luggage to your room and introduce you the amenities in the room. We find it odd at the beginning because no one in other hotels has ever done this. But it shows that people at the MAve do care about their guests. They also recommend good restaurants around the area. We went to one of them for lunch and it turns out that the sandwhich and salad were the best I had ever had! Oh what I love is shampoo/hair wash/lotion they provide here is H2O. In other hotels especially big chain hotels they usually don't provide products from a brand. I absolutely love the smell of the collection. There are definitely space to improve such as: add coffee maker/snacks and fridge to the rooms. I don't like to be thirsty at night especially the heating dries my throat. After all, thanks to the hotel staff provided us with some amazing services which really surprised me.

RE: the noise complaints - there was some noise bleed from the street, but with the heat running at night, I wasn't bothered at all. Not something I'd be all that concerned about - in NYC, there's no such thing as perfect quiet, and you get used to it very quickly. There was a solid, insulated block on both sides of the window a/c unit, and that helps a lot with noise reduction.

We wanted to experience staying in 2 different areas, and spotted this hotel on Trip Advisor for our first. Was very new at the time, quite far down the ratings list...but only because it was recently added. Every hotel needs to start somewhere, so we decided to go for it. To start, the area is perfect. Very central. We prefer walking, so it is very well located to discover Midtown to Central Park. There is also a subway stop within 5 minutes, easy. Just round the corner from Madison Square Park (Shake Shack...a must, Flatiron Building, etc), down the road from Empire State, not too far from Union Square (great, student area...bars, restaurants). Now, the hotel... The staff upon arrival and throughout our stay...extremely helpful, courteous...tick all the boxes in so far as customer service goes. The room...we chose the Boulevard King, and found it to be very spacious and comfortable. BUT....and this is a massive problem....the noise. I am so happy that we were given ear plugs on our flight over to NYC because they really came in handy when we went to bed. Ear plugs + jet lag = pleasant combination when staying at The MAve. I had asked for high floor room because I had read some negative reviews about the noise...but we were put on the 6th, being assured that as our room was not actually on Madison Ave, the room would be quiet and peaceful. Everything you have read about noise so far is true....the 24/7 traffic carries, no matter which side of the hotel you stay on, and it is true indeed...the old style air conditioners fitted into the windows are flanked by flimsy plastic sheets...even with the windows closed, it sounds like they are wide open. I didn't complain about the noise - seriously, there is not a lot the staff can do. I am not a complainer, I am a put-up-with'er. And I did not have trouble sleeping...like I said, ear plugs and jet lag. We were all in all, comfortable, and we did have a generally pleasant, trouble free stay. A few closing comments: 1) The hotel has been open for most of the year now, so when will the 2nd elevator be sorted out? It wasn't such a big deal, only sometimes we had to wait for a more than a few minutes. 2) I would agree that this hotel is more of a trendy, up scale hostel, as there are zero facilities offered by the hotel direct (room service is catered for by restaurant up the road, and breakfast, although not experienced, also sounds like it is arranged externally, and according to other reviews...well...just go to a deli instead). Imagine a trendy New York apartment building, but instead of renting apartments, you are renting a room. That is kind of how it feels. 3) We did pay more for the Boulevard King...I don't like cramped rooms, and it turned out to be a nice size. But considering what's on offer in general, I do think they could slash the prices considerably. I dislike giving negative reviews - too often I read reviews from people who obviously just have anger problems or expect way too much. But I will be honest in what I write and overall, I think we could have done slightly better than The MAve for the price we paid. Such simple things like good noise insulation and at least a small, in house breakfast bar could make the world of difference.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dc", "Title": "\u201cUpscale adult hostel, no working elevators or breakfast\u201d", "Author": "MaryCFP", "ReviewID": "UR47514977", "Content": "Positives: friendly staff, free wifi, comfy bed & lots of pillows (very firm), H2O bathroom amenities, huge shower head, & near subway; Negatives: no working elevators and had to walk up seven flights of stairs with metal covering (VERY noisy), breakfast consisted of coffee at 8:30 am on Sunday, postage-size room (upgraded @ $20/night to queen, much better), all street noise penetrates wafer-thin accordian screen holding window heating/cooling system, area offers little of interest (well, there is the museum of sex.)

There were times we thought people and cars were actually in our room. Ran the air conditioner constantly in a futile attempt to have the white noise block out the street noise, but even that didn't work. The noise really adversely impacted our stay -- but for that we could have overlooked the other problems. Which included the fact that the bathroom is so small they just have a half wall for a shower door. Which means the bathroom floor gets soaking wet every time someone takes a shower. I've experienced that in third world countries where the room costs $30 a night, but I do not expect that in Manhattan at the rates charged there. And, according to the in-room amenity description, extra towels costs extra -- we didn't try to order any so I can't say whether they would have actually charged us but, seriously, who charges extra for a towel when the room only has two towels to begin with?

The area around the hotel is good for walking - pretty much a daytime business crowd, very few clubs. We were ok without having a refrigerator. The hotel is very easy to access and is a good location for seeing Manhattan - near to important attractions (the ESB, Flatiron, Union Square, Madison Square, are all in walking distance, and the Museum of Sex is down the block!). The staff was uniformly wonderful to work with - everyone was universally friendly and tried very hard to accommodate our travel plans. We were always welcomed back when we returned to the front desk. It is obvious that the building itself is a work in progress - one elevator runs slow, the other is out of commission. We had a small problem with the half-wall of glass and the water coming out of the shower - the water surged from the shower head and splashed past the half-wall on to the floor in front of the toilet, leaving fairly messy wet towels and floor. The rooms are small by CA standards but average for Manhattan. We did not have any problems with the card lock or privacy lock, they worked perfectly the entire time. We also had a flat instead of a fitted sheet and that bothered me to the point that I slept straight on the mattress. My fiancee could live with it but the sheet was always bunched up in the morning. TV was great, AC was great, furnishings were good looking and adequate to hold out stuff. We would stay if we could get the same introductory rate, but we've heard that once the hotel gets going, the prices will go up. We like to try many areas anyway. We ate out and wandered NY most of the time and never used the Italian restaurant, Olana, or the breakfast (jet lag :-) Good place for the Flatiron district. Some more tips: Go to Cafe 28, catacorner to the MAve on 28th, a great place to get not only deli stuff but also fruits, sushi, chips, drinks, etc. Also, walk down to Mad Square Block (two blocks south) and find the Shake Shack around 2:30 to 4:00 pm.

Unfortunately, when we arrived at 4:30pm (check-in is 3:00pm) our room was not yet ready, however the staff was very accomodating and brought us next door for complimentary drinks at Olana - thankfully... since there is no where to sit in the lobby area. The room was very clean, trendy, and comfortable (small though - but common for NYC). The bed was very cozy and big! Loved the art work and furniture. The only downer(s) were that the mini fridge had not yet been installed and we were unaware the room would not have a bath tub (only shower). The shower was fun and new-age style, however if we left the bathroom door open the fire alarm would go off. In addition since the shower barrier is only half-way the water went all over the floor - so don't leave anything on the bathroom floor and I would recommend not to put towels down b/c it just makes more of a mess. The H2O products were nothing special. It was dissappointing that the following day when we arrived back at the hotel at 6:30pm to relax before going out to dinner to find that our room had not yet been cleaned. The cleaning staff said we were next, which was only mildly irritating, but that there is no where to go to wait it out (b/c the lobby has no seating). We had to meander around the stairs for 10 minutes. The hotel was exceptionally quiet for NYC, which was great, however the wood shade over the window really didn't block out the light from the office building across the street. When asked how our stay was going - this was mentioned and they provided complimentary eye-shades which really helped. The room next door had a very creaky door which got annoying after a while, b/c the guest seemed to go in and out every 5 minutes, but after they checked out and no one checked back into that room - it was fine. Since the hotel is new they are still working out a few bugs such as the elevator, of the two only one was working and very slow, but this will be fixed soon. The lobby was very elegant, but seating is absent and necessary. Personally, I did not like the artisan breakfast except for the coffee (yum). For the hype they give it you would think it to be spectacular. Of the three mornings we went down, all 3x I had to ask for plates and napkins, one day they ran out of bread before we came down at 9:30am, the other day we went down at 9:00am and only a few crumbles of cheese were left, and on a different day someone must have forgot to pick up the fantsy jelly b/c Shop Rite was the brand for the day with the price tag right on top of the jar $1.79 lol. I firmly believe they should have provided in addition to the artisan breakfast some fresh fruit (bananas and apples) and some fresh juice (OJ). The breakfast got boring after a day. Add some fruit, juice, peanut butter, bagles and cream cheese and that would suffice for a great addition to the fresh baked bread and cheese. Overall, the staff was extremely accomodating and helpful always asking how we were and how our stay was. They would do their best to make a situation better. Customer service was 100%.

Breakfast is provided every morning and consists of Artisanal cheeses, rustic breads, and honey. We never made it to breakfast, but when checking out, the spread looked exceptional. Part of the lobby is still under construction, but we were told a nice cafe or lounge would be built. This is a great idea because there is nowhere to sit in the lobby if you are waiting for a guest. Only one of the two elevators work at the moment, but since the hotel has a small number of rooms this wasn't a problem. The elevator had not been updated, but I gathered that they were working on the interior of the non-working elevator, and when they are finished they will start on the other. The hallways have been updated and everything was clean and sharp. When we opened the door to our room, it was clean and well decorated. It was very warm in the room, but we turned on the A/C and it was cool in no time. We reserved a Queen room, which was a little tight, but it was still comfortable. The bed was plush and inviting, and the hardwood floors gave the room a nice stylish modern look. There wasn't much on the white walls, but this also made the room feel less cluttered. All the furniture was modern and new. There was a desk, chair, dresser, and two end tables. The room has an IHome, 32\" HDTV, iron and ironing board, and a in window air conditioning. In the dresser there is a space for a refrigerator, so maybe they will be installing mini bars in the near future. The bathroom was clean with a nice size sink, big walk-in shower, and toilet. It was stocked with H2O bath products and had a complementary vanity kit. The towels could be better for this type of hotel. The water pressure wasn't great either, but it didn't take anytime for the water to get hot. One thing we really liked about this hotel is how quiet it is in the rooms. You can hear people coming and going as well as the elevator chime, but other than that it was extremely quiet and comfortable. The area is very safe and quiet, and I highly recommend a walk or picnic in Madison Square Park. We only had one issue with the room, and that was that our bathroom window was faulty. While taking a shower it fell out of it's frame and cracked. It was a jolt to the system more than anything, but we told the management immediately and were given a new room within minutes. We were also upgraded and all of the staff were very apologetic for our inconvenience. We were impressed with their expediency. Besides a few opening quirks, this hotel, is well on it's way to being a world class property. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a quality hotel in New York City. The hotels rooms, decor, and extremely professional staff would rival that of the best hotels in New York.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The MAve", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1477775-Reviews-The_MAve-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$243 - $456*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">62 Madison Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10016</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1477775", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/fd/f1/the-mave.jpg"}}
