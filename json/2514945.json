This hotel seemed to have garnered the best reviews for those in our price range, so I made reservations for three nights. The last time I found and booked a hotel in Europe, we ended up in a plywood loft (advertised as a 'private room') with the space below serving as a walk-through to the larger dorm area. So, I was a bit leery in spite of the reviews about what we'd find when we arrived. What we found? An amazing, lovely hotel with owners and staff helpful and courteous. Our room was spotless, fresh, and welcoming. Yes, it was small but a perfect size for a comfortable bed with bedside tables and excellent reading lights (a big plus where I'm concerned), a round table that served as our wine and cheese 'bar' with a chair and stool, and a large closet with shelves. The immaculate bathroom was en suite and even included a small tub, which I did use. Another huge plus of this hotel is the location, basically on Rue Cler. Rick Steves had noted this as the quintessential French street experience, and it was wonderful. Coffee, pastries, cheese, wine, pharmacy, chocolates... everything was within a few minutes stroll from our hotel's door. We discovered several cafes we really enjoyed, one being on the corner diagonally across from Hotel du Champ de Mars, Cafe du Marche. Another was at the end (Cafe Rouissilon) where the salads were great. We had dinner at Petit Cler where we were made to feel we were part of the local scene versus just tourists. Our neighboring diners lived in the area and were warm and open. Wherever we ate, the food and service were excellent and the local company friendly. When we'd return to the hotel after a day of visiting sites and just walking around, our room was as if we'd just arrived (minus our clothes and items) \u2013 clean and inviting. Due to the Air France strike we got 'stuck' in Paris; fortunately, our hotel could put us up for an extra night, which was great as I doubt we would have found another place we would have liked as much. We can't say enough about how wonderful this hotel, owners, and staff were, including their gentle and tranquil pup, Cannelle. We've posted a few photos, but they don't do it justice.

The owners Fran\u00e7oise and St\u00e9phane run and manage personally this little gem in the 7\u00b0 arrond. located between the eiffel tower and invalides literally around the corner (2 steps)from rue cler and one of paris's small and picturesque food markets located in this upscale residential neighbourhood. The hotel itself has all the qualities and ambience of an upscale little boutique hotel , with the rooms perfectly and charmingly decorated with all your basic needs catered too and thought of. The size are \"parisian\" meaning a french size dbl bed , which one could also describe as \"romantically cosy\". In addition a part of the philosophy of the owners,is to charge a flat rate per room the whole year round(which is extremely reasonable and fair for this area and quality of service even in low season, let's not discuss high season! ) This alone deserves a \"hotel management/owner oscar award\" and a special medal from the paris tourism board in our opinion!!!. Paris is always a special city and a magic city no matter when, but our 5 day stay in paris was made espeicially comfortable and pleasurable since we had the good fortune to reserve the very last room available , and be able to wake up or come back for a little rest/relax in this charming and comfortable ambience before setting off happily refreshed for dinner .Located in this area are also a wide selection of small caf\u00e8s (all very typical french) and a variety of restaurants and bistros..ranging from crepes, to korean to modern to classic french cuisine and everything in between,meaning that you have a great range of dinner choices literally at your doorstep or around the corner. The neighbourhood is flowing with a natural daily rythym of life and convenient to reach all other points of interest or neighbourhoods of paris either by a nice stroll (the best way to see any city) or metro or RER. An area with wonderful mix of locals and relaxed tourists ( i like to think intellegient tourists)..without the tour buses or tourist swarms/hoards that other areas often have. p.s i almost didn't want to add my review, since in my experience this hotel is already almost always fully booked by regular guests who come back year after year , or friends of friends who are recomended!

The front desk assured me it would be a quiet room. He was correct! My only complaint was there was one iron and ironing board for the entire hotel. So we all had to share basically. I didnt have the energy to iron all of my clothes as once so I just made do as the weekend went along. The breakfast was wonderful especially for 8 euros. The location of the hotel is perfect!!!

That was ok. we looked around and changed our plans for the day and headed to Museum Orrsay which was a short walk from where we were. It ended up being one of my favorite things I did on this trip so not a bad diversion. Upon our departure we arranged with the front desk for the shuttle to take us to the airport. The driver showed up 25 minutes early and we werent even close to being ready. He decided to go pick up other passangers and come back to get us. Well Monday morning in Paris is a very busy place so he never made it back to pick us up. The front desk (I wish I could remember his name!!) tried to find us a taxi as he felt horrible about our situation. After about 45 minutes and still no taxi he gave my husband 15 euros which is the difference in cost of a taxi vs a shuttle! Yes even in Paris this happened!!! Needless to say he was not going to give up until he found us a taxi and he did!!! We mde it to the airport with only a moment to spare as we were the very last couple allowed to check in!!!

The owner herself, a french lady in her 50s, sits at the front desk. It's only the last day that we managed to warm up to her.

My only two dislikes would be the system of \"holding\" a room. Sending all that information in an e-mail is an extreme risk and in a country where you sign for the smallest CC (even metro tickets) purchase it's surprising they would ask for such delicate details. My other dislike was that you turned in your key whenever you left, not because I didn't want to but upon returning one night at around 1am from being with friends the desk clerk was not at their post.

We had breakfast in the hotel breakfast room on the last morning we were there, and it was excellent value. There are two brasseries on either side of the street just outside the hotel, and shops and a supermarket (plus of course lots more restaurants and cafes) in the vicinity.

We wanted a hotel that was near to the tower and to be honest we considered others near the Latin quarter but felt it a bit too lively for us. We were so glad we stayed here, we felt the location was perfect and at 100Euro you really won't get anything else in Paris at this value for money. Arrived into the hotel on a Saturday evening at 7:30pm and a taxi from the Eurostar (Gar du Nord) was 18Euro, but this was because we spent so long in traffic, it was very busy. We had the quickest check in ever, just gave our name and were given our keys. We felt this was a little abrupt, no friendly chitter chatter, no offer or mention of breakfast, no map, explanation of area, however this didn't really bother us too much. We had the yellow room that other people have taken pictures of. Beautiful decorated room, small but perfect and clean. I wish we would have had a view, but with arriving later on this may have been the only room available, so our view was basically the roof below, however it was nice to open the big windows in our room. It was so nice being near the tower and we were able to walk there in about 10-15 minutes and picnic at the bottom of the tower. We even went up the tower at 11pm in the evening as we were so close. Rue Cler is literally on the door of the hotel and it is convenient for fresh bread and good value for places to eat. We found a supermarket that appeared to be open literally all hours - go out of the hotel doors, turn left, then left again and at the top of the street bear left and you see it. We bought many items from here to take back to the hotel, I just wish we had a fridge but the size of the rooms would probably make it difficult. No air con in the hotel which I was aware of, however they do provide a fan. It was 27 degrees in Paris when we went and I found the fan absolutely fine, but some people may not have done. I know many people seem to have issues staying in the 7th district of Paris, but we loved it and we walked everywhere just following the river. We even managed to walk to the Gare du Bercy for our overnight train to Venice (will do a seperate review). Granted, it did take about 2 hours 30, stopping for many rest breaks and detours in between, but it was better than sitting in a taxi in a heatwave! On checking out, the lady we saw was helpful and asked if we needed a taxi and let us leave our luggage. I agree that staff can seem a little unapproachable and we did feel we were interrupting phone coversations, but it's nothing to worry about and I just think it depends on what your expectations are. Every question I asked was answered - just not over entheusiastically if that makes sense! Oh and a thank you to whoever mentioned the gypsy gold ring scam. I wouldn't have known about it otherwise and twice they attempted it. We were lucky and politely told her to go away. The second time the same gypsy lady attempted it the very next day, we told her she was a 'bad lady' and 'trick' and seemed to attract the attention of other tourists. At that point the gypsy in perfect english said 'you b!tch!'

My friend and I stayed in a room with two twin beds pushed together and there was not much room to maneuver about. So, if you need a lot of personal space this is probably not a good choice. You can feel confined at points, but the room is comfortable and you can always venture out into the neighborhood if you need to escape. If you are in Paris for leisure, you probably won't be spending much time in the room anyway. The bathroom also is very tiny but has hot water with a lot of pressure. Our room was unbearably hot, but we figured out how to control the heat and it was all good after that. However, be warned the hotel does not have air conditioning so I would not recommend it for summer stays. For 100 Euros a night, this place is a great bargain.

You also have your own full-service post office around the corner, and goodness knows, there are two ATMs on every block. We arrived from our transatlantic flight too early in the morning to check into our room, so the mgmt allowed us to hold our luggage (right there in the precious lobby,) while we started our city wandering. Upon our return several hours later, not only was the room ready but our bags had already been moved to it for us! We had a totally cozy and comfortable gem of a room on the ground floor with a private postage-stamp sized courtyard, it was perfect. Excellent wi fi reception, which was critical for uploading each day's photos at each day's end. Arguably, the best water pressure either of us had ever received in a hotel shower, that's for sure. CNN is the only English-language tv channel, but we only had it on in the background at night so that was a very minor minus, indeed. There is breakfast served in a downstairs dining room but for an extra 8EUR pp, so we passed and easily made our daily choices for much less at a few of \"our\" bakeries and cafes on our walks btwn the hotel and the metro stop around the corner, no problem.

Just off bustling Rue Cler, the location was a huge selling point for us. Hotel du Champ de Mars is positioned right in between the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides, and is less than a 10 minute walk to each. But, our favorite part about the location was that Rue Cler was right outside the front door. An extremely charming pedestrian street with open-air markets, restaurants, and shops - there's always something happening. We were a little unsure about finding a place to eat late on Saturday night (11pm), but there were still a number of options right around the corner, and we still felt safe walking around the area after 2am. It had a great neighborhood feel. The room we stayed in (#2) was small, but very clean and well kept. We even had a little courtyard entry to the room, which made it quiet and private, as if we were staying in our own separate bungalow. We didn't see a single other person while we were there that did not work at the hotel. Definitely a huge bonus for a quaint and romantic weekend! The bed was comfortable, the bath/shower had plenty of hot water and pressure, and there was even a television in the top corner of the room with CNN in english. The owners of the hotel were extremely nice, helpful, and unassuming. They have the front desk staffed 24 hrs/day due to the fact that when you leave the hotel you need to leave your room key with them. This turned out to be sort of an unexpected surprise for me, as you didn't have to worry about losing your key, and there was always someone available to help with anything you need. Apart from the owners, there were two other gentlemen who helped cover the night shift at the desk, and all spoke english pretty well. At the front desk, were able to buy museum passes, print Eiffel Tower tickets, as well as arrange an airport shuttle. There was a small miscommunication issue with the shuttle due to the fact that is was going between two of the desk attendants and we weren't completely sure they had it scheduled for pick-up, but it ended up working out in the end.

There are a number of very nice eateries - and one very bad one - If you are fortunate you won't discover it! Just look at the place which has the fewest customers - at any time of the day. I recommend this hotel to any and all who are looking for a great place, in the french tradition and not just another big, expensive hotel where you may as well be in Chicago!

Many times, Francois went to the map to show us where to go, and what RER, Metro, or bus line, so in our experience, very nice! People, the building was built in 1864, ...you can't expect TOO much.

The din from Cafe du Marche could be heard from our room, which, was kind of neat to hear. Francois told us the street side rooms are a little noisy, but we preferred the larger rooms, which, are street-side, by the way ;) Just blocks from the Eiffel Tour, this Rue Cler area hotel is a great location.

He said that the metro was slow on Sundays and didn't run until 6am and we'd be taking a risk by using the metro/RER.

We went back up to the room and I looked up the metro schedule again which said \"all trains start running at 5:20 AM...\" so I went downstairs to show him and asked how their website could be wrong.

When we first checked arrived we told the woman at the desk that we were there to check in. I think she spoke some English, but she didn't seem to want to speak it. My husband knows a bit of French, so he spoke to her in French. She answered the questions that we had, but she didn't seem overly friendly. She guided us to our room, which was on the fourth floor. The elevator was small, that with our big backpacks, we could only use it one at a time.

However, we visited in May, so it was cool enough in the room with the windows closed. Having the windows closed kept out most of the noise. The room and bathroom were both clean and charming. We were very impressed with the cleanliness and appearance of the room, especially for the price that we paid and the location of the hotel. When you leave the hotel you must drop off your room key to the person waiting the desk. A few times there wasn't anyone sitting at the desk when we left, so we just left it there. That seemed to be an alright thing to do. The other people working the desk at various times were incredibly friendly and nice. The hotel offered a breakfast, but it was extra. We didn't pay for it, so I don't know how it was. Overall, we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris!", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wollongong", "Title": "\u201cDont expect much help from the owners!\u201d", "Author": "jp198090", "ReviewID": "UR72810177", "Content": "This hotel was in a great location (you can see the top of the eiffel tower from your room!) but in summer don't expect to get to sleep early as across the road is a row of restaurants that don't close till around 2 am and with no air conditioning you have to keep the windows open. The rooms were always made up and clean which was good and you had a small elevator to take you to your floor which was cute.

Had 4 nights at this hotel. Loved it!!!! We had none of the hiccups or complaints that others have noted in their reviews - we didnt even see the potential of them. It may have to do with 2 things: 1)We were there after high season - July and August - everyone was telling us Paris is nuts then; 2) We smiled and said please and thank you often - we did notice that many did not . The old addage is true - you get what you give. Our front desk people we all great except one - no problem though - Slim on the next shift took care of our needs. BTW - Slim is great - super helpful, very understanding - got us dinner reservations when I could not myself. The room was clean, bright, very comfortable. We were in room 45 and looking out our window to the left could see the top half of the Eiffel tower - the room next to us (41 I think should also have a good view). For the view - ask for a room on the 4th or 5th floor facing Rue Champ Du Mar. You will have a little nightlife noise from the Brasseries down the street - but you also get a view. RE: the elevator complaints others have - get over it. Elevators all over Europe are that size. The breakfast the hotel offers is actually a pretty good deal. its continental - but for the price (8 Euro per) does the trick. A breakfast at the cafe across the street - which by the way was great - ran 16 euro per. If you are going to take a dinner cruise - Bateuax-Mouches was the one we chose. We chose the lesser expensive menu - but as foodies we thought it was great. There isnt a bad table on the boat. And they dont give you a lesser table based on what you pay, like some others. Best crepe stand we found: Down the street from Notre Dame in the row of souveneir shops(orange awnings). 2 euro - great quality. Just down the way from the that - a shop called Aux Vieux - had great deals on womens hats and the best quality scarves we found anywhere in the city. You wont miss it - look for the displays hats on the mannequin heads out front. Near the hotel, a couple of blocks down on Bousquet is Numero 7. Good restaurant, very good food, wine is reasonable - small staff, so expect slow service -but you wont be disappointed. RE: airport shuttle. We used Golden Air. The hotel website mentions them, but the hotel was telling us they are using them less and less. Golden Air prefers groups and high-line jobs. We found that to be true. The ride in was great. But the ride out was poor - we learned the hard way that we were not the only ones getting picked up by that car that day. The couple from Australia that we picked up were just as surprised.

We stayed at the Hotel du Champ de Mars in mid-June of 2009. The trip was for personal leisure with my boyfriend, my cousin, and her husband. I should have taken it as a sign not to stay at this hotel when, previous to our stay, I made many attempts to contact the staff via email on their own website, and never received any response. During our June 2009 trip we stayed our first 3 nights in Paris, spent 3 nights in Rome, and then one last night in Paris. The first 3 nights in Paris we stayed in 2 different hotels and both were miles above Hotel du Champ de Mars in every stretch of the imagination. I am very grateful that Hotel du Champ de Mars was booked for the beginning stretch of our trip because our 1-day stay at this hotel was more than enough. Horrible! There are 3 reasons that I chose to book this hotel in the first place. (1) It was in close proximity to the Eiffel Tower, (2) it was highly recommended by Rick Steves, and (3) the photos on the website appeared very cute for the low price. After staying here, I wonder why this hotel comes recommended at all. The rooms are decent, but beware that the single rooms don\u2019t leave you any extra walking-around room. The price is okay for the area (close to the Eiffel Tower), but to avoid their rude staff, I personally would pay an extra 10 euros to stay somewhere else. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted (this is much too friendly of a word for his demeanor) by an attendant at the reception desk. After giving our name, he just blankly stared at us. I think he was counting our number of guests (only 4 of us) and was confused because they had us booked in one double room and one single room. Mind you, we confirmed the reservation no more than a week prior and had booked 2 double rooms for 4 people. Needless to say, the hotel was completely booked so we were stuck with the incorrect booking\u2026yet charged the same price as if we had 2 double rooms as originally booked. We tried to haggle with this since it was not our fault they overbooked their hotel, but the desk attendant kept stating as long as 2 people were staying in the single room, we\u2019d have to pay double-room price. Oh, and he added, if we didn\u2019t like it, we could leave (and that is pretty much a direct quote). Yeah, at 6pm on our last night in Paris, find a new hotel and still be charged cancellation at this one\u2026I think not. We were stuck with this hotel at this point. Our room (the one my boyfriend and I had) was on the ground floor. It was a decent size and pretty cute. I will attach some photos. The cleanliness left something to be desired though. Wrappers (of who knows what) left on the floor, and many many hairs (ick!) on the bathroom floor and shower. I have photos of this too. It seems like they may have come in and made the bed, but did nothing else. It makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets. Luckily there was a window in the room (that looked directly into the window of the room across the way) and a fan in the cabinet, because this hotel did not have air conditioning. My cousin and her husband\u2019s room, if I remember correctly, was on the 5th floor. There is a tiny elevator (which is common for Parisian hotels to only have a small one if there is one at all), but 5 flights of a narrow circular staircase is a long hard walk even if you are not carrying a suitcase. Since their room was incorrectly booked as a single instead of a double, their bed was a full size bed and the room was only about a foot wider on each side of the bed. Very tiny. The bathroom was also very tiny. I don\u2019t think they would have minded the tiny size of the room as much if they would have at least had a bed that fit the 2 of them comfortably. When we left the hotel later that evening, we were stopped halfway out the door by the desk attendant stating that we would have to leave our key at the front desk. It took us by surprise (since this was never mentioned when we arrived at the hotel) and I have to say we didn\u2019t feel 100% comfortable leaving all our belongings in our room with him having the key to enter\u2026especially with the rude way we had been treated upon our check-in. I guess that is why we had bought luggage locks before the trip. Later that evening we left the hotel again to do some sight-seeing and the desk attendant was not even at the desk for us to drop off the key. We had to wait in the lobby while a 3 other couples also piled up in the lobby to wait. Eventually the desk attendant sauntered out of the bathroom to collect the keys, but only after I had the chance to read a magazine. Overall, our stay at Hotel du Champ de Mars was unpleasant. The rooms were decent in d\u00e9cor, but they were not clean and the desk staff was beyond unpleasant and rude. I can\u2019t imagine they would have been of much help if we would have needed help with anything or needed tourist information. And the desk attendant upon leaving in the morning was equally as rude as the one the night prior. This one ignored us and stared at the computer in front of us and did not look up until he was greeted first. And then his only greeting was to correct our French. This hotel gives French staff a bad reputation and was our only unpleasant encounter of our 8 day trip. My opinion is that they think they can get away with treating people in this manner because being in a foreign country you do not have much recourse against them, and they have a steady stream of tourists and no need for you to be a repeat visitor. In hindsight, I would stay at Hotel de la Paix (the hotel we stayed at our 2nd and 3rd nights in Paris, only a few blocks away and closer to the Eiffel Tower, and the staff and rooms there were excellent) instead or try something in the Notre Dame area. Never again would I stay at Hotel du Champs de Mars and I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, Ca", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Clean\u201d", "Author": "Azniv", "ReviewID": "UR37519900", "Content": "The hotel was just fine.

I had read the reviews about the reception staff on Tripadvisor and to be honest I was a little sceptical.

The response was a tirade of abuse. We were told that \u201cyou are not in your own country now, this is how we do things in France, this is the way we live, you have a large bed\u2019. We were shocked at the extremely rude and aggressive response to a simple question that we had asked in a polite manner. We returned to our room and as soon as we walked in the door the phone rang. When my husband answered he was told that if we didn\u2019t like our room we could \u201cget out\u201d the next day and that we were to let her know in the morning what our decision was. We were really shocked, we had never said that we were unhappy with our room or the hotel we had simply asked if we had been given a room with a large bed. What a horrible way to be welcomed to Paris. At this point we really felt like changing hotels. We checked at the Hotel Valadon and the Hotel Bosquet, which are both located just a few steps away, but neither could accommodate us for our entire stay. We decided that we would continue to stay at the Champ de Mars as we did not want to waste any more valuable holiday time searching for another hotel. The next morning we went down stairs with great trepidation only to be greeted by the same receptionist who simply said \u201cbonjour have a nice day\u201d. There was no mention of the previous day\u2019s conversation and whether we were going to stay on. From this time on the receptionist was polite and always said bonjour or au revoir but she was never friendly. I never once saw her smile except when she was petting her dog. My husband and I had trouble writing this review as we understand the impact that a negative review can have on business but we wanted to give an honest opinion. The hotel is a good standard two star in a lovely location. However the rudeness of the receptionist when we arrived was so awful that we could not recommend this hotel There is simply no excuse for treating guests so rudely.

One night the revelry went on until late at night. Good thing it suddenly rained and the noisy customers had to disperse. Other than that, our stay was quite enjoyable.

The bathroom had a shower stall as opposed to a bath tub but it did have a hairdryer. Closet was ample size for hanging clothes and had shelves for other items. I really felt this was a great value for the neighborhood and especially for the city. I thought the staff for the most part were pleasant. Let's face facts - people are all different and some were nicer than others, but I didn't think anyone was outright rude, although some were more willing to chat than others. Perhaps a language issue ( I don't even attempt to speak French) , but I didn't feel it an issue enough to make a big deal about it or trash the hotel because of it. At least the people there were themselves and not a bunch of phoney people bowling you over with fake sentiments acting like you are some long lost relative. I was treated like a customer - no more, no less. Breakfast is served at the hotel for 8 Euro, which included fresh squeezed orange juice, breads (French bread, croissant and cake) as well as yogurt and fruit salad. Ample enough to start your day, and a reasonable enough price. I think most people need to remember that this is a small privately owned hotel in a great neighborhood in one of Eurpope's most visited cities. When you consider the price per night, you need to realize what you are not going to get every bell and whistle a more expensive hotel has to offer. But what you do get is a clean and decent space to stay at a very reasonable price.

The hotel is really close to the Ecole Militaire metro stop (which smells like pee) and tons of great restaurants (we really liked Le Bousquet and Chez Agnes!). The hotel had a funny little elevator that was like, barely big enough for two people. There was also an ATM close by to the hotel. And one of our favorite memories was putting together a picnic from the market produce on the street outside the hotel. We went to each of the different shops buying cheese, bread, fruit, wine, treats, ect. Then we put it in a backpack and ate it in the gardens at the Palace of Versailles. It was all around one of our favorite meals. The hotel staff are not the type to be overly friendly on their own accord, but they were always kind to us and helped us with what we needed when we asked.

Thanks again. We never felt as though the staff was there to assist us. It seemed as though we were always inconveniencing them. God forbid we interrupt their web surfing! Even to drop off our keys, they showed such disdain. Why?? I really have no idea. I made efforts to speak French, asked if they spoke English, and they relunctantly agreed to speak English with us.

The location is amazing - a few blocks from the Eiffel Tower, around the corner from the Metro (Ecole Militaire) and close to many buses (took Rick Steves' recommended #69 bus tour-great idea).

The room was spotless. Not nearly as small as I had heard they were. We had a double bed, a small table, chair and ottoman. It also had a closet with shelves and a safe. All of which came in handy. The bathroom was a good size and spotless with a tub and shower, sink and toilet. Being disabled it was a bit difficult to get into and out of the tub because the sides were so high but that happens in a lot of hotels in North America too. The room was beautifully decorated French country in pale wedgewood blue. The windows (those french doors!) were lovely. And it was very quiet in the hotel. Some street noise from the cafes on the corner but that was done by midnight and we are nighthawks anyways so that was not a problem for us. The hotel offers a lovely breakfast for 8 Euros. It has croissants, fresh baquettes, pound cake,jam, butter, orange juice, yogurt and coffee. Believe me that is a bargain in Paris. If I had to say one negative about the hotel, and I am really stretching it, it is that the staff is not overly friendly. That is not to say they are rude, just not the smiley how are you today type. That is my only negative. The location is fantastic. Would be hard to find better. You are right on the corner of Rue Cler, in the hub of restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and patisseries. You can see the Eiffel Tower, it is about a 5 or 10 minute walk and in the other direction about the same distance is Les Invalides. You are about 5 minutes from the Seine.

I had a confirmed email reservation at this hotel dated 01/09/08. I called first, however, the owner told me to make my request through email. On the day of my departure 3/21/08, my flight was cancelled due to a snowstorm, all flights out of Milwaukee were cancelled, causing me to miss my connecting flight to Paris. I was fortunate enough to find a flight leaving two days later. I immediately called the hotel and explained my situation; the person who answered the phone (Stephane) assured me that the room was still available. We had been traveling for a good 16 hours and so we were very relieved to finally arrive at the doorstep of Hotel du Champ de Mars. I proceeded to check in. When I told the clerk my name, he asked me if I was the one who called. I responded that I was. He said I didn\u2019t have a reservation and asked me if I had received an email (which apparently was to tell me my reservation was cancelled). When I told him the person who I spoke to on the phone said I still had a reservation, he tried to figure out who it was. Based on the time I called, he believes I spoke with Stephane, one of the owners. He said Stephane was wrong. Apparently their computer system \u201cdeleted\u201d my reservation, to which they had no way of tracking down my original reservation. I asked him if he could do anything about this situation to which he responded by blankly looking at a piece of paper as though he were genuinely trying to do something and said no. I asked the clerk if I could speak to Stephane. Stephane was not available according to this clerk. The clerk sent me off like some sort of vagrant to another (sub par) hotel which was very dirty and depressing (Hotel de la Tour Eiffel), not the French \u201ccharm\u201d I had hoped to find at Hotel du Champ de Mars. Additionally, I had made a reservation at the Jules Vernes and gave them Hotel du Champ de Mars\u2019 phone number. When I called the Jules Vernes to confirm my reservation, they said they were going to cancel it because Hotel Champ de Mars told them I wasn\u2019t staying there. Finally, with the help of the Paris Tourist Bureau I found a nice clean hotel, Hotel Caumartin Opera. Still it was difficult to shake off the initial bad experience during my trip. When I returned home, there was no email from Hotel du Champ de Mars at my work or home email address. I had to give Stephane both addresses as the emails weren\u2019t reaching my home email. For whatever reason, the hotel could receive the emails I sent from my personal email account, but I never received any emails they sent to my personal account, my reservation was confirmed with my work email\u2014I did not receive the alleged email informing me that I did not have a reservation at work either. I don\u2019t care how charming or desirable a hotel \u201cappears\u201d in a travel guide book (Rick Steves), I will never again make a reservation through email alone.

Plenty of hot water; a hairdryer was available. Staff were very pleasant. I didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the food quality, but frankly with the food market right outside and a wonderful bakery and other resources in the neighborhood, you don't need to eat at the hotel. As other reviews have mentioned, the only downside I can think of for the hotel, is that it doesn't have air conditioning, so it would likely get hot in the room during the summer. My window opened into a little interior light shaft, so I didn't get any street noise even with the window open. The hotel is located in a nice little neighborhood right off Rue Cler, which is a Parisian market street. During the day there are lots of food vendors selling produce, cheese, etc. There are multiple restaurants on the street, and more within a few blocks' walk, and a tiny convenience store about a block away that's open quite late (until at least 10:30 or 11 pm), which is great if you want to buy a bottle of wine or something late at night. The area seems very safe and I had no qualms walking around alone at night. While there are a few restaurants that are open late, it isn't a \"party zone\" so noise doesn't seem to be a big problem. The hotel is about 5+ min walk from the nearest Metro stop, and 7-10 min walk to the Eiffel Tower or to the Seine. It's also 5-7 min walk to a light rail station, which is convenient for when you're going to Versailles. The downsides for the neighborhood is that because it's way over near the Eiffel Tower, it is further from all the other sights (Louve, Latin Quarter, Marais, etc.) so you end up taking the Metro a lot. Also because it's a mostly residential neighborhood, there's very little shopping (other than food shopping), and really nothing to do at night other than go to a restaurant (ie, no movies nearby, etc.).

The bathrooms in both rooms appeared to be completely renovated and were bright and clean, with plenty of hot water, and good water pressure. The second room even had a built in hair dryer! The location is what makes this an extraordinary value. A few mere blocks away from the Eiffel Tower, with a metro stop just on the other side of the block on which the hotel sits, and every imaginable service you could want somewhere within a block and half radius--cafes, wine shops, chocolatiers, pastisseries, a grocery store, a dollar store, a laundromat, produce markets, a butcher shop, cheese shop...really, the list could go on and on.

One person and 2 small carry on bags/2 people with no bags was all that could fit at one time. The lights in the hall were timed and operated on a button right next to your door on the left on the outside. Just push the button and the lights came on and stayed on well passed your getting into your room. Our room was small (typical for Europe) and we had our own bath with tub/shower. There was a hairdryer in the bath. We had two twin beds that were somewhat smaller than the twin beds in the USA. However, we adjusted just fine and they were comfortable. They had so many warm blankets on them that we had to take the heavy spread off or it was too hot. There was a tv on which we could get CNN. We didn't need any more than that as we were never there. They didn't have an alarm clock but they did have a phone. (I always bring my own little travel clock.) The room also had a safe in the closet. The closet was plenty big enough for a stay longer than ours. It was a delightful, clean and bright room. What our window overlooked I couldn't tell but it was a pleasant view. It was very quiet and we heard no traffic noise. WE ate breakfast there every morning at 6.50E/person. The small dining room downstairs below the lobby was delightful. Breakfast included, a baguette, croissant (delicious) fresh squeezed orange juice (you could hear the machine making the juice) a small jar of plain yoghurt(into which I put one of their tiny jars of strawberry jam) plus a pot of excellent coffee. Butter and little hard lumps of white and raw sugar. Close to the hotel we only found 1 cafe/restaurant that charged this price all the rest were more expensive for the same thing. It was well worth it. The hotel is right off of Rue Cler which is an awesome street with fresh fruit/veg markets, fresh fish, frommerge, wine, chocolate shops as well as sidewalk cafe' and different shops. The walk to the Eiffel Tower took no more than 10 minutes and was a delightful walk. The metro was a 5 minute walk away. The hotel in our opinion was in a great location. Busy during the day yet quiet and safe at night. The owners were very helpful and friendly yet a little aloof(which I understand is normal). I enjoyed talking to them very much but I found that I had to initiate the conversation which was fine. Did we enjoy our stay there, Absolutely. Would we go back, Yes. The cost for the room was 83E/night not including the 13E for the two of us for breakfast.

We had no idea where to stay or what to expect in Paris but this hotel was great for the money. The room was small as expected the bathroom and elevator too. The shower water pressure wasn't that great, but it was clean and the room was very affordable, around 90 Euros a night at that time I believe. The staff spoke english and it was really close to the Eiffel tower which was cool for us first timers. Our room overlooked the street on about the 4th or 5th floor so there was some truck noise in the mornings with the Rue Cler market so nearby. There are other parts of the city I like more, and with more restaurants, but it is really close to one of the best: La Fontaine de Mars.

The rooms are not gigantic but the size is fine unless you're one that must do your jogging in your hotel room. The bed size for 2 seems fine and must be at least a Queen size in the states (never had a problem and I'm over 6 ft tall, not a small guy) The very friendly and helpful english speaking couple that own and run the place (Stephane and Francoise) have been remodeling the rooms and the new ones look fantastic. Everything is very new and clean (even though this hotel has always been spotless) and the totally modern bathrooms with their all white tile and bathtubs are the best - great water pressure and not a speck of dirt. They also have small room fans for the extra warm nights in summer as well as small room safes and in room internet connection if you have your lap top with you. The neighborhood is fantastic with many restaurants close by featuring numerous French, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and many other cusines. 6 days a week Rue Cler (a 10 second walk from the hotel's front door) becomes an all day open air market with a beautiful display of fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese, pastries, meats, fish, flowers, etc. Even though a car sneaks through once in a while this lovely street is meant for walking only. Within a 5 minute walk you will also find the Post Office, a well stocked Magazine/Newspaper/Postcard shop, self service Laundry, Dry Cleaners, more than one Pharmacy, Nice sized Market including Alcohol, A great Wine Shop, The late market that closes around 1am, the Metro, and an intersection that serves 4 main bus routes (2 of the late night ones). The Eiffel Tower is a 10 minute walk and the neighborhood around the Hotel is like going back in time to simpler days. I've been in many hotels all over Paris (from 1 to 5 star) since my first visit in 1977 and nothing tops this Hotel - a Great Find in the Perfect Location.

We just stayed there for 4 nights. The room was not clean-the bathtub had awlful stuff in it, the walls and bathroom door very dirty, don't look under the beds or smell the blankets. Our biggest peeve was that we ordered an airport shuttle different than they advertised at their front desk, our shuttle called the hotel to confirm and the desk clerk cancelled our shuttle. We ended up taking a taxi for 20 euro more. We called our shuttle company and they said that was common because the hotel wants a cut from the shuttle company they advertise. True the location is excellent but there are nearby hotels rated here in the top 10's for not much more.

It's better than anything I've ever had over here in the States-- and I buy mine from Farmers' Markets!), a post office and couple of great attractions (Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides). One flaw is that this place is filled with tourists, so if you're looking for an authentic experience, don't go to restaurants there. You'll be surrounded by Americans, and servers who speak English and ask if you'd like a non-smoking section, which, as far as I'm concerned, is equivalent to going to \"Little Italy\" in Chicago or Boston. Take the metro and go to more interesting, less touristy neighborhoods for true French fare and atmosphere. Oh, yea, back to the hotel. GREAT place. Friendly staff, lovely neighborhood.
