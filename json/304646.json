How do I put butter on this small sweets? Do I eat my boiled egg with the apple or with the sweet? Not worth the 4 star rating.

We didn't get his name except that we know he's from Java and has travelled to Melbourne before. A big thank you to him.

On last October 2005, me and my wife stayed in Ramayana Hotel kuta for about three nights. We took the Superior room. Our visit just took around 4 days after the 2nd Bali Bombing, so the security in that hotel is kinda tight (but in that moment I think security in all other places around Kuta is the same tight as in this hotel). They were renovating their main lobby back in that time. Perhaps it will be done by now.There are several plus points I found out for this hotel. First, they have a very strategic location. Located across the DVD stores, 2-3 mins walk from the Kuta beach and Kuta square, and just a short walk to the Discovery Mall. You will also find transport easily, because taxis all are around, and there are also several car/motorbike rentals near by.Second, if you stay in superior room like we did (behind the big pool if you step in from main entry), you fill find that it's quiet enough inside the hotel. Good ambience to relax I think. Third, they offer a good value compared to some other three stars hotels.But for being fair, I also found some minus points. First, during the second night the aircon in our room is completely broken (on first night it's still working but not cool enough, finally they relocated us to another superior room). Second, I think the garden they have kinda block the sunshine into some rooms (including ours), so we feel our room a little bit damp. Third, during breakfast there were not too many kind of food to be offered.

Overall the hotel was very centrally located to anything you want. We were on the 3rd floor in room # 735. The room was very nice. There was a misterious odor in the hall on our level, but I was not in our room, but we did have to walk past it. Kuta and all of Bali is struggling bad after the recent bombings. The hotel there are at about 10% capacity (meaning you can get very good deals). We paid about $45 a night. In Indonesia everything is negotiable. I found they have 2 prices, one for foreigners and one for indonesians. I found this out by using my wife (she is Indonesian). Bali was a little depressing with all the empty cabs with no customers always asking you for a ride. It also rained every day in bali (check the season before you go - we were in the rainy season). Also watch out at tourist areas (temples, beaches, native dances, etc...) you will be mobbed by local women and men trying to sell you anything from t-shirts to marijuana. Also keep a close guide on your belongings, during one of these mobbing my wife had a cellphone taken. After Kuta we stayed for two nights in Ubud. Ubud is much quieter than Kuta and very beautiful. I recommend for transportation to rent a car with a driver for the day. We got a car with a driver for $25 a day. That did not include the gas we had to spend (around $8.00). With your car and driver you can go anywhere.The most interesting part of the trip to bali was the bike ride on a cycling tour in Ubud. 25 kilometers through some of the prettiest cournty in the world. The tour is not a mountain biking trip and it is very easy. 99% downhill. We stopped several times to visit a spice store, gardens, rice paddies, local household to see how the locals lived, etc... All the local kids would great you on the street saying Hello and waving you on. This was not on busy roads, but on the backroads. Traffic was very light. For $36 we got breakfast overlooking lake Bater and a volcano, lunch at a local indonesian resturant and the easiest bike I've ever been on. Our tour guide was Darma (a great guy).

Rooms were fantastic - king size canopy bed - tv with dvd player.I couldn't fault the place and would stay here again. (But hopefully in the poolside cottage). I also had a massage which was nice but a bit pricey even for hotel standards.They are in the process of building a new lobby so the noise from that was a tad annoying - especially when I was having a massage - but it will be lovely when it's all finished.This is a lovely central hotel, clean with helpful staff. I would recommend it for anyone, couples, families, business people.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR295738071", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u20ac\u6942\u6a48\u7d12\u951b\u4f8a\u7d12\u5bf0\u64b4\u30ad\u935d\u00b0\u4f05\u9287\u88e4\u5031\u9287\ue046\u7467\u6924\u65bb\u4ef9\u7455\ue044\u578f\u951b\u6485\u5b63   showReview(22226772, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR532887527", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sachirico"}, {"Content": "\u9357\u6940\u6d57\u9288\u6391\u7585\u93b0?#x201d;
