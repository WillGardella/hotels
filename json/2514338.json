After my horrific stay here I emailed a complaint to both the hotel & the company who own it & didnt get any response. Not sure why this surprised me; it just proves this company are rude & incompetent throughout all its work force. On arrival, we took the last space in the carpark. A staff member, the night porter, rushed out & rudely asked us what we thought we were doing. We assured him we were guests about to check in. He asked us to check in BEFORE we parked. Bizarre. 2) When we said we needed to finish parking before coming in, the night porter suspiciously watched us through the glass door, yet as we approached the door, struggling with luggage in both hands, he walked away, leaving us to put down our bags to open the door. Rude. 3)When we got to our room, the phone was ringing. The night porter asked us to come back to reception immediately to hand in our car keys. After talking to him & the night manager, they were unable to supply us with any proof of insurance incase any damage was done to our car while they were in possession of the keys. Illegal. 4) When we told them we therefore couldn't give them our car keys they sneeringly told us they would have to phone our room 'At 1am or 2am' if they needed us to move our car. When we said that was going to have to be fine, we were then told NO! We MUST move our car out onto the road. We asked if that would be safe, we were assured yes. We were told that we didn't need to put a parking ticket on til 9am. On checking the street signs it was actually 8am. So if we had listened to the staff, we would have got a parking fine. Uninformed. 5)At 7.30am we found our car had been vandalised. We managed to get it into the car park but were immediately told it would have to be moved as it was 'match day'. The hotel rents out its car park, stuff the guests! Staff were utterly uninterested in the vandalism. Unhelpful. 6) We spent the morning talking to garages & arranging for Autoglass to replace the windscreen. We asked the receptionist how long we could stay in the carpark to wait for the repair man. They said when we book out by midday, the car would need to be gone by midday. We told them it was undrivable, there was zero vision out of the shattered windscreen. They said we could stay until 5.30pm but would have to either book for another night or pay \u00a315 for a space. Unsympathetic. The 1 night stay resulted in a very distressing 24 hrs.

Only stay here if you're a heavy sleeper and not too fussed about comfort. Or if you're here for the football. Room was an ok size, bed linen clean, but the room in general wasn't comfortable.

There is free parking, but there are no marked bays so you literally park your in whatever way fits even if cars are blocked in. We didn't feel safe with the car there so parked it on a single yellow line on Fulham Road instead. Single yellows are good at 6pm-8am, and all day Sundays. The TV didn't work, the hairdryer would work for 2 minutes and then switch itself off, no air conditioning so this is a problem in the summer heat and humidity. There was an old fan that luckily did work! The bathroom was generally clean. Everything was old though, and many tiles were chipped or cracked. There was no hand soap. There were however two pump-action bottles (body wash and shampoo) that were refilled many times before us. One of the pumps were broken so had to unscrew the lid and pour the body wash out to use. If you really must stay here, bring your own soap/hand wash, toothpaste and toothbrush, and very importantly: ear plugs. Customer service wasn't great.

There were items left by a previous guest in one of the drawers, and although the room didn't seem unclean, this still made me question the thoroughness of the cleaners.

It is within 5/10 mins walk from Fulham Broadway tube station (which has a good Sainsburys to stock up on snacks/drinks) on the District Line so very handy to get to South Kensington (museums), Harrods, and if going to Wimbledon, is just a couple of stops north of Southfields. The first time I stayed in June I was at the front of the building which fronts the Fulham Road. This was a bit noisy so I had to close my windows and keep on the air con (the curtains also needed to stay over as everyone would be able to see in, although the curtains pulled over with difficulty!). The bed was comfortable, the tv small and up on the wall at a great height. The hairdryer blew a fuse the first time I used it, but reception had it fixed within the day. The bathroom was small but clean with a large shower. Breakfast was continental and had a sufficient selection of cereals, croissants, tea/coffee to suit (more than the Ibis offer). Full breakfast was extra although I didn't see anyone eating one. The staff were friendly and helpful (I left behind a pair of earrings which they kept for me and handed to me immediately I arrived for my second visit in August). The second time I stayed there I went with my son. I had requested a room at the back (which faces the back of Chelsea's Stamford Bridge football ground, so not a great view but we didn't mind) so it was quieter and we could leave our windows open. We didn't have air con this time so had to leave the fan in the room on constantly otherwise we'd have been dripping in sweat in the London heat. The fridge didn't work (although we didn't use it), the bathroom was larger, had a bath and a shower over it this time and the room was much bigger than my previous one. While it was clean and functional and value for money, it just lacked a little finesse which a more expensive hotel would probably have offered (and a good lick of paint). Basic but clean. The thing that really got us though the second time round was the attitude of one of the serving staff at breakfast. Having had an early start the previous morning, we lay in until 9.45 am and headed down for breakfast at 10.15, as breakfast was due to finish at 10.30 according to their literature. While there were other diners still eating breakfast, we were approached by one particular member of staff to tell us in no uncertain terms we were too late for breakfast, that it had finished at 10 am. I told her that it said 10.30 on their information in the room (it even said it on the card on the tables), she just seemed to ignore me and insisted that it finished at 10 am during the summer (having been there a few weeks previously I was not aware that this was the case). She \"allowed\" us to have something to eat, as long as we didn't take long. A similar thing happened on the last day of our 5 day stay, when we arrived down to breakfast at 9.40 am. She came over to tell us that as breakfast was finishing soon, we should hurry up. This certainly didn't make me feel very comfortable or particularly welcome. Was she in a hurry to get finished?? Aside from that the other staff were very friendly and they gave me a suitcase bag when I was checking out for coming back a second time which was a very pleasant surprise.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "exuma", "Title": "\u201cterrible service\u201d", "Author": "campfiremagic", "ReviewID": "UR35444637", "Content": "had to catch an early flight. two rooms asked for wake up calls, no one called. asked for a cab knowing how to get to stanstead bus stop at victoria station - we were dropped on the street and told to walk around we would find it. could have easily missed our flights. hotel in poor condition, tv did not work, bath drain did not work, taps dripped etc.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is dirty.\u201d", "Author": "Luscious2009", "ReviewID": "UR31854661", "Content": "When I approached La Reserve from the street I was very pleased with what I saw, but don't be duped by the plush exterior as this is massively deceiving: When I tried to check in, I was told that the hotel was full and my booking had been cancelled due to an issue with the payment card, but sensing somehow this was unacceptable the manager found me a room which evidently belonged to someone else judging by the \"welcome note\" and disgusting-looking bowl of fruit. My room was in the basement, and the first thing that hit me when I stepped into the corridor was the smell of thick cigarette smoke, despite the huge \"NO SMOKING\" sign on the wall. My room was unclean-feeling with strange burns all over the dirty carpet, and all the furniture was battered and falling apart - the glass wardrobe door was cracked and cellotaped together, and I couldn't get a single channel on the old 1980s television. The curtains were dirty, and the duvet in the cupboard looked as though it hadn't been washed for a long time. After finding a brown-stained towel hanging in the bathroom, I asked to be moved rooms as the smell of smoke was making my eyes sting. The following day I was moved to an upstairs room. Again the furniture was very old and worn out, windows dirty, and curtains which didn't meet in the middle. Again the room had a very un-clean feel about it, with a selection of 4 duvets in the cupboard - each badly stained with various body fluid. The television had no remote control, and the hairdryer worked for about 5 seconds before smoking and conking out. I wore shoes throughout my stay as I couldn't face walking bare-foot on the carpet or bathroom floor. Breakfast consisted of yesterday's stale criossants and bowls of tinned fruit (peach slices in syrup, pear halves in syrup). The orange juice had a funny taste and I had no idea how to make a cup of tea so I didn't bother with breakfast for the rest of my 4 day stay. The bar was unwelcoming and always devoid of people, despite the hotel being full. The only good thing going for this hotel is the location - perfectly positioned for Earl's Court via Fulham Broadway tube station, but it really isn't worth staying here.

My own room was of quite a reasonable size with a double bed (it may have been 2 singles joined together but if so it was not noticeable) with a good sized bathroom. Both were spotlessly clean and the bed linen was crisp and clean. The bedroom furniture was perhaps a little dated but nevertheless perfectly acceptable. The hotel is well situated on the Fulham Broadway road just a short walk from the underground station so quite convenient for travel into central areas for shopping and shows etc. Breakfast included in the price was an acceptable Continental variety with plenty of cereals and fresh fruits plus bread rolls and croisettes etc and a cooked English breakfast was available at a small extra charge. The hotel may not be up to a 4 or 5 star standard like the Ritz or Dorchester but then neither is the cost and it is certainly a good 2 star rating.
