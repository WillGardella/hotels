It had a fully equipped kitchen, with everything up to date. There were flat screen tvs in each room.The balcony in each bedroom made it even better; we had a great view of the strip. Housekeeping came just about everyday to change out our towels and empty the trash.The mini mart in the lobby made getting groceries very convienient (there is also a Walgreens at the corner). We attended a timeshare presentation and there was no pressure whatsoever. When we declined their offer, they left it alone and didnt pressure us about it.

Now, you can't please everyone, which I understand, but c'mon people....get over it!!!! 1) The trash came every morning at 6 a.m. Yes, it was loud, but I'm on vacation and I just went back to sleep! 2) Our room was cleaned every single day...can't complain about that! 3) If you walk on the south side of the Hawaiian Market near the McDonalds, the walk is just fine. Even if you are entering from the north side of the strip (by PH), the alley is not scary at all. 4) We are avid gamblers and had no problem walking 5 minutes to MGM, NY NY, or PH to gamble....the walk gives you a chance to see get some sun before your bury yourself in the casino for hours! 5) We were only asked one time about time share opportunities (when getting tickets for a show with concierge). We respectfully declined and there was no further talk about it! I requested a higher floor before our trip, but when checking in, all of those rooms were taken. It turned out that this was to our advantage! We had a room on the 4th floor right by the stairwell. Easy in/easy out with the stairs!!!!

Million dollar view. Usual stuff in there 2 tv's fridge microwave air con etc wehad a towel change every day and bed linen service mid week towel service everyday which is unusual for timeshare (ooops VO).

My downside: I have owned a timeshare for 10 years and have always been treated very well as a timeshare owner at a visiting resort. This hotel, couldn't care less. Before I arrived I had gone back and forth with one of the hotel representatives on the size of the space. We had originally booked a studio, which I was concerned with b/c of size. Finally since I was only using the room for 3 nights instead of the 7 that regularly comes with a timeshare exchange, the man that I was talking to said they would upgrade my room for free. When checking out there was an additional upgrade fee of over $100. Needless to say I am disputing the charge. I will look for another property next time I'm in Vegas.

The location is great-in the heart of the strip district and across the street from the Mirage- and a short walk to all of the major hotels/casinos on the strip.

They are in adjoining buildings but the suites are newer and more modern. We stayed in the Polo Towers which we found very comfortable and would certainly recommend. We used this location as a base from which we visited the hotels/casinos on the strip, drove to downtown-old Las Vegas approximnately 4.5 miles from the Towers- as well as visiting various National Parks. If you are not interested in spending every day and night in the casinos, we recommend renting a car. Renting a car permitted us to visit Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, the Grand Canyon/skywalk and Death Valley. We also went off the strip to adjoining areas for some great food at very reasonable prices. This hotel was an excellent location for our needs since none of our travels were over two and one half hours from our hotel.

Unfortunately the price is average, so nothing good to talk about. Check-in was slow, probably because of the high season period (we arrived on 30th December and I understand that's when everyone moves to Vegas for a few nights). The girl at reception who welcomed us did not find our reservation and needed a couple of minutes to understand what was happening. She did not give us proper information about hotel services because she was clearly in hurry for all the other guests who were waiting in line behind us. No valet parking and that's definitely not a problem, as long as you can park your car. Unfortunately that was a real pain: I had to find the garage by myself and once I did it I could realize it was totally full. It took more than one hour (!!!) to find one parking, with several other cars playing the same game and waiting for others to go out. What is more there are many drunk people around and that makes everything even more unconfortable. When we went to the reception to ask them if there was another place where to park the car they just told us parking is included for free, so it is not guaranteed. As we have reserved our room (a suite!!) online and it was clearly stated parking was available and free, we found that really annoying. Ok, step forward. We went up to the room, a large suite. As we opened the door we could feel a strong smell of fried food. Just a note: that smell never left us till our departure. The room was ok, even though it did not have anything to do with a suite. It was good size, but divided in two communicationg rooms. There was only one double bed, while the others were couch beds with no blankets on them (we had to ask reception). Once you open all the beds the room looks similar to a camping, more than a hotel suite in Las Vegas (that should be what we paid for). Heating system was crazy: from time to time it goes on by itself and there is no way to stop it, even if you switch everything off. It has its own soul... and it doesn't look to be friendly. Swimming pool was on top floor, on a nice terrace with little view, as the walls all around are just closing all the nice view you could have from up there. It is cold water, so pointless in winter. Closed at night. Same for the whirlpool. Fitness room was supposed to be on ground floor, but we never had the chance to find it open. It is one of those facilities we were looking for when we booked, but finally it was closed all the time we were in the hotel. I also understand there is a little fare to pay to get in (if you are lucky enough to find it open). Wi-fi internet, which is another thing we were looking for, was not included. Unfortunately you have to pay for each device accessing internet, so if you have two laptops and two mobile phones you will need to pay four times in a day. Wonderful. That's not it. In our room the signal was so weak we had to go outside our door just to send an email or to use skype. Amazing service for a suite, isn't it? Last point is about cleaning: the room was everything but clean. Room service never cleaned our bathroom. They didn't even touch anything. It was just a towel change. I would never suggest anyone to try this place. As our flight changed we had to stay one more night in Vegas and moved to another hotel that turned to be 1000 times better in everything for a much lower fare.

The location is just right, we felt that we were in the heart of Vegas, as it was only a short walk or bus trip anywhere. The only downside is that on the first morning my shower was only lukewarm. Would recommend this as a place to stay.

So when we first came across Polo Towers Villas we weren't sure about it since we'd never seen it before but it turns out it was also on the strip and directly across the street from City Center which was a new attraction for us! To the north was Planet Hollywood and next to that was Paris. Then to the south was MGM. The room we got at Polo Towers was a nice king size one bedroom with a pull down bed in the living room large enough for our 2 teenagers to sleep on. The bathroom was also large with one door facing the bedroom and the other towards the living room, and it has two sinks one at each counter on opposing walls. It has a spa tub/shower although with our short busy stay we didn't have enough time to actually use it as a a tub. On the other hand our teens did use the heated pool/jacuzzi on the rooftop. The other resort amenity they made use of was the gym with its weights and cardio equipment. I guess if we had smaller kids they'd enjoy the small kids' water park directly outside the gym. Back in the room, we had a decent sized kitchen with cookware, tableware and utensils. Then there was a stove/oven, microwave, coffeemaker, toaster and electric can opener, but the only appliance we made use of was the fridge. The dinning room is part of the living room with a 4 chair dinning table. There were in panel TVs in both the living room and bedroom. In the bedroom closet there was also a good sized safe where we kept our iPad and other valuables. The only negative I can say about our room in tower 3 is that the windows were facing a bit to the east and in the morning the light would come through the living room and bedroom even with the blinds and curtains closed. It seems that the kitchen blinds could have something else over it, and that the curtain in the bedroom should be able to close all the way to the wall so the daylight would not be able to seep in. If there was another slight negative it would be that the internet access from the room was one we'd have to pay for, but fortunately its free in the business center behind the lobby but with limited hours and use of only their computers. One late evening when the business center was closed I needed internet access and didn't want to pay, so fortunately with that location benefit there was a 24 hour McDonalds next door with complimentary wifi. PTV had no restaurant although they did have room service and a coffee shop down the hall of the lobby. For our meals we'd find ourselves taking a short walk on the strip where there were several close by restaurants to choose from. Parking at PTV was also very convenient for self or valet, since it was directly under the building and the elevator would take you directly up to the lobby hallway. Speaking of the lobby, the staff at PTV was very friendly, professional and accommodating from the time we checked in and throughout our stay. There was a mention of a 'welcome package' (timeshare presentation) that we were offered which we didn't feel pressured to take. All in all this was our best hotel (actually resort) stay in Vegas mainly because of the room and location, and for our future visits to LV we'll look forward to a return stay at PTV.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201c\"staycation\" at Polo Towers\u201d", "Author": "Funlv1", "ReviewID": "UR121990575", "Content": "Had not been to many new places on the Las Vegas Strip and decided to stay at Polo Tower, right across from the new City Center Hotels and Casinos.

No eating establishments at the Polo Tower, but many nearby including Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino and the shops, eating places there. even though it was December, the pool was heated nicely and people were using it each day of my stay. The gym facility was modern and well equiped and not crowded at all. The underground parking area was small and compressed, yet easy in and out with careful entry and exit.

We got this place on an I.I. exchange for my Marriott two bedroom. We originally had a tiny 300 sq. ft. efficiency studio, but after reading enough reviews, AND talking to a front desk worker the week before, I knew I needed something bigger. When we arrived our Saturday night, I spoke to the front desk worker and she notified me of the $30/night upgrade fee if I wanted anything else. At that point a concierge walked up trying to help me out because he overheard what I was telling the front desk worker, \"My wife is pregnant, I've read the beds aren't that great, etc.\". He was willing to call the manager to work something out for us. After the call, he offered an upgrade to the 1 bedroom unit size, if I simply attended a presentation and paid a $30 upgrade fee, FOR THE WHOLE WEEK! After consulting with my wife, and us being pro's at saying \"no thank you\", we decided to do the upgrade and presentation the next morning. Since we were leaving Friday night, not using our Friday night stay, we paid only $15 for the whole week upgrade. (BEST Timeshare ever!!!) In all seriousness, the guy that did our presentation (we think his name was K/Chris? About 250 lbs / 6\u20191\u201d) was great, very low pressure, none at all really and very personable. We were out of there in about less than 90mins and enjoying our vacation. If you can, as other members mentioned, ask for the backside \"suites\". They have been renovated and have Jacuzzi tubs, plus flat screens and DVD players. Our room in tower 3, 12311, required a little repair after a day or two. I didn't notice, until it was too late, that our DVD player had NO video hookup to the TV! Something happened and it was destroyed. I put call in at the front desk on my way to work out and maintenance was there before I finished my workout. It was fixed on the spot, after the guy went to get a new component cable. Speaking of working out, the gym is very nice!!! All the basic equipment you could want. It\u2019s not some small hole on the ground floor or basement, it\u2019s overlooking the kiddie pool area on the ground floor and has all different machines and weights, plus aerobic equipment. The pool on the roof seemed nice, but we weren\u2019t there to swim, nor were we in any shape to. :-\\ LOCATION: IT IS ON THE STRIP!!! It\u2019s behind the Hawaiian Marketplace building (one building back in Vegas is STILL on the strip!). As for being on the strip, go behind that facility and you\u2019re at Polo Towers. It is hard to find the \u201cfront\u201d entrance, which actually faces south, but Google map street view and you\u2019ll get a better idea. If driving North on the strip, pull in at the road/Alley just at the beginning of the Hawaiian Marketplace, the alley just after it is one way to the strip. The easiest way to enter if there\u2019s moving foot and car traffic is to just turn down the road (E. Harmon Ave.) towards PH and the Marriott behind Polo Towers. Make a right as soon as you can and you\u2019ll see the Marriott on your left, and the parking lot for the Polo Towers on the right. Enjoy the strip and don\u2019t gamble all your money, there\u2019s plenty to do! P.S. if you like Indian food, there is a G R E A T lunch buffet (and only $13, use the 10% coupon you can find in every discount book!) right in front of Polo Towers, inside the Hawaiian Marketplace. Leave the side entrance (Tower 1) of Polo Towers closest to the Hawaiian Marketplace and go in the back entrance of the building.

The service is top notch. Chris at the conceige desk is simply AMAZING and has wonderful connections to the nightclubs. This is a wonderful Resort next to the MGM Grand and directly across the street from the ARIA Hotel and 3 Resorts away from the Bellagio. Word to the wise. There is aloooooooooot of walking and every corner is not a crosswalk so you may have to walk 2-3 long blocks to cross the street and then walk over an overpass to get on the other side of the street and then back up the block back up 2-3 blocks to get to your destination. BRING COMFORTABLE FLATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If going to the clubs, where the flats for walking to the club and put your Stillettos in your purse unless you are catching a cab everywhere which is expensive. Vegas has a terrible transportation system. It cost us $6.00 for a cab to take us right directly across the street from where we were standing. You can pay $7.00 a day for a 24 hour period to catch the Shuttle up and down the Strip which comes every 20 minutes. The clubs DO NOT have seating unless you have bottle service for a table which start at $500.00 otherwise you are standing all night and dancing so again this is where comfortable shoes come into play. All the stores cell liquor, the walgreens, CVS, grocery stores etc. and the price is pretty consistent with anywhere else you would purchase it.:) Since drinking is legal you can walk up and down the street and in businesses with an uncovered drink in your hand. The show Zumanity at the New York New York is a must see!!! Also, Hitzville the Motown Review show is AWESOME too at Planet Hollywood at the V theatre. CLS Transportation is a good company which transports you from the Airport to the Resort to the Hotel. It is $7.00 one way or $12.00 roundtrip which is the cheapest and you are 3 miles from the Resort. You can get it from door 13 at the airport.

BUT!! The trade for our Hilton head timeshare was a 300 square foot unit with a murphy bed. Not even close to the same unit.The staff at Polo were understanding but could do nothing. None of the one or two bedroom units were avaliable. We were told that if there were larger units avaliable that we would have to pay at least $30.00 a day for an upgrade. I wonder if Interval is aware of this? We own two timeshares. When you book them they have pictures and diagrams of their units avaliable to see. Every other timeshare we have traded for over 19 years have diagrams to show their units. This is not so for Polo Towers. We could find no daigrams of the units on the web site. The location of Polo Towers is really very good. It's in the heart of the (new strip). The staff is very polite and try to be helpfull. We rented a car and found the onsite and undergroud parking a real plus. Polo also offer free valet parking which we did use on occasion. The little 300 s/f room fullfilled our needs but not our wants. The murphy bed slept well for us but you had to move the coffee table, remove the four cushions and two pillows from the couch to pull the bed down. (The bed pulls down over the couch). The bar kitchen had a mini fridge with a small microwave and a very large coffeemaker that took up a lot of the countertop. The shower bath was adequate as was the closet and furniture drawers. We took the timeshare presentation. (Free show tickets and debit card). The presentation was a real production. My wife and I needed to use the lavatory at the same time. We had an escort. I think the escort went with us to make sure we returned to the presentation. They said it would be two hours, but was just over two and a half.

It gets better, the rooms are nice! New furniture, flat panel TVs, I didn't feel like I was sleeping in a motel. The only thing that may throw some people off is the Murphy bed (Thats a bed that folds into a wall when you are not using it). I personally only used my room to sleep, so I took it down once and left it that way the whole time! All the above perks, plus there is a pool, decent gym (for a hotel) snack bar and very friendly staff. This is my new hotel of choice!..until the day I can spend top dollar and not think twice about it at least!", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon Sask.

Considering the location, the price, the full kitchen in the 1 bedroom, and the service, it beats paying double and staying at other strip properties that don't have anywhere near the same value. I stayed here during a business trip to Las Vegas, in which I spent every day 8AM-5PM at the client site all the way northwest on Sahara Ave. If you have ever rented a car while in Vegas, you may be thinking that I had a difficult time getting around, and the answer is, pleasantly, no. Even though the Polo Towers occupies a fairly small grid between the MGM and Planet Hollywood, it was designed quite efficiently, especially with regards to parking in the underground spots. There is surface parking that I think may be shared with the nearby businesses or possibly the Marriott Grand Chateau, but the walk is a bit more than just taking the elevators in the Polo Towers down to the basement. Thinking more externally, though, the access road to the hotel is off Harmon Avenue, which is typically not heavy traffic-wise. I'd recommend this as the only way to enter the property because the alleyways off S. Las Vegas Blvd are prone to pedestrian blocking at any time of the day. The rooms are quite nice, but inconsistent when it comes to amenities. I was initially given a great room on the 9th floor with a direct view of City Center and a soaking tub with jacuzzi jets, but the guest in the next room felt it necessary to rock the house with loud music for hours on end, so I relocated since I had work to do. The second room I got was on the 10th floor and faced east toward the Signature at MGM towers, and the tub did NOT have jacuzzi jets. A bit of a disappointment as I was looking forward to it. I suspect this may be due to many of the units being condos, in which case I can understand that each suite would be designed slightly differently. The 1 bedroom King suite I selected had a nice, upscale-ish design with flat screen LCDs in the living room and bedroom, a full kitchen with all needed utensils, plates, pans, pots, and silverware, and a somewhat small bedroom with a great bed. The bathroom had dual vanities and a larger sized soaking tub. The complimentary soap/shampoo/conditioner was sufficient, but fairly standard generic hotel industry stuff. The bedroom window is actually a sliding glass door which leads to a very small standing-only balcony where you can get some fresh air. The selection of TV channels was good enough, but who does much TV watching in Las Vegas, anyway? I checked out the pool, but did not have time to enjoy it. It is located on the 22nd floor and is fairly small but probably adequately sized for what I think is a rather low occupancy rate at any given time on this property (<30% is what it felt like mid-week). There are also complimentary laundry facilities on select floors. These are literally rooms that have 2 washing machines and 2 dryers, just like the machines you would have at home. They don't have timers, though, so if you are paranoid about someone stealing your clothes, take a book to read while your laundry finishes. This is a really nice feature that I have yet to see at any other property I've stayed at. There are a few things I need to mention, though. First, when you initially arrive it can be rather confusing to figure out where to park so you can check in. There is a row of parallel parking spots on the east side of the building for 15-min check-in, but I suspect these tend to fill up quickly and are used beyond the 15 minute intended window. There is a valet at the front of the building, but being a capable human being with legs, I don't need someone else to park for me. I would recommend just parking in the garage and then taking your bags with you to the elevators and up to the lobby level where you can check in. At check in, the front desk will provide you with a parking pass that you need to place on your vehicle's dashboard before midnight, which I guess is when they do a daily patrol of the garage. Next, the the building is shaped sort of like an H, and the east side elevators do not go down to the basement level. The west side elevators do, though. What this means is if your room is on the west side, your elevators will go directly to the basement. Those staying on the east side either need to go down to the lobby using the east elevator, then transfer to the west elevator for basement access, or walk through the connecting hallway on your floor to the west elevator. Additionally, like I mentioned in the beginning of the review, I had noise problems with the person in the next room. I think most newer hotel properties have nearly eliminated this problem by building thick concrete walls between rooms, but the walls here probably aren't thick enough. Fortunately, the front desk asked no questions when I asked for a different room, so I was able to get quick resolution on this problem. Just something to keep in mind if you are stuck in a similar situation. For what it's worth, I think the property has given guests the means to be inconsiderate like this by providing a stereo with large speakers on the entertainment center, which butts right up against the shared wall with the next room. Finally, while the inside of the building is maintained very well, the outside reminds me of older downtown buildings, especially the \"big city\" smell that you may notice in certain areas. There are no plants or landscapes.. just a lot of concrete, utility boxes, dumpsters, and funky smelling puddles of water. It isn't the most inviting atmosphere to see when walking back after a night out on the strip, but something to keep in mind if you are used to a more scenic return like at the Bellagio or City Center.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "2008OklahomaCity_OK", "ReviewID": "UR118494850", "Content": "Awesome place to stay on the strip.

Our \"personal consierge\" as he called himself, was a bit miffed that we didn't want to attend a presentation to receive wonderful gifts, it would only take 90 minutes. We told him we were not interested as we were already owners of DIamond Resorts elsewhere. He quickly looked at our confirmation again and apologized for the error, however, we were invited to a 55 minute presentation instead! Still, we said no thanks and that was the last time we ever saw our \"personal consierge\". We weren't expecting any phone calls, so each time the phone rang, we just let it go to voicemail. Of course, it's the front desk inviting you to a presentation again, so just be forewarned, if you don't expect a call from anyone, don't answer the phone and they will leave you alone.

There is a convenience store in the hotel and carries everything you need at the same or lesser prices than the supermarkets or Walgreens. There is no casino nor restaurants in the buliding, but there are hundreds out on the strip, do your choices are abundant. The only complaints we had was that the pool area is very small and more chairs and tables than lounges to relax on. Also, we were there for a week and were told we had trash and towel service daily. The first day was great...fresh towels trash removed, bed made. Second day, fresh towels, trash removed. Third day, no towels, no trash. Fourth day, same.

This hotel is also right behind the Hawaiian Gardens shops, where you can eat, catch a street show, get misted with cooling vapors, or just watch the crowds. The room I was in was a studio suite, with a Murphy bed. The bed was not very comfortable and with the bed down, after you move the coffee table to let it fold down, there is very little space in the living room. This might be awkward for more than one person. Otherwise, the room was great, with a full kitchen, a large bathroom and shower, nice decor, a flat screen HDTV and DVD player. Also, on the second floor is a laundry room and the washers and dryers are free! If you want to use the gym downstairs, which is very nice, if you're not a timeshare guest you have to pay for a day or week pass. I recall it was about $20 for seven days. Not bad but an unexpected expense. Overall, I was very happy with the Polo Towers and I was able to avoid a timeshare presentation. But I definitely will stay here again when I travel to Las Vegas. The valet parking is free, just tip the valet, and much easier than trying to park your car yourself. Besides, with the excellent location right off the Strip, having a car is more of a liability anyway, unless you want to go somewhere else. Hoover Dam is only about a 45 minute drive and well worth the trip and tour into the power plant.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turlock, California", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "rat1084", "ReviewID": "UR118069890", "Content": "I'm giving an average rating since dissapointing isn't an option. checking in was a hassle because of the push to attend a timeshare presentation.

If you are there with a group and have a car to do grocery shopping this could be a great way to do dinner. MINUSES: -No restaurant in hotel. This was a minus for me because having never been to Vegas I didn't know where was good to go eat. I would have liked to have just gone downstairs to grab a bite before heading out. -Order in menu not very appetizing and loaded with extra fees because the food is delivered. (like a $15 dollar \"packing fee\") -Really bad conditioner. If you have long hair you're going to need to buy or bring your own. -2 of the 4 days of my stay I came back in the evening to see that my hotel had not been touched by housekeeping. -Pool very very small and shallow. Even though there is a separate pool for kids/families there were still many kids playing marco pollo at the \"adult\" pool. -Because it's a timeshare, I always kind of hesitated before contacting front desk or asking the concierge for something because I didn't want to get roped into a presentation. DEPENDS ON YOUR PREFERENCE: -No casino. Whether that's a positive or negative is up to you. -Coffee machine in room, but only 1 free packet of coffee per stay. After that it is a dollar a day. Whether that's a negative depends on whether you'd rather stay in and have coffee or have it with breakfast. -Parking is outdoors and probably more vulnerable to crime (though I experienced none) and definitely makes your car an oven when you get in. This didn't bug me too much but it depends on your taste. OVERALL: I would definitely recommend the Polo Towers to anyone who has done Vegas before and knows where they might like to eat, where they'd like to gamble, what shows they'd like to see, etc. With none of that on-site you have to go out of your hotel to get the Vegas experience which can be daunting for a first time visitor when you don't really know where you should be heading. SUGGESTION: -When you check in there is a two step check-in process. First you go through a normal check-in where you get your key, show ID, etc. Then they send you down to a different counter to get your \"welcome package\"-- maps, \"where\" guides, etc. My thought on this, and I could be wrong, is that this is the part where they size you up to see if they are going to try and get you to come to the timeshare presentation. The gentleman at the welcome desk was rather smarmy, and sales like, and had a list of guests names and times that they were coming to the presentation or a reason why they weren't written on it. To my surprise, they did not attempt to get me to come to one, but this might be that I simply wasn't their target market-- I'm in my mid 20's and they probably realize I can't afford it. My suggestion for anyone really looking to avoid the timeshare presentation is to simply get your key and not continue down to the second desk and just go to your room. You will miss getting the map, some guide books, a list of shuttles, and the take-out menu, but most of that you can find online or maybe ask housekeeping.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNice and elegant place to stay but needs some upgrades.\u201d", "Author": "Spicki", "ReviewID": "UR115662546", "Content": "Polo Towers is a property of Diamond Resorts, which is selling timeshares, so be prepared for them to try to sell you an ownership.

We arrived early, around 10am and upon checking in the friendly desk staff took our luggage so tha we could drive sround Vegas and have some lunch without haveing to pull up to the front door again and unload our items. They kept them for us and when returned our room was ready and the luggage was delievered to our room promptly. There is free parking (self and valet) both outside and in the underground garage. Very easy accessibility. Our room was a one bedroom suite and it was beautiful! The room was so clean and spacious and we could see the stip from our window. Even though this is a Diamond Resorts property there was absolutley no pressure to attend anything or to meet with anyone about timeshares. We were even pleasantly surprised when we saw our message light blinking on our room phone nad it was a message from the front desk consierge for a coupon for two donuts and coffee for myself and my husband! The pool is on the rooftop and it is just right. There are two great grills for those who want to use it (they were in use each time we were there and the smells were so yummy!) and plenty of lounge chairs and towels as well as cabanas! You can bring anything to eat and drink in the pool area which made it so reasonable (no glass) and fun to lounge all day and drink and snack at our leaisure. There is no free wi-fi but you can use the computers in the business cneter for free, including free printing. We didn't use the spa as we felt relaxed with the pool and jacuzzi on the rooftop. The kitchen has everything you could need and all you have to do is pick up food and bevergare as you need it. There is a tix for tonight located just around the block from the hotel which was so easy and inexpensive! The front desk staff are so helpful and knowledagble! The location of this hotel is practically right on the strip. We had a renatl car, but were able to walk the strip just as well. We never felt unsafe or far from lots of people watching.

The kiddie pool or kids waterpark is located on the groundfall behind the hotel....it was very small but my two year old kid loved it. The hotel staff were ok and nice. I did not encounter any problems with them except when I checked in and found out all strip view rooms were already booked. With that in mind, the only downfall I encountered with the hotel is that I booked and paid for a strip view room however when my family and I checked in I was told all strip view room were taken but I will be compensated to a higher floor with a view behind the hotel. Tired and grumpy from my long drive, I accepted and the hotel never answered any other type of compensation for overbooking the room that I paid for.

The bedding really Is amazing, and the kitchen was well-equipped, though we did not cook at all. I don't know what the house keeping deal was, but they didn't come at all, except the fifth day. We stalked them down twice for toilet paper and garbage bags. I would have liked to see them more! =) The pool is small, by Vegas standards, but very nice and we had no problem getting chairs and even space under the cabana. There's no glass allowed up there, so I recommend bringing plastic cups! I will note, after touring the studio apartment, I can understand the other reviews that complain about their size. They were tiny, and I would have been miserable/angry if we'd been put in one of those for trading our two bedroom time share in NY. One way around the studio is to call ahead and agree to sit through the timeshare presentation. Now, I knew going in that there was no way I was going to buy a timeshare, which made the presentation much easier, but I will say they definitely push you to buy. But, by sitting for an hour and repeatedly saying \"no,\" I got the 1 bedroom suite upgrade, as well as a -day, 2-night trip to any one of their six resorts. Not having a casino in the hotel was great, but I would have liked a restaurant (though the on-site convenience store was great and not terribly overpriced).

We were so pleased when we got there, literally jumping up and down with our view from the 8th floor in the front tower. I don't know why people say it is a walk at all to the stip, it is literally a 1 minute walk down a small side, and if you don't want to go down the 'alley' you can walk down the side roadway which is more open. We would walk with 2 of us at a time and had no problems. We had 5 girls in our 1 bedroom hotel, and we got a cot. Since we were not in our room much at all it was a perfect size. We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and caught the hotel's shuttle to Albertsons (grocery store) on Wednesday morning. We spent $200 and had plenty of food for the week we were there. This saved us so much money in the end, as we went out a few times to get some restaurant made food and cost us $15-$20 a person each time. The staff was awesome, whenever we needed anything we called and it would be up to our room in 45 minutes. We asked for extra hangers, towels every other day, dish washer soap and some other things. The staff was very helpful answering questions about where to go and things to do. The only negative things I would say would be the pool size. On the nice days you have to be up at the pool by 10AM at the latest to be able to get chairs because there are a very limited amount. The only other thing is that in the business center, they need to monitor the people on the computers-when we needed to print our boarding passes, there were women(yes, women probably 35 years old) sitting on facebook for about 20 minutes before getting off.

The Room is clean and had small kitchen which are nice Plus the internet is reasonable -- $8 for 24hrs /$15 for 3days. other vegas hotels normally charge the interent $15 for 24hrs. One disappointment i had with my stay this time was first staff who helped me checking in. Her name is Sandra and she finally called me after waiting in a long line but as soon as i walked toward her, she started helping out someone else without mentioning/explaining/apologizing to me. Her manager came/cut in my turn and asked Sandra to help his customer. IF she kindly told me that, then i didn't feel bad. I tried to be a patient without saying anything. but after waiting in a long line and now took her another 10min or so to help other customers, she was STILL ignoring me and helping other customer. and i started seeing other customers behind me started getting their keys. Here is the worst part of her rudeness... when she finished helping the customer, she didn't even say \"Hi\", \"Sorry for the wait\" or anything.. she just asked me my last name without eye contact. i was really upset about her rudeness! she didn't even say any greeting words like \"Thank you\" or \"enjoy your stay\" as well as no eye contact. NO smile or anything! I went to my room and it was smelled like a cigarette though it was supposed to be a NON-smoking room. I requested to change my room but they tried to push me to use a spray to deal with it. They even said they were over booked and no room available. i needed to explain to them i was sensitive about the cigarette smell in order to get a new room. I don't smoke and I am really sensitive with the smell and i hate it. In addition, their walls are paper thin.. so you hear noises from your neighbor. my next neighbor with the first cigarette smelled room was pretty loud when i walked in. so i was glad i moved to a different one. Overall... I still like this hotel because it's in the middle of strip and reasonable rate. They keep their hotel really clean and other staffs besides this Sandra lady were very nice. So, i think i will still come back to this hotel in the future but next time better to get 1bd suite.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Charles, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!!\u201d", "Author": "Jacqui1970", "ReviewID": "UR104059710", "Content": "Paid for hotel on travelocity.

You have Monte Carlo across the street and MGM on one side and Planet Hollywood on the other. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, 18206 & 18206A and had fantastic views. The kitchen was excellent for those who want to cook in. Complete kitchen with Cuisinart cookware and appliances. The security had to come open the adjoining door that connects the studio/bedroom to the main common area (see pics). Security were wonderful and prompt. They also pay attention to things like when my husband and I returned to the rooms at 4am or so they noticed our door was not completely shut and alerted the front desk to call us and have us come to the door to make sure everything was all good. We didnt realize that we thought we slammed it shut upon arrival but it wasnt tight and was slightly ajar while we slept!! It was a very good feeling to know we had that kind of lookout.

Our friends that also stayed on the same days were approached and did attend the presentation, but they received a free 3 day 2 night stay, a Visa Gift card, and actually wound up purchasing a package. First and foremost, the hotel is located behind the Hawaiian Marketplace on the strip. It is within walking distance to other hotels; we watched a boxing match at the MGM and walked over in about 5-10 minutes. We got a suite in the newly renovated tower and the rooms were amazing! Our suite was huge! It included a living room with comfy furniture and a flat screen TV, a dining room with a view of the strip, a full kitchen with all appliances and dishes (which is great if you want to eat in or enjoy some drinks - they even had stemware), and amazingly huge and immaculate bathroom with double vanities and a whirlpool garden tub which was AMAZING, relaxing and CLEAN. The bed was large and comfortable and there was also a flat screen television in the room. There was a ton of storage to keep items put away and the room looking uncluttered. There was also a murphy bed in the living room so technically around 4 people could have comfortable stayed in the room. The housekeeping service was GREAT. Another plus was there was a business center where you can print free of charge and we used it to print out boxing match ticketsThere is also a roof top hotel at this hotel that is extremely relaxing with cabanas, chairs, towels, and a jacuzzi. The only draw back was the annoying party people that seemed to flooding the area. This hotel definitely does not have the pool party vibe - it is filled with families with kids who promptly started to leave when the rude people were getting raucous and annoying. To the hotel's credit, a security person came up and spoke to them and told them they could not drink in the pool area, but I feel as though they should have been ejected. Other than that small issue, there was a lot of outside noise from the strip on Saturday night that made it a little difficult to sleep (this location is across the street from Diablo's Cantina). . There was also a weird smell in the lobby as other reviewers have mentioned. All in all, these small issues were really trivial and we will be back! Fantastic stay!

We stayed in the \"suites\" instead of the \"villas\"- only difference is the villas have already been renovated with newer furnishings & fancier details. My list of negatives is longer than my positives, but really I would stay here again! The + outweigh the - by far! Here were the negatives: - we were told ahead of time that the roof top pool was open, then arrived to find it was actually closed for a few weeks for maintenance. We could go next door to the Marriot's pool, which we checked out but didn't feel comfortable being the only ones taking a dip while 30 people were hanging out at the bar. -the lobby and hallway areas had a really strong perfume smell. i guess it could have been worse, but it was still a little too strong for my taste. - I was very disapointed to not see a recycling program in place. I asked an employee if they recycle at the hotel and they offered to take care of my water bottle, i'm pretty sure they just threw it in the trash. - it seemed like we did a lot of walking in the middle of roads and alleys since the hotel is off the strip and there weren't a lot of sidewalks leading out to the main drag -the garbage trucks came at 6:30 am to empty the 4 dumpsters located right beneath our windows- good thing we're early risers anyway! -the studio has a wall bed or \"murphy bed\", guess i missed that little detail -the washerd/dryers didn't seem to be working properly, if you plan to do laundry maybe find a laundry mat instead. The washer kept rinsing over & over and the dryer took forever to dry a load of clothes. The good points: - an AWESOME location! Because its off the strip the noise was low enough that we slept with the balcony door open almost every night! Super close to food & entertainment -plenty of room in the 1 bedroom and attached studio for my husband and our travel companions -eventhough the suites have not been renovated yet, the place was super clean and in very good condition.

I ended up in a studio (those designated with the letter A after the room number), 16206A, which faced south down the strip. The room was small and the bed was a double size Murphy bed. When folded out, the room was very small. Nevertheless, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large enough with great water pressure, and closet and drawer space was fine. It lacked a larger trash bin, and since I had take out most nights, the garbage kind of piled up quickly. The room also had a small balcony, although access was restricted due to the sofa which needed to be moved in order to pull the bed down. On the positive side, the staff was great. They were very responsive to a couple of issues I had during the stay, and the fact that the Polo Towers is 200yds off the strip gave it a secluded feeling. The location can't be beat, between the MGM and Planet Hollywood, and across from the Mandarin, almost everything is within walking distance. On the negative side, the shared door to the room next to me, Rm#16206, was paper thin. You could hear every conversation, every rattle of dishes, and every flush of the toilet. I would expect a better noise barrier. It was also difficult to keep the balcony door open due to the fact that the floor below was a smoking floor, and the group below me smoked on their balcony. The smoke rose, and came wafting into my room. Finally, you had to pay for internet, $8 per day, $13 for 3 days, or $30 for the week. I was in Vegas for a trade show at the Mandalay Bay but they did not run a shuttle to the PoloTowers. Instead, I had to get off at the Planet Hollywood Casino and walk about 5-10 minutes to get to the Polo Towers. It's not a big deal unless you have luggage. Finally, there's lots of fast food in the area. McDonalds, Dennys, Wendys, and Del Taco are within minutes of the hotel.

In Las Vegas, it depends on what you want. We don't gamble so a Timeshare is great. We also like to cook so a fully equiped kitchen is great for us. This place worked very well for us. THE GOOD The building is behind the Hawiian Market. It is very convenient to City Center, the MGM, NY-NY, Planet Hollywood, and the Miracle Mile. The location is great IF you get a view of the strip and are at least 8 floors or so up. We had a view of the strip from the 11th floor, so it was nice. This time share had a decent Kitchen which was good for us. We made some really nice meals and looked out to the lights of the strip as we ate. You have a nice view of the big screen at City Center that shows the Fashion show, and views of the new buildings with the multicolor lights etc. Also a nice sunset view. The rooms were advertised as 4 star, but I would call them Marginal 3 star. Nice Counters, kitchen, TV's and bed. A DVD player and IPOD capable stereo are provided, but they are cheap. THE BAD The bathroom is like a cave. VERY POOR LIGHTING, so ladies will have a hard time with make-up and they don't have ventilation so they are always steamy. There is a connecting room with a door and if the neighbors are noisy, your room will be too. The hallways are noisy, and the building is set quite a ways off of the strip, so it is a little spooky going in late at night. The building is OLD, and the bones are beginning to show their age even with the recent remodelling. THE UGLY This place is right on one of the corners where the strip clubs pay illegals to hand out those strip club cards. You are perpetually annoyed by them when you walk out on the strip. OVERALL I would stay here again if I didn't want to use a car. If you have a car (and why not, since EVERY casino does free valet parking), I'd find a place off the strip that is less exensive.

The hotel is right off the Vegas strip, near the MGM and Monte Carlo and across the strip from the new City Center Complex which has some wonderful resorts , including the new Aria Hotel, an exclusive designer shopping center and fabulous restaurants. The staff is friendly. The rooms are comfortable. The negatives are, that this is a timeshare, not a hotel. Towels are changed every day, but room is only cleaned once during your weekly stay. There are no lounges or restaurants inside the property. The pool is very plain. The worst part of the stay was the noise level from the open air center right in front of the hotel. Every day they have a band playing a few hours in the afternoon and in the evening. You could hear the noise even with your windows closed. Luckily, they stopped playing at around 11:00 p.m. or so. But played longer on the weekend. We were staying in the front side of the hotel. The view was magnificent, but the noise was not! I understand that if you stay on the back side of the hotel you hear the early morning noise of the trash collector. For Las Vegas, I believe that it is better to stay in a regular hotel.

Yes I was asked to attend the timeshare meeting and various other meetings but I declined. My studio room was great with a balcony and a coffee maker. These two things are rare in Vegas as most hotels expect you to buy a Starbucks in their lobby and balconies are pretty much unheard of. The rooftop pool/spa was amazing and with no extra costs such as the use of the cabanas (MGM Grand charged $360 per day I know because I used their pools) and free use of two impressive BBQs. You can also take your own alcohol up to the pool just not in glass bottles. Again a big difference from MGM who charged $7.00 per bottle of beer (poolside bar) and did bag checks at the entrance to make sure you weren't smuggling any alcohol in!!!! The little grocery shop was great with just enough to tide you by and the staff amazing. The Polo Towers are situated opposite a 7/11 so you can easily buy alcohol to stock up your fridge and a Walgreens close by for pain killers should you drink too much!

We did a Getaway through Interval International and stayed in the Villas, not the Suites. The property is aging but it is clean and the location is good. We were on the 9th floor and had a very nice view of the CityCenter and the Strip. We were able to check in immediately upon arrival at 3:30 p.m. and were never bothered at all about doing the timeshare presentation. We thought the staff was excellent and very friendly. We valet parked some of the time and self-parked some of the time. If you come back late in the evening, there is no one to valet for you. We did not have any problem finding a parking space ever in the underground parking. Maybe we just got lucky! The long driveway out to the Strip only takes a few minutes to walk and we felt pretty safe at night walking back and forth down it. The unit itself, a one bedroom, was fine, nothing exceptional compared to most timeshares we have stayed at but it served it's purpose. It is smaller than we are used to, especially the livingroom, but we did not spend that much time in the room. It was clean and we did get daily maid service, which is unusual for a timeshare. We only cooked some breakfasts in and ate all our other meals out. The kitchen had everything you need although we found it odd and inconvenient that there was no garbage disposal in the sink. The king sized bed was very comfortable and we slept great! We did hear the garbage trucks every morning but we were awake by then anyway so it was not a huge deal. We purchased the in-room internet from ibahn for $36 for the week and it worked fine. I needed to check in for work purposes at least once a day so it was worth it for me. Seems a little high for what it is but at least it is available. The whole resort is showing it's age but for the price we paid, we were completely satisfied. The location allowed us to walk almost everywhere, down to Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, Tropicana, NYNY, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, CityCenter and others. If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place but the location is excellent.

We had a studio and to be honest it was very basic with no proper oven, only a microwave and no kettle. If you want to cook any meals go for a 1 bed as they apparently have ovens. There were several faults in our room when we arrived. Electricity kept tripping, tv didnt work, coffee maker didnt work.

Arrived at the resort late at night, after hanging around the airport for ages, Delta airlines had lost my luggage, and did not seem bothered, in fact, it appears this happens often. On a five and a half hour flight from New York, the only refreshments were a drink (half a can of your juice of choice) and a two fingered pack of biscuits. There was food on offer (bagel type sandwich or M&M's), but you could only pay with a credit card. I found this totally unsuitable and insufficient. I would not fly with Delta Airlines again, ever. Got checked in very quickly, got to my room, 313sq ft as advertised on the website. I don't think so!!! It was an average sized room, very tired and hungry, I decided to get my bed ready, tried to get the 'murphy' bed down from the wall (foldaway), couldn't get it, tried a few times, couldn't manage it, thought I must be doing something wrong and didn't want to break it so I opted for sleeping on the couch, (the couch is the foldaway bed) okay for sitting on, not for sleeping on. Very uncomfortable night. In the morning, went in search of a kettle or boiling device for tea, only a coffee perculator, phoned and asked if they had a kettle, they obligingly sent one up, but a stove top whistling kettle, no stove to put it on, they suggested that I use the perculator for hot water, knew what the result would be but thought i would try it, as I thought tasted coffee through the water. You would think that with all the european visitors and tea drinkers, they would provide even a small travel kettle. I have one, but because they advertised a fully equipped kitchen, I didn't think I would need it. I told them about the bed, they sent a handyman up within a half an hour and he declared that it was indeed broken, he would fix it that day, which he did. (The bed, when it is down and the cushions are on the floor, there is not a lot of room, even for one person). No apology was offered by management. On a more positive note, the view from my balcony was of the Strip and surrounding mountains, very nice. The room had good air conditioning, a good sized telly and a microwave which I felt was dangerously high for anyone under 6ft, especially when you are having to boil water in there and it bubbles over as you are lifting it out. I am surprised by this actually, bearing in mind the American Culture and their love of 'suing'. Hotel is actually a timeshare complex, and there are tours of people being shown around all the time, this is not an inconvenience, it just shows the interest in the place. The pool is on the roof, (22nd floor) nice but very very small, lovely views and very clean. There is a gift shop which is very well stocked and reasonably priced, you can hire dvds in the machine at the gift shop. This resort is in a perfect location, far enough away from the strip so that you are not bothered by the noise, but close enough to walk to strip. I have been to Vegas lots of times, and stayed at different hotels, this is the nicest one. The staff were very nice, yes you get the chance to win a special prize (a timeshare talk and tour), but you don't have to do it. Flights (all booked through expedia) were excellent, apart from Delta. Air France, were fantastic, I would thoroughly recommend.

The bathroom was huge with a large bedroom (King size bed) and the living room with a pull out sofa bed. I believe the room was set up to accommodate a disabled person since the shower has no steps with a flexible shower hose/head and a fold out shower seat. Because of this, the whole bathroom floor gets pretty wet because the water splashes out when showering. Bathroom amenities include plenty of towels, lotion, shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner, hair dryer. Lots of hangers also. Also an in-room safe big enough for a laptop. Really convenient. The only problem was that every morning around 6:30 AM, we were awakened by extremely loud trash and delivery trucks (we stayed there from Monday-Thursday). It lasted 20-30 minutes each morning so it was hard to get back to sleep after that. Lots of elevators. Secure access to our room since we needed an access key to punch in the elevator floors. They did try to schedule me for their timeshare presentation but I told them I wouldn't be in the hotel during the three time periods that they were holding them, which was true. They also left me a voicemail the next day to try to get me to go to the concierge's desk to pick up some \"free coupons for shows and dinners\". Didn't need the hassle so I ignored it.

Both pools suck, check in was at 4 pm, there is a lack of information online. The rooms suck, it doesn't state that the lockoff room doesn't have its own bed, rather a murphy bed, but to use the bed you must first move the couch to one side of the room and the table to the other, which kills the space of the tiny lockoff room. There is no washer or dryer in the room, as Marriott has in its suites. When we arrived the person at the front desk neglected to tell us we had to pre-register in order to receive a room, even though we asked what we needed to do. Instead she told us to check back at 1:30. Instead of returning at that time, we called and found out we had to pre-register at the hotel, or wait until 4 PM or later, but then they stated that we should note we will not be a priority unless pre-registered. An hour or so after we went to the hotel and preregistered we still didn't have a room. At this point they had us waiting for 4 or 5 hours. After about 7 hours wait time we got a room, this was around 5 PM. On some site it stated there was WIFI available in the rooms, there is, but it is 7.95 a day or 39.95 for the whole week. There is no free data connection. At Marriott both are included. This was by far, the WORST interval resort available. Its location is pretty nice in center city, but there is no casino in the hotel, or on the block for that matter, the closest casino is two blocks away at MGM, unless you want to cross the strip, which is a b!tch. At the desk in the lockoff room the outlet under the desk has no available ports. I paid the money for the wifi just to type this immediately. I DO NOT recommend the POLO TOWERS to ANYONE. All they do is waste time and p!ss people off. There are many hotels that leave this one in the dust in the vicinity of this building. Also transportation to and from the hotel is hard sometimes, during the day the strip should be avoided to access the hotel, rather take the backstreets with less traffic, but still just as annoying. It is not really located on a street but rather between a parking lot and a shopping center. This place sucks, there is garbage all over the streets of the city and on the block there are people promoting prostitution.Vegas is nice, but Polo Towers isn't.

This two-bedroom suite faces east (not a view of the Strip, but that was okay, because it cut down on noise), which was an easy \u00bd block away. Dark curtains kept out early morning sunshine. Mid-afternoon Friday check-in meant almost no delay, and suite was ready at least an hour before official check-in time. Small-ish lobby made things more personable (again, compared to the larger hotels nearby). Being a timeshare property, the daily housekeeping service was a pleasant surprise. Housekeepers kept us stocked on fresh towels, shampoo, soap and empty trash containers. The two queen Murphy beds satisfied our 22 and 18 year old sons, one of whom had his own bedroom, bathroom (with shower) and balcony. As we left the living room Murphy bed down, this put a bit of a cramp on space in the main living area, but we worked (and walked) around it. Main bathroom had large Jacuzzi tub and two separate sink areas (lots of room). One issue in both bathrooms was that neither had a working exhaust fan (which we never followed-up on). Air conditioning worked quite well. As there is no restaurant on-site, this may be an inconvenience, but the room service restaurant had great Italian food, and large portions. If you get the caesar salad, make sure they include the salad dressing! The Polo Towers also has a well-equipped and up-to-date fitness centre, which we took advantage of. Exchangers did not have to pay the daily fee, which I think was about $8/person. A couple of pharmacies with basic groceries are within easy walking distance. Everything seems to be within easy walking distance! Additionally, Polo Towers does offer free shuttle service to the outlet malls as well to a large full-service grocery store at various times through the week. We did rent a car, and while this made it convenient getting to and from the residence, it was not a necessity. The underground parking, at times, was a bit difficult (we didn\u2019t think there were enough spaces for all the cars), until we discovered a second, attached underground lot. There is also another parking lot that is above ground, but is off property. It did come in handy for when we went on a day trip to Hoover Dam/Lake Mead. Then we appreciated the freedom having our own car gave us. Word of warning. If going to Vegas in the summer, be prepared to be in an oven. Dry heat or no dry heat, it\u2019s tough.

Overall, we were very satisfied with everything. No hotel is perfect 100% of the time, so I guess some of the complaints in reviews I've read here are accurate, but I think they are isolated cases. The rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, the kitchen had Cuisinart coffee makers etc., the iPod docking stations in every room were a great bonus, there were three flat screens throughout (with HD and DVD players), nice bathrooms with double sinks and a large tub, and the daily maid service was great too. The patio off the one bedroom was only big enough for standing, but the one off the studio was large. There was plenty of room in the two bedroom. I can see how some have said the rooms were tiny, because if you are in just a studio, it will be very small, but that's what studio's are. The location is great.. between Planet Hollywood and MGM, right across the street from the new Aria Hotel and CityCenter. We requested a view of the strip and landed a room on the 21st floor with a pretty good view where we could see the Bellagio fountains from our patio and dining room window. Our kids were not with us on this trip, but they would have had a blast in the kids water play area... very nice! The adult pool on the roof as others mentioned was small. The cabanas and grills were nice (grilled a couple of steaks), but there's not a ton of space up there. Regarding the trash trucks others mentioned, I did see/hear them but our room (21310) was far enough away that it wasn't a problem. I would recommend requesting a room that is not near the trash dumpsters as I could see how it could be annoying. The staff was very courteous and helpful. We sat through the time-share sales pitch because we own elsewhere and wanted to compare, plus they gave us a $75 visa card and a weekend stay. We didn't taste the room service food cause we cooked a lot and there are so many good restaurants in Vegas. My only complaints are that the air conditioner in the bedroom was a little loud in the night, and for what ever reason, wifi is not available on the higher floors. They offered us wifi in a room with no view... we chose to keep the view and I just used the wifi in the business center or lobby.

As hubby and I were already in Vegas we tried to see if we could check in early around 11am. This it would seem is not allowed and we were told to return at check in time at 4pm. We returned back at just after 3pm and were allowed to check in. There seemed to be a lot of people waiting to check in so be aware if you have an early flight that you may be hanging around until early afternoon to check in. Please also be aware that the hotel requires a credit card and chrges $250 to this. Unfortunatley hubbys card declined and they charged us $100 instead (that is still to be returned 10 days later grrrrr). This hotel is a non casino hotel. Hubbey felt that he missed out on some of the Vegas atmosphere because of this. However i do think if you are a family and do not want to expose you kids to seedier side of vegas this hotel is perfect. the rooms are fitted to very high standard that I have not seen matched by any other budget hotel. We had a studio room with a murphy bed. This is basically a bed that pulls out from the wall. Hubby is very tall and normally has probs with beds being too short but this was fine for him. We left the bed down the whole time we were there and did not have any probs. It is very handy having a fridge and microwave in the room. hubby and I just had cereal in the morning and saved ourselves for the buffets!!!! There are DVD players in the rooms and there is a rental machine near to the hotel shop. So again if you have kids and wnat an early night its great. However now the negatives. The car parking in appalling. There are not enough spaces under the hotel and they are rather tight. You can park on the outside car park, however I would not recommend this. As the hotel is tucked behind some shops bums/homeless people tend to hang around here and I did feel very unsafe. In addition the cops were there EVERY night arresting someone. One night they had 4 bums on the floor in cuffs. This is not something I expect to see. On another night hubby and were followed up the dark unlit road to the hotel and I did fear that we would be mugged. I am not someone who scares easily but I would recommend going back to your room early to avoid this. I however do not like going to my room early, It is vegas after all!!!!.

Had a view of the strip. Clean bathroom, had a problem with lights but it was fixed straight away. Small-ish room. Microwave, free coffee, iron, hairdryer provided. It might not be as plush as the other hotels but this was cheaper than the others and clean as well. Door to door shuttle from the airport for about 6 dollars or so per person. Runs 24/7. Booked a cheap trip to the Grand canyon for 85 dollars. about 60 gbp. (rather book this no frills excursion and save my money for shopping and eating)Coach trip included mini hoover dam and time at the canyon for self exploration inc breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. exit the hotel and turn right, walk past the stalls selling various tourist items and clothes and next to the restaurant/cafe/karaoke place called zingers or something similar(if my memory serves me correctly) is a little one man stand selling these tours. He takes a deposit and u pay the rest on the day Cheaper than the 130 dollars quoted by the man in the shopping mall.(because his includes on board wifi and a newer coach)", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Gem, Great for Families\u201d", "Author": "soj0urner", "ReviewID": "UR67413705", "Content": "We visited Vegas with 2 small kids last week and stayed in Polo Towers for 3 nights.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite - King bedroom, and Queen sofa bed in the living area, huge bathroom, a good size kitchen with Cuisinart appliances, toaster, microwave, dish washer, 10-cup coffee maker (everything looked brand new), 2 flatscreen TVs! Definitely a very comfortable stay. There was no housekeeping during our stay - housekeeping was every 3 nights. But towels were changed and trash cleared every afternoon. Wireless internet is charged at $7.95/24hrs by ibahn. But our computer detected and connected to the free att wireless hotspot from the next door hotel (Grand Chateau). Yey for free wireless! There is also free internet at the business center on the ground floor. The kids enjoyed the children's pool, playground and water play area every evening. Washer/dryer was free but the dryer was pretty weak. Took ages for our clothes to get dried. It was faster to sun them at the room balcony. We arrived late so didn't get to meet any concierge. We received a 'key' to open a treasure box for a chance at a $100 Visa gift card. While waiting to check out, I saw several guest use the key at the concierge, none of them got the gift card, all of them (only the couples) were asked if they wanted to attend the hotel open house with free refreshments - and listen to the time share sales pitch.

It's just a place to sleep, shower and maybe have a snack----the size shouldn't matter!! There were 2 adults in our party with MORE than enough room to move around, despite what some reviewers might have you believe!!! The murphy bed was easy to use & comfortable, the kitchenette was sufficient, the bathroom nice as well. The room even had a large balcony- something you really don't typically see in Las Vegas.......The hotel rooms and grounds were clean, staff friendly, free underground parking, a pool on the 23rd floor (great!!!) and the location.......RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STRIP WITH EASY WALKING TO EVERYWHERE! Even if you don't like to walk as much as we do, you're still close to cabs and the bus line! Polo towers is neatly tucked off the main drag, there is no casino in the hotel, so the mobs of people passing through don't exist!!!!! Polo towers is located directly across from the new ARIA complex, so you really are in the center of it all!!! We did take a bus to the OLD DOWNTOWN AREA.....YIKES!!!

It just seemed a little creepy and NOT comfortably safe to let your guard down!

It turned into a great weekend, so I thought I\u2019d share a little about our experience with the property. LOCATION / VIEW Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Planet Hollywood, the Bellagio, etc. Overall it was a great view of the strip. I don\u2019t think we closed our windows much as it was wonderful to look at any time of day. You could even see the fountains at the Bellagio from our window! From a location perspective, the hotel is really well located. It\u2019s an easy walk north or south to a large portion of the strip. There are several mini-marts, a Wal-Greens and a CVS nearby to pickup staples like cereal, bagels, snacks and drinks. Not grocery store prices, but cheaper than the onsite convenience store on property. ROOM Our one bedroom suite was very comfortable. Living room, dining, kitchen, bedroom (with king bed) and bath. Suites do not have laundry facilities, but they are available on property. Beds / linens were very comfortable. They did towel swap / trash removal daily, but since it\u2019s a timeshare property, they didn\u2019t do a full clean each day. Unit was clean and fresh on arrival, and we found no issues. Kitchen was adequately equipped. There were 2 large flat screen TVs. The sofa was comfortable enough for napping. Bathrooms and kitchen had granite countertops. The unit appeared to be recently remodeled. Internet was available in the room for $7-8/day. There was a business center downstairs with computers, printers and internet. SERVICE Front desk staff was great. Bell staff was usually helpful, although could be a little grumpy about the cab situation --- more on that in the next section. Concierge wasn\u2019t as helpful as I would have liked. They might have been fine for tickets, but always sent you to the bell stand for directions. TAXIS/ TRANSPORT The property sits back from the strip, and there are seldom if EVER cabs waiting. You can\u2019t hail your own on the strip, as they aren\u2019t allowed to stop. The belldesk must call them, and you never know how long it will take. We tried to get them to order one in advance so we wouldn\u2019t have dinner / show issues, but they insisted it was first come / first served only. This was our biggest issue --- but it was really only a problem when going out in the evenings \u2013 where there could easily be 2-3 groups in front of you when you got down there. They also have a transport service that helps them, and if there aren\u2019t cabs available, they\u2019ll put you in one of those. It\u2019s a little more expensive --- about $15 to most places \u2013 but if you are going to be late, it\u2019s not worth arguing over. We did run into one of those drivers that expected a pretty extravagant tip (he didn\u2019t plan to give us change for a $20 on a $10 ride). MGM or Paris are the closest monorail stops. There\u2019s a deuce bus stop next door in front of Planet Hollywood ($3 one way or $7 for 24 hour pass). The bus is fine if you are in no hurry. I had to pick up tickets at the Stratosphere. With traffic, it took 30 minutes to get there and 50 to get back. Overall --- It was a great place to be -- without the craziness of an onsite casino.

Second, we own at the Marriott Grand Chateau next door which is WORLD's better, but wasn't quite finished when we made this trip and our week was a free comp from Marriott for our timeshare purchase. The room was very average and small, but that's because it was the lock off room. It is in a good location, just right off the strip and we only rarely drove or used a cab to get to anything. Service was average at best. Whenever we asked for something it took a while and often, multiple calls, to get what we wanted or needed. You need to know that with most timeshares, check out is 10am and since we didn't get in until 4am the morning we were supposed to check out, we negotiated an additional 2 or 3 hours for an extra $45. We needed the sleep and check out at noon or 1pm was a much better idea. Alas, the front desk called at 9am to verify that we were going to be checking out late. And woke us up. And yes, I was not very pleasant. Then, just as we drifted back off...housekeeping started cleaning the connected room very loudly and then knocked on our door repeatedly and then tried to get in. By the time I pulled the door open, the cleaning lady was running down the hallway, because she realized she'd made a mistake. Not her fault. She wasn't told not to clean our room, but should've been told. I wanted to argue about the $45, but my wife wisely suggested I go get the car and find my peace and she checked us out. Better to write off the money and enjoy the rest of the day. So...my experience was sub-par, but I'd say overall the Polo Towers is a very average hotel and I feel for anyone who buys here with something as nice as the Grand Chateau next door. Oh, and even if you don't stay here (which you shouldn't), check out the three horse sculpture in the lobby.

We have been owners since 1991 and bought in the Villas. When I arrived last week (9/6-9/13) I tipped $20 and asked for a view of the strip. Not sure what took so long, but the girl looked like she did her best by typing for such a long time, then checking certain reports and talking to co-workers about certain rooms, etc. It was like it was an ordeal to get me a room with a view. So naturally I was very very thankful. But once I got to my room I noticed that it was not a Villa. It was a Suite. Basically they are the same except that the Villa's have upgrades that make a huge difference for me. The bathroom, in particular has two sinks instead of one. Also the bathtub is a jaccuzi in the Villa's and just a small tub in the Suites. The Villa's have better decorations, better bedding, better furniture, and better kitchen counters and equipment. Just nicer. So it was again an ordeal when I went back down to the desk and talked to the same nice girl who told me to return the next day. I did return in the morning but was told to return in the afternoon. Sigh. So I returned in the afternoon and FINALLY I got a Villa. But not on the strip. So I felt like I tipped her $20 for nothing! As it turns out, I loved my Villa and I loved the view of the mountains, facing east. Beautiful sunsets every morning. Other than that, I enjoyed staying at Polo Towers. It's not a mega resort, which I like. It is more like a private condo. Private and quiet. That's what I wanted while in Vegas.

It was like a salon hairdryer compared to most of the crappy ones you find in hotels. This makes a difference when you have long hair like me! The location of the hotel was another plus. While not on the strip, it is only about a block or so back. When you are trying to sleep, this makes a big difference as you will avoid a lot of the noise from the strip of loud music, drunken revelers, etc. that are non-stop in Vegas. The hotel within walking distance to MGM, New York- New York, Luxor, Tropicana, Monte Carlo, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Paris, Excalibur, etc. You can also take a ride on the \"Deuce\" bus ($3 one way) to get to some of the hotels on the northern strip such as Wynn, Trump Towers, Venetian. The Deuce also goes all the way to old Vegas where you can gamble cheaper (Binions, Mermaids, Golden Nugget, etc). The hotel also offers several free shuttles you may want to take advantage of. In terms of ammenites, we used the gym, which is located next door to the hotel. It was awesome! Most hotel gyms are tiny and lack a variety of machines/weights. Not this one! It had everything we needed (bikes, treadmills, eclipse, weights, machines, pull up bar, stair-stepper, etc). Overall, the hotel was in a great location, offered great prices/value, and the service was good too. Anytime we had questions the staff was quick to help out.

The pool was awesome, we walked up at the perfect time and was able to snag a cabana with a couple of lounge chairs, the whole pool area was filled to capacity! We took a cooler with drinks thinking that we would have to hide it but there were people there BBQing, eating fast food, and drinking from their coolers also. The only rule I saw was that you had to smoke in designated areas and no glass containers at the pool. We had a two bedroom, two bathroom condo and it is very spacious, you could have 6 adults or a room full of kids and feel like you aren't all shoved into the room.

We had our 14 y.o. son with us. The resort was in a very busy spot with construction around and close to the airport but noise was never a problem. Upon arrival we found a very friendly and helpful stafff, nice lobby area with marble floors and a center fountain. The entrance to the resort was presentable but to get to the underground parking one has to drive around the building, thru a narrow entryway that ran past the dumpster area and then around to the garage entrance. It was just a bit awkward getting to the garage. I might add this is also the side of the resort where the kiddie pool is, the sun barely hit that area all day and it was not the most attractive spot for a child's play area, as it overlooked a large parking lot, construction site and the aforementioned dumpsters. As for the main pool, it was on the roof, looked very nice but was only 3 ft. deep. It stays open until 10pm but kids are not allowed in after 5pm, we saw the security guards actually kick the kids out once. They were the only ones using it so I thought it was a little mean of them. The room was much nicer than I expected from some of the reviews I've read. The decor was very up to date. Carpets were clean and new, no odors, I didn't see even one bug anywhere. The bed was a very comfortable king size with lots of fluffy pillows, I would compare it to a Sweet Sleeper or even a Heavenly. It was that comfy. The bedroom was a nice size with sliding door out to a very tiny balcony. Being on the 12th floor, we had a nice view of MGM, NY-NY, Excaliber, etc. Lots of lights and activity to observe from our window. Our son slept on the sofa bed, he said it was comfortable. Kitchen had tiled floor, granite counter, dishwasher, refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster and all the dishes and utensils you need for 4 people. Bathroom also had granite counter, good water pressure in shower. Housekeeping was not as reliable as I had hoped, we came back a few times after being out the entire day to find they had not been in yet to change the towels, empty the trash or make the bed as promised. However whenever I needed something I just called housekeeping and someone was there in a matter of minutes with whatever I needed. A follow-up phone call from the HK supervisor to see that we were taken care of every time was much appreciated. The one thing I would have liked to see is free Wi-Fi. They have an outside company and you have to pay $35 for a week of use or however long you wanted.

At this point, I was seriously wondering if we could change hotels since we'd booked at this one for an entire week. The manager then \"upgraded\" our room and gave us dinner at a local restaurant. We moved again, it was a long night, and tried to make the best of it, have a good attitude and settle down.

Timeshares and made this reservation through them many months ago for a 1-bedroom suite for 10-23-08 thru 10-28-08 for my husband's birthday. The Polo Towers was one of their top-rated resorts. The day before we were to fly out, we received a phone call from the Polo Towers telling us about the Legionnaire problem. They did not volunteer to put us in another hotel, but they did say that we may want to get on the web and read about Legionnaire's and if we fell into any of the \"high risk\" categories of possibly getting it, we may want to postpone our trip to a future date. When I got on the web, it said people who are at high risk are the elderly (which we don't consider us that yet - we are in our early 40's), people who smoke (neither one of us have ever smoked), or people with a low-immune system (and neither one of us as far as we know have that), so we decided to go ahead and still go. We also doubted if the airline would let us change our flights to a future date without a huge penalty and we didn't know if Diamond Resorts Intl. would give us our timeshare points back if we didn't go and even if they did, we would have had to have used them before the end of the year or lose them, and both my husband and I have jobs that are not very easy to get time off of, so these were also reasons we decided to go ahead and go. We decided that when we got there and talked with the Polo Towers directly, if we thought it was too bad, we would ask them to move us or we would just go somewhere else on our own. When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised. It looked very clean and there were all kinds of young and old people wandering about the lobby and going in and out of rooms and the desk clerks were very calm and laid back. The only thing was that they were not very informative about the Legionnaire's scare. I tried to ask them specific questions and they just kept telling me to read the info packet they handed to me. It didn't really say too much except for that 4 cases had been reported to them of people who had stayed there that had contracted Legionnaire's - 2 from last year, and 2 from Sept/Oct. of this year. They said that Nevada Health & Environment were aware of it and that the Polo Towers had started treatment for it. Well, we decided to go ahead and stay. We checked into our room which was very nice. It had a king-size bed in the bedroom which was very comfortable along with a TV, closet with safe, and a small balcony (if you could call it that). It was just a very small 6 x 10 concrete area - room for one chair - if you sat in the chair, you couldn't see over the concrete. We had a view of the parking lot. The only noise we heard was the trash truck that came by early in the morning and I can't remember now, but I don't think it was every morning, just a couple of days during our 5-night stay. The bathroom was large with just a regular tub/shower combination and single sink, but with a large countertop. We did take short showers and left the doors to the bathroom open while showering so as not to make steam (don't know if this really helped with the Legionnaire's or not). There was also a very strong chemical smell coming from the water, which we assumed was the chemicals they were using to treat it. It smelled something like chlorine. The living room had a TV, stereo, couch, and chair and the kitchen had a full-size frig, stove, and microwave. Our TV wasn't working right when we got there, so we called Maintenance and they had it fixed immediately. We had rented a car also and talked to the valets a lot when we would drop off or pick up the car. They were very helpful and nice. The store they have inside the hotel is small, but has everything you might need - bottled water (which we drank instead of the faucet water), aspirin, eyeglass screwdriver, snacks, etc. (some of the things we purchased) and the people working in it were very nice too. We went up to the roof-top pool/hot tub one day just to see what it was like. It looked nice - kind of small, but nice. All in all, it was a good trip, as long as we don't end up getting the Legionnaire's. The web said you should see signs of it within 2-14 days after exposure to the bacteria and we have been home now for 13 days and so far, we are both fine. I would have strongly recommended this hotel to anyone if Legionnaire's wasn't a factor, but it is really up to you personally if you want to stay here until they get the problem fixed.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cLegionnaires Disease\u201d", "Author": "IowaBlitz", "ReviewID": "UR21416169", "Content": "We had reservations for a 2 bedroom suite at the Polo Towers for 10/18/08 - 10/25/08.

At times it sounded like a jack hammer in the next room because of the air conditioning turning on and off. The water pipes also added to the symphony as did the running toilet. Also, our entry door was damaged by staff and was coming off the hinges because the cleaning staff jammed the doors open while in the room. It took over a week to get this repaired and we could only enter or leave the room with a strong shoulder to the door. And then, just under our window was the garbage pickup and every morning at 6 a.m. the banging and clanking began. You don't need an alarm clock! Linens used for our guests were not removed for a week. There was no intense cleaning of the unit and it was very dusty.

It's in a great area of the strip...and here is my only complaint...our room had a great view on the 9th floor facing the strip, but it was right behind the \"hawiian marketplace\" which is a fun place during the day, but at night it's very loud. People are still karaokeing at 3:00 am! And they play loud music all night. Luckily I always wear ear plugs (my husband snores!) and he snores so loud he wouldn't hear anything. Not the Polo Towers fault but you might want to ask for a higher up room or in a different location. Otherwise I was very pleasantly pleased with the Polo Towers. They even had a shuttle pick us up and 4:00 in the morning to take us to the airport! Great Time...and here's a little tip. Rent a car and go to the North End of the Grand Canyon! Awesome!

There was an active construction site in front of the Marketplace, but we didn't hear any noise from there. I read the review about the air conditioner being loud.

There is a 1 foot deep pool with a shower in the midst and a place to run around with squirting fountains. Kids will love this. By far the best thing about the Polo Towers is the location. It is steps away from Planey Hollywood (formerly the Aladdin) as well as the MGM. Surrounding the property are the Marriott Grand Chateau as well as some other condominium projects.

My husband and I took my parents and there was plenty of room for the four of us. One bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub. The other had a large walk-in shower. My parents\u2019 bedroom had a king-sized bed. Ours had a pull-down queen-sized Murphy bed, which we left down for the entire trip. (There was no sense in putting it back each day since we had a couch in the living room to use.) We were on the second floor and didn\u2019t have much of a view, but we hardly noticed. The towels were replenished daily and the beds were made. The gorgeous full kitchen was great for making coffee in the morning and storing snacks. We easily could have cooked but we chose not to. The small convenience store on site was helpful. Perhaps the best thing about the Polo Tower is its location. It\u2019s smack in the middle of the strip. We had an easy time getting to all of the casinos. Regarding cabs, there were a few times where we had to get the front desk to call one for us but they always showed up quickly. I have no idea why prior reviews complain so much about the cab situation. We did not use the rooftop pool but would have if the weather had been better. While it\u2019s not a luxurious pool, it\u2019s certainly adequate. It\u2019s true that the Polo Towers does not have a casino on site. After all, this is not a resort hotel. We, however, loved this. It was nice to come \u201chome\u201d at the end of the night and be able to walk right up to our room without having to hike a mile through a huge smoke-filled hotel casino. It was such a peaceful place that you truly felt relaxed the minute you walked through the doors. We never heard any noise from construction or the strip. We were never once approached by timeshare representatives. Prior to our departure, I did receive a call from Polo Towers asking if we wanted to book a timeshare tour but I simply explained that we already own a timeshare and weren't interested. As I said, we weren\u2019t approached at all once we arrived. In summary, we loved it here. I would go back in a heartbeat.

Since there is a kitchen area, our first stop was to the SuperWalmart to stock up on food (keep the eating out costs down)! We had a 1BR Jr Ste with the adjoining efficiency on the 15th floor of I believe Tower I (the elevators are closest to the resort grocery store). There were 4 of us, 2 shared the efficiency and the others shared the 1BR.

The eff had a Murphy bed, another sleeper couch, kitchenette, bathroom, desk area, balcony, and flat screen w/DVD player and stereo. We moved the couch in the eff out to the living area, rearranged some furniture, and made more space in the eff, while giving the living area more seating! The location set back from the strip, but still close to everything. We were located facing the MGM, NYNY, just above the driveway for the Polo Towers. The view was great! The resort does sit behind a shopping area that does have a bar w/drunk karaoke singers. We didn't hear them though, as we were not on that side. The walk from the strip up the driveway to the resort takes about 2 minutes, and unless you are walking alone and no one else is out (which doesn't happen in...it's Vegas remember), I had no concerns with safety. There are souvenir shops, a 7-11, CVS, Walgreen's, McDonalds all in the close area, and very handy! We did walk to Planet Hollywood, Monte Carlo (across the street), and MGM...drove everywhere else! The City Center that's being built is huge, can't wait to see it next year! There is a FatBurger in the next shopping complex, so that helped with the late night munchies!

My Grandfather owns a week at Polo Towers and I have used it a few times in the past with no problems. It was this trip that revieled Polo Towers age. If you would ever imagine staying at a hotel that really goes that extra mile to make sure your room is clean and orderly, make those last minute reservations, or even bring you a couple of extra towels, you've found the wrong place with Polo Towers. It really started with check-in. I was pushed aside in line by a very disturbing incoming guest. She was livid about something and didn't care about standing in line. The front desk whitness the whole thing, and didn't bother to ask her to wait for a manager, or perhaps wait in line (we all know this is not the right thing to do anyways though). Check in was a breeze. I was however very disappointed with their check-in/check-out policy being 4PM check in, 10:00 AM check out! Arriving to the room was imbarassing. Being I had some of my friends with me, I imagined they were expecting me to pull a rabbit out of a hat like I did by finding that gem Signature. Our first welcome into the room was via a paper warning sign placed on the carpet, saying \"please take off your shoes if they are wet\". What a welcome huh? Scanning the room, you can tell the furnature needs help quick fast. The couch and armchair's apolstry needed help, the carpet was well worn, the windows dirty, th kitchen freshly mopped only to have them push the hard to reach items under the fridge. YUCK! Our bedrooms were bottom of the barrel. Both King beds were well used with large body imprints on each side. The bed spreads and sheets smelly and looking like they were pulled from the Travellodge below us. I would assume that they do not seperate the bedding fromt heir smoking and non smoking rooms as these sheets smelled of smoke very bad. The credenza in front of the bed proved warn too as the laminate on the front of one of the drawers was ripped off showing the true colors of below. On a good note, after getting a little settled in, we called down to housekeeping for two extra rollaway. I figure they would have an extra charge for these, but found that to be unture, they were free. After only waiting for maybe 5 minutes, the doorbell rang, and two rollaway beds were brought in. A funny thing about 5 minutes later, the same lady brought us two more rollways. We happily declined, letting her know that there must have been a mix up, we already have two(as I was pointing at the two we hadn't even moved out of the way yet). At check in. I had requested a room which was strip view. The room he picked out for us was a room that actually was in the corner of the capital i (Imagine one lines crossing the top and bottom of the capital letter \"i\") shaped building. Thus, we basically shared a view of Planet Hollywood & Travelodge with another balcony located about 2 feet away, can you say \"Awkward\"? All in all, I think I will pass the next time my Grandfather offers me a couple of nights at this place.

Kitchen and bathrooms were fully stocked (dishes, utensils, towels etc...) and in good working order. Valet parking was complimentary and bell service was very prompt. My only complaint is that the smell of smoke came through the air ducts in the master bedroom. If I was more sensitive to the smell it might have been an issue. Overall, I was very impressed. After reading some of the reviews I was not sure what to expect. I would definately stay there again as well as recommend this place to family and friends.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago,IL", "Title": "\u201cYou Can Do Better In Vegas:Trust Me\u201d", "Author": "rx007", "ReviewID": "UR6148908", "Content": "This is a timeshare and exchange thru Interval. Stayed one week Oct 15-22, 2006. If you are exchanging -- there are definately better places to stay. This hotel is outdated and needs a facelift. 1) Make sure to get the highest floor possible. Facing the strip is not such a good thing at this place. If you face North directly below you is the garbage dump area. Garbage pickup is done daily between 6:45-7:15AM -- They produce the loudest clunking sounds that it wakes you up, and if you want to sleep late -- forget it ! We mentioned this to their management team -- they didn't seem to care. 2) You cannot actively control your own a/c unit from your thermostat. You have to call down to maintenance if you want your air turned on -- then they turn it off at their leisure. I had to call 4 times in a 4 hour time period to keep getting them to turn it on. 3) It is a timeshare -- but they are not as pushy as some other timeshare resorts. They will give you a 90 minute presentation if you want for a free show or dinner. They also take you to the new Marriot Grand Chateau being built directly behind them. They have completed one tower and are building four. I would recommend trying to exchange to the Marriot Grand Chateau -- they at least have much nicer facilities and are up with the times. 4) The pool is on the top floor (23rd). It is small and has a wall around the top, so you can't see much of the strip or anything for that matter. The water is always pretty chilly and is only about 3 feet deep. The hot tub is ok though. 5) You need your room key to get anywhere on the elevator, so be sure to have it with you at all times. 6) The mini-mart is ok at best, no alcoholic beverages though -- and that is there downfall there. 7) The fitness area is in a totally different area-- not even in the same building. It is located in the Hawaiian Market Place directly in front of Polo Towers. 8) If you need a cab -- call well in advance -- cab drivers don't like to come to Polo Towers if they don't have to. 9) The kids pool area is located on the North Side directly next to the garbage dump area -- it is very shady there so the water is pretty cold there all the time. I personally think that there are other places in Vegas to exchange to, that are much nicer and much more comfortable than Polo.

Overall our experience is good and I don't think there is a lot more they could do to 'fix' any of the items we weren't ecstatic about. We stayed in the 'newer' Villa section which has received better reviews. I've over heard other guests mention that some of the rooms on the Suite side are newly remodeled, hopefully fixing some of the complaints elswhere. We stayed in room 7304, which I personally wouldn't recommend for two reasons - it is lower to the ground and the street noise at night reverberates between the two towers, and kept waking up 3/5ths of our party (two of us were smart enough to take Lunesta). The front desk is well aware of this problem and hands out ear plugs...thoughtful touch, but a sign they realize there is a problem. It was worse on weekend nights - the sound is from the Hawaiian Marketplace where some band or piped in music went all night long. (my wife said it was still going at 5am). The second reason to get a different room is the view - my dad at first was offered a room on the 23rd floor. It was a handicapped room which I think is why he turned it down. They beat us here from the airport otherwise I would have grabbed that room right away. The view is better, plus being a tall person I've found handicapped rooms are usually larger in size than regular rooms. Which brings me to my only real complaint - these rooms, while nicely decorated, furnished, and clean, are the smallest timeshare suites we've had, comparing with resorts in Orlando, Aruba, Cancun, southern California, New Orleans, and I'm forgetting a few. The bedroom is 'tight' with less than 2 feet between the foot of the bed and the TV dresser cabinet. The closets are small. The main living room is cramped, albeit with nice furniture and big 46\" flat screen tv with DVD/VCR and a stereo. When the Murphy bed is down, you have to pile all the moveable furniture in the 'dining area'. In the 2nd bedroom, it is also small with no room for anything once the Murphy bed is down. With it up, it is a nice sitting room. That being said, realizing we have a 2 bedroom unit with a full and half kitchen in Vegas for an exchange that only cost $149 for the week...I'd stay here again. Location is good - a 5 minute walk to Aladdin, 10-15 minutes to MGM, 10-15 to Monte Carlo. The kids water park area is closed (seasonal) but our 2 year would love it. We also booked another room here for the same time for my wife's employees (all in town for a convention) so the bargain is even better and they've all enjoyed the room much more than a hotel room. The bathrooms are very nice, equipped with double vanities in the master (one vanity bathrooms always get too crowded on vacation, to us anyway). There are coin operated washer/dryers on several floors (another 'downer' since most places have them included in rooms). The front desk staff and housekeeping are excellent. Any request we had was attended to promptly (more blankets, suggesting ear plugs, directions, etc.) and they were friendly and eager to help. They also offer a couple of show tickets if you take a 90 min tour of the Marriott Grand Chateau property next door.

It's old. It's dirty. It's not well taken care of. (My pictures will tell the story.) I just left Las Vegas on the 11th of September, 2006 after a two day stay on the 15th floor of the Polo Towers. Forget the fact that I couldn't get into a unit until 5:00 p.m. when check-in time is at 3:00. When I finally got a room, I was appalled at it's condition. The windows looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years. There were tains on the carpet and on the sofa (I hope it was coffee). There was rust and mold buildup around the caulk and tile in the bathtub. The walls couldn't have seen paint or even a sponge in a very long time. There was dirt and grime in the corners and along the baseboards...I could go on and on. (Again, see the pictures). It was terrible. I knew when I went that I wasn't going to get a five-star resort but I was expecting something along the lines of a three to four star hotel. What I found was a Motel 6 at best. It would be great for a group of college kids who go to Vegas and spend very little time in their room and who have no real discerning standards - whose goal is to pack a lot of people into a reoom and spend as little as possible on accomodations in order to have more money for beer. Honestly, if you don't have to have a condo, for the same money, choose one of the hotels. Even Circus Circus or the Imperial Palace would beat this place. The building is surrounded on all four sides by either a driveway or an alley. The new children's pool area was built on the north end of the building. To access this area, you have to walk through a loading dock driveway and smell the buildings dumpsters. (I have a phoo of this as well.) The smell was very unpleasent to say the least. I heard that there was a bar near the top of the building offering great views of the strip. It's been closed. The rooftop pool does not offer any great views because the walls are too high. I felt that exposure the the pool water for more than about five minutes was to risk hypothermia. I'm not trying to be unfair here. I have often come to tripadvisor to research hotels but have never written a review before. I felt strongly enough about The Polo Towers that I wanted to warn other potential renters to think otherwise. If you do go, ask for a room on the east side of the building - away from the strip. There is a complex on the west side of the building with an outdoor theater/stage where bands play until midnight on the weekends.

About an hour later, while we were in our room, the door opened and another family came walking in, they had a key. The front desk said they made a mistake. (pretty big mistake if you ask me. What if we were not there, would our money still be there) No one ever told us about the after hours club that is located in the hotel parking lot. It opens at 4 am and the music sounds like its coming from our living room. The club is opened thursday friday and saturday. We have a small infant and went on vacation alone to get some rest. Well we got no sleep on these nights. And when you call the front desk to complain they say, sorry we know but there is nothing we can do. I understand that, but you would think someone would have wrote this in their reviews and no one did.. The front desk, bell hop and the entertainment desk acted as if we were bothering them anytime we asked a question. I tried to get tickets to a show, however the 3 girls behind the counter who were doing absolutly nothing but socializing could not find the time to help us. Forget about getting a cab from here because none of them want to be inconvenienced by traveling through the out of the way parking lot. (thats what the cab driver told us and the manager of the towers) The pool upstairs on the roof is clean but very small and only 3 feet. There is no where to get a drink or snack.

The last time we visited was in June of 2004. We ended up selling our timeshare in 2005 because we were not able to use it enough to justify the high yearly maintenance fees. I highly recommend if you are looking to purchase a timeshare, any timeshare, that you never ever buy straight from the developer. Only buy a timeshare on the secondary market. Very few people ever get their moneys worth if they pay the retail price. That said, Polo Towers is a pretty nice place, I would say about the equivalent of a 3 star hotel. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, and having the refrigerator and kitchen facilities is very nice. No other hotel I have stayed at in Vegas had a refrigerator. If you are going to stay in a two bedroom unit, it is supposed to be able to sleep 6 people. However, we heard from our friends that stayed with us that the fold-out couch was very uncomfortable, so that is probably best left for kids or young adults. The king bed in the main bedroom was comfortable and definately not too hard. If you are staying in one of the studios, we saw at least 2 different kinds of beds. If you get a studio with a regular bed that will be the most comfortable. If you get a studio with the pull down bed that turns into a couch, that bed was much less comfortable. The lobby was clean and well decorated, but is pretty small. Be aware that the only onsite store is a small gift shop that has nothing but a few snacks and some souvenirs and closes early. The pool is a big negative for this hotel, it's on the roof, is very small, has only about 20 loungers and has little shade. The pool landscaping is practically non-existant, i.e. no plants, palm trees, waterfalls, etc. that seem to be a standard at most strip hotels. If you want to lounge by a decent pool, definatly do not come to Polo Towers. In 2002, we paid a special assessment fee that they were collecting in order to build a 2nd pool area that would be larger and more family oriented, leaving the roof pool for adults only. However, during our visit in June of 2004, we did not see any sign that any construction had begun on this pool. There is no on-site restaurant, room service or casino. However, next door there is a small strip mall with an indoor food court served by several fast food style booths. I think you can get food delivered from outside restaurants, but not sure how this works. This hotel is on the strip in between the MGM Grand and the Aladdin. It is about a half block set back from Las Vegas Blvd, so there is a bit of a walk to get to the street. It is about a 10 minute brisk walk to the Aladdin or Monte Carlo and even further to the MGM Grand so if you or someone you are traveling with has mobility problems or is sensitive to the heat(if you visit during summer), you don't want to stay here. Additionally, practically the entire walk to the surrounding casinos you will be approached by numerous street vendors selling tours, timeshares, etc. Also, there will be numerous people trying to push flyers into your hands. If you don't want to walk through all this just to get to the nearest casino, don't stay here. Overall, I might recommend this place if you can get a cheap rate. It is clean, comfortable, centrally located to the strip and safe. The downsides are the lack of on-site amenities and the walking distance to get to any of the big casinos. One of the reasons that we sold our unit is because we didn't want to stay here any more when we came to Vegas. There are so many better hotels on the strip and the casinos just offer so many more amenities.

We had a great time. It's easy to keep kids busy during the day hours. Lucky for us! We didn't have to spend a lot of time in our room. We traded into a two bedroom on the 15th floor from our home resort in Orlando-(major difference in 5 Star ratings) The carpets were torn, cheap furniture and kitchen fixtures, stained towels in bathrooms, and broken toilets. How can this be rated a 5 Star? All three TV's were 13 or 14 inch! There is a pool on the roof top, that is only 3 feet deep! Kids are only allowed there until 5 pm then if they are under the age of 14 they must go to the kids pool and \"splash park\" located on the second floor. Again, this is a joke. It's only for toddlers. Access to the hotel lobby and shuttle service is off the street, down an alley. Yes, it is well lit, but it is beside an open parking lot and the alley is deserted when you return to the hotel after dark. What were they thinking??? There should be covered walkway from the street. The lounge was adequate. Also, no internet access in the resort. Las Vegas was GREAT! the location was GREAT (we could actually see the fountains at the Bellagio from the balcony) but Polo Towers has alot of upgrading to do. There is a lot of police presence on the Strip, but I felt very safe walking at night. The shops are great, because there is something for every price range, the buffets are great for families, and cabs are easy to catch. The monorails and trams are great. The Venetian is a must, the fountains at Bellagio are a must and the Rainforest cafe at MGM is great for kids.", "Date": "August 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, CO.", "Title": "\u201cSneaky Salesmen\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3573559", "Content": "My husband and I went to Las Vegas. We also got pitched with free show tickets if we attend a \"no pressure\" presentation. We agreed. We walked through the beautiful hotel eager to hear the \"Affordable Prices\". Once we heard how much they needed down and how much they wanted a month for our 1 week of vacation time, we refused. The sneaky salesmen sent us to \"get our tickets\", this time we also got pitched to with \"come back for a one week stay to see how you like it and all the money you pay towards the vacation would count towards the down payment if you decide to buy\". The sales pitch sounded awesome. We were to put $295 down and pay $100 a month for 10 months and in turn we would receive 2 vacations. One 8 day 7 night trip to Polo Towers and another 4 day 3 night to our choice. The vacations had to be used in a 2 years. We assumed that would be absolutly no problem. We gave our card to the gentleman for the down payment and he came back and said \"You have over $3000.00 in your account, why did you say you couldn't afford the offer. I was appalled and that should have been my first hint at what kind of business techniques these people had. Over the next ten months we were paying off our vacation and yes a few months it was late. Well the last month fell in the middle of December and having three girls EVERY payment that month was late. Well because they had already received all of our payments they decided to enforce a \"late payment means forfeiting of all monies and the contract is void rule\". How convienient that they only stated this after receiving almost all the money. I was livid!!! I called to take care of this for once. They said they cannot refund the money but they would give me my vacation (as a favor to me). When I asked about the other one they said you had 18 months to fulfill both meaning 8 months left to try and arrange for both vacations HOW IMPOSSIBLE IS THAT!! I will get some of my money's worth by taking one vacation.

Polo Towers is a good place to stay and our two bedroom suite was ample in size, very comfortable and had an amazing view of the Strip (and two balconies). Great location. We only paid a $40/day upgrade for the two bedroom which was fantastic . On to the review: Rooms: spacious, comfortable beds, furniture, not my style, by in great condition and ample. Bathrooms: spacious, big stand up showers, good water pressure. Showerheads might be a little low for guys/gals over 5' 8\". Plenty of towels delivered each day. Housekeeping: We didn't have housekeeping b/c we were utilizing the time share. However we needed extra blankets and they were there within minutes of the call. Every morning we got a wake up call and fresh towels and wash cloths. Kitchen: amazing to have a full size fridge and cabinets. A little light on the dishes/glasses and other kitchen items. One hand towel. Ice maker worked great. Staff: No problems except for one timeshare guy who, after we had all been handed off by the sales guy/tour guide (thanks Josh, no pressure, good info, got me thinking) gave us the final hard sell before we got the free txt to the Rat Pack Tribute (good show at the Greek Aisle, which used to be the Debbie Reynolds, CHEESY CHEESY hotel and casino. But remarkable show, RECOMMEND). Concierge at Polo Towers helpful, bartendar in the Hush Lounge wonderful. Rooftop Pool: Eh. Double Eh. The Day we arrived it was nearly 80 degrees and we were looking forward to lounging around the pool and having some fruity cocktails. Were we in for a shock. The pool (which is only 3 feet deep but was refreshing) was packed with people including several families with babies and small children. Exactly what we came to Vegas to get away from. Signs say no food or beverages in the area of the pool and there were limited numbers of loungers. Everything was clean and there were lots of towels. I didn't see a single staffer or employee in the area. Overall good rating. There is no restaurant in the hotel and no rooom service, but an outside menu for deliveries. A convenience store on-site for snacks etc., and a short walk to corner shops for necessities. Would stay there again if my friend got her timeshare -- would not pay what would probably be over $300-$325 a night for the 2 bedroom suite.

Now, on top of this you have a yearly fee for (maintenance, taxes, staff, etc) This fee varies depending on the style (studio $595 / 1 bedroom $895) and is paid every year by you... So, using the information that I was given this is how it breaks down (with the \"discount\" they gave me to try to make me buy): 1 bedroom $21,000 with yearly fees of $895 (note: this does not include the other fees to be able to trade your share with others or to participate actively with their other timeshare properties) So, let's assume you will vacation for the next 10 years and want to do it in Las Vegas... 21,000 + (8950 = 895*10) = 29,950 for 10 years 2,950 each year or 421.43 each day for seven days Now, the room is nice and the location is good BUT 421.43 is very high to be locked into for a week in Vegas that you have to bid for... Even at 20 years the yearly/day cost is still high at $1945/$277 year/day... Not to mention the fact of being tied to a bidding system. Now, if you just KNOW when you will be in Vegas to vacation and can buy that week then this might be worth your time, otherwise, just book a good hotel or buy property... Especially since you can't receive any hard information directly from them and if you ask to review some then they will \"allow\" you to do so but only on site at the time of your \"tour\" I don't know about you but if I can't review a major purchase overnight and I'm denied any written documentation but only asked to \"trust\" some total stranger that he or she will act in my best interest---???
