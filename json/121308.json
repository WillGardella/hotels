Rooms were comfortable. The kitchen with refrigerator and microwave was soooo convenient, even if you don't want to cook a meal, it is wonderful to have the fridge to bring back meal leftovers, stash some cold beverages or keep milk for breakfast cereal or yougurt for a snack. The staff was helpful and efficient. The location right across the street from the hospital is a huge plus if you have the misfortune to be in town for family medical reasons. Restaurants, grocery stores, shopping mall are all close by. The Maryland Parkway bus line runs directly to/from the airport with stops a short walk away, within the same block as the hotel. Limited desk hours (7am to 11pm) and not having maid service every day make sense for a property catering mainly to long term stays. If you can get past that, this is a great bargain choice for shorter stays, too. It might be a bit cramped if you are really staying for weeks and have more than one person living here.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI LOVED IT AND WILL GO BACK!

I'm not going to give it 1 star and say it's horrible, or 5 and say it's the best, just an honest review of my time here. I'll go in order of the categories listed. Value is pretty good. I was initially placed here by a travel deal website for a week and payed about 30 dollars a night for their \"deluxe\" room. After that week I moved to a smaller room for about 700 a month. You get tv with about 30 channels, an ac/heater, and wifi for a one time 5$ charge. Be forewarned with the so called \"hi-speed wifi,\" it's more like bad dial-up. You're not aloud to watch video or music, so that means no youtube, hulu, last.fm, or even news video clips. This is most of my internet usage so that was a major disappointment. It's also an unsecured wifi connection so I wouldn't recommend sending or receiving any sensitive emails, purchasing anything online, and make sure you change any passwords used once you get back home. The rooms felt small but not cramped. The first room, which was their bigger \"deluxe,\" came with a king sized bed and couch area. I then moved to the smaller room size with a queen sized bed and lounge seat instead of couch. Both sized rooms have an open style floor plan with lots of storage space. They both come with a full kitchen that includes a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, stove-top burners, sink, dishes for 2, and a full size fridge. The beds seem comfortable enough but nothing special. One downside is the noise: with thin walls, loud slamming doors, and pets aloud you may hear barking at all hours (which has been the case the last week). The location is below average. You're miles from the strip so it's either 7$ (24 hour bus pass) for about an hour long bus ride or about 20$ each direction for a 20 minute cab ride. It's right next to a major hospital and mall but about a mile from major grocery stores. Cleanliness is definitely it's weakest point. When you first walk in it looks pretty nice. Then I looked behind the bed/nightstand and found used cue tips, candy wrappers, and years worth of dirt. There's also a slight smell that wont go away no matter now much I clean. The carpets are dark and look clean at first, but within minutes of walking around your white socks with be brown. I vacuum weekly, but the carpet really needs to be steam cleaned, which I assume also hasn't been done in years. The overhead vent in the bathroom is clogged with dust but that's pretty standard for any budget hotel. Overall everything else was in pretty good condition, just don't look behind the scenes, ignorance is bliss. Service is by far the best thing of this hotel. Almost all my experiences with the staff have been friendly and helpful. They allow you to change out fresh sheets and towels every week, although there is no cleaning included unless you pay about 100$ a month for weekly service. There's an in house laundry mat that costs 3$ a load. There's also a small convenience closet next to the front desk that has coffee, drinks, snacks, and toiletries for decent prices. Overall, it's been an ok experience. I'd recommend the Homestead to someone that wants a cheap hotel and doesn't care much about cleanliness or location. If you plan on getting a rental car, and just need a cheap place to sleep and eat, this is a good choice. If you have young children or are bringing your special someone I wouldn't stay here.
