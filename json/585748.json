Totally separated from the outside world by the high walls and heavy steel gates around the small parking lot, and the only hallway which leads to the mansion from the hotel is monitored by well mannered staff 24/7. The courtyard with sky-high glass top ceiling was absolutely serene with lush plants, and the swiming pool was meticulous. Everything about the masion was extraordinary but what impressed me the most was water pressure in the shower room. Water pressure was so forceful, it did not take me more than 10 seconds to shampoo my hair. You may think I am joking. Ask me if I was not impressed by BVLGARI brand amenities in the bathroom. No, it did not impress me. Ask me if I was not impressed by a bottle of 1996 Opus 1 as a departure gift. No, it did not impress me. By the way, MGM's Fiamma Italian restaurant wine list listed a bottle of 1996 Opus 1 for over $900, if I remember correctly.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BOONIES", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST OF THE BEST\u201d", "Author": "KIDSWILLTRAVEL", "ReviewID": "UR67819385", "Content": "If you have the means, or more likely the casino credit line, do not miss an opportunity to stay here. The entire place is so serene you won't even think you are in the MGM at all or even in Las Vegas for that matter. There is absolutely no hustle and bustle, you may not even see another guest. The atrium is beautiful and especially so at night with the trees lit up with clear lights. The rooms are incredible. We usually stay in a 5000 square foot villa with 2 bedrooms and indoor pool. Our kids love it. Room services are all 5 star including their immaculate housekeeping. Anything goes here, whatever you ask for, they will get you. Concierge is unbelievably accommodating. Butlers are great, they get the kids video games, snacks, send out for groceries if you want something specific. I just can't say enough about this place. Most people will never even know that it exists. The Sklylofts upstairs at MGM are nice, but if you really want sheer excellence go to the Mansion.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTyrone Power\u201d", "Author": "CatherineK2", "ReviewID": "UR54843129", "Content": "Sleeping next to Tyrone Power's picture was a dream come true.

Robin Williams was staying next door, so I guess that details the level of hotel this place is supposed to be. He was very nice to everyone and smiled a lot, but we never bothered him out of respect, though I badly wanted to ask for a picture with him :) - The bathroom(s) in this place are as big as some NYC apartments, and is just way over-the-top. Steam comes out of the showers and water comes from all angles.. This must be how Saudi princes shower every day. - There is a private bar with 24 hour bartender with an earpiece so that he \"remembers\" your name and favorite drink. - There are real Roy Lichtenstein lithographs hanging on the walls! Jeez, what if someone steals one??? (I'm not suggesting this but still...) - Your hot tub next to the bedroom can seat about 24 people. Literally looks like a small pool. - The TV rises out of a wooden cabinet and the remote control is in a small picture frame (my favorite part). - A small army of maids comes in every day to stock your fridge, and basically cater to your every whim. - We went clubbing on the strip (of course we did) and limos or phantoms will take you wherever you want to go. There's also an office outside with staff to make your club arrangements for you so you don't have to wait in line (there were long lines outside the more popular clubs).. - This place makes me want to be a high roller... ah, maybe in another life.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Desert, California", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST!
