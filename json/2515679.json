The front desk person tried to get my into another hotel and found a room at a Holiday Inn. However, the front desk clerk at this Hampton and the one at the Holiday Inn did NOT know how to make the transaction!!!!??? So I was told to wait for the hotel manager at the Hampton Inn who they could not locate. So I got on the phone with Hilton and a customer service rep was able to get me into another Hampton in the area. It is important to note that I was told that ALL Hilton Hotels and affiliates were booked. Well apparently that was not true for there were rooms available at the Hampton in Speedway in Las Vegas per Hilton Customer Service. I have made a formal complaint with Hilton regarding this issue. The manager of the Hampton Hotel Red Rock did finally show up and gave me a free night at the other Hampton. No apology however. Id recommend to Hilton to changer their staff at the Hampton Inn Red Rock and rectify the situation as soon as possible. In the meantime, id avoid this hotel and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vista, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery good Hampton Inn\u201d", "Author": "PopTopBob", "ReviewID": "UR126784371", "Content": "Stayed in a king room and not a suite and was surprised that there was no refigerator or microwave but at least plenty of ice for our cooler.

We are both Hilton Honors members and we used our points to book this stay. The location was nice as it's very close to the 215 loop and that makes greeting around Vegas much easier. Check in was fine we went to our room. It was a Jr Suite I guess because it had a wet bar area in the entrance with sink, microwave and mini fridge. There was the standard in-room single serve coffee maker. Then the rest of the room was huge with a seating area with a couch and coffee table, a very large work desk and a king size bed. It was nice to have so much room. The dressing area with the sink was nice and clean with the closet with full length mirrors. The tub/toilet room was clean and everything worked fine. They also gave us a room all the way in the back of the building. It was quiet and easy to get to from the back door and parking lot. So we were very pleased with the room. Now, there were some things that need some attention. My wife and I are both allergic to goose down. As soon as we got to the room, I checked to see if there were some extra pillows in the top of the closet. Most hotels will have a couple of foam pillows up there for the people like us that can't sleep with the way too soft goose down. No extra pillows so I call the front desk to ask about getting some. The desk clerk says, um no, we don't have any foam pillows and no one has ever asked for them before. Really? Then she says \"there's a Walmart across the street, you could go buy some pillows I guess\". So that's what we ended up having to do. And lastly, I have to agree with a previous reviewer, the complimentary breakfast is really horrible. Muffins and bread that was hard and had to be days old. The \"omelet\" was something from outer space. So just just had coffee and we went out to eat.

First, when checking in, the room was 57 degrees F. It was inhospitable at that temperature; apparently the thermostat had been set to off, and the weather was really cold, hence the room temperature. Additional pro's and cons: Pros: * Free wireless access * Widescreen TV * Free hot breakfast provided downstairs - with belgian waffles included * They were very hospitable in offering a late check-out when we asked. Cons: * Shower only worked in mega massage mode - too hard to even shower in, much less wash my hair. Tried many times to adjust the Waterpik showerhead, to no avail * Only decaf coffee was left for the coffee maker; had to call the front desk to get non-decaf. * Beds are only sort-of comfortable - not soft enough for my liking, and with scratchy sheets, and what seemed like fake stuffing pillows * Towels were rather threadbare and not pristinely white. They should change their laundry service. * Breakfast was lackluster - \"omelets\" that were pre-prepared, and resembled what you might get on a plane; oatmeal that had clearly been prepared hours before; maple sausage that was less than appealing; yoplait yogurts (but none were sugar-free); muffins that were very dry; fruit salad with oranges, grapes and melon, and a few other things. We didn't have the waffles, although in the past, they have been quite good (make them yourself). All in all, the breakfast wasn't that appealing. Bottom line - the hotel was very empty; maybe it does better with more guests. I probably won't stay here again (you would think being as empty as the hotel was, they would offer a free upgrade to a room with a mini refrigerator to a good Hilton Honors guest).

The beds are super comfortable and it was very quiet. My only complaint would have been the breakfast. The hotel doesn't appear to have a kitchen or restaurant and providing a \"hot\" breakfast means food prepared elsewhere. We just stuck to the bagels and a yogurt, which is ok for us, but I think the hotel should stick with a continental breakfast and not try to do too much. The eggs and sausages looked inedible. For us, quality is much more important than quantity and we're not a fan of sweet muffins, danishes, and other pastries for breakfast.

When I called to ask for the exit, the gentleman put me on hold for ten minutes trying to get me directions.

The first problem we encountered was trying to find it. We exited Flamingo Rd. and we were suppose to turn left on Grand Canyon. We entirely missed it because it is a very small sign and there is no indicator showing that the Hampton is there. Use the Las Vegas Athletic Club as your guide because it's right next to it. The second problem we encountered was attempting to use the pool at 3:00 p.m. we walked right by the front desk and went out to the pool to be turned away because the deck was being power washed. We were told to come back in 30 minutes, it took more than 40 minutes. Other than those two incidents we enjoyed our stay. The room was very spacious, the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was very good.

It's almost brand new (as of June 2008), so everything looks very nice and is well-kept. If they keep it that way, there's no other place we'd ever stay in Vegas. Easily the best Hampton Inn room we've had. Well designed, clean, quiet. The best part about the room is they designed it to where there is a 3/4 wall between the bed and the bathroom and front door. So even if there were hallway noise (which, thankfully, there wasn't during our stay), I think it would be less of an issue. But, speaking of noise, there is a lot of building going on in Summerlin, including a bit lot to the west of the hotel. The workers were out before 8 a.m. on our second morning, which wasn't a problem for us, but I could see it annoying others. The free business center had two computers and two printers. (As is Hampton tradition, one printer didn't work correctly. But the other did, so no worries.) The exercise room was as modern as any I've seen at high-priced properties. Television monitors were built into each machine. The breakfast layout was typical Hampton. Nothing more, nothing less. Summerlin is a suburb and it feels like a suburb. But I didn't mind that after a day on the Strip. Getting to and from the Strip wasn't a problem at all. I'm guessing it was about a 7 or so mile drive each way, with traffic flowing well each time we made the journey.

The first night was in a room with an exceptionally comfortable king sized bed with fluffy duvet and plenty of pillows to choose from. The room had a big screen TV, writing desk and great reading lamps, which I much appreciated. The bathroom was spacious and well appointed. It had a shower stall with sliding doors (no tub, which was fine with me), free standing vanity, plenty of towels, several towel/clothing hooks, nice amenities and a night light, which I always find helpful when staying in an unfamiliar place. This room was spotlessly clean, quiet , comfortable and everything I needed to recover from a series of international flights from SE Asia. The second stay was for three nights in a double room, which had two queen sized beds, a bathroom with shower and tub. The beds, although smaller, had the same comfortable mattresses, spotless bedding and several pillows. This room wasn't as thoroughly clean as the first (different housekeeper perhaps?) but was very comfortable just the same. The hotel is close to some shops, yet in a quiet area away from the chaos of Las Vegas. During the second stay, the hotel was experiencing some sewage back-up issues. The lobby, business center and most of the first floor smelled terrible for two days, but the hotel staff was aware of the problem and was trying to correct it. The breakfast was good and included in the rate (yogurt, bagels, toast, waffles, fruit, etc). The hotel offers tea and coffee throughout the day, which I thought was a nice touch.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place away from the Strip!\u201d", "Author": "IBeCookin", "ReviewID": "UR10601973", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this brand new Hampton for a quick trip to visit our son in Summerlin.

It has a little \"convenience shop\" in the lobby to get sodas, popcorn, ice cream or toiletries although those items are quite a bit more pricey than in a store.
