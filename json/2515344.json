There was construction going on around the hotel and it made getting in and out a little inconvenient but it wasn't too bad. Parking on the main level was a mess, we opted to park in the parking garage underneath which was much better. Once we got to our room we were extremely surprised to see how small the room was. Barely enough room for the two beds, no room for our kids to really move around. Pillows were really small but got the job done I suppose. Walls were a little thin. Bathroom was pretty decent, great water pressure and kept temperature. The breakfast wasn't too bad but they ran out of food often and it took a while to refill. I stood in line waiting for a refill for the waffle mix and after over 5 minutes I just gave up and settled on my toast and eggs. Plenty of extra seating in a room around the corner from the breakfast area. The man in charge was very friendly and helpful. Always walking around asking if everyone was doing ok or if they needed anything. We chose this hotel for 2 reasons. Walking distance to main attractions and the indoor pool. Was seriously disappointed in the pool. It was such a small space and hardly any seating. My husband took our boys down once in the 3 nights we were there and it was very crowded. They had fun so that's really all that matters, but I wasn't able to sit and watch because people were using all the chairs to drape their towels and personal belongings on. Even if I had been able to sit and watch I most likely would have gotten soaked since a splash from any side of the pool soaked all sides. On our next trip to Seattle we will most likely try to get something better for our money.

I got to know my new friends on a personal basis and there are far too many to mention here. Many staff went above and beyond in meeting my needs. Now for the location, the only word being ideal for so many things. Surrounding neighborhoods are safe and surprisingly artistic. Daily Walks, or in my case wheeling in a wheelchair, were very enjoyable. People need to be aware that while the shuttle is there for your convenience, it is also important to know that the drivers have cruise ship obligations amongst others, so it is necessary to always be prepared to take a cab. They can almost always accommodate you with at least a days notice. Rooms were exceptionally comfortable and if anything was lacking, it was only a friendly phone call away. I would have preferred an ice machine on every floor, but this was only because I was unable to use the stairs and had to wait for a sometimes busy elevator. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff...all of whom should be commended, maybe in the form of a raise :).

Our room and bathroom were very basic, but VERY clean. The room did have a cleaning solution odor, which bothered me a little. I do have asthma and was worried it would be triggered by the smell. However, we ran the fan so it drew in outdoor air, and it turned out to be just fine. I also left a note for housekeeping to please not use any deodorizing sprays for day 2. The odor decreased significantly. Breakfast was typically 2-3 star hotel breakfast. Nothing to write home about, but adequate to start your day. We were most grateful for the free parking. We thought the location was perfect. We ate at several local restaurants that were frequented by the locals. It was not a far walk to downtown. We liked that it was much quieter around than the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again.

The hotel building itself was poorly built - the bathroom tile floor was freezing cold (the second floor sits over the parking area - my guess is no insulation in the floor) and the halls and the meeting room were very cold and drafty at times. The area of the city the hotel is in is just OK - a little sketchy but a quick walk to great restaurants and Seattle Center. PROS: We realized we made an error in our reservation and were moved to a different room already reserved for us by the conference. The manager was very friendly and helpful and canceled our old reservation no charge, no problem even though we had already checked in several hours earlier. The new room was in a newly renovated part of the hotel that was tastefully decorated and the room itself was big and clean with a refrigerator and microwave.

The plentiful breakfast buffet (including the obligatory waffles) had hot food that was hot and cold food that was cold and furthermore it was tended by smiling, cheerful people. The pool and hot tub are exceptional in every way. I make it a point not to stay in a hotel that does not offer these amenities and so have many to compare these with. The pool is free form concrete with a terrific shallow end for little people and an 8.5 foot deep end for the swimmers. The water temperature was warmer than one might expect but given the raw, rainy outdoors, it was lovely to bask in. The hot tub, up six or seven steps (with a railing), was hot and the jets well placed. Both pool and tub were spotlessly clean every time I visited AND the facility is open from 6 am to 12 pm. There is a fitness room if you are inclined that way. My elderly mother (who uses a walker to get around) and I stayed here for six nights. It was a pleasure. At the time of our stay, the elevators were undergoing refurbishment which made for some inconvenience but not enough to make a serious difference to anything. The lobby boasts a business center, free coffee, 24 hour front desk, comfortable couches and a fireplace - with fire! One more fascinating thing: On the bottom of the pool, in the shallow end, there is a painting on ceramic tiles. It is signed by \"Klee Wyn\" and I can't find out anything about it. Perhaps it was put there for the making of the movie? It's pretty, depicting a mermaid and a young man in a bathing suit with fish and sea plants around.

We were thrilled with the view of the Space Needle from our room. We didn't even care that the carpet was seriously stained--the rest of the room was fine. However, my 14-year-old daughter started the trip with beautiful, shiny long blond hair. After just 25 minutes in the pool, her hair was dyed bright green. When she came in I thought it was a joke. Panicked, she jumped into the shower and washed it over and over. She dried it and went to bed--very late--with dull green hair and tears. Now, we're not picky people, and I expect a swimmer who is, let's say, on a team, could get green hair over time. But not after 25 minutes, and not that green. My daughter has been in countless pools, often for hours, and never once has had her hair dyed. I went to the desk in the morning tired and irked that our night was taken over by the dyed hair fiasco. The receptionist said, yes her hair is green, all right. Her manager (via phone) refused to compensate us in any way, but offered handouts about blonds and chlorine. I told them I didn't want their handouts and that there was another child with bright green hair at breakfast, which meant their pool chemicals were off. The staff apologized--which to me means you then make it right by at least paying for the cost of repairing what you damaged--ie enough for a cut and dye job if nec. or a coupon for a free night's stay--something. Every time I looked at her hair that weekend, I was angry at the hotel for not taking responsibility. Back home, people asked us about the green hair and were, every single one, amazed that the hotel did nothing to compensate us. Luckily, the green mostly faded after about 2 weeks of frequent washing. But now, 3 weeks later, I can still see the green hue. I have a photo of my green-haired daughter standing next to the Quality Inn sign, but she'd rather not post it here. We won't be going to any Quality Inns anymore. Ever.

I searched on Trip Advisor before I chose here and I am glad I did!! The rates inside of Downtown Seattle were 2-3X as much as this place PLUS they all charged extra for parking & WiFi and so we figured hey, let's pay a little less for the Quality Inn and just walk everywhere. And that is what we did. We stayed mid-week for 3 nights. The $69 rate was very reasonable. The WI-FI and parking are free!! It looks as if there is not enough parking but there really is; they have another \"secret\" secure gated parking area underneath the hotel. You have to go around to Thomas Street to get to it. I felt very safe leaving my car there for 3 days. There is an elevator in the \"secret\" parking area that goes straight up to the hotel. Yes, the elevators are slow but they get you to where you have to go. Some people complained about the noise but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. The front part of the hotel faces a busy street but when you are inside you don't even hear it. The back part faces another hotel and is very quiet. Once in a while you can hear people walking in the hallway but that is only if they are chattering away and have big mouths. The room walls are about the same. If you are a light sleeper like me just bring earplugs and you won't hear a thing. The rooms aren't huge but they are very cozy and have a Fridge, Micro, Coffee. Some of the rooms have a view of the Space Needle. The bathrooms are very clean. The shower is hot with excellent water pressure. The beds are very comfy. I found no bugs, trash, weird odors, etc...in the room. It was very clean and tidy and housekeeping was great about keeping everything stocked for us. (I did tip them daily.) The indoor pool and spa are heated. The pool area is very clean. There are towels for you in the pool area. The only gripe I could say about the pool/spa area is the chlorine fumes but it isn't too bad. The FREE breakfast was great but the line fills up FAST so if you get down there anytime past 7, expect to wait. The good part is that everything is cooked fresh and you don't leave hungry. The breakfast crew does their best to bus tables, keep the counters clean, and serve everyone but when they are busy they can get behind on table cleaning. (It isn't their fault.) I made sure to clean up my table after I was finished so the next guy had a place to sit and eat. (I also tipped these guys daily. They worked their butts off!!) The hotel staff I encountered were very helpful from day one. They helped me find everything on the downtown maps, showed me which way to walk, which areas to avoid, etc... Hubby and I had a late night the last night we were in town and so I asked for a late check out and they let me stay until 2 PM!! ( THANK YOU GUYS!! ) Everything around the hotel you can either walk or ride the bus to. If you walk just a few blocks down it puts you into the \"Free Bus Zone\" and then you can just hop from bus to bus touring the city. We did this when going to Chinatown, Union Station, Pikes Market, Waterfront piers & shopping, etc... We walked to the Space Needle and caught the monorail ($2 each way) into downtown, walked around, had a nice dinner, then caught the bus back. The next day we walked to the free bus zone and took the bus down to the Ferry Piers, and went on a beautiful Ferry ride over to Bainbridge Island. If you want to see Downtown Seattle a very cheap ($7) and beautiful way, the Ferries are the way to go!! The only thing I would say to avoid is the McDonalds across from the Space Needle. There are a lot of drug addicts & homeless in the vicinity and sometimes they filter into the restaurant asking for $$. One woman strung out on something came in and started screaming and yelling and got violent with the manager for forgetting a pickle on her hamburger. Fortunately when the cops came they all scattered but it was still scary. All in all this place is a very great value for the price. Trust me I did my research! The only thing I would recommend is that if you have 2 people who use laptops is to ask for another chair for your room. Otherwise you will have to \"surf\" from either the bed or sit on the suitcase rack. :)", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOlder building ready for a remodel.\u201d", "Author": "CTMHtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR78418144", "Content": "We went here only because they accepted our dog.

The TV was bad it kept messing up and then to top it off the teams that were in the place was not supervised well because they kept knocking on our door at all hours and running off. And a call to the front desk did not provide results. SO my recommendation for travelers is to AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!! And the review below about the elevators yah I agree.

The room was clean and there was adequate space. We booked a suite that had 1 king size bed in the first room with a small kitchenette and the second bedroom had 2 double beds and a bathroom to the side. This room comes with 2 TVs. The pool was a hit with the kids and the hot tub was clean and hot. They picked us up from the Amtrak station for $15 including 7 trunks. And dropped us at the airport at the end for $30, again with 7 trunks and all our other hand luggage. In the US, it is difficult to find hotels that cater to for 5 people where the parents don't have to room with the children for any price, so, this hotel was great for us. And the price was good too. The hotel front desk staff were great, some of them even helped us figure out which buses to take to visit a few of the further flung locations we wanted to get to. And of course it is only a few blocks to Seattle Center, so one can just walk there. Breakfast was included and while it wasn't a great breakfast (we eat mostly fruit and don't like lots of wheat and starch), the breakfast was similar to that we've had in other hotels in the US. I do think that the rooms at the front of the hotel might be noisier as the hotel is on a busy street, but we had a room facing the back and looking onto the hotel next door. Not a great view, but we slept fine. So if noise will be a problem for you, ask for a room facing the back. We used the kitchenette to make sandwiches and to eat takeout foods from the grocery stores nearby. We don't usually dine out as our younger children are not adventurous eaters, so paying a small fortune to eat in an expensive restaurant where the kids don't like the food doesn't make sense to us. We didn't want to eat McDonalds all week either, so the kitchenette was very handy. It is not a fully equiped kitchen. There is a sink, stove, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a dishwasher, but there are limited pots and pans and only a few plates and bowls. But it was adequate for our needs as I didn't want to cook meals. The hotel was close to two very good grocery stores, one in the Pan Pacific Hotel and a QFC at the bottom Seattle Center on 5th. Both are about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The store in the Pan Pacific Hotel was more expensive, but they had a bigger selection of takeout foods that were relatively healthy. Both stores had lots of fruit and veg including organic foods. I'd stay in this hotel again if I needed to go to Seattle and wanted to stay near the Space Needle or downtown, especially if I was traveling with children or teenagers.

If you want a good deal but without the noise, we suggest that you get an odd-numbered room, as the even numbered rooms are the ones right on the main road. The noise does make sleeping in the morning difficult for some of us, since the morning rush hour traffic begins by around 6:00 am. However, not everyone may be bothered by this. That being said, the room itself was fine. We had 2 double beds and there was enough room for our family of four. It was a good deal for the middle of summer - with tax, just under $100/night. The room was not huge, but unless you are spending the entire day in the hotel room this should not be a problem. The beds were very comfy. Shower gave a good spray. We did not have the time to use it, but the pool looked nice. Good size for the hotel. They have coffee, tea and hot chocolate always available in the lobby. Front desk staff was adequate. Usually had 3 staff on, which was good, as it was busy. Express check out info was completely accurate and checking out was fast. As has been noted, parking can be limited here. Fortunately, it is free, compared to some of the other hotels in the area. We were able to park in the underground parking with no problem. It does help to have a smaller car. We decided to park (arrived around 4:00 pm) and just left the car there and took the bus or walked for the 2 nights that we stayed. For those of you who need wi-fi, while it is free and is available, there does appear to be dead zones where it does not reach. We were not able to connect in our room. Had to walk down the hall before it would connect. The breakfast they offer is great. We thought that there would not be hot food, but on one day they had scrambled eggs and sausages and the next day they had both of those as well as biscuits and gravy. There was also make-your-own waffles, toast, bagels, apples, danishes, mini muffins, yogurt, 3 kinds of cereal, 3 kinds of juice, milk, hot chocolate, coffee and tea.

Obvious confusion resulted in my reservation and cancellation and my reservation was never cancelled. Hotel charged me a $156 no-show charge for a reservation I had cancelled. Hotel management claims their system is failproof. They refuse to refund the no-show charge; however, they offered me a free night's stay to compensate me for my trouble. Why would the hotel offer me a free night's stay rather than refund the no-show charge that they should not have charged me? Obviously they know a mistake on their part was possible if offering some compensation. Hotel has simply responded through my Better Business Bureau complaint that they will not refund the no-show charge, but will provide a free night's stay to me. They will get away with this again, even if a small claims court awards me the reimbursement of the no-show charge. I recommend not staying here, not necessarily because of their mistake (mistakes happen) but because of the unscrupulous business practices of their management and their unwillingness to admit and correct their error.

I'm guessing that this hotel opened its doors back in 1962 when Seattle hosted a World's Fair, hoping to capitalize on fairgoers visiting the city back then. There are two or three other similar hotels nearby built to the same blocky college dorm standards as this one. I've seen references on different websites noting that this hotel was recently renovated, but evidence is sadly lacking. This hotel looks tired and could use a spruce-up. The room was a big disappointment -- two queen beds, a knotty pine dresser, a TV, and little else crammed into a tiny space. There wasn't even a chair in the room to sit on. I'm sure there are monk's cells better furnished than the rooms in this place. The room was so small that the three of us would be tripping over each other if we all tried to move at the same time. The rooms either overlook Aurora Ave. (the hotel is not set back from the street) or the back alley and the adjacent Travelodge. Aurora Ave. is a busy major thoroughfare that carries a lot of traffic (and the accompanying noise) into downtown Seattle in the morning rush hours. The rooms in the back don't get the traffic noise, but you have to contend with sound of garbage trucks emptying the dumpsters early in the morning. A lot of construction is currently going on in this neighborhood, including a building across the street from the hotel. That raises the daytime noise level as well. If you have a car, note that while parking is free for guests, you may not be able to get a space in the hotel parking lot. There are not enough spaces in the lot under the hotel to accommodate all guests. At night you can park at the end of the driveway off Aurora Ave., but that may necessitate backing out onto a busy street the next morning. The alternatives are parking on the side streets or in a nearby surface lot that will cost you. Because of the nearby construction some spaces on the street have been designated as no parking areas, limiting that alternative. The indoor pool is OK, though it was closed for one day of our stay. There are no changing rooms at the pool and you have to walk through public areas of the hotel in your bathing suit to get there, so bring a coverup if that's an issue for you. Breakfast is the pastries and bagels fare that you find at most hotels these days. Get there at least a half hour before the breakfast room closes, however, because it doesn't look like they restock the buffet during the final 30-45 minutes. On the plus side, this place is three blocks from Seattle Center attractions like the Experience Music Project, Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle. Busses to downtown Seattle stop at the front door every 10-15 minutes during the day. The front desk people we dealt with were friendly and helpful. The neighborhood seems safe at night and there are restaurants nearby in the Belltown neighborhood (about a 10 minute walk) If you're not fussy or claustrophobic, I suppose you could get by here. If you're willing to spend more money, the much newer Holiday Inn Express on the other side of Aurora Ave. might be a much better choice in this neighborhood.

It's a Quality Inn, for Pete's sake. Don't expect the Ritz. It's a perfectly fine 2* hotel. I was there for UW commencement and the city was busy, so this was the best I could do. I got a rate of $95 on Quikbook, and that was the best I could find ANYWHERE for this or any other decent property in downtown. When I arrived, I asked for two beds. The clerk was knowledgeable and efficient, and said she had only one left, but the rate would be $99. No problem. Still a deal for these dates. The lobby had a kind of Northwest lodge feel, with stone walls and floor. There was free coffee available and limited free newspapers. The elevator was kind of creaky and battered, and the guest room hallways were pretty shabby, but the room itself was spotless. Event the edges of the carpet seemed vacuumed, something I often don't see in 4* hotels. It had a beamed ceiling, again with the lodge feeling, and a microwave and mini-fridge. Plenty of room. Free wireless internet (although sometimes a weak signal). No problems with noise. The free breakfast was pretty abundant, although the breakfast room was crowded. There were signs about not taking away food, but my sister brought me stuff anyhow. No big deal. So I was perfectly satisfied. There's FREE parking! Some is in a lot alongside the street (Aurora), but there's also a hard-to-find garage. Go behind the hotel and completely around the block to the other side. You'll see a small Quality Inn sign over the entrance. You enter with your room key, so access is completely controlled. The elevator will take you all the way to the guest floors. I'd say the elevator was the biggest problem here: it was slow, old, creaky, and ugly. Otherwise, everything was fine. They even have a nice indoor pool off the lobby. The location was good. It's not in the thick of downtown, but DT is very accessible in a few minutes walk. If you exit the hotel and go right down Denny Way, there's an area with cafes and restaurants, and further down is the Space Needle food court. There's also a McDonalds near the Space Needle. If you go a few blocks north on Denny Way, there's a Whole Foods Market. And if you're in a hurry, there's a convenience store/gas station on the corner of Denny and Aurora, about 2 minutes walk.

I requested an ironing board and it came within 5 minutes. I didn't take advantage of the breakfast or other amenities, there was just too much to do in Seattle than to stay in my room! Overall, this hotel was superb for the value and quality. The service made my stay a memorable one. They never once hesistated to answer my questions.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Podunk, Backwater, MT", "Title": "\u201cA variety of room sizes so look at it B4 you sign in!\u201d", "Author": "myassesdragon", "ReviewID": "UR6088243", "Content": "We should have asked Ricky the check-in clerk to show us the room he intended to give us before we signed for it. And we should have come right back downstairs and asked for a standard size room to replace the assigned \"closet size\" one. Although it was a quiet, non-smoking room with 2 beds as requested, our room 329 had almost zero floor space. No round table, no two chairs, no desk, no desk chair, no luggage rack, a very dinky sink counter left no room for toiletry kits, only one night stand for 2 queen beds, the 2 lamps (for the whole room) each had only an 18 watt compact flourescent bulb, closet pole 18\" long. I kid you not when I say there was only 24 inches of floor space between the foot of the bed(s) and the dresser. BUT room 316 (with its door open for mtce), was a typical, 2 double bed room with all the furniture that was not in our room 329 plus a much larger sink counter and plenty of floor space. So this property DOES have larger rooms; ask Emily to give you one! Hot breakfast = A-; location = B+; property condition = B.

To start off, we looked for a hotel in downtown Seattle for we were going to the International District (Chinatown) for four days. My main preference was to have an indoor pool (who knows what the weather will do, so you can't go wrong with that,) and our budget was under $125/night. We got a deal of $100/night at Hotels.com and they indeed had an indoor pool. I've had interesting experiences renting hotels from just seeing websites, and this one was one of those times. The parking is BiZaRRe - not only does MapQuest or RandMcNally.com tell you they can't find it on the map, but if you find it yourself while driving around you only have 2 ways to enter the lot... if you overshoot the entrance then you end up on the frickin' highway. Moving on... check-in was crazy... a TON of people were having problems checking in (from online reservations of all things) and surprisingly when it was our turn they found our reservation easy and got us a parking permit and 2 keys without a problem. However, we booked a king and got to the room and it was 2 doubles, and 1 key didn't work. Bleh... I was tired and my husband and I just took advantage of more space and slept on the separate beds instead of stand in line to complain about that error. Bathroom was good, carpet was ok - not the horrible conditions I expected when reading everyone else's reviews. Thought maybe I'd have a view from the window, but all I got was a lovely view of the Travelodge right behind us (teeny tiny view of the Space Needle if you look at the right angle.) Definitely within walking distance to the Space Needle and only a few blocks to restaurants, the malls/stores downtown, and only a few (drivable) neighborhoods away from the International District. The pool's location isn't that great - right behind the hotel lobby (so much for privacy.) But the pool is really clean, and the adjacent hot tub was nice - could easily fit 8 (10 kids probably.) We opted for dim sum downtown every morning, but the one morning I decided to check out the breakfast I saw a pretty decent spread - lots of fresh bagels, huge fresh muffins, a juice machine, coffee, yoplait yogurt cups, and I saw them putting away eggs and turning off the waffle machine - and that's a lot of good food in my opinion. Overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10 - only an 8 because they did screw up the room and the parking sucked - if there were no vacancies then there wouldn't be enough spots - good luck on the street. The Holiday Inn Express across the Street had the same parking issues, and the Travelodge behind us looked 4x more run down than where we stayed. But for the money and the indoor pool and the breakfast and location, I really don't have any major complaints.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "long beach, CA", "Title": "\u201csmall & shabby\u201d", "Author": "db2", "ReviewID": "UR5731811", "Content": "This place was a dump.

This is obviously an older hotel, so if you are going to Seattle to spend your time in a hotel, this would not be your choice.
