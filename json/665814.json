There was no table, the main bedroom bed was broken. the majority of the rooms are tiny cubicles off a main hall with sliding glass doors. The effect is very \"prison\". The \"caretaker\" lives in a room that is really PART OF THE APARTMENT. She was perfectly nice, but we were sharing the bathroom with her. The apartment is not as large as advertised. Directly downstairs is a dance studio, and on the weekend they had a salsa dance party that was pretty cute, but kept us up until 4am. we made the best of it, and there were awesome things about the neighborhood, but the place is a scam.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Ill", "Title": "\u201cThis Loft was AWESOME!!!\u201d", "Author": "thebestguest", "ReviewID": "UR32413420", "Content": "I stayed at the Soho Loft with 8 of my friends for an engagement party.

My experience is based on the pre stay experience I had with this company. My stay was supposed to be Oct 5-11 2008 I booked this Loft because 1st- was in Soho, 2nd the pictures looked good, 3rd the price was good, 4- I was contacted immediately. I never should have done it. They require you prepay on a credit card and sign a \"lease.\" I should have known better by the tone of the emails. Unprofessional, Lacking in tact or intelligently written. The terms of the contract are short. Basically (but vaguely) It says cancelation policy is within outside of 6 weeks prior to the stay a refund of 75% will be given back if re-rented. I didn't think we'd cancel. Well, after reading all of the horrible reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites - I canceled. I immediately emailed the 2 people I dealt with told them about the reviews. One review stated that they actually book private partys in the \"commom\" space and they can go all night. The guests aren't allowed to be in that space during the party. As well it said, the party guests use the same bathrooms as the overnight guests. Plus, the rooms do not lock. One reviewer even said the day he arrived his bed had been used and sheets were not changed. Gross! This was not the mature, private, clean and comfortable arrangement I wanted. In my cancelation letter I mentioned and asked if there would be parties booked. I recieved confirmation that there could be a party booked. I was contacted not by the original people who took care of me( we'll call them kevin/sales and James/rental agreeme\\nt)But by the Director of the Loft. After some correspondence, the Director, we'll call him Leroy, stated that he might have a private apt. I was very much interested in it and wanted details. It would be easier to just change locations instead of cancel. He didn/t get back to me. I had to be the one to initiate all communication each and ever time. Plus it took 3 or 4 emails to get him to answer. He finally, after a week said he found a place. I wanted details. After 3 days, still no details. He kept sending one sentence emails like \"don't worry\" etc etc. After 4 emails and 3 days of asking, I finally emailed and stated that I wanted the address and details of the place by end of day. He emailed back and said\" don't worrry, call me at lunchtime tomorrow\" I did what he said - he answered the phone and put me off.. again. He said he was busy and to call him around closing time. I agreed. However after all of the correspondence, unprofessional behavior, abrupt and strange emails, I decided to cancel. His response?: \"No problem\" I had since sent 2 emails asking the status of my refund. No reply. I have a feeling even if they did re-rent my space - I may not see my money. Very very shady. by the way, this location was found through VacationRentals.com which in itself does not have a good reputation according to reviews. Do yourself a favor, stay at a well known reputable hotel. It's worth it. As of now, I have booked a hotel for the week and will have to shell out another 2000K.

My husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first reaction was that the loft had been a former massage parlor. I have no idea where the people giving positive reviews of this place stayed. Our bedroom was a shabby, stuffy, 6X10 windowless room that barely fit the bed and a bowed dresser. The fan in the room made so much noise that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep. The walls are paper thin. Both nights we stayed, the loft also hosted parties of 30 - 100+ people starting at 5:30. We found out about the parties AFTER we arrived, and that the common room, (the pictures of it on the website was the reason that we booked the place), would be off limits to us until at least midnight. We were also warned to keep our room doors locked in case any of the party guests tried to get in. We also shared our bathroom with all the party guests. Good luck with finding toilet paper. Breakfast was Costco muffins, and dry cereal. The other guests arriving during our stay were as surprised and none stayed a second night. Management was unresponsive and rude.

This place is a disaster waiting to happen. We spent 5 long nights here in September.
