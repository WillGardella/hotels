One thing to consider is that our room was on the freeway side, which we could hear once the air conditioning was turned off, but it did not bother me at all because we were so tired after running around all day.

The room was pretty good and it was nice to have a refrigerator in the room. It was clean and new and the beds were supportive and newer.

We also had noise issues that were partly due to the inexpensive construction of the hotel and partly due to the fact that many people just use no manners or restraint no matter the hour.

It is in a very clean and nice neighborhood. You are warmly greeted by the front desk staff who are brisk, efficient and exudes an aura of welcome. They take all requests, no matter how large or small, seriously and work quickly to satisfy your needs. Being a frequent guest (between 100 and 200 nights the last 3 years!), I have stayed in a variety of rooms and ALL of them are very clean and comfortable. A selection of pillows from soft to hard ensure a good nights sleep. The rooms on one side face the highway but the distance and insulation damps out all the noise. Even if you get a room on the highway side, don\u2019t worry, you will sleep well. The air conditioners in all the rooms I stayed in, work well and are a welcome relief from the hot days of Arizona. There is a small fridge and microwave in each room. The bathrooms are well stocked with the usual toiletries. I love the showers in this hotel. A hard day\u2019s work and weary bodies are rejuvenated in the rain like shower. The towels are high quality and very nice. The pool is nice and it is well used In the heat of the Arizona summer. They have a hot tub too, but I have not used this. However, much to my surprise, I have seen guests use this in the peak of summer! Must be Santa's elves from the north pole enjoying the heat! There is a small exercise room on the fourth floor. It has a couple of weight machines, two treadmills and a stair stepper. Not the best, but adequate while on a trip. For those serious exercise buffs, there is a LA Fitness within walking distance and for those of you who are members of the YMCA, there are 2 located within 5 miles of the hotel. They have an excellent selection of food for breakfast. I love the brand new pancake machine. Press the button and a couple of hot, perfectly cooked pancakes pop out after a minute or so. They have placed the syrup, butter etc conveniently next to this machine \u2013 feels like home \u2013 maybe not, no machine at home, I have to do them myself! Being a road warrior, who travels the world, I can confidently state whenever I come across a great hotel, the management behind the scenes ensures the whole operation is guest focused. Ollie Smith, the manager is to be lauded for the operation she runs. Ollie and her team of dedicated staff make the hardship of being away from home that much easier to bear.

We will not stay at this hotle again when returning and would recommend families not to stay here. Cons: 1. We were told there are only King bed rooms available not facing the noisy interstate. This will leave most families (2 Queen bed rooms) on the noisy side of the hotel. We turned on the fan to drown out the noise. The AC when it kicks on is very loud. They were unflexible in accommodating room preference such as being on higher floors and also facing away from the interstate. 2. No side or back entrances. You can only enter or leave the hotel by two front exits. This included handicap parking located on the side entrances away front entrances which is unusual for most hotels. 3. Although smoking is prohibited inside the hotel (Which was in forced), they do seem to allow smoking in the front and next to pool area. Some smokers were polite and moved farther away when our kids were in the pool area but others sat out and smoked away making guest who were at the pool breathe in 2nd hand smoke. Also it seemed this was a cocktail area with people drinking beers and smoking. Not really a good family atmosphere. 4. Only 1 washer and 2 dryers located on floor 3. 5. The receptionists need to work on providing friendlier service. 6. Breakfast food did run out one day when a swim team came down and cleared it out. We came back down about an hour later and it was restocked. Holiday Inn Express seem to have more teams and groups staying at them because they offer group discounts. 7. Small breakfast area - you may need to take the food on run. 8. No usual cookies except for one night out five. Pros: 1. Except for the noisy interstate, the room was pretty quiet. The doors are very heavy and close loud. I think the hotel was not very busy but I only heard the doors closing outside the room a few times and didn't hear any noise from the other rooms except when walking down the hall. 2. Comfortable beds. 3. Pretty pool. Jacuzzi can't stay warm enough once the sun goes down but I figure this is Phoenix weather and most of the time people prefer it a little cooler in the pools. Pool is clean but heavy in chlorine so bring the googles and moisturizer. 4.

Breakfast is light and usually has something hot like eggs bacon and/or sausage as well as the normal cereals and breads.

The bed was extremely comfortable (wish mine was so nice), and the decor was very tasteful. Very clean too. The lobby was also tastefully decorated and the complimentary breakfast was quite good and filling. Lots of choices: fresh scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, several cereals, many types of muffins and baked breads, several yogurts, milk, juices, coffee, tea, etc. And did I mention it was complimentary? As if this isn't enough, there's a Cracker Barrel (my favorite) within walking distance. The hotel was also quiet. My room faced the busy freeway but the windows were very well-insulated and I didn't hear a thing. Free high-speed wireless internet was a very nice plus. Also USA Today every morning. Also free.
