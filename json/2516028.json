Yeah, yeah, I know the passport photo trick hotels like the 4S use to identify their guests, but it felt warm and genuine and I went for it- hook, line and sinker. I had a suite (God bless Amex Platinum) big enough for one of my BFF's to stay one night, and a a balcony that looked over the mountains. Breakfast was amazing- there's a mixed juice drink called the Italian Mob you must get. The spa was great- had a massage with a wonderfully attentive massuese.

Gym - perfect size, great work out options and a cool view of the herb garden. Bar - a great place to meet cool people. They had a good live band and an outdoor terrace.

What made the Four Season only Two Seasons for us, was the lack of any real connection with the guests and the staff, especially the front desk, all smiles, but no debth and no real interest in you as genuine guest in a top rate hotel. The valet parking is the worst in Beverly Hills with the parking staff having no idea if you are arriving or leaving the hotel to the point of frustration and even after I repeatedly told the front desk and manager about the problem, there was no acknowlegment of how bad it really was. On two occassions as we went to drive out, we were stopped by the parking staff welcoming us to the hotel!! Every day we had to ask for chilled water to replaced in the car, as the valet left the empty bottles in their holders when he brought the car up.

A breakfast of one fruit plate, one bagel w/ cream cheese & salmon, coffee, two juices, with 20% included tip and $4 service charge added, was $96. A lg. pot of coffee is $16. Go downstairs or eat everything in the minibar; it's going to be less painful. Here's another stab at a perennial complaint with almost every hotel in this level: WiFi was $15/24 hours. Note that it's 24 hours, not for a \"day.\" if you check in at 10 and out at 12 the next day, that's TWO 24hr charges. When will these hotels realize that this makes everyone's blood boil? My colleague now has a Verizon MiFi, which provides him with a 4G connection everywhere for about $50/month. Just pointing out to management that these charges won't last forever.

Since the renovation all areas of the hotel are in great condition and stylishly updated. Most of the standard rooms are comparable to one another with differences in view. I am not sure there is a truly bad view to be had. We prefer the garden side of the hotel, but know others who prefer looking the other way toward BH and the ocean. The beds are typical FS beds, which means very comfortable. The one down side to the regular rooms and studio suites is the old fashioned tub/shower combo. It's not a deal breaker, but an unfortunate remnant of an older building. Our Executive Suite this last time had much nicer bathroom with a huge walk-in shower in addition to the tub. The things that really set this hotel apart are the attention to detail and service. There are few hotels we have stayed at, including some much more expensive than this one, where the service is so seamless. It reminds me of the FS in Hong Kong, which really is the epitome of stellar service. It is a perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism combined with an impeccable ability to anticipate your needs. There is no attitude at all, but they also deftly avoid being too folksy or familiar. The pool area is still one of our favorites. While it may not have the drama and grandeur of pools like the Hualalai FS and the Amangiri, it is peaceful, beautiful and impeccably attended by the staff. The food throughout the hotel, including poolside, is excellent. Culina is beautiful and food is very good. Their wine selection is broad and fair in pricing. They also often have good deals on hard to find wines and will pour almost all of their bottles as half bottles, which is rare. Finally, if you have the occasion to be here at Christmas they do a pretty incredible job of decorating the place to the hilt so it feels festive despite the lack of snow outside. We are looking forward to our next stay in a month and will continue to make the FS Los Angeles our home away from home when we are in LA.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cSuper duper!\u201d", "Author": "havanagirlGlasgow", "ReviewID": "UR116677558", "Content": "Thanks to the staff whose exemplary service was such a welcome after a long journey.

The character is relaxed elegance.We have tried the Montage, but it is much more formal. The food and service at the pool deck is great. The food at Culina is excellent at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Some of the items are unique, so be sure to take the waiter's recommendation.

This feels like a boutique hotel, and if you hang around you'll see a few celebrities. Location was great---not in the middle of all the traffic like the other Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, but close enough to Rodeo Drive to walk (abotu 10 minutes). We took the house car several times---a Rolls Royce with tinted windows---which is available on a first come first serve basis. It was fun to see what life is like for the stars as people try to see who's inside the car. My one requirement for a room: to sleep. Beds of course are not a problem at the Four Seasons, but I was concerned because the hotel isn't very high, and our room was facing the front of the hotel and a busy street. But with the A/C on constantly we heard nothing all night long and slept for 10 hours the first night. Compare this with the Ritz in Laguna Niguel---a sprawling beachfront resort---where we stayed later in the week where we heard people walking above us and everytime the A/C came on it woke us up. This seems like such a minor thing, but sleep is important whether you are on business or pleasure. Only a few complaints, which of course are minor compared to other hotels: *When we made the reservation and when we checked in we asked for a quiet room. We were given the one RIGHTNEXT to the elevators. It's a pain to go to your room only to have to then go back to the desk and then wait again for a new room. *During breakfast one morning we heard two of the waitstaff complaining to each other about their manager---guests really don't want to hear that. *One morning we had a long discussion with our server about one of the smoothies, we ordered it, but never got it. We weren't charged, and decided to forgo it, but it was strange. *There is only one pool, and it's relatively small---if there were kids there, it would not have been relaxing. One thing I would like to mention is that the staff is fabulous---no snootiness like what you'll encounter in the service people on Rodeo Drive. Everyone is treated like a valued guest no matter who you are or what you\u2019re wearing.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay for the whole family - both the hotel & service were flawless\u201d", "Author": "Global_Splash", "ReviewID": "UR84297162", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel twice on our recent trip to the US - once on flying in to LA and again flying out either side of a round-Californian trip.

Although not wealthy, we are loyal Four Seasons guests, and had high expectations ; we feared we might be disappointed, especially in the perspective of swapping from an opulent old style resortlike place hidden in the canyons, to a high rise city hotel. Different it was, but we had a great time. First approach was not on the best note, as we litterally had to wait in line to reach the valet parking area. From then on, all went smoothly. Front desk attendant welcome us asking how the drive had been from the Santa Barbara property (good system). Wa had booked a Deluxe Four Seasons Suite, requesting the highest possible floor, which was only the 9th floor. Asking for a higher floor, she proposed a room upgrade, that would be on the 16th floor, for a fee. I felt it was stingy, as 7 of our last 10 nights had been at Four Seasons properties. It showed on her screen. I declined. I only take complimentary upgrades, and felt that a token of recognition might sometimes release the pressure of the $$$ hunt ... The front desk manager fgot out of his office for a personal welcome. We proceeded to the Suite, along with the Bellman. It was exquisite, albeit rather smaller than we thought it would be. Not a problem. The view was awesome, from the Design Center to Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood sign to Downtown to the ocean : we felt the 16th floor would not have purchased a better view. Exquisite decoration (special mention to the carpet pattern), plush bedding and seats, 2 large flat TV sets, ample storage, 2 french windows (seats and coffee table out there would be nice), beautiful marble bathrooms (showing its age : toilet in the bathroom, so un-Four Seasons) (special mention to the oversized shower stall with a great shower head and at last good water pressure). We only used the restaurants for breakfast each day. Perfect outdoor seating, great menu, beautiful execution, spotless service, Four Seasons price tags (possibly Beverly Hills price tags, too). We tried once the pool area for breakfast, but service was not up to standards there. Although quite compact, the pool area is very pleasant. The upper deck allows for a quieter scene, away from kids, and for some sun until 6.30 pm (in august). Pool attendants are very gracious. We did not order food there, but it looked very good and tasty. On our last day, in order to catch the last Air France flight to Paris, we wanted to have time to carefully pack our 240 lb. of luggage, and requested a late check-out, hoping for some recognition of 10 nights in Four Seasons properties across the South West. Well all we had was a blunt no, even for an hour ; until I said I was ready to pay (the all around $$$ hunt) : so it was 50% of the daily rate, for occupation until 6.00 pm. Well, we shelled those out ! This is a great Four Seasons property. It has been beautifully renovated. It is up to all and each of the brand standards. We had a lovely time, and thoroughlly enjoyed what was offered. Being loyal FS guests, we know and appreciate all this. I really find bothersome is the obvious $ hunt. Not nickel-and-diming you really, but the slightly sour note that they are your big dollars at every opportunity, never acknowledging the obscene amount of money you are spending there. I understand this is a business, not a charity, but come on. I remember discussing the company policy with the GM of One&Only Reethi Rah in the Maldives ($1.800 per night), to whom we expressed how surprised we were by all the daily attentions : the owner's directions is that they splurge on customers, it does not cost them much margin, but the customer feels cherished. Unfortunately, this is what is lacking here. Would we return ? In a heartbeat, until Hotel bel-Air resume business.

A near-perfect stay, and exceeded expectations by far. The property has been recently renovated, so it's a great time to visit; also, its residential location on Doheny makes this an urban hotel with a resort-like feel. Booked via the Amex Platinum FH&R program. We had a Four Seasons Executive Suite (room 310), which was lovely. The room had a full marble bathroom with an extra-large shower and separate tub. The sleeping quarters were separated from the living room by fabric-covered glass French doors, and the updated carpeting, furniture and other furnishings were all very comfortable, warm and tastefully done. The step-out balcony, while not large, could fit two (standing) adults easily and overlooked the gardens below and, in the distance, the Hollywood sign was visible. Bathroom amenities were Bvlgari white tee - a change-up from the standard FS-issue L\u2019Occitane - and came in both mini- and medium-sized containers. The only shortfall of the suite was that there were no mirrors whatsoever outside of the bathroom. At the very least, a partial mirror should be added to the sleeping quarters, and ideally a full length mirror added to the back of the closet door in the main entry as well. We ate at both the updated outdoor Cabana restaurant, located on the fourth floor pool deck, and the new Culina restaurant that's located off the lobby. Both were quite good and the service was attentive without being overbearing. Prices at both are not for the weak of wallet: You can easily spend $300 for two at each without trying very hard if alcohol is part of the mix. We hung out late the second evening at Windows Lounge, where a fairly raucous crowd of people were enjoying the live music/dancing. A terrific room, the lounge is both upscale and laid-back, and the crowd enjoying themselves just reaffirmed our feelings that the LA property has a welcoming and resort-like ambiance. That is to say, definitely high-end \u2013 but a place where stuffiness is set aside. There are limits, however: Someone did attempt to take a photograph with their camera and hotel security stepped in to forbid it; I would imagine this is in line with the hotel\u2019s ethic of preserving an atmosphere of privacy. Spa/pool: To get to the pool deck and Cabana restaurant, one must physically pass through the small spa on the fourth floor (in fact, the restrooms that serve both the restaurant and pool are those in the locker room for the spa - a somewhat odd setup). I had pre-arranged a treatment prior to arrival and was a bit flabbergasted by the price - nearly $300 for a 90-minute treatment, before tip. However, the pre-booking advice I was given was spot on: Both treatment and the therapist were outstanding and it was quite possibly the best hotel/resort treatment I have ever had. The spa treatment area itself is lovely - whereas the locker room facility seemed like it could use an update and an expansion. Since the area services the needs of both spa attendees and pool- and restaurant-goers, it really should be at least 50% larger, if not twice the size. The showers and steam room (I did not check out the sauna) were quite nice, however, and worked well. The pool is small-ish, but terrific. The pool bottom is surfaced in a soft, gym mat-like material that\u2019s quite comfortable. There is an elevated hot tub is at one end of the pool and was rarely used (weather was in the low 80s during our stay). Service was friendly and casual, and there are the standard ranks of folks to set up chairs and towels as well as to provide F&B service (same menu as the collocated Cabana restaurant). Thanks to the Amex late check-out we were able to extend our stay at the pool until late in the afternoon on our final day. Other: The house car is a black Rolls-Royce Phantom that we used twice - once to drop us off at dinner and again to pick us back up. The driver gave us a Four Seasons business card with the number to call when we needed him to return, and he was there within five minutes of our phoning him. Be sure to use this complimentary amenity if you can score it (is assigned on a first-come, first-served basis and cannot be reserved in advance); the driver will take you anywhere within a two mile radius of the hotel, an area that covers a lot of shopping and dining options. Bottom line: I would both return to this property without hesitation, and would highly recommend to others.

I had ordered wrongly and he still insisted on crediting me...and sending over some delicious soup. I cannot say enough about this hotel. The flowers are still amazing.

The check in was extremely smooth, the staff is all very courteous and attentive. They try not to make you wait ever, they open doors, always say good morning. Attentive without being invasive. Good example is that I asked for an adapter for my computer. In most hotels it takes 20 minutes to get, but within 3 minutes they had already brought it to my door. The decor is very LA 1980's. While very lavish and opulent, it's certainly not modern, design and stylish. They do have a beautiful garden and there's always these enormous, beautiful floral arrangements everywhere. They upgraded my room so I was staying in an executive suite. The room was huge, the bathroom as well. The decor is classic 4 Seasons. Pale green, old English furniture. Going back to the 1980's comment, I had 2 old school TV's in my room with a VHS player. I didn't even think they made VHS anymore. They did have an ipod dock in the BOSE alarm clock - but that's really the only modern amenity in the room. Food is quite good - I only had breakfast (once in the garden and once in the pool) but it was delicious. The pool is beautiful and a great place to hang out, but the pool water was really hot. Jumping in you definitely didn't cool off from the humidity outside. Fitness center is nice and up to date with the latest equipment. It's outdoors so whatever temperature it is outside is the temperature you're working out in. It sometimes got insanely hot. I could only really work out in the morning.

Like in my more recent visit in March 2008, I could not find a hotel employee who did not personally say hello and smile. I am truly curious how this luxury property has figured out how to get their entire staff on the same page of perfection with regard to service. They are just warm and artfully tuned into the guest experience. Remembering the slightest detail is not just their focus for me...but you can sit and watch the same level of intimate touch happening around you if you just hang and watch. They just get it. BEST SLEEP I have rested my head on virtual every luxury brand's bed and pillow in North America and beyond. When I lay my head down here, I can't put my finger on what it is exactly, but I know one thing for certain that I never forget about this hotel. I sleep better here than anywhere else on the planet. BEST SPA I think this is exactly what Goldie Locks meant when she said \"just right\". Intimate, refined, understated elegance and massage therapists who have proven to be the best. It's location on the 4th floor of the property keeps it feeling very private and secluded. Just on the other side of the spa is the pool and an outdoor restaurant. My favorite thing to do is to stretch out on the comfie pool chair with a friend and pretend I live like this everyday..a pool attendant and staff bringing you drinks and food from the restaurant..walking by to spritz some evian spray and offer a cool towel on a hot day. It's hard to believe you are right inside L.A. because it feels like paradise. BEST BAR Extensive wine list and wines by the glass plus a thoughtful menu and excellent food that make this an easy spot to grab a light bite along with laughs with friends. (Though the restaurant and outdoor terrace dining on site from their amazing chef ashley is one of L.A.'s best kept secrets.) It's also the spot in town for power drinks and power meetings and it shows. If I grab a drink at the bar alone, I inevitably end up meeting interesting people without ever trying hard.

Especially in the area of LA where this hotel is located. It was an enjoyable stay nonetheless, however we felt for the price the room was a bit on the old side...... but still comfortable for a short stay only. It was quite small, plus it was noisey. We could clearly hear the kids next door. We did have a nice wrap around balcony though (however the view was of a dingy apartment block opposite!) The pool is small and unremarkable. The restaurant had average food but a cute and cosy ambience. The room service food was good and the check in friendly and efficient. Transportation to and from the airport was quick and easy. I think we will try another hotel in the same area next time. Not sure we would return. Overall the stay was 'OK' but we did expect more from the Four Seasons.

As you approach it , you can see the architecture went out of fashion some time ago. The pool is painted and old fashioned in style. There was construction activity across the road, which should have been brought to my attention or in some other way compensated for. However in the 5 days I was there it only started once at 7:30 am and then sproradically on weekdays. it was a nuisance. But thats all thats negative. This is a GREAT hotel. The service is impeccable. Each person has been trained. The food is outstanding (especially the Sunday brunch). The pool was a bit busy on the weekend, but thats due to the fact that it is small relative to the size of the hotel. And you definitely dont notice that its an old building. The maintenance is good. We had breakfast each morning on the patio and could easily have been in acres of garden. The setting is tremendous and you do get to see stars. One day we saw four easily recognizable major actors. The hotel is located in a residential part of Beverley Hills so expect to walk or use the hotel's Rolls if you want to go places. But thats LA for you. if you want to stay in a more pedestrian area, Four Seasons has another hotel in the area.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFavorite Room - one of a kind suite on 16 - I'll never tell\u201d", "Author": "RadioTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5338828", "Content": "For fear of never being able to check into this room again because there is only one of her kind in the hotel - I'll just say this - it is not as big as some of the larger suites, but when you don't bring your pets (we often travel with two pugs) - this is the best room in the hotel and when you want luxury mixed with something nobody else has - you ask for this room at the Four Seasons Los Angeles near Beverly Hills.

I've heard there are many famous faces who stay there. Well, I am not famous and I'm guessing that is why I received the substandard service that I did. Upon check in there was no bellman available. The bellman delivered the luggage about 15 minutes later. He did not offer any explanation of the room, nor did he point out fire exits, but I beleive he was in rush as one of the elevators was out of order and he seemed backed up. The room service order was cold. An order for one person is usually delivered on a tray. This was delivered on a table with one lonely plate in the middle, not even any flowers. Quite disappointing. The worst part of my stay was when I did not receive my wake-up call in the morning and missed my flight! An apology was offered by the doorman as I left the hotel, but no one in management has apologized. Truly disappointing. I highly recommend staying elsewhere when in LA.
