Now, I may sound like a snob, but there is a major distinction between nice affordable and 'chintzy'. Everything by description seemed appeling while in fact you cannot help but sense the cheapness. Worse, it carries through in a lack of ammenities and focus on details. At check-in, a room 'held' for us not 24 hours prior to our arrival was 'released' to another party and I was told that it was a 'request' that was not guaranteed. Admittedly, a lovely and attentive front desk person made the best of a bad situation given that we were concurrently celbrating an anniversary milestone. The refrigeratior that was supposed to be in the room was not. The fitness center is small and expecting them to provide headsets went down without mine to be told they do not. Their 'spa' is a steam room, locker and lounge. Really? Wet heat for $18 when I could have been at Caesar's in progressiely hot Roman baths or the Mirage with their beautiful retreat like atmosphere. Not chic, not elegant, not fine-think Day's Inn with a Latin beat and formica. And, although modest by Las Vegas standards in price, 5 days averaged out to @$179.00/night, so you could do much better for a little more money. Decidedly low-end.

We were looking for a great pool and a nice room, but found all of the pictures on almost every web site disappointing. Frankly, it looked like they were all hiding something. We decided to stay at the Tropicana based mostly on tripadvisor reviews...and it turned out to be one of the best hotel stays we've ever had. I travel frequently for business and can almost always find something to complain about in even the best hotels, and can honestly say that the Tropicana not only exceeded all of our expectations, it set new ones! More in detail... The images on their site simply don't do the pool area justice (why would they sell themselves short like that?). We were there the second week of Spring Break and I don't think there were ever more than 30 people in the water...and most of the time there were 10-15 (or just us!). We reserved one of the pool-side \"beds,\" which I also recommend because you always have a large place to come back to and at $25 it's a steal. The free-form layout of the pool area means that this is not a mob scene with thousands of chairs stacked end to end. The water was in the high 80s, clean and beautiful. The palm trees and landscaping around makes it a wonderful setting. The shape of the pool means that there are lots of little coves and shaded areas to explore, which makes it fun to swim around. Beautifully designed by someone who knew how the pool would be used, and the emotional impression it could make on guests. Who would have thought that the staff at a huge 'Vegas' hotel could be such an asset? As I said at the beginning I stay at a lot of hotels, but what really made an impression was that every person we met--every one--not only did their job professionally, but clearly LIKED what they were doing and took real pride in it. From our waitress Celine in the Beach Cafe, to the dealers at the tables who would wave at our four-year-old every morning while we were on our way to breakfast or the pool, to the woman at room service who treated us as if she knew us after the first call, to the wait staff at the pool who just genuinely took interest in the fact that you were comfortable and having a good time, the place just made you feel at home. Who would have thought this possible? I certainly wouldn't have, but there you have it. The room was exactly as pictured: clean, modern design, and newly renovated. Don't expect over-the-top Vegas opulent (but this was perfect for us traveling with two children). The furniture was new and very clean, with nice drawers and storage, and we spent one evening in front of the 42\" TV and plugged in our own DVD player which the television configured to automatically. We had a partial view of the strip from our 14th-floor room, and the windows even open slightly for fresh air. One of the other positives is that there is only a single smoking floor in the tower where we were\u2026and there was absolutely no smell of smoke in the halls or the rooms. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom clean and very usable with lots of towel hangars. Possible areas of improvement? Really, the only thing they could do is banish smoking in the entire hotel and casino as some have had the courage to do. But even so the casino was not filled with smoke as many Las Vegas casinos tend to be. That was tolerable, but it\u2019s still the worst part of traveling to anywhere in Las Vegas. Again, many thanks to those at the Tropicana who made our stay so memorable\u2026we will be back!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona", "Title": "\u201cnice\u201d", "Author": "SmileyCorona", "ReviewID": "UR127778529", "Content": "Rooms were nicely decorated and in good condition.

I had seen comments on here that Nicole Marshall had been helpful to people so I emailed her to see what she could do for us. She gave us a great rate, waived the resort fee and the crib fee and gave a us Breeze priority check-in which was very helpful, skipping the long line. We arrived just after 1:30 and were able to check in because our room was ready. The desk clerks were talking and they said that early check-ins before 1:30 cost $30, but after 1:30 they don't charge and you can get in if your room is ready. They were also helpful to move my parents to a room on the same floor. We were in a deluxe room with two queen beds in the Paradise Tower, which was great because it was right by the main entrance. We had a nice view of the south strip: Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Excalibur. There was some noise from the road at night (mostly sirens) even on the 16th floor. But I think I'd rather have the view with a little street noise. The room was much more spacious than I was expecting. There was plenty of room for all of us to spread out a little and the crib (a pack n play) was able to be a little out of the way. The bathroom was large, too. There was a good hair dryer (not one of the stuck on the wall kind), but no coffee maker. The room was clean and new. I didn't hear any noise from any other rooms. The only annoying thing was on Sunday and Monday they were cleaning our room when we came back from the pool after 4:00 in the afternoon. I understand that they are trying to get all the rooms done for check-in, but it would have been nice to have service a little earlier in the day. The pool was great! We had no problem finding chairs together, the towels were large and best of all the pool was warm. Really warm. The pool is large and has lots of sunny spots and shady spots, too, which was good to keep the little ones out of the sun. We ate at the Beach Cafe our first night. The food was really good. They didn't have a children's menu (note: I wasn't expecting most places to have one, I'm just documenting for others), but they did have a high chair. It was a great stay.

I can't understand why there isn't some minimal coffee self service in the room though other than they want you to go downstairs and pay $8 for a Starbucks and gamble on the way by but even the cheapest hotels in the US have coffee makers at a minimum...oh well. The problem I had with the Trop is that it is merely decent, and in Vegas home of some of the nicest hotels and attractions on the planet, decent isn't good enough and the hotel looks decidely low on anyone's list. I stayed there because it seemed to be good value, the travel site did not mention a ridiculous \"resort fee\", and because I have loved the Trop in the past, appreciate the \"old vegas\" feel of the place and was anxious to spend time at the pool and see the renovations. Well, change was not good to the Trop in my opinion. The rooms were nice not great but nice. But who goes to Vegas to stay in the room. The pool is no longer the groovy tropical place it once was...there is no sun and only shade due to the location and towers blocking the sun in the late afternoon and the pool service was non-existient. Trying in vain to soak up some late afternoon rays and all you get is wafting of someone's second hand cigaratte smoke. I think they should not allow smoking at poolside.... and the casino is shrunken, small, and sparse. And they will still insist on $17 resort fee when all is said and done....for what? Well they say it is for the gym and some 2 for 1 drink offers in some of the bars...what? I know it is a money grab that many of the hotels are doing these days, but in no way did this place feel like a \"resort\". In Omaha or Smithville or anytown USA this would be a nice hotel without coffee service (ahem....) but in Vegas it is merely a forgotten gem who has tried in vain to make itself relevant again.

I would never have stayed in The Tropicana before it's renovations but now it is my first choice when I go to Vegas. The Hotel is beautifully clean, the rooms are very nice and the beds are sooooo comfortable. The staff are all very friendly and really do try to help with all your needs in a very professional manner. I usually stay in The Paradise Tower which has it's elevators right by the main entrance which for me (being a disabled traveller) is very convenient when you want to get out and see the strip. It's very nicely placed for the south end of the strip. The only down side with the hotel is a bit of noise from the street especially regular sirens from ambulances etc. But as you are right in the city I guess you can expect a bit of that and if you are a sound sleeper it really isn't an issue. Only other problem I have found is if your neighbours are not paticularly conscientious noise from them can also be a problem (yes I know it's a party town but there are plenty of places to do it without having to go mad in bedrooms imo). Security normally sort this out quite quickly if you feel the need to get them involved. I aim to be back in Vegas in October and February and as ever will be looking to stay at The Tropicana.

The casino is not overbearingly large where one can easily get lost. The cheerful service was fantastic -- no waiting for a bit of libation -- all with a \"you are our VIP SMILE!

The bathroom itself was a nice size, however you can tell that it did not get the same level of upgrade as the room did with the remodel. I arrived late on Wednesday evening and the casino was alive!

Their were plenty people outside sitting enjoying that area. The casino didn't smell of smoke either which is hard to find in Vegas. Check-out went smoothly as well it took less than 5 minutes. Their seemed to be a number of places to eat in the hotel, however we had breakfast at the Beach Cafe. They had an $18.99 breakfast buffet that boasted an omelet station, lots of fresh fruit, pastries and typical breakfast like grits, eggs, breakfast potatos, sausage, bacon, smoked salmon. It also came with sodas, juice and an assortment of tea. I thought the assortment was well worth the price. All in all, a great hotel.

They have more than surpassed my expectations during each stay and that is why they will continue to receive my business. I am returning this month and will be staying at the Tropicana again. The hotel is clean, bright and most everything is brand new. My favorite part of the entire hotel is the comfortable beds! I frequently stay in 5 star hotels and the beds at the Tropicana are better than most of the more expensive hotels I have stayed at. The pool is gorgeous and is a wonderful place to relax for the day. They have large, beautiful rooms that really make me feel comfortable while on my vacation. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I have never encountered a rude or unhelpful staff member. If you treat people with respect I find they will show you respect back. I have read several reviews off of this website and I would like to address the following things: 1) The club tower is NOT that far!- Seriously people how out of shape are you!\u2026It takes me about 4-5 min to walk to the club tower at a leisurely pace. Anyone who has stayed at other hotels on the strip knows how spread out most of the larger hotels are. The Tropicana is a small resort which means that you never have to walk very far! 2) I love how small and intimate the hotel is- Some people have complained about how small the Tropicana is in relation to other larger resorts on the strip. I see this as a huge advantage! Nothing is more annoying than being crowded in a casino or having to walk a few miles to get to your hotel room. 3) Location on the strip- Okay, yes the Tropicana is located at the end of the strip but again\u2026..how lazy are you! I love being able to walk and stay active while on vacation. If walking is not your thing then take the bus for a very cheap rate. I do have one complaint. I would like to see the Tropicana get rid of its resort fee. This would really set them apart from the competition! Honestly, the only reason I would not stay at the Tropicana again is due to its resort fee. There are properties on the strip that do not charge a fee and I would be tempted to stay there.

Anywho, I was disappointed but hoped that with the renovations my stay would still be a nice one. Well, apparently, the only renovated part of the hotel was the front lobby. The slots were okay, but the overall atmosphere was not 4 star at all. The only plus was that you could play the card games all by yourself or with your BF or GF and no one else would disturb your table. It was like a ghost town. I did not like the Tropicana enough to go a second time and anyone interested in going to Vegas on a budget...this is the hotel for you! It felt more like a Holiday Inn Express. No real Vegas feel at all. Even the bartenders were bored and unfriendly. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm in my late 30s and so is my BF so we're not some young punks looking to party, we wanted to sit at a sexy lounge, have a few drinks and enjoy each other. This hotel is just boring and only good for the low rate. Next time, I am going to stick to my guns and just pay the rate for the much, much nicer hotels on the strip.

Though, in all honesty, I would not give it the 4 star rating that Priceline did. As someone who travels extensively, and almost always uses http://Priceline.com, I can tell you that they are usually pretty spot on with their ratings... however the extremely small gaming area, the \"vintage\" looking architecture and the slightly tired looking cocktail waitresses and dealers, less than stellar bathrooms, etc... this is NOT a 4 star hotel, by any stretch. The check in area is very swanky looking, with it's white leather and tropical color changing lighting... it's very sleek. However, it really doesn't match the rest of the casino or hotel. It looks like they were trying to create a South Beach type vibe... and in my opinion, go big or go home. They went home. The check-in process was easy and the front desk guy was nice enough, but not the overly friendly type that we're used to seeing here in Sin City. One thing that did upset me, was the resort fee. Having just stayed at Mandalay Bay, also using Priceline, our resort fee (which I guess covers the wifi) was INCLUDED. Here are The Trop, we had to pay an additional $15 a day, making our stay here... even more expensive than Mandalay Bay, and so now I'm just a little pissed off. Our room was nicely re-done... beds are comfy, the room is spacious and it has a neat Florida look to it (bamboo, wicker, a lot of orange), plantation style shutters... but the bathroom really leaves something to the imagination and isn't nearly as clean as a bathroom should be, which is a huge problem for me, personally. Again, it was a go big or go home and they went home, once more. We encountered a very friendly players club employee, Jahmela, who should be snatched up by a better hotel/casino. She was the epitome of customer service. She was, unfortunately the highlight of our stay here. One perk of joining players club is that they will reimburse you for up to $200 of play (50% right away and the balance in 30 days). It's free to sign up, so do so if you're planning on gambling here. We also spent some time in the lounge area, playing video poker, while a band was playing. This area, particularly, really left me scratching my head. The band, wasn't great, and the music was just TOO loud. Really poor acoustics, I'd guess. Also in the same \"area\"... for seemingly no reason at all, there were gaming tables and each of the \"dealers\" were in lingerie. In the middle of all of them was a stage with a pole and a solo \"dancer\" doing a clothed \"strip tease\". Now, I am in no way a prude, but it just didn't seem to work. There was no real reason or theme or point to this tiny, sort of hidden area. Awkward. Several parts of the hotel, smelled like eggs... sulfur. Which was rather unappealing. The best parts of the hotel include easy access to a few other hotels (including Mandalay Bay, where we stayed for 3 nights prior to staying at The Trop for 3 nights, and I really wish we would have just stayed there... but we'd been wanting to check out the \"new Trop\"... so here we are, sorely disappointed). A couple other good things are that players club I mentioned above and they have an in-hotel Starbucks. Sadly, that's about it. I guess when I sum it all up, I feel like things aren't finished, but I think, as far as the hotel is concerned, they are. Which is unfortunate. If the idea was to \"change the hotel\" in order to remain competitive, I think they've missed the mark.

(Priceline and Kayak have it at 4 stars, I think it is totally wrong considering they have Cosmopolitan and Aria at 5 stars.) There are some good things at Tropicana. Free internet, nice room with upgraded vanity, bed and deco. The style they chose (Miami South Beach) makes it look a bit outdated already. The gym and pool are great. Gym is small but not a lot of people go there. Plus the view to the pool from cardio equipment makes it a easy to spend 30 minutes doing cardio. Weight equipment is limited but it has all you could need. Casino area looks fresh and it has good service (again not 4 stars but good). Location, great to walk to nearby places, a great plus on that. The bad parts. Overpriced in room dining. The price I got for my room is overvalued considering it's only $30 difference to go from Tropicana to Cosmopolitan. The bathroon was left with some tile that shows it was from 70s and limited amenities tell you it is not 4 star. The hallway smell is not fresh, not good either. Security should pay more attention to those who pass out on the hallway couches if this is a true 4 star hotel. Self- parking is very limited, but I guess you can always have a choice to valet, but again price per room is high and on top you keed adding. I felt nick and dimed. (Except for the internet, which in turns help you get some food delivered from outside the hotel and saves you quite some money.) The food was nothing to write home about, especially when it came to value. The A/C was cranked up as cold as it could get, outdoor temp was around 80. A/C kept up, I will not see it perform in July at 100+ degrees. Too bad I foresee this investment in renovation as not worth it, as it will bring new customer segment, but it will clearly ahd quickly tell some customers to stay away...and if priceline wants to keep their bid system working, Tropicana should be changed to a 3 star.

This was my first time to Vegas, so I was a little overwhelmed but settled on the the Trop based off of the rave reviews they had on their remodel (not to mention the fact I caught a good sale too) and booked a deluxe plus room. Before our trip I was in contact with Elsa from customer care and Monica a guest services manager. They were more than helpful in providing little extras to make this a special trip for us. We arrived at 10:30 am on Wednesday, granted check in is not until 3pm, I was assured by the desk clerk (cant remember her name outside of the fact she was an asian woman) that she would expedite a room for us and she would call me when it was ready (she said it wouldnt be more than 30-45 minutes), and almost 2 hours go by and no call. When I went back to the desk, she told me, it was ready over an hour ago. One other thing folks, if you think tipping the desk clerk gets you anywhere, this is not the place to be ( I tried to tip her a 20 and explained it was our honeymoon and well, I would have gotten better service from giving the 20 to one of the homeless guys on the strip)... We get into our room 1813 in the paradise tower, drop our bags and go out exploring for a bit. We had dinner reservations at 5:45 at the Eiffel Tower followed by O at 10pm. We head back to the room and my wife goes to take a bath. She was in for a big surprise when she found hairs from the nether region of a previous guest in the tub and stuck to the soap dish. I attempted to call Nicole and Elsa to for some assistance to no avail. Left voicemails and emails and nada, nobody in the hotel could tell me when they would be in much less who I could go to instead. None the less we had plans so I cleaned the tub for my wife and we went on our way for the night. Thursday morning, when we got up, I took a moment to take a better look at the room in comparison to the pictures online. I realized I was in a standard room, and this is not what I paid for. I attempted to call my contacts again to no avail and went down to the front desk to address the mystery hairs and the room. I spoke with an african american woman at the desk who seemed to care less about the fact of the hairs in the tub, and would only tell me that the room I thought I had booked didnt exist (there isnt one that faces the strip) and if I wanted a bigger room (never mind the fact i paid for it) I would have to move to the back tower. (A little background on this, in the 5 weeks prior that I had been emailing my contacts at the hotel, not once did anyone say there would be an issue with a deluxe plus room with a strip view.... Now I get told I would need to move the back of the hotel and face the airport?????). My wife and I dont get to take trips that are not family related very often, 99% of our trips are either to Florida or NY to see our respective families, so this was supposed to be a stress free get away. Back to the story, I was LIVID when I was told the room I wanted (and paid for) got booked the week prior because of a blackjack tournament... Um HELLO people I booked my trip 7 weeks ago....... The desk clerk handed me off to the front desk supervisor Gwen, I will give Gwen a lot of credit, she was more than fair and patient. She offered to move us to the back tower, (bare in mind people, the back tower is almost in another zip code), I told her my wife was happy in the paradise tower, so we would keep the room. Gwen promptly had a cleaning crew go to the room to do a thorough cleaning, and provided us with some nice comps. The comps made up for the \"extra\" I had paid for the deluxe plus room and we let it go at that. On the plus side Thursday I entered a Texas hold'em tournament and came in 5th, the \"pit boss?\" Todd, and the dealers were very pleasant to deal with (thank you Todd). Some of the other perks of the hotel include Biscayne the restaurant, we received a comped meal and I can say the experience was wonderful. Friday we had comped tickets for Recycled Percussion (something that was arranged prior to our visit), you need to bring your own drinks in to the show from one of the bars (not a big deal). Wednesday night I had hit up the Anhbar, played a little video poker and had some free drinks (bottled beer and a shot of crown), I ordered this a few times with no problem. One of the bartenders (DJ), told me since I was playing poker there was no charge, I was out of cash so I made him ring up a soda so I could tip him (thanks DJ for the great service), and Friday afternoon I was at one of the other bars and played a little poker and received my beer and shot of crown without issue at no charge. So before we went in to see Recycled Percussion, I went back to the Anhbar to play a little poker and get some drinks for my wife and I to take to the show. I sat down, put some money in the game and started to play. This older caucasian woman took my order, (a couple beers, a shot and some waters), brought me my drinks and told me it would be $25...... I reminded her that I was playing poker and I was under the impression there would be no charge. This woman almost read me the riot act to tell me it only 1 drink, per 20 minutes, per 20 dollars spent at the poker game. I really wanted to tell her where she could put the drinks, but I bit my tongue and let my dissatisfaction show in the 1 dollar tip I left (from someone who formally ran nightclubs and bars for a living, I would NEVER leave such a bad tip no matter how bad the service, but in this case, I felt the exception was justified). If you are curious about the Recycled Percussion show, it is a definite must see! We saw Blue Man the night before and this was a much better show! Friday night my wife and I opted to call it a night early due to flying out Saturday, here comes the Coup de gr\u00e2ce........ Remember that strip facing room of ours??? We learned real quick the view comes with a price on the weekends. All we heard all night was the bass from the speakers on the driveway roof blaring the music from RPM the club on the main floor... We were 18 floors up and all we heard until 4am was thump, thump, thump, thump thump thump........The sirens from emergency vehicles didnt hold a candle to this mind numbing noise vibrating the room.... In all honesty there were a few good points to our stay, but the comedy of errors with our room, lack of customer service from the front desk and 1 bartender, the very tight slots, and the noise left a very very bad taste in our mouth. I can honestly say most of the few thousand we spent this week went to MGM properties (and we came home with most of what we gambled), and from what we saw at the other properties, the Trop will not be on our list of places to stay. If you are budget minded and are not expecting much, this is the place too be.

First off, I have to get this one off my chest - while the maid service was very attentive, they did not really pay attention. I left my towels on the rack/towel bar for a reason (which they even had listed on the card - \"help us save water\"), but each time they were replaced with new towels. I don't understand why a hotel would claim to be green when they don't even follow their own \"rules\" about the towels. Minor detail...moving on. The customer service at their restaurants was horrible. Twice at the pizza cafe, our order was either messed up, or forgotten entirely. And the people working there were not friendly at all. They also came and stuffed their advertisements under my door at about 9:30 at night (which, since I was attending a conference, was when I was trying to fall asleep) and the sound of crinkling paper in my room scared the daylights out of me.

The Cosmopolitan was never in my plans for this 2 day birthday trip to Las Vegas. I decided to stay at the Tropicana because of the favorable reviews I read here on Trip Advisor (usually very reliable). Upon my check-in, I was charged an early check in fee (1:30 pm), but I was ok with that. I made the long trek to the Club Tower where there was 0 air conditioning and it felt like a sauna down that walkway. Once i got to the room, the room was absolutely HOT and STUFFY. Even my cousin who usually likes her apartment at 80 degrees commented that it felt hot. So I called front desk to ask them if we could get another room, but they said they'd send an Engineer instead. The engineer did come promptly and first words out of his mouth were \"It feels Cool to me\". He did end up changing the air filter (dirty) and said he'd make some adjustments in the chiller room, but that helped minimaly. The temp dropped to 70 and never below that (even though the thermostat was set to 60). So we laid down for a nap in this hot stuffy room, and all we could hear was the jackhammer from the pool area. The noise was unbearable. So I called front desk once more AND they told me that ALL double rooms face the construction noise. They acknowledged that these rooms were noisy, BUT FAILED to do so while we were checking in. At this point, I decided just to put up with it AND not let it ruin my birthday. Dinner at Diego at the MGM Grand was fine. Once we got back and went to sleep, I woke up at 4 am in a warm sweat. The room just felt Muggy like a summer day in Houston. At 7:00 am (with the jackhammer outside already blasting), me and my cousin had enough. She said \"I feel hot and if I feel hot you must be miserable.\" So I went to the front desk, and checked out. Worst part is that the front desk agent admitted that the rooms probably wouldn't get much more below 70 degrees. WIsh these same front desk agents would have told me about this and the excessive construction noise before I checked in. SO now im here at the Cosmopolitan. Why the Cosmopolitan? Well I told my cousin Id rather pay a premium than risk spending my actual birthday day in misery here in Las Vegas. I'll review the Cosmopolitan later, but so far it's a complete 180 from the Tropicana.

The good - Centrally located - very convenient and safe parking lot (only dept where The Trop truly excels...a rarity in Vegas) - Newly renovated rooms, everything works - good housekeeping The bad -lax security - nothing good to eat in hotel -Rooms have absolutely zero style (allegedly there's a Tropical theme here, other than a faux coconut air freshener, theme undetected) -no good attractions or shows in hotel - no frills architecture -no front desk to be found late at night...this happened to me several times...unheard of, and I used to tour for a living, so I've stayed in a variety of places from Ritz Carltons to Motel 6s. Basically ....in these rough economic times, Vegas has some fabulous places to stay for very low sums. There's no reason on Earth to stay here, as service and style are nonexistent. Thumbs way down.

The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the Strip as the monorail station is just across the road at the MGM Grand Hotel as is the bus stop for the buses to take you down the Strip to Fremont Street, a must see attraction. An added bonus is that as the Tropicana is near the end of the Strip when you catch a bus to go down the Strip you will nearly always get a seat.

Standard room had two double beds, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Lovely and clean and modern although the bedside lighting wasn't very bright and made it hard to read when in bed. The windows open so you can get fresh air instead of the noisy air conditioning although the road noise was loud as we had a room strip side room but earplugs soon sorted that out. No coffee maker/kettle just an ice bucket. Huge TV, iron and ironing board. Bathroom was large, towels were thick and fluffy and changed every day. Included toiletries were shampoo, Conditioner, moisturising cream and a bar of soap but no shower gel. All smelt of coconut which I'm not keen on so didn't make use of. Plenty of hot water and a good water pressure. The maids came in every day and did a great job and kept it spotlessly clean. Since it was a reasonably small hotel it didn't take long to get to our room. All in all very satisfied with the room. Check in/out was quick and no queue. Staff friendly Restaurants: we only tried Baccio on the second from last night. Food looked great but the two of us who had the prawn pasta were up all night with sickness and diarroeha the person who had the chicken was ok. We did go back the following morning to tell them that there may be a problem with the prawns and we didn't want anyone else to get sick but found out that they didn't open until 5pm which was no good as it was our last night and we didn't want to have to come all the way back to the hotel. The lady at reception when we checked out said we should have gone to security to make them aware. It would never have occurred to us to go to security to pass on a comment about the restaurant. Did visit nicer restaurants so we wouldn't visit Baccio again, was quite expensive as well. Pool - really disappointed as it was being refurbished when we were there. I'm sure it is wonderful when it is up and running. This was one of the reasons we booked this hotel as it said what a wonderful pool/pool area it had. We thought that since we were staying a week in Vegas we would have a couple of days relaxing around the pool to recharge our batteries from all the walking. We booked last April and there was no mention that the pool closes in the winter. The lady on reception said it states clearly on the website that it is closed until the end of March - yes it does now but it didn't last April when we booked it. It would'nt have been so bad if they had done the same as Caesars Palace and cordoned off the pool but left the sun bed area usable. There were only about 10 beds available for use near Cafe Nikki which were all taken. Resort fees - I don't understand these at all. Pool closed - so one facility not available. Why not do what most hotels throughout the world do, if you want to use Wifi then charge for it. Gyms, pools etc are free to use in virtually all hotels in any country as it is part and parcel of enticements to draw customers. Do feel at $14.99 a night on top of the room rate is very expensive when none of the things included we used or were able to as not in service. Also, when you read on here that the resort fee was waived for some people does make me cross. All in all the Tropicana is a good hotel if you get a good rate. Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff, close to the airport. $15 in a taxi. The only reason for not giving it 5 are the pool area being closed and the resort fee.

The room was ok, not as nice as other hotels we have stayed at in Vegas, but acceptable (with the exception of the Strip View).

The room had a large tv with a decent range of channels. WiFi in the room was intermittent; I had to sit by the bedroom door for consistent access. This is most likely due to the thicker walls from the older building. Again not top of the range but perfectly acceptable for this level of hotel. The negatives... I would have liked a coffee machine or at the very least a kettle, a common theme for me in Vegas hotels. As noted above, some form of refrigeration space would have been helpful; I like the odd in room tea or coffee and to store some soft drinks (not always the ones sold in the vending machines). Dining: I didn\u2019t try out any of the high end dining options but made use of the Beach Caf\u00e9 and Marketplace. The beach caf\u00e9 was very average although reasonable for the price whilst the marketplace offered simple decent quality food for the price. I was pleased to find a Starbucks on site, useful for a morning coffee and some cake. Casino: The casino isn\u2019t the biggest but it had a friendly atmosphere and plenty of people making use of the slots and tables. I liked the environment and would happily visit even if not staying at the hotel. Sports Book: This was old and dated, very American in terms of content, so I had to go elsewhere to catch some UK sports. I think it could do with some expenditure to bring it up to date. Pool: This was my main disappointment with the hotel. I had primarily booked the Tropicana for two main reasons, the newly renovated rooms (leading to excellent reviews) and the pool. As I found upon arrival, the pool was closed, not because of the weather as other reviews had indicated, but because they were still building it! Using a lounger on the grass isn\u2019t quite the same and really did spoil things for me. I raised this complaint with reservations, see below for details. Bars: There seemed to be one main bar which was pretty nice and had a good feel to it. I had a couple of drinks there and was happy to go back. It was a good place to meet friends and have a relaxed drink. Clientele: The Tropicana seemed to have a largely older clientele, more so than most other Vegas hotels I have stayed at. This is not to say though that there weren\u2019t plenty of business and younger customers. I thought there was a good mix and found it a good place to stay. Location: Towards the end of the strip I can see that the location could cause issues for some. For me it was perfectly fine, with easy access to the strip and all the action. If you want to party, I would stay somewhere more central, but otherwise the location was perfectly good. Gym: I did not check out the gym or spa. Other: As noted above, I raised an issue with reservations due to the pool being closed. Whilst unfair to disclose details, I was extremely impressed with the response and action that I received. The gentleman who called me was willing to do whatever was required to make me happy, offering me a huge number of options to make my stay better and compensate for the pool being closed. The service I received showed me that the Tropicana actually values its customers very highly and will really go the extra mile to ensure that they enjoy their stay. The way that the hotel dealt with my complaint was enough to make me go back on its own, not because of how they compensated me, but because they were so professional, understanding and willing to show how much they valued my custom. Overall: As a mid range hotel, I think this is an excellent choice in Vegas. The rooms are comfortable, the hotel is friendly and relaxed, the refurbishment gives it a more modern feel and most importantly, the hotel cares about its customers. If I came back to Vegas, would I come back to the Tropicana? Yes, no doubt about it. Would I recommend to friends? Yes, but it would depend on what type of holiday they wanted.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat alternative to Massive Hotels\u201d", "Author": "donald m", "ReviewID": "UR126705451", "Content": "This Hotel was recently renovated and it is a great bargain for the price and amenities.

The hotel rooms are all newly redone, very clean, the bed is EXTREMELY comfortable. Shower heads in most of the Club rooms are too low. Depending on how tall you are can be pretty uncomfortable to wash your hair. The location is great - at the end of the strip near the airport, however there is soooo much within a short walk - MGM, Luxor, Excalibur, NY, so no lack of things to do in the area. Another 10 minute walk & you're at Bellagio, Bally's, Caesar's Palace. This is not the hip hot place to be & be seen, however the warmer pool season may be completely different as the pool area is quite large & very nice. The staff is extremely service oriented & goes out of there way to help you.

After waiting more than an hour in line to check in, I was informed that the only rooms available were smoking rooms, even though I had requested a non-smoking room. I was told that there were no other options until the next day, so I accepted the smoking room for one night, and they put notes in \"the system\" to hold a non-smoking room for me the next day. After about a quarter mile walk (no lie) with my bags to wait behind a hoard of people to get on an elevator, I got to my residential ashtray. It wasn't just smelly, it was filthy. The next day, after a long day in a tradeshow booth, I patiently stood back in the check-in line for about 35 minutes, waiting for a front desk person to wait on me while at least 12-15 people walked past me to be waited on at the \"VIP\" desk area, making it painfully obvious that \"regular\" customers aren't valued there. When I got to the front desk, they had no record of my room change in \"the system,\" and the desk clerk had no interest in correcting the problem, until the desk clerk from the pervious day happened to come around the corner, and I asked her if she would please help, which she did. Then I had to walk the quarter mile to my first room, carry my bags all the way back to turn in my key before they would check me into the non-smoking room, and then all the way back again. My non-smoking room was much better, except for the giant (and I mean giant) stain on the floor. And while I was playing their slot machines, an employee came over to me and tried to sell me on a \"refunded loss\" program, whereby they guaranteed to give me back everything I lost, with certain restrictions. It turned out that was a total scam. As naive Vegas person, perhaps I can take the heat for allowing myself to be scammed, but it didn't help to soften the blow of the entire lousy experience at the Tropicana. I did have two positive things to share. The pool area was very nice, and I had several very good meals at the breakfast cafe (even though the hostess was absolutely clueless and unfriendly to all the patrons, and walked at a snail's pace to seat each person before walking at a snail's pace back to the front, as if she didn't have a care in the world; she was clearly in the wrong line of work).

From Excalibur there is a free tram South connecting to Luxor and MB properties, from MGM there is a Monorail to several properties on the South and North all the way to the LV Hilton(I think the fee is prorated).

There was a hiccup, we had requested the paradise tower as we had people who had bad knees in our party but we were placed in the club tower. The customer service agents waived our resort fees as a result. This was very nice of them. The club tower is not as far as people make out though and we had excellent views of NYNY and the strip. We were high enough up not to hear the club. Rooms The rooms were lovely and had the most comfortable beds! Miad service was excellent, the power shower was great also I could find no complaint with the rooms. Casino Small but smelled nice and fresh compared to other hotels that smelled of stale smoke. I liked the size of the casino and had some good laughs with some of the croupiers. Club Small but again handy if you couldn't be bothered leaving the hotel.

The Tropicana was convenient but the rates were $95 a night, which I thought was a bit high. I really think that the \"resort fee\" that so many hotels are tacking on to room rates are ridiculous. If you can't opt out of the fee it should just be included in the price of the room. The Tropicana \"only\" charged $14.99 compared to the $20.00 and up at other hotels. All I received for the fee was phone service and Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi did work, I had no issues. Check-in was slow, the clerks are friendly but they need more of them at the counter. I paid extra to have a room in the Paradise Tower but the clerk said they only had a double bedded room, instead of the King I asked for, with just a shower. The lights did not work in the bathroom but I could see that it was a roll in shower, which the clerk did not mention. I called the front desk and this clerk said he would have a room in half an hour and for me to just wait in the room. Luckily, he called back in 10 minutes with a King room. The bellman was very nice and the new room was much better. The room did look like the pictures on the web site, but the bathroom fan was very noisy and had a lot of dust on it. The tub could have stood some refinishing along with the tile floor but the sink and counter were very nice. The bed was comfortable enough and it had king sized pillows not those awful postage stamp pillows that many hotels have. On the hotel's key card envelope it says they are changing everything, so maybe they just haven't done the tubs and floors yet. There was some street noise to be heard even on the 14th floor but closing the shutters helped. I would think that the Club Tower would be quieter because it is away from the Strip. I didn't hear much noise from the hallway and just a bit of noise from the room next door. There was a rather strong perfume smell in the hallway that I could have done without but it didn't come into the room so I survived. I liked that I didn't have to trudge through a big casino to get to the elevators and the parking was much closer than at most Las Vegas hotels.

It's a very clean property, staff was friendly, check-in was fast (no line up when arrived at 10pm on a Tuesday).

And fortunately, I didn't smell any smoke anywhere else in the hotel or the room I stayed in. The rooms, casino and hotel in general are very clean and new-looking, no doubt in due part to a recent renovation they went through. I had a standard 2-queen room in the Club tower, it's a big enough room, nice bathroom with large two-person soaker tub, and great views of the Strip (my room was directly facing the MGM Grand & New York New York across the street). There's a nice big 42\" LCD TV with HD channels, unfortunately you cannot use any of the video inputs for your laptop/etc. The room has a safe for storing valuables... however, there is NO minibar/fridge and NO coffee maker. You need to head down to the Starbucks in the food court for that. Location is great, right across the street from MGM Grand, Luxor, Excalibur, New York New York, and a short walk up to Bellagio, Caesars Palace, etc. There's a bus stop right outside the hotel on Las Vegas Blvd where you can buy a ticket for the Deuce to go up and down the strip or downtown to Fremont Street, $7 for 24 hours. The hotel does not feel as \"large\" as some of the other hotel/casinos on the strip, and this means it's very easy to get around inside, and not a confusing maze to easily get lost in (the MGM Grand, for example). There is a resort fee (like pretty much all the hotels on the strip) that includes fast WiFi (some of the other hotels on the strip do NOT have WiFi!), free local calls, pool, etc. Unfortunately, the pools were closed for renovations when I visited (March 2012), but they look very nice!

There for 5 of us for this trip, we stayed for a week. I have to say that we will plan to stay at the Tropicana for every future trip to Vegas. We had arranged to have the hotel limo pick us up at the airport, our flight was delayed by three hours due to some weather issues. I was concerned that noone would be there to pick us up, as we came down the escalator there was our driver waiting patiently for us, so that was great !! We had a little glitch with checkin, our reservation was actually for the next day, but in no time that had gotten that straightened out and off to our rooms we went. The rooms were perfectly fine as they were the last time we were there. If you havent been to |Vegas, at night it can be noisy with the traffic , airplanes, helicopters, sirens and people....you learn to expect that your sleeps maybe interupted but I have learnt to accept that. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Housekeeping does a fine job.....The rooms do not have coffee pots but you can ask at the front desk and they will gladly supply you with one. The casino its self it alot smaller than others, but it it nice to be able find others that you are travelling with. The drink service is excellent, I think because it is smaller the waitresses are able to make their rounds fairly quickly. A couple of the guys that travel with us spent alot of time at the tables and they were very happy with the dealers and the service they received at the tables. All the staff we encountered were very kind courteous and helpful. There are numerous options for food as well....There are two restaurants up top a steak house and italian restaurant.....we didnt eat that either of these restaurants this trip, but we did the last time and they were both excellent....there is now a Starbucks---which is extremely important to me !!--and well as a little fast food/deli--they offer pizza, sandwiches, soup, fries,orings and breakfast sandwiches and stuff, as well as the naked spoon which is frozen yogurt, with options to make your own smoothies and stuff....There is also the Beach cafe, which has a full menu from breakfast options, salads, fish, burgers, prime rib and steaks.....Lots of options for any type of eaters. There is also the option to sit out of the patio for this restaurant and take in the beautiful garden area. Please note the deli and Starbucks are open 24 hrs.....There is an outdoor pool/pools the entire area is breathtaking, but I believe there were many disappointed guests as the pools dont open until April, so keep that in mind. There is also a fitness center, and also a full service spa....I am unable to comment on either of these, as I didnt use these services, but definately the next trip I will be booking a date at the spa, and then will be able to write a review. We are not clubbers ourselves, but there is one here---RPM-- I can tell you on the weekend that there was quite a line up to get in, so I guess that speaks for itself. As far as the location goes, it is on the end of the strip, I personally dont mind that, its minutes from the airport, the monorail is right across the street at the MGM, and that will get you down the strip. The Excalibur/Luxor/MGM and NewYork are all across the street with easy access, if you choose to walk around. There are also some fast food -Mcdonalds/ Quiznos/DQ and Pizza hut if you are looking for some different options....Overall I feel that there is no reason to stay anywhere else, we are extremely happy with absolutely everything that this hotel offers. I want to send out a BIG thankyou to Julie for helping me arrange everything....And to also thank her for all the little perks, I couldnt of asked for a better host !!

I was hesitant at first but decided to give the Trop a try when our much larger with kitchen 1st choice fell through. I did call ahead with several questions regarding some concerns we had...like no fridge in room, location of rooms, and amenities around. Unfortunately after 2 emails I only received replies back after our stay was over...sigh. The re-model looks to be completely finished and the standard was good for the price. As others have mentioned the coconut scent is strong and we did notice remnants in the rooms as well - tolerable but we would of preferred a more subtle scent or none at all. We ended up with 2 connecting rooms and one stand alone room all in the Paradise tower all double queen beds. The rooms were fine and connecting room was particularly convenient for the kids to run back and forth between during the day. As others have mentioned the windows are covered by horizontal wooden shutters but if you turn the shutters up and not down it does block out more light and wasn't a issue for us which we were concerned about with kids. The rooms have no fridge (they quoted us $25 per night extra to have fridge brought up) and no complimentary water but you do have a vending machine down the hall with drinks and the gift shop first level near the exit does carry all the basics...drinks, snacks, small sandwiches, etc.....You can also go the MGM casino floor for slightly larger gift shop with similar items. Otherwise walk further up the strip past MGM about 10 minutes to ABC store/Walgreens. The pizza and other basic items at the food court was fine and reasonable quality and price. We ate at Nikki Cafe for breakfast and did enjoy the buffet breakfast - Not too much variety but quality of what they did have was good and made up for the lack of variety. Location of hotel was convenient and being in Paradise tower was a short stroll the the neighboring properties. We saw 'KA' at the MGM which was also a short walk over. We used the monorail on the first day but ended up taking taxi's rest of our stay which worked out to be much more convenient and not much more in price. The casino at the Trop as the others mentioned was bright and dealers friendly. Although not very full it was probably one of the more fun atmospheres to hit the tables for the casual gambler.

It was old, worn out and smelled like cigarettes. Five years ago I walked through the casino on another Vegas trip and it was just depressing. Based on these experiences, I'll admit I was a little disappointed when it came up as a four-star hotel option on Hotwire. I shouldn't have worried. The minute I walked into the new Trop it became clear that it is not the same place. The lobby is white and clean with a hip modern look. I went with a couple of friends and we reserved adjoining rooms in the Club Tower. Both rooms had a view of the Strip, were a good size and had all-new furniture. The beds were clean and comfortable with nice linens and duvet covers. If I have a complaint it's that the renovations to the bathrooms are somewhat superficial. The tub/shower combo and toilet still feel a little cheap and to me that's the real distinguishing feature between the Trop and some of the higher-end hotels in Vegas. That said, as someone who normally stays at the Bellagio but wanted to save a little money on this trip, I could not have been happier with the Trop and would absolutely go back if I was in the market for a nice hotel that's a little cheaper than the five-star options. It was a pleasant surprise in every way. Even if I didn't stay here, I would definitely come back to gamble. The casino is bright, clean and well-lit. The dealers are friendly and pleasant and the crowd is \"normal,\" neither snobby nor trashy. The casino is also much less crowded than some others and has relatively low table limits. We were able to play $10 blackjack (with blackjack paying 3-2) and $5 craps even on Friday and Saturday nights without fighting crowds. There were also plenty of cheap slot and video poker machines.

I will try to break this review down into sections so people can pluck the information they require from it. Location At one end of the strip, with MGM Grand, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, New York New York's and Excalibur all within 5 to 10 minutes walk. It is only 20 minutes walk to the center of the strip where Caesars Palace, Paris, The Belagio etc are located. A trip up to Circus Circus or The Stratosphere (highly recommended) is a 10/15 minute taxi ride away. The best thing about the location for us was the close proximity to the Hooters Hotel, and not for the reasons you may be thinking! Vegas is a very expensive city to drink in, with most places selling bottles of beer at between $5 and $8. Hooters had bottles of Bud and Bud Light on what looked like a permanent promotion for $1.50. You can appreciate the savings, so we would always start our nights out here. It also has some of the cheapest tables to gamble at, not to mention the 25 cents chicken wings! Word of advice, get yourself an 'owl card', which is free, and you'll get discounts at the restaurant including this one. Rooms For the price we paid for this hotel we could not have asked for more! Huge rooms with comfortable beds, large safe, plenty of storage, massive flat screen TV and nice big bathrooms, all of which were kept very clean by the maids. The bathroom itself was the only bit which had only a partial refurbishment but it was still fine, the rest of the room however was brand new and looked amazing. The air conditioning was a little noisy but worked really well. The view we had from our room was absolutely awesome, straight out over New York New York, MGM and Excalibur, it was a great thing to go to bed and wake up to! Casino The Casino was all brand new and looked great, with a very classy 'light and airy' feel in comparison to some of the larger, older ones which seemed very dark, sometimes even a bit grim. It was however very small compared to most of the larger themed hotels, and lacked the buzz and atmosphere that made others so exciting to be in. Its worth visiting if you have a room at the Trop, but probably not worth a trip if you stay elsewhere. Which leads me onto the last part of my review, the hotel as a whole. Hotel/Resort The Trop is quite different to a lot of the other hotels we visited in terms of there doesn\u2019t seem to be the 'wow' factor get from other strip hotels. Don\u2019t get me wrong, staying here was awesome as it has amazing rooms at a great price, in a great location, with one of the best pool areas in Vegas, however I wouldn\u2019t necessarily visit it as a spectacle as I would others. It just lacks the extravagance and unique features of the other hotels that left me with my jaw on the floor: the fountains at the Belagio, the volcano at the Mirage, pirate show and Treasure Island, the sheer opulence of the Wynn and Encore etc. If you bare this in mind and treat the Trop as an unbeatable value for money base from which to explore the rest of Vegas, with a great pool to chill out if you need some down time, and beautiful modern rooms, you will not be disappointed!

My wife and I go to Vegas every couple of years. At best we would walk through Trop and wonder why anyone would stay there. It was a typical, older Vegas hotel. Bad smell, awful decor and just an \"old\" feeling. Kind of what Excalibur is now in my opinion. What a surprise. The Trop looks and is reborn. Common areas are bright and clean. The hint of coconut in the air keeps the place feeling fresh. The rooms are on the larger side and modernized as well. I found it refreshing to be in an actual hotel where everything is easily accessible and the service is great. We could walk in the front door and be in our 10th floor room in the Paradise tower in about 20 seconds. Try that at MGM, Mirage, Paris, etc. The Club Tower is a bit of a hike so be sure to request the Paradise Tower. Yes it is at the south end of the strip. However, you are a short walk from other resort hotels. The Monorail is also fairly close if you want to get up towards the north end quickly. Another forgotten plus is that you are very close to the airport. We didn't bother with the shuttle back to the airport and having to rely on their schedule and many stops. We left at the time we wanted and it was a $13 fare WITH tip. There is a Starbucks if you want disgusting, over-priced coffee, a good cafe (Beach) and other restaurants and shops.

We chose the Tropicana because we heard it was newly renovated and the price was too attractive not to make a reservation. Check-in: It was quick and efficient. We've stayed at other hotels on The Strip and have waited up to 30 minutes just to check-in, but perhaps because the Tropicana is still an unknown gem, our wait was less than five minutes. Our room: Our room was a very large room with two double beds in the Paradise Tower. We found the size comparable to what you would find in the MGM Grand Tower. The room had a flat-screen TV that was relative to the size of the room (it may have been a 42\" TV), and unlike other hotels, had channels that played commercial-free music of several genres. The only \"low\" point was the bathroom. While the room itself appeared to have been renovated, the bathtub enclosure seemed to have the same tiles as when the hotel first opened and the grab-bar was loose and almost fell into the tub. We booked our room without specifically requesting a tower or room. When we checked-in, we requested the Paradise Tower as many TripAdvisor reviews suggested. We were told that it would be $15/night more than our original reservation, on top of the additional $15/night resort fee. We went with it without debate. Our room faced The Strip, but toward the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. It was not a horrible view at all. The Paradise Tower is found at the front of the building, so guests do not have to walk through the casino to get to a room, which was a convenience for us. The location: The Tropicana is directly across the street from the MGM Grand (where we stayed in previous visits), so we were very familiar with the area. There is a transit stop outside of the hotel/casino that heads northward on The Strip. In general, the Tropicana is in a great location and is easy to access by foot and vehicle. The staff: Everyone from the reception desk to the cleaning staff to the 'food court' staff were nothing but pleasant. Our philosophy is that if you are nice and have a smile, people will be nice and smile back. The dealers at the tables were also very pleasant and seemed to enjoy conversations with tourists. Because of our flight, we had to check out around 4am. The Trop Plus rewards desk was closed, but reception was able to find someone quickly so that we can apply any credits we accumulated toward our bill. We found that the comps with Trop Plus were very generous, compared to other hotel/casinos. In our three night stay, we were able to have the additional $15/night Paradise Tower fee and our resort fees comp'd, giving us a $90 savings on our bill. A negative: Some people may not like the overt coconut/vanilla scent of the casino, but it grows on you. Plus, we much preferred the coconut/vanilla scent over the industrial cleaning soap scent that is at the MGM Grand. Also, our room facing The Strip made things a little noisy. We didn't mind, but others might not enjoy the sounds of ambulance sirens at 3am. Overall, give the Tropicana a try. They renovated the hotel and casino and it shows.

Previously I had stayed at the Palazzo and Caesars Palace. I admit, I had some concerns about staying at the Tropicana -- it didn't seem as \"flashy\" as other hotels on the Strip and I had never stayed at the south end before. However, during the particular week I was in Vegas this time, the hotel prices were unusually high and I was able to snag a room at the Tropicana through a special one-day 50% sale at Orbitz -- for about $63/night (+ resort fee of ~$16/day with taxes). So I took a chance and was glad I did! I think the Tropicana is my new favourite on the Strip. While it is not as opulent as the other larger hotels like Palazzo, Caesars, Aria and the like, it has been beautifully remodeled and the place feels brand new. More importantly, though, because it is smaller, it seemed also a bit slower and it didn't feel like the constant \"rush\" of Vegas...there were places to get coffee and sit and relax. Since I needed to get some work done while there, it was nice to be able to find a quiet spot in the lobby (of the Island Tower) to work outside of my room for a while. Let me also say that my check-in experience at the Tropicana was one of the best I've had -- and I've stayed in many hotels. I was checked in by Sheila, who was extremely friendly, helpful, and easily accommodated a number of my requests. An excellent first impression for the hotel. I had a room in the Island Tower, a walk from the Paradise tower which houses registration and the casino. Given the reviews here, I was concerned about this long distance between the two towers...but in actuality, the walk is not very long, and again it was rather nice to be at the quieter end. That being said, I'm a city dweller so I'm used to walking. My room was excellent -- everything was new and comfortable. Looked just like the pictures on the website. As other reviews have noted, the renovations were less fantastic in the bathroom--new countertops and such were nice, but some of the tiling was still older and not quite as nice as the rest of the room. Also, my bath/shower was on a diagonal, making showering a bit difficult. And the shower head was a bit low for my height, and it could not be adjusted. Otherwise, the room was great, and I would easily give it a 5 if it wasn't for the bathroom issues. I should also add that this was one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in -- hardly heard a noise from the hallway (and nothing from my neighbours) during my whole stay. The location, as it turned out, was great. Easy access to the MGM Grand through an overhead walkway, and the bus/monorail made it easy to get to other places. My beef is with the rather high costs for the bus and especially the monorail...but that is independent from the hotel of course. The Tropicana also has a little grill restaurant open late (maybe 24 hours?) which offered usual grill food at a reasonable price...which is also a nice change in Vegas. Also a Starbucks in the lobby. In short, if you're looking for the over-the-top, 5+ star, $$$$$ Vegas experience, the Tropicana may not be for you. But if you're looking for a simple, clean, and well-valued stay, this is it.

Had it been for pleasure my ranking would have been lower. I understand this resort hotel had a bad rap and was redesigned. Things did appear to be new and it seems the designer was going for a \"white, clean, and neat\" theme rather than something grandiose. The minimalist approach unfortunately did not work for me. In leaving the resort today, I have several positives but more negatives to share with readers. The facility is in a prime location, adjacent to the MGM, NY/NY, and Excaliber resorts. It is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the LAS airport. It is very clean and doesn't have a smokey odor. It has two high class restaurants (although I did not eat at either as they are quite expensive). There are shopping kiosks to pick up small gifts, incidentals, and groceries. Room service was prompt, polite, and my calzone was delicious. I asked for a room change and within 20 minutes a bellhop had delivered my new card key. I stayed in two different \"deluxe\" rooms, both of which were very clean, odor free, and I was not bothered by housekeeping. The first room was on the first floor (actually about 3 stories up). My second was on the 14th floor. I recommend a room with a king bed as it is a bit roomier and has a comfortable ottoman, unlike the double queen room. There was a great large screen HD TV in the room, the beds were ultra comfortable with no shortage of pillows, and the rooms were spacious. Here's what I did not like. The first two nights I had \"gansta\" neighbors that were so loud and belligerent, that I eventually had to change rooms - not the fault of the hotel. However, I called security, and after 40 minutes, there was no apparent intervention resulting in my room change shortly before midnight. As to the physical aspects of the room, first the windows do not open more than 6 inches so you cannot enjoy the cool dry breeze of southern NV. The windows are also covered with some sort of honeycomb filter that makes it impossible to take a photo of the Las Vegas skyline. On the lower floor I had to listen to the police sirens at night. On the upper floor, I had to listen to the helicopters as early as 7 am. There were minimal other amenities - no fridge, no microwave, and no coffee maker. I can deal with no being able to stock my room with groceries, but not being able to brew a cup of coffee is an unforgivable oversight on the part of the hotel and something I expect to have, even in the cheapest motel. I had to get dressed, take the elevator to the lobby, and then stand in line for 10 minutes to get coffee at a Starbucks stand (largest size 16 oz for $3.50, refills $2). The decor is very plain, geometric, modern-cabana-ish. The beds are all white linen reminiscent of a hospital, but I reiterate very comfortable. Check in and check out were hardly smooth, taking 15 and 10 minutes, respectively, due to a line similar to what I'm used to seeing in a post office -- a big long reception desk capable of housing 15-20 employees, with only 2 stations open, and on each occasion one of the stations was encumbered with lengthly interactions with just one customer the whole time I was in line. I was wondering if the staff were trying to sell a time share it took so long. On check-in the woman was terse. On check-out the gentleman was warm and asked how my stay was, but then excused my complaints as being the norm for Vegas. I don't gamble but the lobby and gambling areas seemed overly lit with low ceilings - kind of cramped and not very cozy. I did not use my laptop because you are charged for wi-fi service in your room. My calzone from room service was $21 plus tip. Overall, I probably would not stay here again, even if the price was lower. The limited aesthetics and lack of reception staff kind of did it for me.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOverall just an average stay...\u201d", "Author": "apsdtravel", "ReviewID": "UR125041053", "Content": "The trouble I had with the tropicana was how long it took to get to the room.

The bed was comfortable, the flatscreen TV was great, and everything was very clean. We didn't know what to expect in Las Vegas, but were pleasantly surprised with how clean everything at the Tropicana was, including the room. The room was in Paradise Tower and had a great view of the strip! The casino seemed a bit small compared to other hotels on the strip but it still had everything we needed. I spent most of my time at the blackjack tables while my wife spent her time on the machines. The dealers were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The drink service was better than any of the other hotels we gambled at. We got tickets to see the Recycled Percussion show and it was definitely worth it! Its a high-energy and interactive show that we both really enjoyed. If you are at the Tropicana, definitely go to the show, it was extremely entertaining. The one small downside was that the Tropicana seemed a little lacking in the shops and food places. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants (they looked expensive, but good) and found ourselves making a short walk across the street to have a cheap breakfast or indulge ourselves with a buffet. We really didn't consider it an inconvenience considering how close the shops and other restaurants were. All in all, highly recommended, and will definitely consider staying here again whenever we decide to return to vegas.

I became extremely busy here in NYC with back to school and work after we left Vegas. I stayed at the lovely Tropicana LV during January 25-28th 2012 with my boyfriend for his mini birthday getaway (my treat), which is his very first time in Vegas, and I was so excited to show him around. I booked an awesome combined flight (Virgin America) and hotel deal through bookit.com because of their BillMeLater payment plan (so i can pay 6 months later and use the money I had available for activities!) It was our very first time staying at the Tropicana LV and I loved every minute of it! The reason I gave them 5 instead of 4 stars is because of their very attentive friendly staff- hands down outstanding customer service!! From the doorman, to the check in, to the housekeeping, the host and hostess and all the staff we encountered daily at Cafe Nikki was very pleasant, and the staff at the Tropicana Lobby Giftshop next to the entrance was so amazing, especially the Filipina lady and another lady I cannot remember their names but my receipts says Chona and Michelle! I think just about everyone literally everyone we encountered was truly genuine with excellent interpersonal skills and that's really rare in the hospitality industry/ customer service in my opinion, so not only did we have a BLAST on the Strip, we looked forward every time to return back to our hotel. A big thanks to Kimberlee our check in agent, she upgraded us for free to a non smoking king size room in the paradise tower with the view of the strip on the 12th floor, and free daily breakfast buffet, and late check in! Words cannot describe how happy we were, she is just an amazing individual with a great personality as well! I emphasize this a lot because it is rare for us to encounter amazing staff and have good deep intellectual conversations with them such as in the Tropicana. It's funny when our check out agent asked how our stay was I was so speechless because words cannot describe what an excellent stay it was, I managed to mouth out \" it was awesome!\" and I bet she knew our stay was awesome too judging by the many great reviews. By the way check in and check out was super fast than I expected! I remember Alina our room attendant is such a sweetheart she would always write a note to thank us and showered us with extra bath and body products and towels every time we tipped her since we made a big mess in the room. We were greeted by like everyone of the staff, which was pleasant. You might think I'm crazy but I've stayed at the Trump and the Hilton and other hotels before but I never encountered this kind of experience with the staff members. You would think its a small boutique hotel were you know everyone. I wish we could have tipped everyone we encountered at the hotel but we would've ended up with a big hole in our pocket that's how amazing all the staff at the hotel were, I will bring more money for tips the next time... I forgot to make note of everyone's names, but they all truly made our stay welcoming and we didn't feel out of place (since I think we could have been the youngest guest during our stay- early 20's). I will definitely go back to this hotel and recommend people. The hotel's scenery is very beautiful I think its a perfect place for couples... I love the tropical feel I love the carpet and the smell of the casino I think was this light vanilla scent... usually I'm sensitive to smoke and strong fragrances, but it smelled very pleasant every time we passed by the casino! Also thanks to the staff in Glow to recommending my boyfriend a barber on East Tropicana for his haircut and shape up for an awesome value (we apologize that we couldn't afford the prices in Glow). The staff also recommended us to The Gun Store, which was so much fun! Last but not least, I am thankful for the staff that stopped us as we exited our hotel to go to a club, we walked right back in our hotel because he convinced us to attend the RMP Nightclub with free cover and free vodka open bar for ladies till Midnight!.... the RMP is in the Tropicana, although there were long lines the wait wasn't too bad at all. I had a great time at RMP, yes I did get super wasted I am so glad we stayed there its beautiful, the dj played GREAT music, it was a sorority night so almost everyone was in our age range, free drinks for me, they gave out free glowsticks, and best of all my drunk boyfriend was able to carry me back upstairs to the hotel room cause I was about to pass out!(lol). Oh and the bartender Phil (if Im not mistaken) is incredible, he has so many awesome moves and tricks- he was juggling the bottle and the mixer to make our drinks, BRAVO! He even assisted to take our pics and was very thankful for the tips (in NYC the bartenders are rarely thankful in fact they are stingy thats why I pointed this out). Because phil was so awesome I stayed at the bar after midnight when the free drinks were over and opened up a tab for my bf for his b-day night! Besides the outstanding service we received at the hotel, I just need to mention the other most important things about our stay was the fact that the hotel Jacuzzi was open 365 days of the year. Besides the great reviews that I researched of the hotel (in order to convince me to book) and the amazing affordable price- the fact that the outdoor Jacuzzi was available really nailed it! We took advantage of the Jacuzzi every day after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner, and even at 4am in the morning,lol. The staff provided towels for us- Iove how they are so attentive you may not think they are there, but out they come with towels! =] They have 2 large hot tubs, not everyone in the hotel took advantage of it so we had the place to ourselves most of the time. It may be winter season but by the Jacuzzi being available made our stay at the hotel even better. And the rooms is very spacious I was surprised, I love the whole design, it felt very tropical and romantic it felt like summer vacation for a winter season. Our room must have been renovated because everything was perfect (minus the itty bitty flaws that I noticed that obviously cannot be removed- me being ocd- such as the shower head was too low for my 6ft tall bf but its not the end of the world, he just had to bend his neck down to get his head wet which was uncomfortable since he has neck problems and it looked like there were permanent scratch stain marks on the bathroom floor tiles but its very minor, and I noticed a tiny stain on the shower curtain- like I said its just me being OCD).. besides this everything was spotless. The bathroom was big! And they had a shower pole for grip, and I love how the toilet was separate from the shower and sink! and the shower curtain pole was designed to have more space in the shower, two people can shower together! We had free wifi, and free usage of the safe, which we took advantage of daily. By the way my issue with the safe is that I think anyone can reset it and easily access it, because I found out by accident when I mistakenly pressed the wrong numbers and the reset button. I left the instructions in the safe along with my valuables (because im ocd).. but when you think about it the staff is most definitely trustworthy, so I felt more at ease later on. I absolutely love the closet with the large mirrors and the many hangers it came with!!! I also loved the whole design of the room, everything seemed perfect, it came with an ipod dock speakers so we blasted music, and a large flat screen hd tv!! Besides the AMAZING view of the trip , the best part of the room was the bed it was the most comfortable bed on the planet it was stuffed with many plush bedding's! I slept so good, it was so good that it was so bad when I had to struggle for my bf to wake up in the mornings and after his naps!! I'm not kidding!!! I barely watched a full tv show since I would literally melt away to sleep ;) I forgot to ask the hotel the brand of the bed and bedding's, I must have it! I most absolutely loved all the lamps that each came with an attached electric outlet unit- a must have! I even appreciated the bi tropical plant in our room and the photos. I appreciate every small detail even the ceiling had a nice detail to it. Overall the stay of this hotel was excellent, there were minor cons but it definitely did not overshadow the fact of how excellent our stay at the hotel was! The other cons that I will point out was there was an afternoon when the hot water was not working, it was on the warm too cool feel, and I am used to taking really hot hot showers not warm or cool showers but that quickly changed later by my next shower. There was also a time when we bought a wine bottle and we didn't have a cork and room service said they would charge us just to pop open our bottle, we of course went to the gift shop to buy one for cheap price. But I just want to point out a detail how room service came like in a minute or less after our call! Lighting fast service,lol! I also want to say the soda machine in the 12th floor for some reason wasn't accepting my dollar bills and the coin slot was stuck inside and didn't take my coins- these are all minor flaws that really didn't affect our stay in a negative way. I wish the was like a hot water machine so I can make hot tea or coffee, but its not a big deal. It also would've been nice to have a fridge but then when I thought about it we really did not need it! We had the ice machine on our floor to keep our liquor cool, and we did not order food through room service so we didn't need the fridge. The location of the hotel on the strip was perfect!!! Across from MGM Grand and Hooters and NY NY... and not that far to the Miracle Miles Shop. The location made the cab ride to the airport dirt cheap! =] I want to sincerely apologize for my late review and the fact I wrote an extremely long review, I couldn't help myself. But I hope this review helps!!! By the way this hotel should be ranked up to the top 10 hotels in Vegas because of all the great things I just mentioned that all comes with an an amazing value!!! =]", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sandy hook, MB Canada", "Title": "\u201cNewly renovated, old time hotel on the strip\u201d", "Author": "Cinderella1956", "ReviewID": "UR124934339", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised by our stay at an old time, but newly renovated & updated hotel in Vegas...

I wanted to write this right after I got back from my trip, but somehow never found the time to do it and eventually forgot about it. Our (my grandma and me) stay at the Tropicana was in June 2011 and my graduation gift. In the preperation process for the trip I contacted Nicole Marshall whether it would be possible to receive a room upgrade, since it was going to be my first time in Las Vegas, which she confirmed after a few days. Thank you very much, Mrs. Marshall! When we arrived at the Tropicana the first inconvenience was the fact that we waited in line for about 50 minutes although there were only 3 other guests in line before us. I think that 2 employees at the check-in desk are just not enough for a hotel with over 1400 rooms. When we finally stood in front of the lady that would check us in, she kept looking for our reservation in the system. It took her another 15 minutes to actually find it. Unfortunately she told us we would have to stay in a smoking room for our first night, because there was no other Strip View Room available at this time. Well, we weren't lucky about that, but there was nothing we could do about it. We were told to come down in the morning again, to check if another Strip View Room is available. The room we got the next day was great and made up for Besides this there was just one other unpleasant incident one day before out check-out. My grandma asked at the Concierge desk, if there was any possibility to weigh our luggage, so we wouldnt have to pay an extra fee at the airport. She was told \"Of course, just bring down your suitcase and we will put it on a scale.\" So, that's what she did... But instead of actually getting a scale, the lady at the Concierge desk apparently couldn't remember that she said that and told my grandma that there was no way to weigh her suitcase. When my grandma told me about that I couldnt believe it, so we both went down there with our luggage and suddenly the lady seemed to remember what she said and it was no problem at all to check the weight of our suitcases. I don't know if this was just a misunderstanding or if employees just like to kid around ?! Nevertheless, apart from this everything was really nice. The renovated rooms are fabulous and the beds are really comfortable! The pool area was a nice place to relax and catch some sun and the Southbeach Marketplace is a pleasant place to get a snack or a tasteful breakfast. I really recommend this hotel, because now, with the renovated rooms I think it really can compete with other big hotels on the Strip. Next time I will be in Vegas, there is a high probability that I will choose the TROPICANA again!

I was wary about booking this hotel as on previous visits to Las Vegas it had appeared run down and tired, but as we had got a great deal and heard good things about the refurbishment we decided to give it a go. I had emailed Nicole in advance (got her details via this website) to let her know it was my hubby's 50th birthday and if she could do anything special I would appreciate it. well, she emailed me right back with the offer of free show tickets which was really nice of her. When we checked in the receptionist said she had upgraded us to a junior suite - don't know if this was Nicole or not, if so thanks Nicole. The room was very spacious, with corner windows, overlooking MGM and Hooters, I think it is called a deluxe plus on their website. We had a super comfy, extra large king bed and large flat screen TV, really cannot say anything negative about the room at all. The bathroom was clean and bright, and maid service was fab. (we left the maid a tip every day and she always left us a wee thankyou which was sweet). We were in the tower which is furthest from check-in, and although I have heard others complain about the walk, you do get used to it, it really wasn't that far. The pool area wasn't opened in January but we had a look round it and I would imagine that in the warmer months, it is a great place to spend your afternoon,s - lovely pools with comfy loungers. We didn't eat in either of the restaurants or Nikki Cafe, so can't comment on these, although the steakhouse seemed very busy, so I assume it must be good. I would definately stay here again, the walkways over to MGM and Excalibur make it very easy to get around the rest of the strip, so the location definately wasn't an issue. Everyone knows that when you come to Vegas you do a lot of walking to get anywhere, and Tropicana is a good place to set off from. We've stayed in quite a few Vegas hotels over the years and I would put the Tropicana on a par with other 4* hotels we've stayed at, Luxor and Monte Carlo.

We didn't know what to expect, as we've only stayed in the MGM Grand, Luxor, and the Bellagio, but we absolutely loved it. In the five years since we've been to Vegas, the Tropicana is truly unrecognizable. It was open, airy, had an upscale tropical feel to it, and was FABULOUS. We had a late check-in (about midnight) and had no wait at all. We were taken care of by the super friendly ladies in front, and were given room 724 in the Paradise Tower. The elevators were close by, and we were immediately put into party mode as we heard the band jamming and saw the cocktail waitress pole dancing in the middle of the gaming tables. :) Our room was huge by Vegas standards and had two queen beds. The furniture was very nice, and the plantation shutters gave us an AMAZING view of the strip. Out of our window, we could see the Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay. Most importantly, we were pretty damn lucky in the casino downstairs. We took advantage of their \"free play\" rewards, and got back $150 to play in casino money. We had a couple of $400 wins as well (this was playing penny slots). We also had the opportunity to eat in the Beach Club for breakfast and we all loved it. Again, the upscale tropical feel was echoed throughout the restaurant. We also ate in the food court, and were pleasantly surprised by the food there as well. Lastly, the pool area is BEAUTIFUL. I can't wait to go back when it's open to try out the water slide. HIGH OH! I would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Vegas on a budget, as the rooms are absolutely STUNNING for the price.

I know Vegas and knew the Tropicana was a cheaper option and very close to MGM. I read up on its new look and 180 million rennovations and thought all my birthdays came at once when i got a 55 dollar a night deal on a sale weekend on booking.com. The cab ride is approx 10 mins and one of the girls at the hotel had replied to one of my emails re airport transfers to advise me of which way to tell the taxi to go to keep the fare to its 15 dollars approx, which all went smooth. Check in was excellent, about 5 people on front of me, and i was waiting approx 5 minutes. As a single traveller i chose a room with 1 bed rather than 2 (they ask you this). This was a mistake, as all single bed rooms are on the 1st few floors. My room had an air con unit outside, so after a quick call, i was moved to the 14th floor to a much larger room with 2 beds and a fantastic view of the strip. I was in the club tower i believe, its at the rear of the hotel. So...The hotel itself. Unlike most Hotels, the Casino is very bright at all times, white, white and more white, and my one and only complaint is the over powering smell of what I can only describe as like pot porri. Im guessing this is to eliminate the smell of smoke, great idea but mother of god its OVER THE TOP, so much so when you breath in you can tend to cough a little. You can tell money was spent, the furniture in the Casino was similar to the Bellagios, that cream leather and very comfortable feeling. The service at the tables was very speedy, all good! I never ate there so cant comment on the food. There is a small food court type thing with a starbucks. The one big positive I must give is the pool area. It was closed, but looks amazing. I dont realy understand why the hotel doesnt open the pool during this time to people like me, IRISH, who in 17 degrees go around in shorts and flip flops :-), probably looking very silly. But I understand, Im the minority and it probably costs a fortune to run the pool, so I just cold shower it instead !

A number of issues came up during the stay. First, on check in it was a bit slow but not bad. We were there a bit early and our room was not ready. The couple we were with did get their room so they said they would put our keys in their room and make it a priority. We came back to the hotel 8 hours later and no key. It was a big hassle to get the key, took a long time for the person to come up to deal with this and this was very frustrating. One day we came back late and there were no towels left in our room after cleaning. Not sure how this possibly gets missed? We also experienced some apparently drunk people trying to gain access to our room around 6:00 a.m. one day. They did leave and were probably in the wrong tower. Rooms are nice but the shades don't work well so it gets light very early. The location is not the best and if you are seeing a show at the Mirage or down in this area you are looking at a $12 cab ride one way or a 30 minute walk. Overall we were disappointed with this hotel and will not go back.

Have now stayed at Tropicana 3 nights in 2 different trips. Room Reviews: I have only stayed at the Tropicana twice since the refurb. As long as a room is clean and comfortable, I don't really ask for more from a Vegas hotel. I am not there to hang out in the room, as I can do that at home. I stayed in a comped regular room in the back tower (I forget what it is called). It is a bit of a hike from the front door, but a 3-5 min walk does not really bother me and the elevators are lightening fast and zip you up 18 floors literally in about 10 seconds. The room was bright, clean, comfortable bed, flat screen TV, \"free\" internet, work desk, etc. It was certainly nice and quiet in the back, with just a parking lot and the airport behind you. I ended up working several hours and had no issues with the internet connection. The desk is a tad high for the chairs, so I would not want to work 8 hrs straight, but comfortable enough for a few hrs at a time. I am not a fan of the scent of the bath amenities (shampoo, etc), but that is one of the last things I care about in a hotel. There is a Starbucks kiosk right at the elevators, so you can pop down for a caffeine fix quickly. My last stay, I was bumped up to a suite in the main tower with a view straight down Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure which suite it was, as it was a comped one night stay and I was not about to ask questions. The suite was huge. Probably 800 sq ft. It had a fridge, flat screen 2 couches, coffee maker, and corner suite so windows on 2 sides of the room. The separate bedroom was nearly as big as many vegas hotel rooms. It had a flat screen TV that matched the one in the suite area, and a very large bathroom. I was only there for about 10 hrs total, so did not get to really spend much time there other than the 5 or so hrs I slept. Very nice room though. Everyone I have dealt with on the Tropicana staff has been extremely friendly/nice and helpful. I can't think of a single interaction that was unpleasant during my stays there or when visiting the casino (which is daily when I stay at MGM). Casino: This is what brought me to the Trop a few yrs ago and made it my favorite. It is smaller than many strip casinos, but has the games I want to play. There are 2 craps tables and usually 5 or 6 BJ tables going. They have other table games (roulette, let it ride, etc), but I don't play those. The refurbished casino looks great. Everything is new and shiny. The main reason I like the Trop Casino is the staff, from the pit bosses to the dealers. Very relaxed, fun, and personable. You actually enjoy conversing with most of them while playing. They usually have a $5 craps table and at least a few $5 BJ tables, though there were more $10 tables than $5 tables during the weekend the last time I was there. Yes, many of the cocktail waitresses are over 40 and look it, but all are as friendly as can be. I don't go there to ogle the cocktail waitresses ... I go to gamble. (Note: If you want a pleasure pit type environment and crappy BJ rules, hit up NYNY next door). The drink service is usually quite good at the tables, though there is an occasional 20 min or so lull where they are scarce for a bit. I can usually get drinks as fast as I can put 'em down. Hotel Restaurants: I must say I don't eat here much, other than a quick late night bite at the deli/pizza place. They do have mostly higher end restaurants from what I have seen. Plenty of fast food type places at NYNY and MGM, both of which are a 5 min walk from Tropicana. Pool: Went to the pool one afternoon last year, and I think additional refurb has been done since then. No complaints about it. Not as large as the MGM pool area, but plenty of chairs and not too crowded. It was late september, so not really prime party season (it was as lively as the MGM pool, which I also went to). Overall, for a mid-tier hotel, the Trop is one of my first choices in Vegas. I typically go there to gamble quite a bit whether I am staying there or not.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasil", "Title": "\u201cExcellent !\u201d", "Author": "carpor", "ReviewID": "UR124011685", "Content": "Beautiful hotel with large rooms, amazing pool, friendly staff and a very good price.

Got a good deal on Priceline so decided to give this hotel a try. Location is good, close to several restaurants and other hotels/casinos. However, it is at one end of the strip, so not real close to mid strip...which means a lot of walking. (Food court with Wendy's, Sabaro, Del Taco, Subway, and a couple other places real close for resonable food), also a La Salsa (great breakfast special for $3.95), and a Denny's close for other resonable food. Had a two queen bed 18th floor room (had confirmed a King a two weeks before arrival, but upon check in was told they didn't have one). Had a nice view of the far south end of the strip, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay. If you want a view up the strip the other way...those rooms cost a little more. Room was more than adaquate in size, but did not have any \"extras\" (coffee maker, fridge, etc.). Decor is vibrant and refreshing, beds/pillows very confortable. Only main issue with the room was housekeeping. The room was clean - when they cleaned it...but had a hard time getting them in there to do it. So, here's the story... 2nd full day there went out all day and came back at 3:30-3:45pm to an unclean room.. a bit late in the day for the room not to be clean. Wanted a nap so called room service and said they'd send someone right up....waited an hour and still noone. Finally chased down a room service cart in the hall and gave them our dirty towels for soime clean ones, and told them not to worry about the rest of it. Not a good display, but figured OK, it's Saturday and they are busy. So next day, out all day again (and walked past the cart cleaning the room next to ours when we left first thing in the morning), came back again between 3 and 4 and room not cleaned. Hubby walked two doors down across the hall and asked the housekeeper there if she could do our room next, and she said wasn't her room and she'd have to call her supervisor. Didn't want to wait an hour for noone to show up again, so decided to ask front desk if they could expedite some service. To their credit, the front desk manager was very apologetic and said this is not a normal \"service\" level for them. He even comped us a dinner for our trouble and got the room taken care of right away.........here's the kicker though. That night (or actually next morning) at 3:45am! we were woken up by the door slaming in the room right next to ours and the vacuum going in the room, and out into the hall in front of our door. So, we go out all day for two days and can't get our room taken care of, and then at 3:45am their cleaning the room next to ours and making all kinds of noise when guests are sleeping. I have never stayed anywhere with such crazy housekeeping service. The rest of the staff was very nice, the Niki's Cafe restaurant was good, and the casino was alright (a little small, but OK). Guest Services Manager Nicole was outstanding and answered all our questions before and during our trip. There is a stop for the Duece bus right at the hotel so makes getting around easy. Taxi service is $11-$15 or so, same or less than a shuttle and direct service. All in all, for the price we payed it was well worth it...for full price at over $100 a night, probably wouldn't say here again (too many other choices at that price point).", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "lynne42england", "ReviewID": "UR123956734", "Content": "we visited this hotel in January 2012. it is undergoing a lot of updating.

I chose the hotel because of the good reviews and the reasonable prices (I was able to get a special 24hr sale - it's worth it to suscribe to their newsletter if you plan on booking a room there). Check in was very fast, friendly and efficient. They gave us a 2-queens bed room, in the closest tower, facing towards Tropicana blvd (we had booked a Strip view room), with a view of the MGM Grand, on the 12th floor. The room itself was bigger than we expected! I liked the look, and it was very clean. Good bathroom, good beds. The wireless internet worked perfectly and I used it a lot. When we arrived, there was a problem with the in-room safe (the door couldn't close because there was some kind of metal thing sticking out). I called the reception and 5 minutes later, someone was there to fix it. We had some poor timing with the maid services after our 2nd night, so the room was only done once. However we went to the front desk the day before leaving and they were able to accomodate us with a late check-out (free of charge, at 1 PM). We tried two of the restaurants, Bacio and Caf\u00e9 Nikki. Bacio was superb, and excellent value with the prix fixe meal for early birds (jetlag helped us on that one!). Caf\u00e9 Nikki was more standard, with ok food and service being slow. We couldn't try the pool as it was closed in January. The hot tub was open but we didn't get the chance to try it. I liked the Casino's atmosphere (and smell!); it was not too dark or crowded, even on the week-end. Our room and hotel felt like a safe haven after walking all through the Strip. The location was ok, farther from the heart of the Strip than bigger hotels, but still next to a bus stop and right by the airport. Proximity to the MGM was also a big plus.

Rooms: We stayed in the Penthouse Loft and a 2 bed connector. The rooms were recently remodeled and very spacious. Clean enough that i felt comfortable walking barefoot on the carpeting in the room. The view was amazing, All different parts of the strip. The penthouse loft had a spacious living area, dry bar with built in fridge, a downstairs bathroom, an eight person jacuzzi that we used every night. then up the spiral stair case with a very nice size bathroom with another jacuzzi, stand in shower, toilet area and a big double vanity and even the bathroom has a nice view of the strip. The connector was a standard two bed room but it was also set up very nicely. Casino: some might consider the casino table game area small but i think it's more personal that way. I like to get to know the dealers for a better stay. Eats: Though it might not have many selections i enjoy eating at Biscayne and Bacio. We also had visited the Nikki Cafe. Room Service was above par from what they usually would offer. I enjoy the \"Market Place\" for a late night snack or something on the go. Service. Guest Services accommodated every request i had. Even when i need 20 towels for the hot tub cause we had a few friends over. Everyone was very helpful from valet to concierge and everyone in between, such as where to go for good eats or shows to see or activities to do. A few occasion through-out the stay we arrange for the limo to travel in style, well worth the small fee.

Since the weather was near freezing and there were high wind advisories during most of my stay, I was not able to enjoy any of their pool amenities which were all outdoors.

First time staying in the Tropicana, but it won't be our last. If like us you remember the old tired Tropicana from a few years ago you are going to be pleasantly surprised by the renovations. We stayed here for the CES convention having got a reasonable rate via the convention. Have to say everything from start to finish was very impressive. We had to make a few changes to dates on both rooms we booked. Noriel in reservations was quick to respond to us and very helpful. Check-in was via their temporary check in area (the new one will be open now). This was efficient and friendly. This something that was characteristic of all of the staff at the Tropicana. Maybe it's because it's not one of the big monoliths on the strip that it allows them to provide this friendly service. But it's probably about hiring good people and keeping them well motivated. The room was clean and fresh. Nice contemporary muted colors and the all important comfy bed. Nothing to complain about here. Good TV with proper HD too (we are geeks \u2013 these things are important). Bathroom had been refreshed too but nice to see they had retained a full size bath tub. Although it was in the Paradise (Tiffany) Tower facing the airport there was no noise. Aircon was quiet too - sometimes that can be real clanky in Vegas for some reason. We ate in both Biscayne (Steak) and Bacio (Italian) both very good an reviewed separately. The Ambhar lounge was a good 'watering hole' especially when the iCandy girls were performing (don't tell me that was their last night? Bring 'em back!).

While it was a bit inconvenient ($9 taxi rides each way), I think I made a good choice. Most of the Tropicana has been recently renovated, and it's updated and clean. My room, a \"Deluxe\" room, was more than adequate. Comfortable bed, large HDTV, quiet. I stayed in the closer Paradise Tower, which I highly recommend. The casino was a good size, not as large as others I visited, but more than adequate. The dealers were friendly, and while I played some blackjack and slots, I'll leave the gambling reviews to those more experienced and qualified. My one quibble with the Tropicana is its dining options. I traveled alone, and didn't have an interest in the more upscale hotel restaurants. They probably wouldn't have been my choice even if traveling with my wife. But in a moderate scale hotel like this, there should be a lot more casual dining choices. There's a Starbucks, a pizza/sandwich shop, and a yogurt store. This is a weakness the hotel really should have addressed in its remodeling. Still, a good experience.

The first thing I have to say about Trop LV is that the customer service is absolutely outstanding. Every single person that we encountered in the hotel, at every level, throughout our stay was helpful and accommodating but never intrusive or over the top. We were always asked how we were enjoying our stay and whether there was anything the person could do for us - even when we just ran into someone in the elevator. They are clearly focusing on customer service, and in an era where the concept doesn't exist in many places, it was so nice. Additionally, when we returned home and I had a question about something relating to the newly opened spa, I received an email directly from the VP of Hotel Operations and he continued to correspond with my until my questions were fully resolved. The rooms are fantastic - beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable and spotless. I am extremely picky about hotels, particularly the beds and pillows (we have a Tempurpedic bed at home, and it's had to sleep on anything else) and will therefore only stay in certain hotels. I'm happy to say that Trop was a fantastic home away from home for a week - probably the most comfortable bed second to my own I've slept in. Bathrooms were great and beautifully decorated; the shower was hot with plenty of water pressure. We loved the size of the hotel, casino, etc. The hotel has two towers - one closer to Nikki Beach and one directly above the casino. We didn't spend any time at Nikki Beach - weather was too cold for it, but it looked beautiful. We requested a non-smoking room on a high floor in the Paradise tower above the casino and it was perfect - close to the hotel entrance, easy in and out and quiet. One night we did have a small problem when a family with small kids moved in next door and the kids were screaming and loud at 6 am. We called down to the front desk and it was immediately taken care of - no more problems the rest of the week with noise (again, great service!). Location of Trop is great - free shuttle to Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay right there and getting around is very easy. Loved the 24-hour Starbucks in the lobby - common in Vegas hotels, but still fantastic and a definite perk for me! Thanks Trop LV for the best Vegas stay ever - we won't even look at other Vegas hotels anymore - we are definitely staying at Trop when we are back! If you're considering Trop, just go.

I was assaulted with $15 a day resort fees but was told at least I would have 24 access to their pools and saunas - except that the pools are closed and as I would soon find out, the saunas are anything but free. The room was about a 3.5* with awkward shutters (no blackout shades) and tv channels that sometimes didn't work. When the time came for sleep I noticed there were no feather pillows and called the front desk which never once picked up right away. I was told \"no one has feather pillows here\" with the suggestion that why should I be so special. Well, I reminded them that they purport to be a 4 star hotel so how could they not have feather pillows (and only lumpy foam)? I was put on hold and then told housekeeping would look into it. Well 5 minutes later two maids brought me comfy feather pillows. It's way long to get to and from your room and all the food there like the rest of the strip is overpriced. A cup of Starbucks coffee is at least double and one night a Starbucks guy asked me for ID when I bought a 54 cent cup of hot water....ridiculous. On my final day I checked into their swanky new spa/gym as I did the first day but this time was jolted by a pushy woman claiming to be the manager. She asked me to sign in similar to my first visit with another employee, however, insisted I wear a pink bracelet - a first in any hotel gym I have visited. I felt like I was being branded in WW2 Germany. Did she have an armband for me too? When I reached for it she said \"No - you will wear this or I'll call security.\" I looked around and there were exactly two other people - both women - in the gym. Little did I know that wasn't the end of her security threats. When I went to the change room to change (like I did the first time without incident) the hyper lady actually came in to the mens change room and began to yell at me \"what did I tell you you have to pay more or leave!\" Apparently the change room and steam room is not free contrary to what I had been told at check in and contrary to my first spa visit. I told her \"no, I'm not leaving take it up with the front desk.\" She stormed out and made threat number two about calling security. This is all before I have even had coffee for the day. When I complained directly to her that I've had it at this hotel with the lies and the overcharging she said she could have upgraded me but since I was rude now she wasn't going to. She then called security while I had enough of this harassment and told her to tack the fee onto my hotel bill and continued on the treadmill. When two security people arrived I explained the situation then returned to the treadmill and magically was \"upgraded\" after hyper/pushy lady apparently gave an embellished story about me \"reaching over the desk.\" After this nonsense I was left alone - and the problem? A whole $18.00. She already had my room number and should have just added it to my hotel bill if she was worried about it. This hotel has some qualities of a four star hotel but overall is a disjointed, unprofessional, money-obsessed crass pathetic holding cell. However, if you are blind and deaf with no olfactory function and love to be harassed and disappointed then this is the place for you!

We planned to leave on Sunday so we wondered about finding an inexpesive but nice place to stay for a beyond reasonable cost. It was, afterall, New Year's Day. We selected the Tropicana and go tthe room for 5 nights for about $220 including taxes! I was very happy and the reviews on TA seemed to support this choice although I was concerned about the number of smoking comments...off we wnet with fabreze in hand! We arrived to a beautiful hotel outside. The bobbies were attractive and very \"South Beach.\" This is their motif and it wworks. They pipe in a tropical fragrance that works. However when you walk all the way in you are hit with the cigarette smell. It is pretty strong but as we discovered once you leave the gaming area it is no longer a problem. The registration desk was in the last throes of being overhauled when we were there so our registration desk was a small area outside the Poker room and Sports Bet. This is due to be completed near the end of January, in time for the Super Bowl. We were checked in by competent and helpful staff. Make sure they know what is a priority for you. The front tower will allow you quick access to the casino and dump you out on the strip with little walking. The back tower is nearer the pools and convention areas but is in the far corner of the property from the strip. If you have a car parking is easy to both towers so I would choose the back tower next time...we were in the Paradise Tower (close to the strip) Once you ar ein the elevator all of the smoke issues dissappear. The interior is warmly decorated maintaining the South Beach feel and the coconut air fragrance. Our room had wonderful quality sheets and a huge number of pilllows. The TV is beautiful but just a clunky and horrible as all TV channel selections usually are with all of the hotel junk and oddly placed channels (you know...different from home) but you arenore to watch TV, right? There is free Wi-Fi but I did not attempt to use it. I did not study the alarm clock, so it may have had a dimmer but holy Bat-Light was this thing bright. I put a pillow over it. The outside of the ENTIRE casino is white. The windows are covered with a \"wrap\" like you will see on busses. This is a while vinyl that has thousands of micro holes in it so you can see out from the inside. I am sure this keeps the heat down and preserves the white outside they are trying to achieve. It is very difficult to look outside if you are close to thewindows. The windows open about 4 inches but if one were to bring a torx screwdriver this could be remedied! The shower really was wonderful with aquality head and really plentiful towels. Now, they had the same \"save water\" signs that all hotles do but no matter what we did we had new towels everyday. I even put the sign ON my towel one day and it was new that afternoon....or folded to appear to be a new towel. However it did not seem to be an old towel even a folded one..you know, you can just tell. One day, late in our stay we encountered a baby moving in next door. We have kids so we understand but after 45 minutes of non-stop screaming I called security. (I should have knocked on the door but I thought maybe they would move one of us, an option I could not offer). Anyway security showed up, the baby was quiet and for some reason housekeeping brought us a bag of shampoo, conditioner and lotions!?!? I thought they had moved them but I heard the baby the next morning, maybe they just thought the child could not be heard...I kind of felt bad for not talking to them. We tried all of the restaurants but Biscayne and all were good (find reviews). Starvbucks is open 24-hours which is good because there is no in room coffee and a room service carafe is $12 (plus 18% gratuity plus a delivery fee...a $9 cup of coffee all told). Parking is easy and free, access is easy if you are arriving but you must plan you departures because you will only leave in one direction since this corner is soo busy. The tram on the west side of the Strip is avaialble across the street at Excalibur and the Monorail is across the street at MGM to get you all the way north past the Las Vegas Hotel (nee Las Vegas Hilton which was renamed on January 3rd at the end of their franchise with Hilton hotels).

I had to spend 10 minutes on the phone with the booking agent while I was checking in, for the Hotel and the agent to get it all straightened out, which, they finally did. But once the registration snafu was ironed out, really, I couldn't be happier with the place, especially at the great rate I got. I think most resort fees are a rip-off, but the fact is, even with the resort fee included in the total rate I paid the Trop was clearly a better deal than where I had been considering staying. I did at least make extensive use of the wi-fi that the resort fee got me. As for the hotel facilities, I was really impressed with how well they have been spruced up since I had seen the place 5 years ago.

I don't like the smoking environment in casino area and hall way in every hotel because smoking is allowed in casino areas and restaurants. This bothers me a lot. Biggest fear during our stay in this hotel is somebody broken in my room in early morning on Dec. 31, 2011. Fortunately, nothing was stolen and nobody got hurt. The situation is on Dec 31 about 5:50am, I was waked by trying to open door noise. somebody tried to open our room door for about a couple minutes, he/she didn't make to open. Then, I heard trying to open next room door, and I heard the door open and close. I thought perhaps somebody mistakes my room for his/her. I was kind of relief. But, a few minutes later, somebody tried to open my door again and this time he/she did make it open. I can see the door open in the mirror from my bed and the light was turned on. Somebody tried to get in. I shout out \"who is that?\". He/she left without a word. The door was closed after him/her. My husband and I had a pause. After about 30 seconds, my husband opened the door and look around the hallway and didn't see anybody. I called front desk to report this incident. A lady from front desk said she will call security rightaway, but we waited 50 minutes, nobody came. I called front desk again, a gentleman said \"I'll call security right now\". After about 15 minutes, nobody showed up. I was so worried about our safety and I went to front desk to have my room keys re-programed and told the story again to the gentlemant at front desk, he said the same words \" I'll call the security and check the system to see who used what kind of key opened the door\". However, nobody came to my room and nobody tell me the result of the investigation. On the New Year eve day, the hotel was very busy to get organized for New Year eve big party, maybe they don't have time for my issue. Anyway, since nobody got hurt and nothing was stolen.

We had three rooms in the Paradise Tower which was a great location as it opens right into the casino. The casino is smaller then many of the other hotels on the strip, however it was very manageable for my elderly mother. The hotel and casino are attractive and bright, unlike the darker casinos of neighboring hotels. The rooms are clean and comfortable and we never had to wait for an elevator. Our rooms faced Las Vegas Blvd and the Excalibur, which was a beautiful view, but kept some of our party up at night due to the frequent ambulances that ran up and down the strip during the night. Only experienced one rude bartender when we accidentally walked out of the elevators the wrong way into the High Rollers area with kids where she instructed us to \"keep walking\". The food at the hotel was very good, although limited in choice. However, this was not a problem as it is a relatively short walk to New York New York and the MGM buffet, which we enjoyed.

First, I am greated by a heavenly aroma when between the glass doors . . . it's so pleasant and inviting. Also, every time I walk through the doors, often held open by a valet, I feel as if I'm coming home and can hear \"welcome home\" being whispered as I step through the doors. The front tower (Paradise Tower) is very convenient - just a short elevator ride to your room floor. However, I recommend trying to get a room in the back tower (Club Tower). It's a longer walk to get there but the view of the strip is superior in every way and you don't get the traffic noise that you will hear if in the front tower. The corridors are surprisingly quiet for a casino hotel. The rooms might not be as fancy as some of the other high dollar hotels, but they are very clean and extremely comfortable. I'd love to take one of their mattresses home with me. In the casiono our waitress was quick and courteous. Just when our drinks were almost empty she would appear to ask if we needed another, and she had them waiting for us on her tray. It was the best drink service we received during our entire visit. When at other casinos we often had to chase down a waitress or couldn't find one at all. Not so at the Trop. We always were greated in a friendly manner by an efficient waitress. I'm always surprised the casino at the Trop isn't filled with patrons. The casino is neat and clean, there is a great variety of games to select from, and the slots give back as much if not more than they take, making for a pleasant gaming experience. Also, the choice of slots is a perfect mix of older favorites that are hard to find and the newest on the market. Bottom line is I feel like the Tropicana is one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas. It is a perfect mix of classy sophistication with the intimate feel of the smaller casinos from years gone by. It is by far my favorite hotel and casino on the strip.

Needless to say, the Tropicana doesn't really have the same \"WOW\" factor as many of the other hotels on the strip, but really, you get over that pretty quickly (besides, how much time does someone spend in their room in Vegas?) My only few suggestions would be: a) Yes, the $20 trick works here (found this out afterwards...oops!), so don't hestiate to try. That being said, even the basic rooms are super clean and spacious, so you'll be fine either way b) If you're nice to the front desk, they usually have extra coupons to give you for free drinks, discounts/free food at their restauraunts and so forth. c) The resort fee can be waived if you (again) ask politely at the end of your trip - otherwise, the $10 is still pretty decent value.

And if you want a cab, the line is never long. Rooms \u2013 I booked a Paradise Suite. Great room and terrific layout. Large living room area with plenty of seating, fantastic view of the strip, refrigerator, coffee maker and 42\u201d flat screen TV. The bedroom had a king sized bed, large closet, safe and sitting table, with plenty of room for luggage. The bathroom was very functional, maybe a little light on shower water pressure, but nothing to complain about. It came equipped with sundries, plenty of towels and a hairdryer. The Paradise Suite is located in the Paradise Tower which is closest to the front of the property, so it was just a short one minute walk to get outside; extremely convenient. Gaming/Restaurants \u2013 It\u2019s a full service casino complete with a very nice sports book. I must admit I never got drawn into the craps table which is what I usually play, but I like to be with loud groups and it never seemed to be going that direction when I was in the casino. The dealers and staff all were very friendly and I did end up winning some on the slots. I only got a chance to eat in Caf\u00e9 Nikki but did so a number of times and was never disappointed. If the NFR schedule allowed I would have certainly dined their Italian restaurant as I hear it is quite good. Bars/Entertainment \u2013 I always come to the Trop during the NFR and take in the comedy club. This year I was fortunate enough to get to the 2nd to last performance as apparently the club is closing at the Trop and reopening at the MGM. Too bad, I always love the Trop\u2019s venue. Not sure what they are putting in its place, the comedians joked about a restaurant/bar/swimming pool\u2026 guessing not! The main lobby bar has live entertainment and while I was there it was titled \u201cEye Candy.\u201d Yes it was. Great dancers, sexy music and very fun. The drinks aren\u2019t bad, the staff is relatively attentive and it\u2019s a pretty inexpensive way to enjoy part of your evening. Don\u2019t waste your money on Crazy Horse or Jubilee, just go to the Trop and enjoy a drink and the show. Staff \u2013 The 1st people you meet are the Bell Hops, and they do their job well and with a smile. The gentleman who brought the luggage to the room was even so nice as to offer to go get ice so the party could start. Our maid was phenomenal. I don\u2019t know how she cleaned the other rooms after being so through in ours. She noticed the coffee was all used and offered to leave more than the usual supply, we were never without bottled water, towels, clean sheets, clean everything. The front desk staff was courteous and friendly. The only complaint regarding the staff would be the IT personnel. Our room had the wireless router for a couple other rooms, and it quit working. After having people in the room to fix it, it still was not functioning so upon calling down to the desk they connected me with IT. The young man at the other end of the phone did not have much experience with Iphones and their Wi-Fi properties, which he proceeded to tell me each time he tried to get it to hook up. Of course I\u2019m not going to be mad he doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience but when he gets frustrated and wants to vent to me I have to say call me back when you figure something out. He never did. What did happen is since the other rooms were still having problems they sent an electrician up, who was very friendly and he contact COX who provides the service and they fixed it. Finally I can\u2019t talk about the staff without mentioning Nicole Marshall. Originally when I booked I couldn\u2019t reserve the Paradise Suite for the final night of our stay. When I contacted Nicole to see what she could offer she was very quick to provide solutions utilizing other suites. She also said she would stay on top of it and if possible try and keep us in the same room, which ultimately is what happened Nicole took very good care of us. So in summation, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable room in a casino where service does count than you won\u2019t be unhappy at the Tropicana. True it won\u2019t have the crowds of the mega casinos but if you want that, just go hang out at one, why stay there? Prices are great, the location is ideal and all the staff wants to do is make your stay enjoyable. It\u2019s a win at the Tropicana!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cCompletly Met Expectations\u201d", "Author": "MRJKY", "ReviewID": "UR122145966", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9 and I returned from a 3 night Christmas stay at the Tropicana and it absolutely met my expectations. Traveling on a budget, the Tropicana offered the best opportunity to stay in a very nice hotel/casino with enough to do within a reasonable walking distance and at $50/night I could not have had a better experience. The rooms have been \"refreshed\", to say they have been newly renovated I think would be overstating it a bit. While it was a nice room there was some older features such as the bathroom tile and some fixtures but clean. All in all it was very nice and certainly well worth the money. If I could offer one exception it would be that houskeeping did not come until very late. We hiked at the Trial of Fire one afternoon, we left at 10am, returned at 3pm and still the room had not been serviced. That was the second day, so we just decided we would do without being that our stay was so short. We did order room service one night and it was exceptional. Granted, we did not order filet but our sandwiches were well prepared and savory. I have often heard via tripadvisor post that the room service is expensive in Vegas. Room service is typically expensive anywhere you go whether it be Vegas or Atlanta. I would say the room service prices were not out of the norm for any other place that I have stayed. While there are some attractions on location many were closed for the holiday. However, Recycled Percussion was playing on Christmas day and it was incredible!! Wherever you stay in Vegas, you should absolutely go see this show. We did not gamble much in the casino, mainly when we had a drink at the bar we played video poker. The casino and other common areas were decorated to look like that old South Beach hotel. Everything looks to have been updated and is in very good condition. That being said, if you are looking for gigantic themed casinos then go elsewhere; that is certainly not the Tropicana. The Tropicana is an excellent getaway especially if you set the appropriate expectations. If you want to an easy walk to the Paris and Caesars Palace you may want to stay closer to the center of the strip (and if you want to pay double what we paid). Can you walk it from the Tropicana? Sure, it just depends how much you are willing to walk. We walked as far as Paris and that was a hike, we opted for a cab ride back. The Trop is connected by walkway to the MGM, Excalibur and New York New York. From the Excalibur you can catch a tram that runs to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Also, if you are looking to do a lot of off strip excursions the Tropicana offers easy access to the highway at the south end of town. It was a very nice stay and if we travel on a budget again we will definitely stay at the Tropicana.

The vast majority of people who go to Vegas do so for the excitement, gaming, shows and all around feel good atmosphere of the action packed city. The rooms have been updated and have a 42\" tv, safe, ironing board and blow dryer. They have WiFi for a cost that is charged along with their added room fees. The room was quiet but that had alot to do with the fact that the place was a ghosttown. My wife and I checked in Friday morning and stuck around for a few hours in the casino and noticed that there were less than 50 people walking around the gaming area. Now if you like the older slot machines, penny slots and very,very little people around you then you will like this place. Also, if you are \"NOT\" into blackjack, roulette or craps then this is the place for you. They have very few tables to play on but it seems to be the perfect amount for their empty casino. I really cannot see how they keep their head above water with all these other casinos nearby within walking distance. Well I guess it could be their new promotion where they give you back $200 of your initial slot losses. The catch is they give you $100 free play on certain slots and you cannot cash out until you use the entire amount once. The other $100 is credited to you account for a future visit( LOL). The machines are outright tight and this seems to be a shady gimmick. I went to the MGM grand across the street that night and returned twice to my room at the Tropicana and it was dead in the casino. The MGM Grand, New York,New York and even the Excalibur were far better places to play, be in, eat or just walk around and hang out. If you like excitement, action and all that Vegas has to offer then the Tropicana is not the place to be. If you are reading this and are elderly and like places that are quiet and are thinking about staying here beware. Unless you specifically request a room in the main casino tower, the walk from the casino to the rooms is very, very far and I noticed some people having problems and complaints with the hike. All in all I was very disappointed with the Tropicana.

I'm a little surprised they seem to have cut some corners in spending on the bathrooms but its not a big deal. Even the pool area looked really nice and because its not surrounded by towers seems to get a lot of sun. Its got a decent location on the corner of the strip and tropicana blvd. You can cross the skybridge into MGM. 5min walk to NY/NY and 15min walk to City Center if you cut through Monte Carlo (Aria, etc.) Resort fee a bit disproportional to the rate I was paying but it includes internet and gym so if you use those things you get your money's worth on that also. Only downside is not much in the way of food options but given proximity to MGM this hardly matters. The outdoor patio at Nikki cafe looked very appealing if the weather was a little warmer.

We chose it mainly based on price and location. The room was $89 a night, on the 17th floor in the Paradise tower. It was listed as a city view room and I guess technically it was but I had hoped to see more of the actual strip and not mainly the Luxor/Excalibur. Also there is a overlay on the outside of the windows that leaves a pattern of small circles on the glass, making it pretty hard to see anything clearly anyway. It's like looking through a really dark screen. Taking pictures is ruled completely out due to it. And as already mentioned the room stays very bright due to the window coverings which are wooden slat shutters. No matter which way you face them, up or down, the room stays really bright. Check in was super slow. 2 lines of people (Regular check in and Breeze check in) with only 2 people working the lines. The Breeze check in line (Booking via the Trops website affords you Breeze check in) was stalled due to a problem of some sort with the couple already up there. We waited 20 minutes without either line moving before someone (A guest checking in who was tired of the wait) went and had them get a manager who opened up 1 more window. After that check in was easy although far from friendly. As a side note, while there is a luggage ramp outside to roll your cases along there is not one inside so be prepared to lift your bags up about 7-8 steps to get to the front desk area. Also be prepared to watch the bell hop stand at his desk, next to these same stairs, chatting with another employee while he eyes you making two trips to get your bags up the stairs but does not offer to help. We actually ended up helping an elderly couple get their bags up as well while he watched. The room was clean and nice. The bed very comfy. As already mentioned the room is very bright, even at night and especially in the AM due to the shutters and no way to truly shut out the light from outside. The bathroom was clean and new looking as well. The adjustable shower head (Rain, jet, massage) was fantastic, great water pressure and perfect height. The towels are thin and see through in some spots and some had black stains that have probably been there a while. The provided glasses are super small and when we called down to request wine glasses we waited 30 minutes for them and were then given 4 more teeny water glasses instead. Housekeeping skipped us entirely one day as well and we were out of the room by 12:30 that day so not all that late. The casino is standard, nothing that makes it really stand out from any other one. The atmosphere smell that is piped in stinks. I think it is supposed to be vanilla but instead smells like a day old cigar. It's also in the hallways leading to the rooms. We did not eat there so I cannot comment at all on the restaurants. The outside staff is far friendlier then the inside staff. The location is fantastic for getting around. You can get the Deuce and Express Deuce right out front. And monorail access is located next door at the MGM which you can get to easily by the overhead bridge between the 2 hotels. I'd strongly suggest getting a 3 day Deuce pass versus the monorail. The monorail is great but it costs more and you will pretty much always end up walking the equivalent of a few blocks inside the casinos to get from the monorail drop off behind the hotels to the strip. Where as the Deuce runs along the strip and you get off directly in front of whatever casino you are aiming for. So much easier! And it's a great way to see the strip and whats on it as wella s people watch. Plus if you are wanting to get to Freemont street you will need the Deuce anyway since the monorail is for the strip only and the Deuce drops you right off at the Freemont street experience. Forget taxis unless you have too much cash and want a quick way to get rid of some. So in closing, the Trop has cleaned up nicely, the location is handy for a lot of things, the rooms are decent and clean but it still has some work to do as far as customer service goes and the windows/window coverings need re-thinking.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201cgood rooms and price, bad customer service\u201d", "Author": "may0529", "ReviewID": "UR121839993", "Content": "I loved the room i checked into and for only 30 a night it was a steal (room 1581)!!!However the front desk girl who checked me in, Rose, was rather rude and unkind.

This isn't one of the five star properties on the strip, but it is tasteful and appealing to the eye with reasonable value fo the money. There was one of three check-in clerks working despite the people waiting. The line wait was about 20 minutes, and the clerk was efficent but strictly business. I attempted to upgrade our room and ended up with a view of the neighboring buildings airconditioning ducts for my trouble and tip. The room was neat, and we verified no evidence of bedbugs were present. There were some large orange/red stains on the carpet and furniture from a previous spill. The stains detracted from a sense of cleanliness, and I have to wonder why they give that room out if others are available. The next morning we found hairs from prior occupants in the bath and elsewhere. Due to a long line at checkout, we used the express checkout box and forgot to tell the desk clerk about the hairs. A trip for ice and drinks from the machines turned into a visit to three floors before success. I ran into an employee on the elevator and reported the failures. I got a shrug and, 'Yeah, they're always broken.' Overall it wasn't a bad experience, and our stay is about what I expected for the price.

I also have high expectations, as I've worked as a Front Desk Agent at some very nice properties. But we were pleasantly surprised how nice it was! Upon walking in it was bright and clean. We arrived at 9:30 AM knowing it was way to early to check-in, but we thought we'd store our bags and have them call us when our room was ready. Maria, at the Front Desk, was so nice and helpful. She gave us a few options and upgraded us to a Junior Suite for it being our wedding, and promised that we would get a call as soon as it was ready. We got a call at noon that our room was ready, and when we got to our room I thought \"Ahhhhhh.\" So fresh and clean and classy! It was on the 15th floor on the corner with lots of windows. The junior suite is a good size, but they could probably replace one of the 3 armchairs with a loveseat and a little bar. There was ALOT of empty space, but it was just fine for 2 ppl, well even 3 or 4 as I had a couple of guests as I got ready for our big day. Sunset was a great time for pictures in our room, with views of the Luxor and mountains behind us. It was very quiet in our room, we felt like we were the only people in that part of the hotel! It was a perfect place to recharge after the cacophony of Vegas. At check out Yolanda offered to print out our boarding passes for us, and made easy for us with our departure. Some cons: No bathrobe in the rooms (you can request them, but I didn't realize that at the time). Also, the shampoo,conditioner, and lotion seemed kind of cheap. Wouldn't mind a bit of luxury there! Also none of the little soaps were face soaps, usually hotels put a bar of facial soap in the rooms. Also no mini-bar or in room coffee. And it's quit a walk to the Club Tower, making it annoying for coffee/drink runs, or when we forgot something in the room. Also it's at the South end of the strip, making it a bit inconvenient, especially if you want to check out Fremont. Also, this was one of my favorite casinos, as it wasn't dark and smoky.

After browsing online for several months, the Tropicana seemed to provide the best value this weekend (NFR rodeo and LV Marathon). I've stayed here several times before, but it's been 10+ years. Things have really improved! The south strip location worked well for us. Each of us arrived/departed at different times. The Tropicana is convenient to the airport (approx. $15 cab ride). The MGM Grand, NYNY, and the Excaliber are right across the street and provide quick access to additional dining and entertainment options. Three adults stayed in a Club tower room - non-smoking with two queen beds. The Club tower requires walking a good distance to access - not a problem for us, but something to consider if you mind a long walk back and forth to your room. The hallways and common areas were clean and well maintained. Everything really has a new, updated look. There are plenty of elevators - never a wait. The room was clean throughout. New carpet. The beds were comfortable with nice bedding. New flatscreen TV (with broken remote). Good climate control that actually maintained a comfortable temp. No coffee maker. Plenty of available outlets for phone chargers, laptops, etc. Ipod compatible clock radio. Windows are covered with shutters to block the light. The shutters swing open allowing each window to slide open a few inches. Our room had a view of the pool area(closed), NYNY, and the MGM Grand. We didn't try the WiFi access. We commented several times on how quiet the room was - no noise from the surrounding rooms, outside traffic, people in the hallway, or airplanes. The bathroom was fine, but apparently not fully remodeled - several cracked tiles on floor, odd corner tub/shower with a crusty old shower head, trim falling off tub faucet, toilet that often required multiple flushes. Towels were clean, but no \"fluff\". Vanity, sink, faucets looked to be new. We didn't dine, gamble, or see any shows at the Tropicana. We had drinks at the Ambhar lounge. Fred (bartender) was a funny guy that provided great service. When I booked my reservation online, I requested an additional roll away bed for the first two nights. Due to \"fire code\" regulations, they would not put a roll away in a room with two queens. I tried to book a second room at check in, but they had limited availability and wouldn't come close to matching the rate we had for our reserved room. The room was plenty large, so we made do. At check out, we paid $15 per night in mandatory resort fees, even though we didn't use or benefit from any of the \"resort\" services. The free parking garage was convenient to the front door. It seemed safe and secure. All three of us would gladly stay here again.

Having done the research online, we decided to reserve a non-smoking king room in the Paradise Tower. That's the one that is right off the casino floor. Upon arriving, we were told that that tower didn't have a non-smoking room and we would have to take a room in the Club Tower. They told us we could come by between 1-3pm the next day to request a new room in the correct tower. Not thrilled, we went to the room. If you've ever seen the Trop from the outside, you see just how far away the Club Tower is. After the long walk, we made it into our room. The room looked pretty nice. New LG TV on the wall. But when I went into the bathroom, it was pretty dirty--especially the tub. Not a little dusty. It looked like the faucet was rusted. But it was just dirt. So I called down to housekeeping and let them know. They said they would send someone up to clean it. A little unhappy about the combo of wrong tower and dirty bathroom I went to blow off some steam by tweeting about it. Well, by the time we got back from eating (HOT DOGS AT PINKS IN PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!), they had gotten back to me on twitter. The manager on duty called my room. She personally apologized and even offered us a food credit for our trouble. Even though there was public pressure (my tweet had been retweeted by a few Vegas people), I appreciated the personal attention and gesture. The next day we still wanted to switch towers. Not thrilled about having to be around in the middle of the afternoon to do this, we packed our stuff and left it at the bell desk. I went to the check-in desk and let them know I wanted the new room. Again she told me I had to come back between 1-3pm so they could do a room switch. When I told her I brought my own bags down, she said that she could then block out a new room for us anytime. I wish they had told me that. If I hadn't taken the initiative, I would have been sitting around waiting to switch rooms instead of enjoying Vegas. I gave them a call later just to make sure we got the room. And we did. No problem. The new room was even nicer than the old one. Definitely cleaner. And a much shorter walk. The casino there is pretty nice. The dealers seemed friendly. We ate a few breakfasts at Starbucks and had a late supper at Cafe Nikki. Steak and Eggs at 11pm is awesome. The food was great. Overall the staff was wonderful. The bellman was from NJ, so we had some hometown chat while we stowed our bags. I'm not thrilled by the location. We hung out at MGM and NY NY while we were down there, but we usually find ourselves more north.

We chose the Tropicana based on location, website photos, off-season price and TA reviews. From the time we arrived all staff from valet parking, bell desk, registration and restaurant service were wonderful. Everyone was friendly, informative and helpful. Upon first glance, the updated rooms were great. We liked the modern \"Miami Beach\" decor, but it quickly became evident that the Tropicana declarations of a newly \"renovated\" property actually meant newly \"decorated.\" The bathroom floor tile was very old 4\", outdated, chipped and scuffed. The stone threshold between the bathroom and bedroom appeared either very dirty or permanently stained. The bathtub had numerous, large chips in the enamel. The housekeeping, or lack of, was quite surprising. Our bathtub had standing water in it, hair (not ours) in the sink and the carpet, particularly in front of the dresser, had many stains. The carpet appeared fairly new so part of the re-decorating, but obviously not regularly cleaned. My Mom's room had the same stained carpet and her bathroom sink actually was sprinkled with dirt particles, as though a broom or mop had been shaken out in it. There was long, dark hair on the bathroom counter, also not her's. A housekeeper was doing the room across the hall from us so I told her about our bathrooms. Her response was to simply open the bathtub plug and let the water drain out. I had to ask her to \"please clean it.\" There was a memo in each room alerting guests to a hotel water test on Nov. 28th that would require turning the water off completely between 1:00am-5:00am. We were there on the 30th so fortunately it didn't apply to us (the memos should have been thrown away) but I can't imagine checking into a LV hotel with the idea of gambling, eating and drinking the night away only to discover, upon check-in, that I wouldn't be able to flush the toilet or have any water in my room during the night. It was surprising that the room service menu was limited to pizza and strombolis from their Italian food court cafe. In a 24 hr. town I would always expect a breakfast, lunch and dinner selection. We don't gamble so the only other hotel amenity that we used was the Cafe Nikki for breakfast. Again, we loved the updated decor and table with a pretty view of the tropical, palm tree surrounded pool & patio. Our server was great. On the negative, the prices were high for basic breakfast in an older, average Las Vegas hotel. Coffee was $4, bacon and eggs $12, pancakes $9 and the breakfast buffet was almost $19 per person. We've done a lot traveling in many states and countries and aren't opposed to indulging in good dining, but that was extravagant for an average property, at low season, during a negative economy, in a resort town where business is off 40% and there is a lot of competition. That one experience would certainly deter us from trying any of their other restaurants when there are so many excellent choices in Las Vegas. Others here have had very positive stays at the Tropicana so perhaps the bad housekeeping in our two rooms was the exception, but managements policy to cut corners by not replacing the worn out tile and tubs and not regularly shampoo the room carpeting will send us elsewhere. With so many good $50 a night rooms in LV right now I doubt that we'd stay at the Tropicana again as room cleanliness is high on our priority list.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel without the glitz!\u201d", "Author": "MarkBTID", "ReviewID": "UR121352010", "Content": "Visited the Tropicana for my 30th birthday with my wife in November and had a lovely stay. 1st impressions are of a really clean, fresh and modern looking hotel and these don't go away throughout your stay.

Check in was pretty quick and we had been upgraded to a City View room due to my tweeting of the hotel which was an unexpected but very nice surprise. The room itself was excellent. Very large, big king sized bed which was the most comfortable I have slept in. Huge TV on a nice big unit with safe, 4 big drawers and a desk with chair. Also in the room is a chaise lounge, a palm tree style plant, 2 bedside cabinets and an i-pod dock which is great to plug your own i-pod into and listen to your own tunes when you feel like it. The view from our window was onto the MGM Grand and down the strip, looking down on the bridge between Trop and MGM. When lying on my bed I could see the MGM, Planet Hollywood, Paris and Wynn. Very nice. The bathrooms were fine, it did look like they hadn't been upgraded as much as the main room but they still clean and well functional. Decent sized sink and unit, bath tub with a shower that had a very powerful head and a toilet more secluded in a boxed off section of the room. The only slight issue is that we had an adjoining room and you could hear the guests in that room. Luckily we had quiet neighbours but this could be an issue if you had a noisy neighbour.

What I found refreshing was it appeared that they are loyal to their longtime employees as many of the beautiful cocktail servers were my age- what some might call \"mature\"- a nod to the value of experience and constancy. My only concern during our stay was our room had a shared adjoining door- and I could clearly hear the gentleman next door coughing. Next time I would request a non-adjoining room.

We wanted to be at that end of the strip (it is near MGM, NY NY, Excalibur) because we were going to the Las Vegas Invitational Bball tournament at the Orleans (cheaper cab). I was hesitant to book at 1st because the price was so low compared to other hotels in the same location but after reading a few reviews on TA, we booked. Although the ceiling in the casino is low, which is odd after going to other casinos, the entire area has been redone and looks great. I can't compare to the old but my husband said it was a definite improvement. Check in was a breeze and off to our room we went. We were on the 8th floor and were able to get a king bed, which is what I wanted. Although I asked if the room had a view and was told the double bed rooms have the view, king bed rooms look at airport. Ok, no big deal about the view since we wouldn't be in the room too much anyway. Our room was clean and nice. Flat screen tv, desk area, plantation shutters. The bathroom was ok. Seemed they may have skimped or skipped redoing the bathroom, but again it was clean. We had a non-smoking room and it seemed to be a real non-smoking room. We did have a view of the airport but never heard any noise (we even had the windows cracked). All in all, a great hidden gem especially for the price. I would consider staying at this hotel again. The bad: the a/c was terrible. We had it down to 60 and still had to open the windows as it seemed very stuffy and warm in our room. I didn't call b/c w/the window open it was tolerable. I did, however, mention to the front desk at check out and I am pretty certain the information went no further. The bathroom, as I mentioned didn't seem it was updated. The tub/shower is weird. It is at an angle and every time one of us showered there was water on the floor no matter how the shower curtain was placed. Although they have plantation type shutters, the room wasn't the typical pitch black room that I have stayed in while in Vegas. The sun was peaking thru the shutters no matter the directions we put them. To consider: as with most hotel rooms in Vegas, it seems they are miles from the front desk and this is no exception.

We had spent ages picking out our hotel for our first trip to Vegas. I work for a major hotel chain so I am always really picky when it comes to hotels. We wanted a reasonably priced, nice hotel. We didn't want to spend a fortune on a hotel, as it would give us more spending money on the casino floors! We got exactly that, and so much more. The hotel is literally minutes from the airport, so after almost 28 hours travelling (thanks to hurricane Irene) we were thankful of such a short journey. Arriving at the Trop, we were greeted by the amazing smell they pump through the AC. Whenever I smell coconut now, I am reminded about the great time in Vegas. Check in was a breeze, and as we booked direct with the hotel we were able to use the VIP line. Then the room! OMG! It was amazing. I had a paradise suite on the 22nd (I think) floor. It was a corner suite, with stunning views on three sides of the hotel. The room was massive!!! It had a huge living area with big flatscreen Tv, fridge and coffee maker. The separate bedroom area had another huge flatscreen and quite possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Truly couldn't wait to get in at the end of the day and didn't want to get out in the morning! We gambled some on the casino floor, I lost loads but other members of the party were a good bit richer by the end of the trip. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but had pizza at the small diner place on the ground floor, great value and fed us well. Pool area was nice, had a look but didn't stay long as we weren't in Vegas to lounge by a pool! Location was good. It is at the south end of the strip and most places could be walked to, however the monorail at MGM just across the street is always handy. Every member of staff we spoke to all were great. We also contacted Nicole Marshall prior to our arrival and she went out her way to make sure our stay was as great as possible. She even sorted out some comp tickets for Brad Garret as we were celebrating an occasion while in the hotel. It was an amazing night. We also went to the Mob Experience. I had doubts about this but thoroughly enjoyed it! Great fun and the ending was a good laugh! We stayed for 5 nights and it genuinely made our Vegas experience even better.

A nice steak and seafood place with somewhat higher prices and a beach style cafe with a decent selection and decent prices.

The check-in lady (I forget her name now) was very abrupt,and downright rude when we were told we still owed money on the 3 rooms we had booked,(despite us showing her an email that the account was settled in full),after me getting a bit annoyed she rolled her eyes at the manager and he took over and very quickly realised it was a reservations error not ours.

The renovations are a nice update as I remember the old Tropicana from a prior visit to town. If your scent sensitive, or have asthma issues, you will probably want to avoid most of Vegas.

Check in went well, quickly accomplished and on our way to our room. we were oh the 14th floor of the club tower with a great view of the airport. Great because I like to watch the planes. Would be nice if the windows either opened more or they got rid of the white screening applied to the windows. would be nice to be able to really stop the light too, the slatted shutters are pretty, but they don't really stop enough light. Some good blinds would have been nice. The club tower was a bit of a problem with me too, as I have 2 rather bad knees and there is quite a hike to get to your room. The beds are great. Very comfortable. Wireless internet in the room was good but there were some issues with the television picture shredding while watching shows, but then again, who watches TV in Vegas The room was very quiet and clean and comfortable. The headroom is limited in the bathroom and the big corner shower tub. The shower head is mounted very low, making it a challenge for me to wash my hair. I managed to smack my head on the shower head 2 of the 3 mornings because I had to bend over to wash the shampoo out. The breakfast buffet in cafe Nikki was great. The fresh made while you wait omelets were excellent and well done, Definitely the highlight in an otherwise bland and flavorless dining experience for for all the other meals I ate in the other hotels buffets.

Check in took us around 20 minutes in line as they had one person on the desk, this person was not at all friendly, we were so excited to be there and felt disheartened when the lady gave us attitude. #2. When we got to our room, there was no hot water in the bathroom so we called to the front desk muliple times and did not get any answer. The bathroom we had in room 1559 was BADLY in need of a cleaning, there was mould in the grout the floor tiles were all cracked the filters in the ceiling and wall was very dirty and the toliet would barely flush. #3. The room has very bad circulation, if you took a shower the whole room got damp and would feel damp unless we opened the windows. #4. There is a very very long walk from the Club tower to the exit of the hotel with not a lot going on inbetween, we felt that we had to go out most of the time to eat because there is very LITTLE selection in places to eat. or thing to do, the shows are not the greatest and the hotel is very far south on the strip.

It was our first night out in almost three years - we have a 2 1/2 old twin daughters. So, we were really excited about our trip. Overall, the hotel wasn't so bad. However, the positive reviews I've been reading seem overrated. I stayed at room 1123 at Paradise Tower during the first week of November. The wait line at the check-in was ridiculous. When I arrived (4 p.m.), there were three people in front of me, and yet it took 30 minutes for someone to help me with check in. Anyways, we checked in to room 1123, located on the 11th floor overlooking south side of MGM Grand. The room did not feel spacious. The room was clean with simple tropical-themed decorations. Nothing special. I upgraded to City View room for $25 more but the view overlooking MGM was not spectacular. Of all the things that were renovated, the bathroom tiles were not remodeled. It looked dirty with lots of old stains. The bed was comfortable; however, two things kept us waking up at night - the noisy heater and lack of black out curtains. The plantation shutters looked nice but they kept letting mornight sunrays through our room. The heater, every time it would turn on, would make such a loud noise that it would wake us up. The hotel staff were not all that friendly as many reviewers said. They were not rude, but I didn't find them particularly friendly or nice. There were just doing their business. In addition, the hotel ceiling on the northern portion by a snack shop and a restroom (leading to 2-story motel structure) was so low that I felt claustophobic (and I'm 5-7). The ceiling was probably 6 foot and 2 inches high and anyone who's taller than that could not have made it. In addition, the hotel has a very small, I mean VERY SMALL casino! For the size of the hotel, the casino should have been at least three times bigge than its current size. I didn't want to play there. Other people probably thought the same - the casino was virtually empty on Sunday evening. One crap table - no players, one roulette table - no players. Four or five blackjack tables - some action there. Only about 20 people seemed to be playing the slots. The hotel guests appeared to be much older compared to other hotels in Vegas (average of 65-75 years old). Consequently, the cocktail waitresses were also older (60-70) wearing awkwardly revealing uniforms. I didn't want to see cleavage of someone who is older than my mom. I understand millions of dollars were spent on renovation. I seriously think that was a bad mistake. The hotel should have been demolished and rebuilt. There were many issues with the old hotel that could not have been resolved with renovations. I even joined Trop Players Card and participated in even the odds program. (I lost $70 and got $35 back) But I don't think I will come back to Tropicana. It's just not worth it. Even if I get a free room, I would pay and stay at other newer hotels. Overall, the hotel isn't terrible but I just wanted to inform people that if you are going to stay at Tropicana, significantly lower your expectations.

We loved everything about the resort. It is on the south end of the Strip and it is very easy to access all of the amenities that the strip has to offer. No matter where you stay you will have to walk so I recommend wearing comfortable shoes. The check in process was good. A bit of a line but the guest service agents were super friendly and willing to help with any and every question. We also got a complimentary upgrade to a mini suite which was great! We had a view of the south end of the strip and we were not bothered by any noise whatsoever. The room was large and clean. A fridge would have been nice but other than that I can't complain. We went to numerous casinos during our stay and we agreed that the Tropicana was the one that most suited us. Not too busy and not dark and gloomy like most. The servers came around often enough with beverages which was not the case at any of the other resort casinos (I ended up spending 40$ at the MGM Grand for a bottle of MGD and a double rum and coke due to lack of service there.) The pool looked awesome and it was not very busy but we never got around to enjoying it. Cafe Nikki was perfect! The food was amazing, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the service was superb! I can't wait to go back for more! All around this resort gets 5 stars from me! I didn't want to leave! Thank you Tropicana staff for a great stay!

I had a King room and it was spacious. I liked the desk/table set-up, room for two people. There was a nice flat screen TV in the room. Hairdryer in bath. There was no coffee pot in room, want you to use their coffee spots downstairs I guess! I don't drink it, so didnt' care, but I know some people like to get up and make coffee. A friend of mine said she brought a 10.00 perculator type thing from Walmart and took it, made her own and said you can even just leave it there if no room to take it home in luggage, because is cheaper than buying the coffee in the shops, even if you leave it! The bathroom was spacious and the tub was a garden size. The shower head was low or weird or something. I am 5'2'' and it just did hit my head. I think a tall person would have issues and have to scrunch up under it. Not sure what the problem is, but the water was hot all the time and immediately when turned on. I liked the curved shower curtain most now have as well. The room was quiet, I never heard neighbors, etc. The bed was very comfortable. There was a digital clock with iPod dock. I don't care for the \"resort fee\", I know many of the hotels charge this, but it is basically just adding to the room rate and I'd rather they just include it, since it is mandatory anyway, it is part of the rate, we are not stupid. I am not too sure what the fee covers, maybe the \"free wireless\", which is not free when you pay $14.99 a day to use it! Just include it all in the rate and be done with it. The only thing I did not care about at the Tropicana was the shutters on the windows. They were pretty, but a lot of light filters in through them at night and I like it dark. I tried shutting them in both directions and still got a lot of light in the room. I would prefer curtains, but the shutters are probably easier to deal with by the staff. I was in the club towers, which is a tower at the back of the complex. From the outside, it looked like it was a great distance, but inside walking it was no more than 5 minutes from registation to elevators, unless you walk real slow. I do tend to be a fast walker! The pool area looked nice, but it was too cold for that this trip, weather in low 60's and 50's. I never found the business center, though I saw signs directing to the area. They did have some internet kiosks near the elevator for the Club tower and you can print boarding passes free there. There is a deli, food seems to come from Cafe Nikki and appeared to be the same food on their menu, you just order at the counter at the deli whereas Cafe Nikki is sit down. There was no room service menu, but an abbreviated room service flier in the room. Plenty of food options at the hotels in the area, NY NY, Excalibur, Luxor, MGM, etc. I did not eat at either of the other two restaurants in Tropicana, one was Italian and one more a steakhouse I guess. Casino never seemed to be very full, even at night or weekends. I do not gamble so can't comment on anything there. My money went to the resort fee! LOL!! All of the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful. We rented a car right at the hotel one day to go to Hoover dam and it was convenient, inexpensive and they were helpful. I had no problems at check-in and was even able to get in my room at about 12:30 pm. overall, it was a very nice hotel, very comfortable and quiet.

Right from the front entrance to the room everything is either white marble or orange, red and brown carpeting. I for one did not feel that the coconut scent in the casinos and public areas was overwhelming. It was a refreshing break from the usually smokey casinos I have encountered. The casino is not as large as some others but is easier to navigate without getting lost. I mostly play slots but there seemed to be a lot of action at the tables during the 5 days that I was there. I really liked the slot area that was off by itself between the two escalators, the ceilings were higher and it was cooler in that area. The cocktail waitresses were for the most part very attentive, efficient and friendly. I did not get to experience the restaurants as all of my meals were covered by other people at other hotels but the menus and the food looked delicious.

The lobby is nothing like the other hotels - which can be good or bad depending on what you're here for. Absolutely nothing to look at. Service was ok, not especially friendly, at the front desk. But I got a great rate over the phone - even better than the conference rate. So the value was very good. And I also talked to a couple of the concierges before my arrival, and they were helpful with suggestions, dinner, and show reservations. Glad I took care of this because in person there were sometimes long lines for the concierge (who also took care of our Hoover Dam excursion). The room: comfortable and clean. Beds were ok, pillows were ok. I didn't think they were incredibly comfy but then I slept really well all 4 nights! Plenty of room. Had 2 double beds. Quiet. Renovated. The bathrooms had apparently not been renovated - old cracked tiles, small bath/shower, thin towels, minimal amenities (ie no shower cap or shower gel) Enjoyed Nikki's Club for breakfast - huge portions, yummy oatmeal, yogurt and fruit, etc. There were a couple other options in the hotel - a Starbucks and another cafe/frozen yogurt spot for a quick bite. Did not eat at the hotel for lunch or dinner. (Across the street at the MGM was our favorite lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Grill!) Pool was spacious, comfy chairs, very loud music. I found it hard to find a quiet spot anywhere in the whole hotel - I like to read and relax when not in meetings, and the room had terrible lighting for reading. Unfortunately there wasn't really any other place to sit quietly either. The casino was not crowded like a lot of hotels, but like all of them the area was incredibly smoky. Coming from a state with no smoking laws this was very irritating - not to this hotel specifically. (My friend woke up one night thinking something was on fire and it was her hair and pillow that reeked with smoke!). Our eyes and throats bothered us the whole time. Location was ok - not in the \"thick of things\" near Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, etc. But the MGM across the street had a monorail station to other hotels, it's a quick and cheap cab ride to other hotels, and the location at the Tropicana was definitely less crowded and quieter than the other places as well, which I think is a good thing. This hotel does not have free entertainment like the other hotels either - ie Bellagio's conservatory and fountains, Treasure Island's siren show, Mirage's volcano, etc. Again, this could be a good or bad thing depending on what you're expecting.

We travel to Vegas at least once per year. This is our first stay at the Trop and were quite excited to see the recent changes made. I will start by saying that every employee we came in contact with was more than friendly, they truly go out of their way and kill you with kindness. Other than that, we were not impressed. They are trying to be/offer a Mandalay Bay experience and falling short of what they are selling. I reserved the room almost a year ago, we received an excellent rate of $129.00 per night, I had requested an upgrade to a \"Strip View Room\". They agreed and said it would be an additional $25.00, great deal. Ever heard the saying \"You get what you pay for\"? We waited in line for about 25 minutes checking in. There were 2 employees at the desk. However the VIP Line had I believe 4 employees there with no one waiting in the VIP Line it was only after waiting the 25 minutes that these employees decided to help us common folk. Then we got to our room, 1225. The view was of the back side of the MGM and off to the East side of Vegas, oh, it also included a beautiful view of the rooftop of the main Casino. There are very few \"in room\" amenities. No fridge, coffee, water, etc. They want you spending your money downstairs. There is a blow dryer and an iron.The carpet in the room was stained throughout with bright red blotches and the bathroom floor was streaked with black marks. Not a lot of attention to detail in the cleaning process. I wore flip flops around the room. The beds were comfy. The A/C was a small 12x12 hole in the wall that blew directly into another wall inside this little cove area of the room, not out in to the room. We had it set at 68 and could not get the room to cool down. We finally opened the windows to get a little bit of a breeze into the room and stayed awake the rest of the night listening to the loud music played througout the parking area and sirens. On our fist day we went to Nikko the \"Cafe\" type restaurant. Food was way over priced and not great. Service was very slow, but employees were very apologetic and nice. The hotel is conveniently located for events at Thomas & Mack, we walked back to the hotel each night. Oh yes, the Elevators, on Friday and Saturday night we waited at least 10 minutes for an elevator down to the Lobby.

Bottom line: If you are considering the Flamingo, NY-NY, Luxor, etc., then you should definitely consider the Trop, too. It is nicely appointed, decently located and not as overwhelmingly huge as some of the other resorts. The price is right, too. And the pool is beautiful. Do not stay here expecting the luxury of City Center, the Wynn or even Caesar's. But by saving money at the Trop, you will have a lot more money to spend while you're in Vegas!! Read on for more specifics: The king-sized room was clean, bright and a nice size. It overlooked the airport but was not loud. We were in the club tower, which is a hike from the main entrance. You might try to stay closer to the front, but we never heard one minute of night club music, even on the 12th floor. The best thing about the Trop? The bed. **The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.** The bathroom was a nice size with a big tub. There were mildew and paint splotches in the shower, which I did not expect considering the renovations were so recent. One day, housekeeping made up our room and left us with 1 towel, which we did not know until after midnight when we got back to our room. That was annoying. The casino ventilation has not been upgraded and is not even close to that found in the newer properties. The smell of smoke as you approach the casino is overwhelming. The \"South Beach Marketplace\" is a 24-hour Starbucks (yay!) & a couple of quick service eateries. Nothing great. The breakfast buffet at Cafe Nikki is $18.95 and hardly worth it.

None of the confusing maze and multi-story compounds much larger properties have.

Well situated at the crossroads of Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip) and Tropicana Avenue and facing the MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York New York hotels. Very easy to reach from the airport. The Tropicana is not as large as many of the themed hotels, with under 1500 rooms - small for this town. It feels more of an hotel and less like an airport terminal. The decoration throughout is fresh and relaxing, with a Miami South Beach meets Caribbean plantation theme. My room was spacious and beautifully furnished with a chez longue, plantation shutters and 42\"-50\" TV (all HD) and good quality bathroom toiletries. The best thing about the room however was the luxurious bed. Quite simply, this was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, with a superb (Serta?) mattress and high quality cotton sheeting. The AC worked well and I found the room quiet and restful. This hotel easily deserves 4 stars following its complete remodelling. Even the perfumed public areas were pleasant and not in any way overwhelming. Presumably, this 'freshener' is cycled through the air conditioning. My only gripe, is that there are some steps from the parking garage to one of the hotel entrances so not ideal for the disabled or someone with heavy luggage. I didn't like the service I received at breakfast in Nikki cafe. The server appeared disinterested and perhaps tired from the night before? The reception staff were extremely helpful when I tried to complete an airline check-in and they went out of their way to assist.

We reserved 2 rooms. The Check in was so OK! After landing on the airport we went to wallmart and did a lot of shopping. We picked up our rental car and droove to the Trop. We were welcomed by the bellmen who droove our suitcases and shoppings to our rooms. while i was at the check inn desk. We were checked in smootly within 5 minutes due Barbara! We took the elevator to floor 19 and got rooms 1923 and 1925. Enetering the rooms we were overwhelmed! Everything what we seen on the picture's was in the rooms we were Silenced! We knew the rooms looked nice on Internet but in reality it was MUCH MUCH more nice! Very quickly the bell boy ringed at our doors bringing our things! 4 minute's ? So wooo we were in las Vegas !!! We got rooms with city view ( view on the strip MGM , Paris , Paris ) 2 rooms! the rooms had connecting doors from the inside!... So no walking in the hallway to knock nock... The rooms even were better as all the pictures i have seen on internet! Happy Happy Happy But :-> after a few hours i woke up due Beep Beep Beep sounds.. it was the digging machine's digging and preparing the Nikki Pool area,, i tried to silence my ears... I tried pillows on my ears,,,, But nothing helped.. I kept hearing the BEEP BEEP BEEP it sounded exactly like my alarm wake up clock... I phoned to the Front Desk explaining my problem... happily they understood!! we were then transferred from city view BEEP BEEP rooms to the other site of the tower with a view on Excalibur, Mandala and Luxor. That was a great sight also! still on floor 19 The sun did shine in that room! so i lowered the shutters and slept long. next Morning Miss Nicole Marshall phoned to my room asking if all was OK .. yes it was beside i had a bad cold and was couging.. In the aftrenoone we droove to red rock canyon. after arriving back to our rooms from Red Rock i had a message from the Front desk asking me to report in......So i was worried if the complained we made was to much. So i went to the front desk verry worried what would happen...BUT There was a Yellow Gift bag for me there, Containing tea , Honey sweeties and other things with a little note: get well soon.. Regards : Nicole. I Consider that as very very very special! Ok we stayed 8 nights and then went to the Grand C and from there to Page. From Page we went back to Las Vegas. We checked in at the Golden Nugget and beeing in the Golden Nugget room we both were dissapointed wishing to be back at Tropicana, But OK we slept at the Nugget but i did set my alarm clock at 10,00 I woke up and called the Trop ( Nicole) I Told here we were downtown at the Nugget but we want to be back again in the Trop.. is there a room for us? YES it was !! beeing in Page and checking my email i got a message from the trop giving me 20% off so i mentioned that and got the answer... OK i can do better as that and i got 30% and resort fees waived!!! We checked out of the Golden Nugget , went to the Trop.. But we were told ok rooms not ready yet.. Come back after 15.00 So we went back at the car and droove up to NMount Charleston.. we had a great time. We returned back at tropicana about 18.00.. The rooms were ready! 2 rooms again on floor 20 with inner connecting doors and a view on the strip! We wanted to stay in thoose rooms 7 days more :) But then in the middle of the night i heard ( at 04.30) Tick Tick Tick I Just returned from a long walk on the LV Strip Tick Tick Tick I looked up to the ceiling and WHOO there was a big wet place leaking water... tick tick .. I Phoned the front desk : Telling Hey there is a poblem in my room! Water is dripping true the ceilings... Nlothing happened.. and it was getting worse... not only tick tick tick.. but almost a little river off water was dropping from the ceiling in my room! I put plastic cans , cofee makers and a lot more on the floor to catch the leaking water, and i phoned again to the front desk saying: HEY SENT SOMEONE TO MY ROOM! There is a major Problem! After 10 minutes a maintain men arrived with some tools.. he looked in my room and said! Pjew i have to get someone else! and he left 15 Minutes later an invasion came :) Security, maintainance and a lot more ppl.. They all together in a meeting decided that the water that was coming in my room came from the upper floor! So all thoose ppl left my room and went 1 floor up. I dont know what was gooing on there .. i heard a jacuzzie was overflooding... the real rea\\son what happened above my head was never told... anyway the dripping ( Tick Tick Tick) stopped slowly so i went a sleep about 06.30 maybe 07.00 Ours later i woke up... i looked at the ceilings and oh men it was terrible! the wallpaper also. I Called Front Desk and told sent someome over to look at the damage..... Well they did sent someone.. He looked and said Ow No...and left 2 hours later front Desk Called me telling me we had to moove from the damaged rooms telling me to report at the front desk. So i went to the front desk ..But hey at the front desk they wanted my ID (passport) wich was crazy! They Phoned me! to report in! So i was sent up back to the water room to get my passport and went back to front desk. There i got the keys to 2 rooms below us and was told to change from the water leaking rooms to floor 19.. So i did. (My friend was walking on the strip) so i mooved all we had from floor 20 to 19 :) I was very aware if i have not warned the Trop on the leaking damage it would have gone from floor 20 -> 19_> 18-> 17->16 and more So i was very aware that i saved the Trop Hotel some damage money. OK we installed ourselfes on floor 19 .. but nobody contacted us.. We talked about it and concluded that is strange. Next Morning i went to thye Front Desk Telling the story... The ladies at the front desk already knew about the water problem... 1 off them I cant give the name said Hey GO Complain! You dont have to take that! So i asked for a manager and i got one.. He heard my story.. asked me why didnt you complain earlier.... saw the pics i took.... and then asked me : Will you be OK with 4 free nights for both rooms to undo the trouble you had. YES i agreed.

We arrived at the Trop and had a little wait in the \"breeze\" check-in and the lady at the front desk was surprised when she saw what we were paying for the room and she also noted that the resort fees were waived by Nicole Marshall. It was an easy check-in and we were put in room 1101 and was asked at least three times if we needed help with our bags. Room amenities: The suite has two very spacious rooms. The \"living area\" has two sets of windows, one looks out towards MGM/NYNY and the other looked out towards the Excaliur. We could not see the Excal as there was a large advertising banner blocking our view but the view from the other window was spectacular. Included in the room was; a couch with two end tables and foot table, a sitting chair, a writing table and chairs, a large flat screen TV, a Keurig coffee maker, and a refrigerator. The bedroom included; a king size bed with end tables, a sitting chair with foot stool, another large flat screen TV, and a chest of drawers which contained the safe. the closet had plenty of room and had two bathrobes in it that you could take home for $100.00 each. The bathroom was average but very clean. Minor Issues: We had a couple of issues during our stay which did not hamper our stay in any way. There was a small leak in the supply line for the toilet which a pool of water on the floor but maintenace fixed it immediately after we reported it to the front desk. Another issue was that we did not get maid service one day which was no big deal as we just called the front desk and had fresh towels and addtional coffee sent to our room. The last incident happened late one night when we got back to the room there was a food cart that had a large bowl filled with snacks and fruit along with a bottle of crown royal. it was obviously delivered to the wrong room by mistake so we reported the error and they sent an individual up to bring it to the correct room. It was unfortunate that the mob experience tour was closed as we would have enjoyed that but it sounded like there was some possible financial backing for the exhibit and hopefully it will be back up and running in the near future. I do have to comment that if anyone has questions regarding the Tropicana you need to send an e-mail to Nicole Marshall. She helped with our questions from the time we decided to stay at the Trop. She had our resort fee waived, and also sent us follow up e-mails after our stay when we completed their survey. She is definately very customer service orientated and a pleasure to work with.

It seemed that slots paid out a fair amount and we won a fair amount. The Wheel of Fortune slots seemed to pay out nicely. The pool was nice, though the water was frigid (Oct).

I travelled with a girfriend and both of us were Vegas Virgins. We shared a twin room which was quite large with 2 very comfy beds. Personally I thought that the lighting in the room was a bit gloomy, although the lighting in the bathroom was a lot brighter. Trouble being that I prefer to sit down when doing hair and makeup and the only mirror with a chair was in the bedroom. We opted for a higher floor room, but had to take a smoking one. You could smell the smoke when you first entered but we didn't think it was to overpowering, The pool area was busy, but then again we were there over a weekend, I would imagine that during the week it would be a great deal quieter and the water was not at all cold. I did not notice any sunbeds that were broken, and whilst it was a bit of a tight squeeze we did manage to get 2 beds on each of the days. Personally I would prefer there to be no music around the pool, but it wasn't overly loud. Although on the Saturday and Sunday Nikki Beach held their pool party and the music from it was rather booming, lots of bass. We did go into Nikki Beach, but only for about an hour as we found it to be full of a younger crowd, and we couldn't really understand the rules on where we could sit or not. The beds and Cabanas can be hired for the day, but at huge cost. We asked one of the waitress about this and was given a price of $500!!!!!! and I think that was cheap, as it was the last party of the season. We took breakfast and lunch in Nikki Cafe and found the food to be of a very high quality and the staff were very efficiant and friendly. Likewise the Biscayne restaurant where we ate on our first night. Neither of us are gamblers, but we had a go and came out evens. The casino, is, in comparision to some of the other hotels rather small, but then again the hotel itself is on the smaller side. Which I prefer. We did go and see a number of the larger establishments, and they are massive. You could easily spend an entire week in some of them and still not have drank in every bar or eaten in every restaurant. We took a trip to The Grand Canyon with Sundance Helicopters which was fantastic, quite breath taking. And we went to The Gun Store, which was also breath taking, but in a totally different way!!!!! An excellent expreience. We also went to Fremont Street, but we didn't like it at all, it felt down at heel and a bit scumy.

People that complain about things on this site have to realize no one hotel is perfect and if you do not like something then try to do something about it! Yeesh. Another special thanks to the desk staff for assisting me with printing off boarding passes as the lobby CPU's would not work correctly yet they were more than willing to attempt to print them off for me! The maids are very polite also and do an awesome job. The casino staff and waitresses are also excellent and one night we almost had to ask them to stop serving us LOL. So again, thanks Tropicana for giving us 'specials' and we will continue to stay there when we come as it is a great place to stay...sad thing is more people will stay with reviews like this. I strongly recommend a suite in the towers as they give you soooo much room and extra amenities...however the standard rooms or strip views are also well equipped and more than comfortable. My only complaint and it is a 'me' thing is I am not fond of adjoining rooms - unless of course you know who is in it as they can be a bit noisy at times....but that again is a 'me' thing and is not against the Tropicana!

Not so at the Trop! The lobby is right off the strip, registration is immediately to your left and and the elevators to Paradise Tower are directly to the right. Check-in time was less than 4 minutes, in our room on the 14th floor after 2 more minutes...it just doesn't get any better than that. The Tropicana is light, airy, comfortable, friendly.

Our room, the entire hotel in fact, was tastefully appointed and the beds were wonderful, high quality sheets, duvets, almost too comfortable to leave! Once in our room, we never heard our neighbours, the elevators nor the ice/vending machines outside our door. We couldn't hear the casino noise or pool/club music either, these rooms are well sound-proofed. We ate at Cafe Niki twice, good food, comparable prices. We dined at the hotel's Itialian restaurant \"Bacio\" one evening where we very much enjoyed the rissotto, the profiterole and the charming waiters.

This was our first trip to Vegas (in fact to America) and we were a little apprehensive when we arrrived at the airport but we needn't have worried. In our opinion the hotel was a breath of fresh air compared to some of the other hotels along the strip because of its bright, airy public areas making feel that you were indeed at the beach rather than in an oppressive casino atmosphere. The rooms were clean, of a good size and the maid service was regular and thorough. Beds were very comfortable and of typical American size - large and very comfortable! Unlike neighbouring properties such as New York New York and the Excalibur there was not a wide choice of places to eat within the hotel, but the restaurant and fast food options were of very good quality. Location is great. It is one of the closest hotels to the airport. The hotel did not seem well populated at night time and this resulted in a lack of atmosphere in the casino and bar areas, compared to other hotels we visited. This was a shame because the barman who served my family was very obliging. The quietness could however be considered a bonus if you are looking for somewhere to chill out after the business of the strip. The pool area had ample sunbeds with towels provided but even though it is landscaped it did feel a little bit like a concrete jungle, maybe because it had just been completed.

The mattress topper and quality of the sheets was the best we had ever had. The view was also good overlooking the pool and the strip. The only slight negatives with the room was the noise from Club/Cafe Nikki which drifted upwards but having read other reviews was something we were prepared for. The room was quite stuffy at times as for some reason the air con would not go below 16 degrees c.The bathroom was also a good size with a large corner bath. The only part of the room not completely refurbished was part of the bathroom with the wall and floor tiling and bath/shower. Be warned if you are tall-ie over 5'6 in my case, as you will have to stoop under the shower head as it is fixed. Bit of shame to cut corners in the bathroom when everything else had been refurbed. The towels were also poor quality. It would be great if tea/coffee facilities were in the room as we really missed this. I appreciate having read other reviews now that the management can arrange this on request, but to be honest I assumed that if this was possible they would already have been provided-the same with the lack of fridge-not something i would think of asking for at reception! The staff were all really helpful at the hotel-but we felt sorry for the hostesses who had the worst uniform going-an unflattering and old fashioned skimpy outfit that you would expect to see in a different occupation!

Check-in was swift and efficient and we paid extra to retain our room until 3pm on our last day, and then up to floor 16 in the Paradise Tower. The room (a deluxe) was large, spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, with 2 huge beds, beautiful linens, and a large bathroom with lots of good towels. There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board, along with a large safety deposit box and free wifi. It also sports a massive television, should you feel inclined to watch US television. No fridge in the room, which we would have liked for a variety of reasons including the storing of the doggie bag! (Large US portions!) We noticed a fridge in the corridor on our last day from a room that had been vacated, and realized we could have rented one for our stay \u2013 we wish this had been pointed out to us, but maybe we just should have asked. The Tropicana is next to the airport, but the window glazing is excellent as we can honestly say that we were never troubled by aircraft noise. In addition, the Trop casino area is mostly light and bright (and we would say \u2018airy\u2019, but they do allow smoking as in all casinos in Vegas), and not as massive as some. It took us until day 2 to realize that to get into the pool complex \u2013 Nikki Beach - that you do not need to be a resident in the hotel (well, we never saw anyone checking whether people were resident, so anyone can make use of it). Needless to say, the pool area really does fill up, so it pays to stake your claim early. We also found that a huge number of the sun-beds were broken and no-one seemed to check them take them off site to get them fixed. There is an abundance of fresh towels and the pool is large and fairly warm too \u2013 note there is no \u2018deep end\u2019 \u2013 the depth ranges from 3ft to 4/5ft only. We have to comment that Nikki beach is EXTREMELY noisy thanks to the OTT loud music. The speakers around the pool churn out music constantly which was fine by us, but Club Nikki (at least, that\u2019s what we think it was), suddenly comes to life around mid-day and the music thumps out at an ever increasing decibel level, competing with the music coming from the pool speakers \u2013 nightmare! We therefore retreated to the far end of the grass banking, which made it tolerable. Some people, we guess, must just enjoy the racket! Anther thing to point out about the Tropicana is the over-powering \u2018scent\u2019 of coconut air-freshener, which is pumped out 24/7 from the air-conditioning \u2013 it really stinks and we are at a loss as to why they do it. Thankfully, no such aroma pervades the rooms!

And the results were even better than I hoped. Let's start with the rooms: They are clean, comfortable (one notoriously difficult sleeper said it was the most comfortable hotel bed he had ever slept on) and feature a pleasant d\u00e9cor. The sportsbook: This was a big one for my group - our entire Saturday was dedicated to watching and gambling on college football. And we couldn't have been happier with the room. There were tons of huge HD projectors to dart our eyes between, comfortable chairs and some cool nooks with big HD TVs on the wall. Before the trip someone recommended we do out football watching at Caesars Palace. We checked it out, but the bright lights from Pure washed out the images on the wall. At the Trop, they keep the lighting perfect - the picture really pops. We loved it. The service: I've been to Vegas about 10 times, and the service has been pretty good no matter where I stayed. My experience at the Trop was even better, though. Nothing crazy, just a lot of employees willing to actually interact rather than just address my immediate need. My group had great conversations with a hostess, two bartenders and two blackjack dealers. It was cool to feel like a person, not just an object to satisfy. The food: We didn't eat a lot of different food at the Trop, but we had several meals at Cafe Nikki. (One member of the group wanted to have every meal there, but the rest of us insisted on seeking a little variety.) The breakfast buffet was very good - make sure to pour yourself some real apple juice and get a custom omelet. The lunch and dinner options feature a lot of great sports bar food, and it's all well-made and reasonably priced. Other great things: The pool, plenty of card tables, fun poker dealers and one of the highlights of my trip - they serve Victoria cerveza at Cafe Nikki and throughout the casino. Thank god, a casino that serves a Mexican beer other than Corona! My only complaint is the Casino's music selection - it was really soulless. I'm talking Ricky Martin \"Shake Your Bon Bon\" played several times over the course of the weekend. Luckily, they don't play the music too loud (if the songs were better, I would encourage them to crank it up a bit more). I brought this point up in a questionnaire after my stay, and the hotel's VP of Hotel Operations was nice enough to email me to let me know that they're making changes. Sweet!

Pai Gow was not always open, but why open it if no ones playing right? Slots as usual, 1 cent to high limit. Poker room has about 6 tables, sometimes no cash games going, sometimes 2 tables, tournaments a few times a day and depending on the times 1 to 2 tables. Poker room staff friendly and knowledgeable. The location is awesome. Walk ways take you to the MGM in about 2 mins, NYNY in 5, Excalibur and Luxor in 5 and Mandalay in 10.

So here goes... I moved from the East Coast to AZ early this year and before I started my new job I decided I would treat myself to a long weekend in Vegas. After some elaborate room searching I was able to get a great deal for my stay (I booked 2 consecutive reservations; one for the weekdays and one for the weekend and ended up with a great price!!). Now when I got to the hotel I was exhausted (I had clocked about 14 hours of travel due to delays and a missed flight). The bellman was immediately offering assistance and got me over to the front desk right away... Small wait at check in but nothing out of the ordinary... and then... The front desk set the tone for my stay.. The front desk agent was being polite and doing that small talk thing that they have all been taught to do (you know what I am talking about) but the difference? She was actually listening... She asked me to wait a moment and stepped away, when she came back she said \"I imagine you are tired after such a long day. I've gone ahead and upgraded you to a nice quiet room so that you can relax\". She set up my reservations so that I could stay in the same room straight through the weekend and made me feel like she actually cared... I get escorted to my room by the bellman and he points out all the renovations along the way. Now, I remember my first trip to Vegas about 10 years ago when the Trop seemed to be going in the same downward spiral as all the other Vegas classic hotels (the Sands, Sahara, Frontier... etc). I can only say one thing after walking the renovated \"These people know what they are doing and are bringing the gem back!!\" The hotel was clean as a whistle, the hallways felt plush as you walked and they smelled awesome. All along the way the bellman made recommendations according to what I said I liked to do... he mentioned some great restaurants, 'must see' Vegas attractions and gave me the 411 on how to get around Vegas and enjoy myself... PERFECT! Now the best part... The room!!! They did it right... The linens and bed were just what the doctor ordered, the room was massive and had a decent view (it was a view Eastward so none of the casino lights were visible from my room... i.e. I got a full on black out that was perfect for sleeping. VEGAS NAP A SUCCESS). Plenty of storage in the room too! The bathroom was decent and the amenities were great... was it the best bathroom ever? No. But it was all I needed for this stay. Housekeeping during my stay was more than I expected... The room was immaculately clean each day and when I ran into a room attendant in the hallways they would always smile, greet me and ask if I needed anything (ohh yeah, when I asked for anything, they actually followed thru and delivered). The casino staff was cordial and polite. I always had a drink within a few minutes of sitting down to gamble and there was regular presence on the floor. The selection on the casino floor was pretty decent FYI, for the Vegas/gambling novice the Monopoly Big Event machine all the way in the back is a lot of fun if you have a group of friends with you.. play the \"invaders from the planet moolah\" machine in the middle.. even if you lose it is a hoot and a half.. yes I am easily entertained by some slot machines. Everything during my stay was smooth and comfortable... I am so glad that this Las Vegas gem is coming back! Check out the Trop!!!

It's a great hotel, there's no doubt about that, it's in a fantastic location - on the junction with New York New York, Excalibur and MGM Grand - it's light and airy in the casino (and not too large), the staff are amazingly friendly and the price is good for where it is situated. It's recently been refurbished and they've done mostly a great job. We had a room on the 17th floor in the Club Tower (there's no 13th floor!!) and the view was of the south end of the strip and the pool. Wonderful. The rooms are clean with good amenities, lovely lovely housekeeping staff and a decent size. Why I've given it 3 stars? Well if it's not your first time in Vegas, you'll no doubt be aware that it's **exhausting** to wander round all day. So you'll want to sunbathe by the pool. The pool is freezing. It was 95 degrees outside, but the pool was soooo cold. Most of the sunloungers were broken. The functional sunloungers were all taken by about 9.30am. Please Tropicana management sort out the sunloungers!! And then to the music. The music piped through to the normal pool area is fab, a mix of good popular stuff, appealing to everyone.... then at 12 noon the music from Nikki Beach starts (the part of Tropicana where you have to be 'beautiful' to lounge in a cabana, and pay to get in - hence it's never full) - now I'm no pensioner - I'm 35 - but the music is SO LOUD it's disgraceful. A thumping bass line of dance music all day from lunchtime that overrides everything else - I had noise cancelling earphones in and could still feel it thumping against my (broken) sunlounger.

The customer relations manager Nicole gave us a fridge free of charge to keep my partners meds in which was nice of her, if you`ve got any queries she will be happy to help.Drinks at the pool excellent..Mohito`s were made by them crushing the lime with the mint 1st for maximum flavour but unfortunately at the inside bar the bartender was new and didnt know how to make them so he got his colleague to make them and he just put sliced lime and mint leaves into the glass, it cost $24 for 2 Mohito`s at the bar and they tasted like a glass of soda with no alchohol in and no flavour. So excellent cocktail makers at the pool , so tasty..thankyou. Be careful of taxi drivers, one charged $28 from Freemont to our hotel (should be $20) , they go onto the Freeway if you dont tell them. Wanted to go and spend a lot of money on the last night on the Roulette table but there was only two which were too busy so had to leave it and do it in the morning which wasnt as much fun as was rushed.

We found the bus service to be the most efficient and cost effective way of travelling up and down, $5 for a multi-use ticket lasting 2 hours and $7 for one lasting 24 hours. The monorail is expensive, difficult to access and stops a fair distance from The Strip, at the back of the hotels. Whatever you do, take comfortable shoes because Vegas involves a lot of walking. If not, the hotel will hire out a motorised wheelchair by the day!

Its not as big as some of the hotels, think its because its one of the first that was built, its no were near as big as the bellagio, mgm, mirage etc. The casino was a nice size though, not too big that you wont get lost, and the croupiers were good fun we had a laugh with them. Because it was not as big as other hotels sometimes the tables were full all the time, so we had to wait sometimes. The drinks are free though as long as you gambling, i was happy as i could have champagne cocktails. There is a small takeaway restaurant in the hotel, they do a sandwich called the reuben and it was the nicest sandwich ive ever had.

Shortly after we got in the room the phone rang and we were told that there was going to be a delivery to our room and within a few minutes chocolate cake & champagne arrived. So at 1 am after being up almost 24 hours we were enjoying our goodies. The suite was beautiful and very spacious with a coffee maker, refrigerator, spa tub, sauna, and a huge shower. The bed was comfortable and they even gave us masks to keep the light out. It was fantastic and the room was beautiful, clean & well cared for--we felt like royalty. We had to move the second night and I told my hubby to be prepared to come back to reality for the next three nights as we were leaving the suite but much to our surprise the deluxe plus room we have we also wonderful. The bed was again great, the tub large although not a spa tub we great and the room was neat, clean and spacious. I loved the bright colorful furnishings--they were refreshing. We then left the hotel for two nights in AZ and returned for our final two nights in Vegas and were booked in a Deluxe Room in the Paradise tower. This room although not as big as the plus room was nicely furnished and well taken care. It was clean and the the bed was comfy as the other two. Check-in was efficient--no line, the valet parking was well staffed and efficient and everyone working was very friendly and it looked like the employees enjoyed working there.

Each and every day housekeeping was carried out with any complaints from us. We both loved the size of the casino as it meant you got used to different slots and were able to find them again with ease. This helped me manage a win of over $800 on a 1cent machine, a great start to our holiday.The pool area was fantastic other than having to spend too much time seeking out a sun lounger that wasn't broken, I would guess that over 50% of them fall into that category. One of our holiday highlights was seeing the Gladys Knight show which was truly memorable. I was not impressed with the car rental company as the staff were quite ignorant and the prices were very poor value. To make a car rental reservation I used the internet in my room and booked with Avis who have a desk and collection point in Excalibur saving over $200 on a 4 day rental.To all the reviewers who complain about the location may I suggest they look at a location map prior to booking and if you don't want to be so far South on the Strip go elsewhere.

So for this price it was \"okay\" (we also got $91 off of hotel due to our comps). We did not get 3 rooms together as booked (and paid for) which is typical of Las Vegas -- at first they were going to give us smoking rooms but due to all members of our group being non-smoking, two of which were asmatic we were given non-smoking rooms, not all of together and not in same towers for first night. The next day they moved one room to our tower (at back) on same floor, the other room we left as it was in same tower but different floor. The staff did not offer to find us alternate rooms at beginning, we had to insist that they find us rooms. If they could not have given us non-smoking rooms I am not sure how much fuss we would have had to make to get what we already paid for. I believe the least a hotel in Vegas should do is hold \"non-smoking\" rooms for people that reserve non-smoking 6 mos in advance. We had an incident with a member of our group - she was going up stairs at Nikki Cafe where art work is on a wall but part of that artwork involves a \"sandbox\" for better lack of term that actually juts out 1 foot beyond the wall. She did not see the curb of the sandbox and tripped and fell into the artwork and was scraped on the hands (trying to break her fall) and wrenched her neck and back. Staff did not assist her, customers did. Then staff came and offered bandaids for her scrapes. We were told to make an incident report which we did to the security officer in the casino. The casino security officer did NOT take her to a private location (like an office) but took her back to the restaurant to view the site of the fall -- had her sit in visible view to all patrons and took photos of her injuries (this is just NOT acceptable way of treating a guest). While doing this two other restaurant patrons tripped and fell as well. Security said that this was not the first time someone fell. They gave her a small icepack (that is all they had, no tensor bandage for her sprained ankle) and sent her on her way. Not one person from the hotel offered an apology -- in most hotels you would hear from Management who would at the very least offer you some sort of comp for the inconvenience. This was most disappointing treatment by hotel staff. The pool staff were very lazy -- compared to Palazzo staff. [Palazzo staff hand you your towels and offer to assist you in seating (moving chairs etc) and they have maintenance staff that come around every half hour cleaning up the glasses and garbage people leave. The Pool Staff go along and pick up all towels left on chairs that are unoccupied.] The Trop staff did none of this. You have to actually reach into the towel cabanna and pick up your own towels, the staff do not assist you in moving the \"plastic\" chairs which are 80% broken (they cannot be set to recline only lie down) nor do they or anyone else clean up the pool area (garbage or towels). made us wonder if anyone even bothers to clean the pool and hot tubs! The decibel of music coming from Nikki Beach is unbearable (as is the selection of music) at the pool and overpowers the beautiful music from the Pool area itself. The area of the pool by Nikki Beach smells of sewer (very unpleasant) so reccomend you sit as far from Nikki Beach area as possible. The only \"nice\" things about the hotel is the comfort of the beds and the back tower's proximity to pool. The room (1773) we had was dirty, the carpet had a burn hole by the door and on the desk (this was a non-smoking room ?) and a red stain on carpet (likely from a drink spilled). The shutters on the windows are okay - providing you do not want to sleep during day as they do let light through. Loud music from Nikki Beach makes sleeping in afternoon impossible. Also at night you cannot sleep until it shuts down. The rooms are nothing to write home about - did not even take photos of. I will say that the photos on the website are NOT what you get, deceiving in size and what is included in your rooml.

When planning this trip the reviews were great and explained that the hotel has been completely renovated. I want a great pool area to top up my tan so chose the Trop and got a great rate on it's web site for a king club deluxe I was staying in Fremont street the first night so hit the bus up to the Excaliber and crossed over to the Trop. I arrived just after noon so was prepared to check my bags with the Bell service but was really happy to be welcomed at check in who was really engaging (my Scottish accent helps too I think). I asked for a quiet room and he offered me a new king room in the club tower on the 14th floor looking towards the airport and hills which was just fine for me although I think he would've tried hard to find me a strip view if I'd asked. Very efficient and friendly plus he took the time to talk me through the resort map and explained how to get the the gym, pool and my room. The Trop has a $10 a night resort fee. I actually this it's was great value as it included wifi by the pool and in the room plus gym access and pool towels. Other realist charge you for everything so I think it was very reasonable. Walking through the hotel I was very impressed with the decor, it's very light and airy with everything clad cream leather with gold trimmings. Felt very upscale but also laid back at the same time. A great feel to the place so it was a very good first impression. The club tower is a bit of a walk from the reception, yo need to walk through the casino, up an escalator and then walk over the pool overpass to get to the club tower. Not that bad a walk but some may find it hard going. The good thing is that there is a Starbucks near the elevators in the tower so you can grab a dose of caffeine to get you the final stretch to your room :) There are 5 or 6 elevators so I never waited long for one. Also, I really liked that when you pushed a call button, the sign for the elevator that was coming to you lit up meaning you didn't have to guess and run for it when it got there, nice simp touch that I haven't seen much. The good thing about staying in the club tower is that you have direct access to the gym and pool area from the elevators. My room was fantastic, definitely best in class compared to any of the others I've stayed in and amazing value. Real nice touches like lots of drawer space, shutters on the windows which can be opened along with the window which is a rare feature. The TV was huge and had may too many channels for me to be bothered hoping my way through The bathroom is well appointed with a corner bath with shower and lots of towels. All in all I was really impressed with the room. The Nikki Beach pool area is fabulous! Exactly what I was looking for. The only gripe was the lack of fully functioning beds. They obviously purchase the plastic frames very cheaply as the hinge on the back to prop it up to a sitting position was broken on many. That said I managed to find a good one every day and they are all fitted with thick mattresses so are extremely comfortable. The pool are is very cool indeed, I was really impressed by it. The pool bar is well staffed and not as expensive as I though it might be. There is also waitress service for food which again is pretty reasonable, decent quality and plentiful if a bit lacking in choice. I never went to the club but it looked amazing and will definitely visit next time when Im not travelling alone. There was no loud music from the club that I could hear at the pool, just soft rock/pop which was fine. The casino was surpassingly compact but I loved it. The staff told me it was almost doubling in size soon but I didn't find it lacked anything. I played the tables and slots and loved the atmosphere of the smaller casino. The only thing it did lack was waitresses who were hard to find sometimes. I never ate at the hotel as I like walking the strip at night. There are two main restaurants plus a few others for snacks and a 24 hour Starbucks.

Nicole Marshall was superb in making our stay even more special (we were celebrating my big 50 birthday!) and her help and suggestions by email before our stay really added to the whole holiday. Plus she surprised us with a birthday gift of two tickets to see Gladys Knight in the hotel theatre which was amazing. Our intial room was not available on arrival and the only hiccup to our stay was that when we arrived at 9pm at night we were put in a smoking room in the Club Tower which still wasn't cleaned!! This meant us having to hang around for half an hour in the Starbucks coffee shop, a bit of a pain, but when we did get into our room we were surprised with two mini bottles of champagne and two enormous chocolate covered strawberries as a birthday treat! The room (18th floor) we had for our first night was lovely, but we did notice the smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor (not in our room though). The view was amazing, it had a large bathroom and two queen beds. The walk to the Club Tower wasn't bad at all, take any other reviews that moan about the 'long' walk with a pinch of salt. An extra 5 minutes walk along an internal corridor that has small shops either side and a coffee shop at the end and you're there! Nothing to complain about, some of the hotels we visited during our stay (MGM for example) were so HUGE you must have to walk for miles to reach your room! On our second day we moved to room 1826 on the 18th floor of the Paradise Tower. Another fabulous view - over the south end of the strip towards Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay. A huge room with a large king size bed, great flat screen tv, great toiletries in the large bathroom, loads of storage space and we also arranged for a coffee maker in our room which was lovely. The staff at the Tropicana were all incredibly helpful, polite and friendly, from check-in to concierge to maid service and everyone else in between. We ate at Biscayne at the hotel which was superb and I would strongly recommend, we also had breakfast twice in the small cafe there (whose name escapes me) but that was very good value. We played on the slots a fair bit and joined the players club which gave us some cash back with Tropicana's promotion at the moment. We were very low rollers but we had some fun gambling a little - I tried the roulette table once and my partner spent some time in the Sports Book and also managed to watch a couple of Manchester Utd games while there!! We didn't try out the pool but did have a walk around the area and it looked fun with space for everyone. We didn't try out Club Nikki or the Nikki Restaurant but they both looked pretty buzzing. I'm trying to think of any downsides to our stay, but the only one I can think of is really petty .... ie. the shower water pressure wasn't as good as I'd like but nonetheless I had a good shower every morning!! For the price we paid the Tropicana was fantastic! It isn't a huge themed Las Vegas hotel with an enormous casino and loads of restaurants and theatres to chose from, but that's what we loved about it. It's smaller, friendly and even though towards the end of the strip near enough to the hustle bustle to only be 10 minutes walk to the centre of the action, but far enough away to escape the crowds and manic fun of the Strip!!

I've heard a lot of nice things about all the updates, etc. and from the past I knew I liked their winding pool which had some shady areas for those not wanting to me in the hot sun 100% of the time. Upon arrival I was a little disappointed as there were 2 clerks at the check in desk but soon two more arrived and the line moved along. Our resevations were for a king nonsmoking and it was not available. When I stated that was what we \"reserved\", I was told that is only a request, not a guarantee. At first we were told we could have a queen - nonsmoking and then the next day could be moved so we agreed upon this when the clerk tells us to wait a sec- he would check with the manager. He came back and not only provided us with a king, nonsmoking but gave us $30 a night off the internet rate that I had booked it at. Wow, talk about putting a smile on our faces. We stayed four nights on the 11th floor. Being school probably just started, there were virtually no children around and the whole floor was very quiet. Our room had a view of the pool. Bed was extremely comfortable with extra pillows in the closet if need be. Furnishings were nice and room was very clean and flat screen was awesome. The bathroom, while nice, did not have an exhaust fan but that didn't really matter. In room safe, hair dryer & clothes iron & board were included. No fridge or coffee maker. The pool was very nice, a little chilly but the hot tub warmed you right up. It was big and roomy (I believe held 18) and we enjoyed that a lot. Didn't win on the slots but the points we racked up, we were able to deduct from our hotel bill so that was an added bonus to the reduced rate.

Expectations are often unrealistic and even ridiculous in my experience, especially in the States where people travel so frequently and as a consequence are exceptionally picky, critical and easily dis-satisfied. Bearing this in mind, the Tropicana is MIND BLOWING!!!! We had sooooo much fun there and it far exceeded all of our expectations!! Reviewing the place on its' own merits should be enought to convince anyone to stay here but one cannot help additionally comparing it to the surrounding hotels on the doorstep, where the Trop comes out on top, mostly. It is so much lighter, brighter, airy and more colourful & modern than the NY NY, MGM Grand and Excalibur, which, although much bigger than the Trop, all look strikingly dark and dingy and stuck in a late 80s/ early 90s weird cheesy time warp. Anyway it was our first time in Vegas and I'd read loads of reviews with conflicting 'tips' and recommendations for the 'best' rooms. It cost us $13 in a taxi from the airport (it is practically next door to the airport.) I'd asked for a room in the Paradise Tower, fearing the supposedly horrendous noise from the Club Tower. However our room wasn't ready upon check-in so they upgraded us to a junior suite in the Club Tower and we never heard a whisper of a peep of a hint of a noise! (6th floor facing the airport/ Luxor/ Mandalay.) The room was beautiful, lovely bright colours, very spacious, great TV, excellent quality i-pod dock, super-comfy bed. I mentioned a fridge at check-in and they brought one to the room straight away, and it was free of charge. There's a tip for ya! I could see that the bath didn't quite fit in with the rest of the room as it looked quite old-fashioned but it was clean and big enough for 2 people with a ledge to sit on so you could have a beer in the bath! The pool was fabulous. Although it's always packed you can always find a bed and it's really big. It was 100 degrees when we were there and we loved the super-cool temperature of the water. We arrived on Tuesday and there was music playing but it was at a nice volume, and it was sing-alongy & up-beat, new stuff and older songs too. But come Thursday, the dreaded Nikki Beach opened it's doors and it IS pretty annoying I must concede , especially since it seemed so totally unappealing to us, a teeny weeny little pool too small to swim in surrounded by loungers and beds where posers pout into their $20 cocktails, and yes it was ridiculously loud monotonous heavy-bass painfully cool 'non-music' that drowned out the 'normal' music. But it didn't spoil our time around the pool it was just slightly irritating. The casino looked massive to our naive eyes when we checked in but actually it is a lot smaller than the others. But it's still really big - how many slot machines do you need?? We don't play at the tables (we were there for a wedding, not to gamble, athough we had a go on the slot machines for a laugh) but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Gladys Knight plays there, Brad Garrett has a comedy club there and the restaurants always looked busy. We looked around quite a few of the other hotels and despite their more impressive sizes and greater choice of bars and clubs and restaurants compared with the Trop, I would choose the Tropicana hands down if I went back to Vegas. We got a really good price with Expedia, it's in an excellent location (wherever you stay on the strip whether north south or in the middle you will end up pounding the pavement anyway to get from one hotel/casino to another), the decor is sooooo pleasant and bright, the room was absolutely wonderful and the staff were very personable and efficient.

I've stayed in the MGM before and liked being at one end of the strip but I hated the MGM because it was just too big and didn't like the rooms. The view from the Tropicana was INCREDIBLE!! We were looking right at the MGM, NY and Excalibur and had a great view of the strip. I loved the tropical scent that was piped throughout the hotel, I could have sworn it was in the pool as well. The pizza/cafe in the hotel had fantastic food and for a reasonable price. Plus there was a Denny's nearby. I like laying by the pool so I did a lot of research to find a nice pool and this one didn't disappoint. Having said that, the area is nowhere near the size of the pool area of the MGM so when they start blaring the music from Club Nikki, mixed in with the music at the main pool (that I LOVED) plus a third section going, it sounded just awful and was not relaxing in the least. The only two \"big\" complaints I had was that, because we stayed the weekend, we didn't realize just how loud the music at Club Nikki would be, though the lady at check-in said that being on the 15th floor we should be all right. With the windows open it was like having the music right there in your room. With the windows closed you could still hear it very clearly, until 3 a.m. both nights. I know that you don't go to Vegas to sleep, but 3 a.m. is a bit late for me to be listening to blaring music. The second complaint was that when we finally made it to the pool I was happy to see how many available lounge chairs there were. Well, there was a reason they were available - they were all broken!! Having undergone a big reno, couldn't they have sprung for new chairs? I gave up after the 9th chair and just collected 3 lounge pillows which I used to prop up my chair. Not a big deal in the end, I was just glad to soak up some sun. :) Would I stay here again - yes! But not on a weekend. Maybe the sound was better in the other tower.

Nikki Beach was amazing and was very cool and everything looked so new and clean! They offer sun beds and sun tents which were very affordable and we also found the drinks were also very affordable again cheaper than most of the other hotels! The Nikki beach pool party was really fun and busy and the D.J also played great music, such a good relaxing fun day. Nikki club was also very good and always busy and entry is free to people staying at the hotel which was great!

Tropicana Las Vegas is one of the well talked about hotel/casino resorts on the fabulous Las Vegas Strip! It was my first trip to Vegas and of course my first time staying at the Tropicana. I chose this hotel because of the attractive decor. The warm color schemes and they had great deals for employees like myself through my job(Delta Airlines). From check in to check out, the front desk agents were welcoming and polite. They all were calm, and easy to talk to. They were very knowledgeable of their position, the hotel and could pretty much answer all of my many first timer questions. I felt so revived at the Tropicana, and so alive. Once I got to my room, it was like my own piece of heaven. It looked like a little beach cabana (lol) very clean, very cozy, very sexy. I honestly forgot I was in Vegas for a sec. The thing that stole my breath was the POOL! I have never seen such a beautiful pool side like the pools at the Tropicana. For some reason I believe that their signature color is white (the hotel building white too)! In the sun that pool looks electrifying, I'm talking blinded from its beauty. I read that it has the best pool in Vegas lol...I don't know how true that statement is but I'd like to see others try and compete. Key word TRY! Club Nikki...I honestly don't need to say anything else...but to words \"LOVE IT\"!!!! I didn't dine there however, but I did take a peak in the restaurants and if the food taste as good and the restaurants look, then you better believe you are in for a taste divine treat! The dealers at the casino were awesome. It was my first time at a \"BlackJack\" table and they weren't to busy to answer my questions. I felt like a big winner...and a big spender....Hey ya gotta play to win right lol....comfortable seats, even the tables had cushioning for your elbows...Drinks anyone? Cocktail drinks were delicious, and well served. The overall service was excellent beyond EXCELLENT (what are u training your employees over there)!

I also brought this to the attention of the front desk, but nothing changed. It was very inconvenient when we were trying to get ready, and maid service arrived to clean the room---inexcusable.

Everything is clean and bright, the employees are happy and it totally shows. Check-in was easy and painless (unlike some Vegas properties). Our room was 1203 in the Paradise Tower...had a view of the Strip. Room was SPOTLESSLY CLEAN, and each day we came back to the room it was perfect.

Last time I stayed at the Trop, the waitresses bringing drinks in the Casino were non-existent, this time, every time I turned around, one of those nice women were asking me if I wanted a drink. Found some great loose slot machines. The new pool is the best, but my only complaint about is that while sitting out at the regular pool, I could hear the music from the pool over at Club Nikki. Two different songs going at the same time....very distracting. I would suggest they coordinate the music between the two pools. They now have a Starbucks, so nice to be able to get coffee early in the AM. One complaint about the store by the front entrance that sells essentials....although it is nice to have the store there...is it REALLY necessary to charge $9.00 for a pack of cigarettes?

The food was pricey for that type of service ($11 for a club sandwich - no chips, or anything served with it).

Myself and my partner travelled to LV for 3 nights in July 2011. We were joining a group of people who were staying in this hotel, so we didn't need to look elsewhere on the strip for alternatives. We booked through lasvegas.com and got a rate of $60 per night (although the $15 resort fee/per night/per room was additional to the $60 as is standard with all of the LV strip hotels I believe). The first thing that hits you as you approach this hotel is the smell of coconut; somehow the fact that the hotel pumps this tropical scent throughout the aircon had failed to register with me prior to our arrival. After a few days we just became accustomed to it. The rooms were not overly luxurious; the bathroom was quite basic. But the beds were comfortable and the hotel had all we could ask for, at what I still think was a decent overnight rate. The breakfast buffet was about $20 per person, which also seems standard enough in Las Vegas hotels. The hotel concierage desk helped my organise a helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon prior to our arrival, we secured a rate which saved us more than $200; we flew with Maverick and I have to say although it was pricey it was well worth it. There is a starbucks inside the hotel, and it is within walking distance of CVS pharmacy and Ross etc on the strip. The outlet malls are well worth the visit, I went to the one south of the strip which was about a $15 taxi ride, although I do believe there are buses you can take which are much cheaper.

The suite was very tastefully decorated Vegas hotels. The Tropicana consists of the Paradise Tower that is nearer to Las Vegas Blvd., AKA, the Strip, and the Club Tower sits farther back. Some readers have complained of the \"walk\" from the Club Tower, but because the Trop is a more intimate property, it really is nothing compared to the walk one would have to your room from many main towers of the other hotels in town. Also, if you book a Club Suite that faces the Strip, the panoramic views of the Strip from your suite are some of the best in Vegas. I would avoid the rooms facing the back of the Club Tower because these face the airport-although I suppose that because the rooms themselves are so nice, it would not matter to many people. The staff is excellent. Although everyone there was great, the front desk supervisor Gerard was gracious and understanding and our server Ryan at Nikki Cafe was wonderful. Nikki Cafe is one of the restaurants on the property and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning. The interior design of the Cafe is gorgeous from the bamboo ceilings to the lacquered wooden tables, to the Maori-inspired accents. It could easily be found in an Amanresort. There were several small nits with the Trop--most related to the music that they play. The music is too loud, espcially in Nikki Beach and by the Pool. Another issue is that the outside \"club\" called Nikki Beach plays different music than the rest of the pool area, creating a crazy cacocophony that detracts from house nice the pool area is. The music should be toned down and coodinated between Nikki Beach and the rest of the pool area. I love all kinds of music ( rock, metal, blues, jazz) and do not mind a good amount of volume but the volume here was over the top. All in all though, I recommend the Tropicana for its freshly renovated rooms, great staff, and for some of the other design features such as Nikki Beach. The Trop offers an excellent value.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat option if you don't like the bigger casinos.\u201d", "Author": "DJ1971", "ReviewID": "UR117969170", "Content": "Not being a gambler or a fan of the bigger casinos in Vegas, the Tropicana proved to be an ideal option for a business trip.

Pro's Loved the location as we could walk up along the strip and also easy access to the airport which is great. It was beside New York , New York which has so much to do in it - must visit the piano bar. Best casino for me as it was smaller and not as dark as the others we saw and we went into every hotel. Room was newish - bed most comfortable we have slept in and big TV Loved the smell around the hotel !! very fresh and a nice change from the musty smell in alot of the hotels we walked around Check out - friendly staff member and was smooth but I had already gone down and sorted out our bill the night before which took a while as they hadn't followed notes added to the system for us. Cons Bathroom in rooms, still looks outdated and actually strange in room, as it makes room not fit together ie.old with new Check in - lady who checked us in was not friendly, didnt tell us anything about the hotel, she just said 'Oh you have spoken to Nicole' - she then had our refridgerator delivered but I kind of felt she turned her nose up! Its not much to ask a staff member to say Welcome to Las Vegas - its not like they were that busy! Long walk to the tower we were in so I would say ask to be in the Paradise tower if you can! Not many restaurants - we ate at the steak restaurant but it was expensive for what we got! Now I have to say I was in contact with Nicole in advance and she was very friendly but her staff didnt follow what she had added to our booking and I had to sort that out myself. If Im being honest I expected a little more but at the same time I was happy to stay there and for the price we paid it was great value! If I was staying in Las Vegas again I would probably spend more and stay in The Venetian as this was the nicest hotel we saw when walking in and out - but of course Tropicana doesn't claim to be one of the fancier hotels so as they are in different price ranges this would just be my preference.

Each room had a fab view of the strip with New York New York, the MGM Grand & Excalibur within view. We each had 2 very comfortable double beds, a flat screen hd tv & an iPod dock. A good size wardrobe aswell. The room was huge by US standards & the bathroom was a good size with a shower & bath tub. I will say that there was a bit of grime around the seal of the bath, certainly not enough to put you off though. We didn't experience any noise which conisdering the pool was directly below us was good. I think the opening times for the pool were good (9am-7pm) as it meant there were no issues with noise whilst you were asleep. The wifi was also very fast. We used the casino occasionally, it was much brighter than other places & nowhere near as busy (which was good!) The waitresses were friendly & the drinks came promptly & free!! We didn't use the pool but it looked very clean & well kept. We also didn't go to Club Nikki although the pool parties at the weekends looked really fun! Check out was a breeze, took less than 5 minutes & they store luggage if you have a late flight. Couple of points to note: When I got to my room, there was a 5 cent coin & a few black hairs on the floor, under the bathroom sink. So I don't think housekeeping was all that. (they also failed to remove empty coffee cups from the room) However, beds were made daily & they did mop the floor when I had an accident with the shower! We had 3 or 4 pizza house menus pushed under the door at night. Something I felt a bit uneasy about. The shower was good but difficult to use at first. You have to pull the handle out & twist!

I traveled with my 20-something son so we needed a room with two beds. Last year we stayed at the Nugget and when I requested a room with two beds I had to pay for VIP service to ensure I got the room. At the Tropicana when I asked for two beds there was no problem and no extra charge. I also asked for a strip view on an upper floor and got those also, with no additional charge. We arrived four hours before check-in but since there was a room available, which met all of our requirements, they let us check in early--again no charge. On the day of our departure we asked for a late check-out, which they gave us and again no charge. After all of this they asked at check-out if they could have done anything else to make our stay more pleasant. This is great customer service!!! The room was on the 12th floor and overlooked the pool and part of the strip. I was a little concerned because I had read in some reviews that the pool could be pretty loud, although we heard nothing. That may have been because we were not there during a weekend. The pool area is great with plenty of room to move away from the crowd near the pool and find some trees for shade. Our room was clean and well appointed. When we were checking in a lady was pushing a rug cleaner past our door and asked if we wanted the rug cleaned. It looked great to us so we passed. The only problem with the room was the shower head; it was okay for me because I'm pretty short, but my 6' tall son wasn't so happy with it, but it's nothing that would make much of a difference for us whether to stay. The beds and pillows were comfy, the room clean and quiet. The cafe' is good and reasonably priced. The casino is clean and really well lit, which we both like. Some of the casinos are so dark I have a hard time staying in them when I know it's so nice and bright outside. The slots were good to us plus when you sign up for the players club they will credit you half of your losses up to a certain dollar amount on the first day you sign up.

We have always loved the Tropicana since our first visit to Las Vegas in 2004, and managed to get this hotel at an excellent rate for 10 nights. We booked 2 paradise rooms and were not disappointed with them. Both rooms had a king size bed with one looking at the strip and the other overlooking the pool area (including Nikki Beach). The rooms were very clean, the beds extremely comfortable and for 2 people the rooms were huge. One of the things that was great about the hotel is that we didnt have to walk miles back to the room, or walk throught the casino when returning to the room which is really refreshing for a Las Vegas Hotel. Rooms - Spacious, clean and well maintained. Shutters were at the window instead of curtains which was great and the bathrooms were large and well equipped. The shower had multiple settings which was great to wake you up in a morning. Hotel Amenities - Good selection of food options, with both lower and higher end of catering options available. We used Pellegrinos quite a few times and the pizza and sandwiches were huge and well priced. Some shopping options available which were convenient but if you are looking for clothes bouitques you need to go other hotels or shopping centres. Everything clearly signposted except for the toilets over by Nikki Beach nightclub entrance which were very confusing, and resulted in more than one lady going into the gents toilets! This needs to be looked at and would recommend seperate signs indicating which toilet is for which sex. Pool - This was lovely with music played each day around the area. Nikki beach can be a little loud (we were there for the Labour Day celebrations but it didnt disturb our sunbathing) but the pool is large and so quite spots can be found. Towels were plentiful as were the sun loungers, and were able to get a sunlounger at anytime in the day. Pool was ice cold but certainly cooled you down from the 107c temperatures that they were having whilst we stayed there. We were able to take our own food and drink around the pool although a pool bar was available if you decided to purchase there. Location - Ideally located on the strip with NYNY, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, MGM and Monte Carlo all within walking distance. Also the hotel is located at the begining of the Deuce bus route ensuring that travellers are able to get a seat, although be aware that express buses do not stop here which was a little frustrating. Special mention needs to go to both Nicole Marshall and Joseph Phillips who both helped to make our trip even better by providing assistance in advance of us arriving.

Another negative was the bathroom in the room, it was dated and tired, they say they've just had a refit but did the bathrooms get missed? My final problem is with nikki beach, you have to pay into this pool/bar, I think this should be free the residents of the hotel and also it is only only open on some days meaning half of the week it is sat there empty whilst everyone is crammed into the other pool, I can't really understand the logic behind this?

We stayed at the Tropicana and we were impressed with the hotel room overall. The bed was great, super comfortable. The room safe was a great touch being I brought my lap top, it was large enough for my camera and my 15\" computer with room to spare. The T.V. was a good size flat screen, 42\" from the look of it, even though I only turned in on once. The only part of the room that I didn't like was the bathroom, the bathtub and shower are combined and the shower head is rather low. My girl friend didn't have much of an issue but any one over 5'10'' would have to duck down to get their head under the water. The pool was great, I can see why it was rated the best in Vegas, nicely away from the Strip I didn't even hear any traffic. The fitness centre was decent, with a ten or so workout machines, some free weights and cardio machines. The casino was smaller than some other casinos but nice and not too smokey. The casino was very clean, a lot of effort was put into making sure it was a welcoming place to stay. We stayed in the Club Tower it was nice but walking to the far side of the hotel each time was annoying, especially after a long day walking the Strip. If I was to stay again I would pay the extra move to the front tower. The staff was good, we were able to check in early around 12:30 which we really appreciated and they were helpful in finding places on the Strip. We took a trip to the Grand Canyon to the South Rim, we got a good deal along the strip for $115 each. I first thought of going to the West Rim to see the Sky Walk but one of the tour sellers that sold both tours informed me that you can't take pictures on the walk way and you have to pay extra to walk it anyway. The views from the South Rim will amazing and we got to see two different vantage points on our tour. It was a long day, eight hours, but I couldn't recommend it more. Freemont Street in the old casino district was my second favourite spot after the Grand Canyon, try and go early in your trip, we wanted to return again but ran out of time. The Light Show is really cool, the have a Zip Line you can ride and we went to the Golden Nugget casino and I won $100 when I signed up for a players card, but most only win $5. Get the bus pass for 24 hours to travel back and forth, it too far to walk, we tried! There is a great custom burger place in the restaurant section of the New York, New York, try the onion rings they were great. The buffet at the Excalibur and the Luxor were really good and affordable but I think the MGM had the best buffet I have ever been, my girl friend is a Chef and she was really impressed but it cost more than the other ones. The walk along the MGM, Paris, Planet Hollywood side of the strip is much faster than the NY/NY, Beligio, Treasure Island side of the strip.

We had an LG flatscreen TV in our room. Cafe Nikki offers buffet breakfast at a very reasonable price. The omelette station is a must - freshly made in a few minutes while you wait; absolutely delicious. Once the breakfast has gone down, stroll out to Nikki Beach with its lovely waterfall and palm trees. The poolside bar offers cocktails, beers, anything you like.

A must see for all!! I loved it, and the staff in this hotel and most other hotels made us Brits feel extremely welcome. The Tropicana Hotel where we decidede to stay is clean and airy, you may notice due to all the white decor it is actually not as overwhelming as some of the other hotels, which we liked, because it meant we felt more relaxed when we arrived back at our hotel in the evening. We didn't unfortunately try any of the restaurants in the evening simply because there was so much choice out on the strip when we were out exploring, however me & my partner did try the breakfast buffet at Nikki Cafe for $18 approx each, this was very nice, though you can find breakfast buffets on the strip for quite a bit cheaper, however we found a lot of the more popular buffets had very long queues, and at nikki cafe we were always seated straight away. We went to the Nikki Beach pool party on Sunday 28th August which was great fun, I would strongly recommend anyone go who is over 21 and likes lounging/swimming with table service (there was a minimum spend of $100 between the two of us for our choosen bed) and live DJ. There was a great atmosphere, and everyone including the staff were friendly. The casino isn't as big as some of the others, but as first time holidaymakers in Las Vegas, this just made the tables more approachable to us (We are not big gamblers). We were very pleased with our stay at the Tropicana, and have no regrets booking with this hotel since it was excelent value when we compared its standards (comparable with the other large hotels) against the price you need to pay to stay at some of the other hotels on the strip, however where ever you finally choose to book, it is difficult to get poor service in Las Vegas anywhere (maybe just avoid Imperial Palace which looks like it could do with a renovation).", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMade our Anniversary Very Special\u201d", "Author": "PhxFan", "ReviewID": "UR117609076", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a combination business/vacation trip which happened to fall over our 10th anniversary.

They were as excited as could be and couldn't wait for the fun. Check in was quick, 10 minutes and off to our rooms, they were clean at first glance and very nice. But I found a penny and a few broken potatoe chips, against the foot board on the one bed and wondered how long it's been there and how long it would stay. Guessing the vacuum doesn't get used much, if there's nothing obvious laying on the floor. Beds were great, towels and basic's were just what we needed. Room view was over looking Nikki Beach, loud thumping music all day, but hey I can live with it. Went site seeing the first night son #1 bought a water at casino store when we got back and on our way to the room($2.50) we watch tv and call it a nite. Friday morning, I hit Starbucks @ 6:30am, call family down at 8:30 and hit Sugar Factory for breakfast, come back to get a few things to go to Factory Outlets to go shopping, but #1 son left his 350 dollars and I.D in a white bank enevelope on the dresser, but when we return for his money, it's no where to be found (cleaning service hasn't been here yet OR SO WE THOUGHT) turns out the pre-inspection lady makes rounds first and enters rooms to schedule room cleaning !!!!!! So she was the only one in our room, admittely, ut that means nothing, they tell us !! Never heard of this, but thats how they do it. So we tear this room up-side-down, no money, no I.D., no envelope. Find tons of place's they dont clean though !! Call security, because there's absolutely no doubt where it was, and where it isn't. But you may as well, throw it all on black and take a chance with roulette instead, because they could care less that it's gone. I didnt expect them to call in the FBI, but give me more then 2 minutes and at least act like you care, because security was really in a hurry to get back to the casino to watch all the honey's walk in and out the pool area. So they had me fill out paper work describing it, because they really could care less, and they'll let us know if something turns up. So fault one: stupid son's stop being so trusting hide your money, fault two: use room safe, up to this point, I didnt even know we had one, but I learned, fault three: just make my own bed (and dont worry about vacuuming, their not doing it anyway) and let a message on door do not disturb and leave old towels outside door, and have them put new towels in a bag outside door. I learned to let no one in that acts like they cant speak English. Any how, very few people are in the pool, when we stayed at the Flamingo, everyone was in the pool. But with the temps at about 105 it's too hot not to get in, but the pool water is shockingly cold, and if you watch everyone get in, they are surprised and really dont stay in the water very long. I'm not sure what the water temp is but It must be colded through some refrigent system, the water temp has to be in the 70's and it is almost to cold and no one stays in, Didnt hit club Nikki, had to be 21 to go in there and act like your something. Drinks were probably double the price in there, I paid $7.00 dollars for a Bud Lime, $12.00 dollars for a icy slushy rum drink for my wife and $8.00 dollars each for 4 no alch-drinks. Water was $6.00, but they'll give you 2 glasses of water free, but ONLY 2. So yeah we're talking $47.00 dollars for one round, me I'm thinking it's crazy, and appariently so did other's, because most people I saw had mugs that they took to their rooms to re-fill, thank good-ness I couldnt get my kids into Club Nikki It would have probably been much higher. Almost forgot, when daughter went with me to buy the drinks, the guy from behind the counter asked if she was 21, I said no! so he says she has to get away from the bar, which doesnt look like a bar, it's looks like a mini-pizza, restaturant, soda-beer stand. Well she didnt move quit fast enough for him so he YELLED, GET AWAY FROM THE BAR !!!!!!!!!! Litterally SCREAMED IT, I said relax dude! there's no sign that says this is a bar, and nothing painted on the ground to say stay behind. Very Low Class, I wasnt impressed with the a-hole and lack of respect for people, but most are tourist, and he could really care less. So as a test I had my kids stand at the craps table's to see how long it would be before security made us leave because they were under 21, and after watching for 25 minutes and security standing 20 feet away,,,,,,,,,no one ever said a word....I thought this was funny. So U have to go to the BAR to get your under 21 adult a soda, they can not go for it ! Anyhow, seen alot of people go in there (Club-Nikki Gate) and alot come out, it's geared to the youngings, not the gambler types that these place's were built on, very few of these kids going in there were in the casino, but then again Tropicana probably made alot on their drinks. Basic small coffee at starbucks 3.50, scoon's were same 3.50. Besides that didnt eat here, they could actually use more restaturants. Be prepared for a country hike to park your vehicle, walk to the front door, thru the casino, across the cat walk (over the pools) to the elevator's, and to your rooms. Ok, it's not bad, but if you do it a few times, you'll learn to hate it. (I'm not opposed to excerise, I run everyday......ran my first 26.2 mile marathon May1,2001) But do the walk a few times, gotta be better enterance to Club Towers, but not according to security. Over-all, nice place. Nicer then it's was previous years, but nothing special. Being from the east coast and only getting here once a year, I would stay somewhere else to just check the place's out. But so far Tropicana is in the middle of the road of place's I'd stay. Also 5 dollars craps during the week, 10 dollars on weekends,,,,,,,,left ahead for a change !!!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable\u201d", "Author": "Ann F", "ReviewID": "UR117395274", "Content": "Overall stay was very nice.

The king sized bed and the pillows in our room was incredibly comfortable and their bathroom was exceptionally clean. Their bathtubs are quite nice as well as they are very large. I also noticed little details such as the shading that had been put onto their windows to help with the amount of sun that comes into the room. It neared 110 degrees when I was there so the shading really did help with keeping the room cool while having the blinds open. Overall, I am completely satisfied with the room we stayed in. Upon checkout, we were cheerfully greeted by the hotel manager, Thomas Martinez. He is friendly, personable, and he made us feel as though we'd known him forever. He greeted me with cheerful birthday wishes and surprised us at the end of our checkout with a complimentary brunch at Cafe Nikki (also inside their casino) as a birthday gift. How thoughtful, and amazing is that? I have never felt so taken care of and I couldn't be more grateful to have met Mr. Martinez.

Pools is Vegas are definitely a personal preference, Trop's pool was nice, but not my favorite Enjoyed Vodoo at Rio and Ceasars a little better.

Our club room (2 Queens) had a nice set-back view of the strip. Our club room (1 King) had a worse view of the airport, but also mountains in the distance. I slept soundly at night because the beds were comfortable and the rooms were surprisingly very quiet. I appreciated the IPOD alarm clock. It would have been nice to have a mini fridge and coffee maker, but there is a Starbucks near the elevators. The walk from the lobby to our Club Tower room was quite long, but I think that's to be expected at any strip resort. Unfortunately the escalators were broke a few times, which made our walks even longer. The rooms are decorated very tropical and pretty, but the bathrooms aren't so great. We had problems with the toilet and the floors were cracked so they appeared to be dirty. Showers were miserable because the shower head was so so so low! After a long day/night of walking down the strip, I was so uncomfortable having to bend down to wash my hair. If you are short, than this isn't a problem, but at 5'10, I could only comfortably wash my stomach while standing up straight. Hopefully they do bathroom/shower updates to this hotel soon! Customer service was great and very understanding, no complaints there. We didn't try any of the restaurants because they looked too expensive, but they were decorated nicely. The pool area is really nice, with good landscaping and plenty of space. Also, Nikki Beach (which has a cover) keeps the rowdy partying crowd separate from the more low-key relaxing main pool. Everything seemed to be very clean. I liked the location of the hotel. Across the streets from MGM, Excaliber and New York. It's near the beginning (south side) of the strip but still close to all the action and walking distance to many places. We were able to walk to the Mirage in nearly no time at all and bought a bus pass ($7/day) to get to the outlets and fremount street at night. To be honest, I'd probably stay somewhere else next time I go to Vegas, either splurge for a 4 or 5 star, or visit one of the more extravagantly-themed hotels on the strip (cesar's palace was so beautiful!). But this is definately a nice place that I'd recommend, especially for a good price.

Usually, I'll roll with the flow. This trip [Oct 14-17, 2010] was disappointing on numerous levels. CONSTRUCTION - I know they were updating the Trop. New pool coming in, etc. It was an inconvenience but I could have worked around it. Not that big of a problem. SPORTS BOOK - Hopefully they have one, now. Again, I worked with it and just went to Ballys. THE PARTY NEXT DOOR - We had 2 rooms. 1 room was the g/f and daughter. I'm in the other room. Same tower but different floors. Turns out they rented the room next door to someone who was having a birthday. I'm assuming, since the party was in the room, the birthday was not #21 or they would have been having it in the bar area. Have you ever pulled up next to a car that has the bass turned up so loud that it vibrates your own car? Well, that's what was on the other side of the wall from my bed. I figure \"hey! its Vegas ... they can have a little fun\". So, I put up with the yelling, screaming and loud music til midnight. Called the front desk and asked them to have things settle down. Which it did ... for 20 minutes til the alcohol took over again. At 2:00 AM, I demanded a different room which they provided on the opposite side of the hotel. So, about 3:00 AM, after dragging my stuff through the lobby to the other tower, I get settled into a handicap room. After a few hours of sleep, I ask to be put back into my old room [since it is closer to my g/f's room]. They tell me they can't do that because it hasn't been cleaned yet. I explain that I'm well aware of that fact since I'm the one who has been staying in it. That logic was lost on them. Now, I've stayed at the Rio a couple of times, the Imperial, even the Westward Ho way back in the day and this was by far the worst place I've stayed. And its all because they didn't take care of a problem in their hotel when asked to do so.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Christinet09", "ReviewID": "UR117074870", "Content": "The room was nicely decorated, light and airy and it was good value for the rate that we paid.

Despite having to wait about 20 minutes in a queue for check-in, we were impressed that we were able to access our room immediately (we arrived at the hotel earlier than expected at 11.30am). This enabled us to get straight out to the pool which is a nice area, with a good mixture of sunny and shady spots for relaxing and catching a few rays. There are plenty of sun loungers which are allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis. If you're willing to run up a big bar/food bill you can reserve one of the comfy 'double beds', some right by the pool (they expect you to spend $100 which isn't too difficult if there's two of you and if you're intending to stay all day it is worth doing - we really enjoyed it). The pool area gets very busy, particularly over the weekend. The rooms at the Tropicana have been nicely refurbished with some pleasant touches like an alarm clock with an ipod dock. The air conditioning is really quiet so you can keep it on all the time without it disturbing you. There's no fridge or coffee making facilities, so if you want a coffee in the morning you have to trek down to Starbucks. No big deal but it wouldn't hurt to have a coffee maker in the room. The beds are really comfortable and the room itself is spacious with a well designed bathroom area. We asked for a quiet room, away from elevators and ice making machines, and we were very happy with the allocation. The only downside is that the walls are thin which means you hear a lot of what is going on next door!!!! That said, we liked the Tropicana. It is unpretentious and good value for money. It is close to the MGM which was convenient as we booked tickets to see Josh Groban at the Arena.

It was my wife's birthday and we decided on the the Trop to see the new face lift. The rate was about average for this type of proerty on the Strip. We could have stayed at several others on the Strip for the same rate. We saw the reviews about the service and how stealler it was. We did not experience this. We experienced typical LV service. They have signage demanding checking your baggage. We did this nly to turn right around and have to tip the guy and get our one piece of luggage back after checking in. Checking in: There as no wait which was perfect. The gal that checked us in was not pleasant. She wasn't very accomodating. We informed her that we would NOT be using the pool, the WifI, the phone or fax and certainly not utilizing \"2 for 1\" over priced drink coupons. We were there to gamble and that's it so we did not see any merit in paying the \"resort fee\". She advised that EVERYONE pays it regardless. This simply is not true. There are many on Tripadvisor and other travel blogs that state they were forgiven on the resort fee. I also asked her about an upgrade since this was my wife's birthday. She said the ONLY rooms that face the Strip had two double beds not a King. We thought that made no sense and again was probably not true. Then she did not put us in the Paradise Tower. Not a real big deal but it would have been nice to not have to walk so far to our room. The hotel/casino did not seem to be all that busy so I doubt they were \"booked\". Their casino is not very big and we did not do very well there. The promotion they run is basically advertising that you will lose. It is not a very attracative promotion. A promotion is supposed offer a few bucks in free play to get you interested and gambling. The facelift to the property was pretty nice, much better than it was previously. The room was okay, clean enough but we had to ask for a box of tissue and towels, which we received with no issue. The bathrooms were only halfway upgraded. The shower was ample but old and hard to turn on. not to mention it seemed to have a shower head height designed for people shorter than 5 feet tall. I am under 6 feet and had to duck under it to take a shower, rather strange. The bathroom amenties (shampoo and soap) was generic and didn't smell very good. It stayed pretty quiet during our stay so we give that a thumbs up. They have a Starbucks kiosk at the elevator of the tower we stayed in so that was convenient. Cafe Pelligrino we thought was very good, their prices are about average for Vegas as well. We thought the pizza by the slice was awesome as were their breakfast items. The service at the counter was very pleasant. The food we had was fresh. We did not try any of the other restaurants on the property. We did like the location however, South Strip is not bad at all. Plenty of other casinos adjacent. We did well at Bally's and the Wynn when it came to winning money. Overall we think the Trop LV is about average. We would probably ot stay here again for the rate we paid and due to the lack of customer service by the check in desk. We hope their scalping of $22.00 in resort fees is worth losing repeat customers. Had they not forced us to payf or something we did not care to use, we might consider staying again and giving recommendations. Attitude is a big deal to us and we tought the gal at the front desk did not show much in terms of customer service or hospitality.

The pool was fine, nothing great or bad. We went to Club Nikki and had a really relaxing, fun time. The pool is really small, but the music played is great and its a nice time for the under 30 crowd. Just be warned, there is little seating if you're not on one of the day beds, and those cost $100 food/drink credit, with 18% gratuity and $9 service charge. But with chips and salsa costing $30, tiny Fiji waters for $6 and pitchers of drinks for $68, you will spend more than $100, trust me. The casino was great. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about it being too small, but it was so refreshing compared to the dingy casinos in every other resort.

Oddly, the second day of our stay, a refrigerator magically appeared under the desk but it was in an odd position and made it hard to use the desk chair. The other REALLY bad thing was that the toilet wouldn't flush. Since we didn't spend much time in the room and when we were in the room, it was quite late, we just dumped a bucket of water into the toilet to get it to flush and that worked. When we checked out, we told the man at the front desk about the toilet and he did refund our resort fee. As far as the location, it is at the end of the strip so there is a LOT of walking or taxis. Another thing was that there are very limited options for dining late at night. For a city that stays up all night, you'd better not get hungry. We ate at the small cafeteria and it was horrible.

We reserved a suite. On arrival, the front desk lady tells us that our room is not ready. So I asked when it will be ready. She then tells us that they do not know. After our long car ride from California, we would like to wash up and get ready. So I ask her is there at least an approximate time. She then gets defensive and tells me that how should she know. And that they will call when they are ready. At this point I am fairly shocked. I ask her fine, can she please give us passes to Nikki beach so we can wait it out there. She disappears and comes back with ONE pass. I ask her what am I supposed to do with one pass. (We rented a Suite) She said I only put one guest on my online registration. I told her no that is a mistake I put 4 guests. She gives me a look and say well if you want 4 tickets, we will charge you $25 for each additional guest..... This is the type of service you would find at a motel 6. This is not something you would expect at a Las Vegas Casino. So I gave our luggage to the bell boy and use the public restroom to change into shorts to go to the pool. When I get to nikki beach, I find out it's free to all hotel guests anyways..... The pool is pretty nice. The pool staff are friendly. We finally were able to check in past 5pm The walk to the club towers is a hike in of itself. Up a floor using escalators and then a long walk to the elevators. The suite was decent. We went elsewhere for the rest of our stay there. Checked out NIkki CLub at night. The venue was nice. The crowd was a little ghetto. On our checkout, I asked for late checkout. I was denied. That should have been expected from this hotel. I will never stay here again.

Anyway, bathrooms were clean, beds were nice with no bedbugs, etc... The tv was like 33\" or so. Wifi was free - nice! We had issues with the eating places down in the food court. They gave us bad information regarding hours of operation; like it was all new to them. The food at the restaurants was nothing special, especially for the wait time, even though we had reservations.

Nicole and the staff at The Tropicana exemplify customer service excellence! Thank you so much for making this milestone birthday a very happy one! After a stay in December 2010, I was very comfortable in selecting The Tropicana as the hotel for our guests because of our wonderful first experience. My husband and I stayed in a Paradise Suite in the Paradise Tower, just steps from the strip and all the action of the Casino. The room was spacious for entertaining (complete with mini fridge and coffee maker) and the bed was extremely comfortable. Thomas at check-in set the tone for a fantastic trip with his friendliness, humor and helpfulness. He advised we'd been upgraded to a Paradise Suite and wished me a Happy Birthday. The staff at the Tropicana go above and beyond to make the guests of the hotel feel special and appreciated. Every single encounter we, or our friends, had with staff was a pleasant experience. Everyone commented on how impressed they were with the Trop\u2019s team and how friendly and happy all the staff seemed to be. Another staff member we really enjoyed is Thomas the bartender. He makes an excellent mojito and remembers what everyone drinks. We always had a blast playing a little video poker while enjoying a drink and chatting with Thomas. He\u2019s friendly and hard-working. When the bar got busy, Thomas moved with lightning speed and put a smile on everyone\u2019s face! I was happy to see that the word is getting out there; the Casino was lively and busy during our stay and we had a blast at both the table games and slots. Drink service in the Casino was excellent! We were able to enjoy many of the hotels amenities this trip and just loved the pool. Stacie was wonderful and got us set up for a relaxing day in a cabana by the pool, a must-do for future trips! We enjoyed breakfast at Nikki Beach several days and had a wonderful dinner at Biscayne. It's pretty rare that in a group of 10 everyone raves about their meal, but that was definitely the case at Biscayne and once again, the service was excellent! A friend & I both had our hair done at The Tropicana's Salon......once again very friendly service and we loved the results! I feel badly that I've forgotten the name of the lovely lady that did our hair, but I was in a bit of a frenzy getting ready for the party; she worked the afternoon of August 7th. Our group also took in the Las Vegas MOB Experience and had a blast. This is a must-do for anyone with an interest in that part of Vegas' history. Kudos to the Tropicana Team!!!

First of all , special thanks must be given to Nicole Marshall , who made our trip extra special. We were given adjoining rooms in the Paradise Tower, beautiful rooms with view of the Excalibur & Luxor with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in a hotel & the added benifit of mini fridge !! Gifts were left at reception for my Mum & sister & a birthday cake was sent up on mums birthday. The Tropicana is smaller in comparison to the themed hotels but we loved this fact as the size of the other hotels is very daunting & easy to lose each other in whereas the Tropicana has everything close to hand & the pool is wonderful ! Nikki Beach is only open at wkends, not really my scene but looked really beautiful but can be noisey during the day if you sit too close to it but all you need to do is sit at the other side of the pool , problem solved !! Never went to the Nikki beach nightclub but a couple from our party did & they really enjoyed it, free champagne for ladies up till 12am !! Cant comment much on the restaurants as we only ate the buffet b/fast there once which although nice , was very small in comparison to the buffet at the Excalibur where you can get all day pass for $27 which allows you to eat there or the Luxor. Strabucks is open 24/7 which is great & the food at the deli was lovely if you wanted quick bite to eat. If your a steak lover you must try Gallaghers at New York New York !! The pool area is lovely , never any problem getting a bed , water is cold when you first go in but I think thats more to do with you going in from 110 degree heat !! There is a pool bar where you can also order food & you can also be served at your beds if you cant be bothered walking to the bar. Casino is lovely & bright , never had any problems getting drinks while gambling. The Amber lounge has a Happy Hour btw 4-6pm , excellent for half price cocktails :-) All staff are excellent and go out of there way to help you , best service I have had anywhere in the world.

We tried the Nikki-branded restaurant, club, and pool. The restaurant, Cafe Nikki, was quiet when we were there, but we had excellent service.

We stayed in the hotel for four nights over the Easter weekend and it was my first time in Las Vegas. The hotel has apparently been refurbished very recently but our rooms seemed a little tired already. The bathrooms had definitely not been refurbished and could do with a bit of a makeover. The rooms were however clean and spacious and had a comfortable big bed. The pool area is really nice and was a mixture of families, older people and young people. The sun loungers and towels were free of charge with the room booking and there were plenty to go around. The pool area was clean with nice gardens around it. The pool bar had good service. The hotel has a couple of options for food which varied in price and quality but there was something to suit everybody. There are two Starbucks in the hotel and a couple of small souvenir and newsagent type shops. Check in was quick enough and we used express check out, so that only took a couple of minutes. The casino is bright, airy and scented with coconut, which was a nice change from the darker, smokier casinos. We played a lot of slots over that weekend and the machines at the Tropicana seemed the unluckiest for our group and also had the least attentive waitresses. I only managed to get one drink in the Tropicana over the whole weekend! Beware of the hotel telling you that you have free boarding pass printing. I had to go through a major rigmarole with the front desk to get passes printed despite requesting this a day before and emailing the pass to the desk. As I said at the beginning of this review, there isn\u2019t really anything wrong with the hotel, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away by splendour. It is also worth taking some of the reviews oohing and ahhhing about how great this hotel is with a pinch of salt, unless I stayed in a different Tropicana!

Everything has been done in white throughout the casino. There are even loads of new slot machines. They even have somone opening the front door when you enter the establishment. My wife and i hung around almost the enitre evening to check out the new Nikki Beach and the permanent new show of GLadys Knight. Her vocals today and every bit as good as when she began if not better,. You will hear all the hits and then some. She shook hands with everyone in the front row. A real class act since we were honored to be sitting in the front row. I picked up a t-shirt from theTropicanan logo ship and they are true to size and are one of the better quality shirts. I am experineced in this area having collected over 100 t-shirts and over 100 sweatshirts from my stays in Las Vegas. When we got home we called the Tropicana for a couple more t-shirts for myself and one for my brother. We completed the transaction via phone and the merchandise arrived at our steps in a matter of days. We are not getting anything from the hotel to completed this review.

We go to Vegas a couple of times a year and wanted to try a different hotel. First impressions were very good, it's a clean, modern hotel...not so big that you spend hours wandering around lost. The rooms are simple, but clean and modern. Having the ipod dock in your room is a nice bonus, but half the TV stations don't comi e in, not that you're in Vegas to watch tv. Upon checking in we got pulled into the VIP line and the lady who checked us in wasn't overly friendly. She confirmed that we asked for a non-smoking, king sized bed. We went up to our room and I could smell cigarette smoke...thought it might just be leftover because it's an old hotel. By morning I couldn't stand the smell anymore, so went downstairs to ask to switch rooms and was informed that we had been put in a smoking room. not good. I asked for an upgrade or something to compensate for the fact that I was stuffed up from the smoke and we had to change rooms after unpacking, was told that the hotel was full and we could switch to a non smoking room at 3:00. Not a great start to the trip. Other than that, the staff were great, very happy to serve. The pool was smaller than I expected, but nice enough. Considering the hotel was full, there were still plenty of chairs if you got down there before noon. Didn't try the Nikki beach restaurant, or go to the club Nikki. The bar in the hotel has amazing cocktails, so for sure check out happy hour. The location is much better than Luxor or Mandalay Bay, it's only a two minute walk into the MGM, which is good. and there's a bus stop right outside the hotel, so if you get sick of walking around, it's nice to just hop on. The bus stop will also take you to the outlet mall. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll stay here again. The price is good, but then they add on the $9.99 plus tax resort fee every day, so it adds up quickly. Could have stayed somewhere more in the middle of the strip with no resort fee for that price. you don't really get enough for that money to justify it.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ChasWV", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "wvvolleymom", "ReviewID": "UR116379614", "Content": "Resort is very nice.

This hotel has just completed at major face lift. It was very bright, clean, and welcoming. We loved the grounds and property. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful, as well as everyone else we came in contact with during our stay. This was our 4th time in Vegas and we enjoyed the smaller hotel feel as we found it faster and simpler to get around in. The Tropicana Hotel is in a great location, right on the strip, where the action is. This is our favorite end of the strip, we love it here. While we loved staying at the Tropicana, we also like to pop over to the Luxor, Excalibur, and New York, New York Hotels as well. Staying at the Tropicana makes it easy to do this as it is right across the street, and next to the MGM as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to stay at. As an added tip to your Vegas stay, we really love the meals at the Pyramid Cafe at the Luxor Hotel across the street. We find the prices to be very reasonable here as well as great home cooking. This was our 4th year visiting the Pyramid Cafe as well. Don't forget about the shows in Vegas. If you want to conserve your money go to the 1/2 price ticket boothes at 10am for tickets that did not sell out for shows that coming evening. You will find a booth at the front of the M&M's store and one down at the Fashion Show Mall. Also make sure to visit Fremont Street, you'll be glad you did. The canopy light show on the world's biggest TV screen, plus the live entertainment, and everything else that goes on down there, is totally awesome. Not to mention also Fremont East with its old neon signs and Vegas's famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop from the TV show Pawn Stars being just around the corner. This area is a must to go to. This year, while in Vegas, we did the Scoot City Tour to Red Rock Canyon. We had a great day. Our tour guides were fantastic, the day was fun, and the scoot city scooter cars were awesome. I heard it said that you will look like a bunch of Skittles getting down the road, and that we did.. way cool! We really enjoy Vegas, it is a must to do at least once in a life-time.

They have done a fantastic job of renovating the place - the lobby is lovely and bright, friendly check in staff (no line at all), the hallways are really nicely decorated in a South American theme and the rooms are excellent - 10/10 (and I never give a 10!) Everything is and felt new - brand new carpets, furniture, bed, bathrooms - everything. Large screen TV, lots of hangers in the closet, a good hairdryer. There was no fridge- but I knew that going in and no coffee machine, but its no big deal. The buffet was great and is the only Vegas buffet that I know of that has an outside deck so you can watch over the pool and the waterfall whilst you eat. The staff could not do enough for us - some of the best I have ever dealt with they made us feel like we were staying in a 5 star resort. 2 things I did not like: 1. Pool. Now - the pictures are of the pool that you see all over the internet and one-third of it does look just like that - but those seats under the palm trees are never available. Turn around and the other 2/3rds of the pool is pretty much all concrete and row upon row upon row of tightly packed lounge chairs. I understand, its a large hotel, you need to have a lot of seats but this was like a school auditorium full of chairs - and don't forget - you can smoke anywhere in Vegas and we couldn't find vacant chairs not next to smokers. Also, the pool bar is just a pool kiosk (like at a post office) we were hopeing (since we didn't like our chairs) to seat at the bar for a bit until something else opened up - that was not possible. The swim up blackjack was closed all weekend (and this was 4th July) The adult pool is very expensive to get in, and when I peeked in, I saw the smallest square pool I have ever seen and a large bar, and chairs that are available to rent at very high prices. 2. The gambling. You cannot surrender, split more than once nor double down after splitting. Deals all hit on soft 17's. Basically, every player advantage that all the other casino offer (well, the 5 I went to on my trip) allow you to do that, so there were not many winners nor many smiley gamblers which was a bummer. Overall - I would go back for sure - I would gamble at a neighboring hotel and get to the pool really early to get a palm tree lounger!

We all know why...the much talked about renovations. There were a few disappointments but over all we had a great time. We stayed in the Paradise Tower in a Paradise Suite with a connecting 2 queen deluxe room. The location of the Paradise Tower was perfect. Easy access from the room to the casino, to the bridges leading to Excalibur and MGM. You'll enjoy this easy access while looking for affordable places to eat : ). After reading about the great service at Tropicana, I was disappointed with our check in. Without going into all the detail, I'll simply say we should have been called when the previous guests decided not to leave the room that was holding for us, and we weren't. Couple of comments about the room. Carpet in the suite was dirty to the point of being sticky in some places. Since we'd had the earlier hassle with check in, and we were finally in our room, we decide to ignore the carpet and get on with the fun part : ). I have no doubt that had we made a call, our carpet would have been cleaned, or we could have been moved. I was also surprised by the condition of the floor tile in the bathroom of both rooms. I'd read on TR about the tile being old and not having been renovated, but I never imagined it being as bad as it was. For some reason, the condition of hotel bathrooms are important to me, I understand that this isn't the case for everyone. I should add that the bathrooms were clean, it was just a visual thing. You can't beat the grounds around the Tropicana pool. I don't know of another location in Vegas where you can put your lounge chair under a tree on the grass near the pool. We're in our late 40's.....feel like we're still in our 30's, and enjoyed the vibe very much. We rented a cabana on two occasions. If you're going to spend the day at the pool, drinking and maybe eating, cabanas are the way to go. We like the casino and found a room with fun slots that paid us well. One night while one of us was winning $600 on WOZ (playing 70 cents a spin !), another in our group was winning over $500 at Deal or No Deal. Each night at least one person in our group won a significant amount at the Trop. The size, price and location of our suite in the Paradise Tower, along with the pool and cabanas will probably be enough to get us back to the Tropicana. My advice to others who are considering the Tropicana.....give it a try. Go there with an open mind, and don't 'expect' the special treatment that others mention in their reviews. Enjoy the location, the pool, the newly refurbished room, the bed (so comfy). And don't get hung up on the little things. No matter where you stay in Vegas with a room rate comparable to the Tropicana there will be some issue with the room, the service, the casino....

We are happy to report that we had a wonderful time from the minute we pulled up to the valet parking to the minute we left. Every employee we encountered was similing and took great pains to make us feel welcome (unlike some other properties where they act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money). Check-in took all of five minutes, and luggage was delivered to our suite within minutes of our call to the bell desk. The corner suite with a strip view was huge and bigger than some apartments we've lived in. There were two large flat-screen TVs, a comfortable bed, a fridge and a brand-new bathroom. There were one or two minor flaws with the housekeeping (there were a few things left behind by the former occupants in the drawers) but in fairness to the housekeeper, there was a lot of space to clean and it seemed like she had to do the whole floor by herself. We do not sweat small stuff like that in any event. The casino was small but comfortable and easy to navigate. We found the machine selection to be adequate for a property of this size and the payouts to be on par with other strip casinos. The slot club personnel could not have been nicer and more accomodating and the current new-member promotion is easiily one of the best in LV at this time. After venturing across the street to see a show at the chaos that is New York New York, we couldn't wait to get back to the Trop. When we asked a security genteman for directions to the slot club, he insisted on walking us to it instead of just pointing. That's the kind of service one finds only in small midwestern towns these days and something that leaves an impression. We had some nice pool time and enjoyed a great brunch buffet at Cafe Nikki. While the selection of food may not have been as big as the buffets at the larger casinos, every item was first class, from the lox to the lime tarts. We are only sorry we did not have the chance to eat at either of their upscale restaurants, as they looked very nice and were reasonably priced. Other than that, my only regret was that we had to leave and didn't have time to sample the 2-4-1 margaritas at the tequila bar during happy hour.

I was enticed by the fact that Tropicana had just finished updating all of their rooms and were due to finish the new pool remodel by the end of April. They had the best combination of price and ratings, so I was hoping the pool would be mostly finished for our visit. Unfortunately, the best and largest part of their pool was closed for our entire stay, so that sucked. It is probably done by now and looked like it would be nice when finished. The casino has an odd smell. I think it's supposed to be coconut, but smells more like old pipe smoke mixed with sweet-scented tobacco- not very appealing in my opinion. They did a nice job remodeling the casino and rooms but, that said, you cannot change the fact that the ceilings are still very low in the hallways and rooms which reveals the building's true age and it does not look as nice as some of the newer hotels on the strip. The room was a LONG way from the casino, way in the back. We had a king-size bed that was very comfortable there was an adequate space for a large chair and table next to the bed and a nice flat screen TV.

We had their breakfast buffet which was a very good price and they had a great selection. Food taste was average/adequate, but all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Coffee was very good and they included my latte with my buffet charge. Overall, our stay was fine, but I did not like how far we had to walk in order to go anywhere else on the strip and we were not really interested in spending our time in the Tropicana. So, I will probably not stay here again.

Im not too picky on hotels but this one sounded nice and we untimately picked it as we wanted lots of pool time. They recently renovated and we kept hearing that this was one of the best Vegas pools. Dont get me wrong...it was OK...the tiles were grimey along the inside of the pool and It just gave me a very bad impression right off the bat. My biggest complaint about the pool is that it closes at 7 PM!!! Seriously?!? The hot tubs were open 24 hours. Also they have a seperate pool for Nikki Beach that you have to pay admission to, they are seperated by a fence and the music was blaring over there so you all you could hear was the bass from that pool and you couldnt enjoy the regular music at the public pool! The casino is small...which I prefer but you cant EVER find a waitress for a drink! We only ate at the pizzaria and the food was OK and reasonably priced. One morning we did have to wait 20 minutes for a toasted bagel (guess they forgot). The hotel smells like coconut, which I liked, but 2 of my friends HATE the smell of coconut. I new about this but apparently they did not. They were both thankful that the rooms didnt have much scent. They beds were OK, lots of pillows, the bathroom was large enough. I dont think the AC was working properly...we turned it down as far as it would go (60) but it never really cooled off in there (some nights we got very hot). Every single day we had to call room service for more towels...4 girls need more than 3 towels! and there are definately not enough outlets in the rooms. Most of the staff was nice enough, but the girl at check-in didnt seem too thrilled to be there and didnt go out of her way to welcome us at all. We had a great view of the strip on the 18th floor. The elevators seemed very slow and every tiem you got in the same tropical song would start playing...after 5 days that was pretty annoying. I thought that being closer to the end of the strip would be quieter but Friday and Saturday nights we heard police, ambulance, or firetruck sirens about every 20 minutes! Probably wouldnt hurt to carry ear plugs if you are a light sleeper...and I had read before about the plantation blinds in the rooms...they are terrible! Most Vegas rooms have black-put curtains but these giant blinds did NO good at keeping light out especially since you are right on the strip with all of the lights. Since I knew about the problem I took an eye mask so it helped. I am hoping to go back to LV in Dec for NFR but I will definately not stay at the Trop again...Unless other hotels are booked and the Trop has some insanely great offer I just cant pass up. I was really looking forward to this hotel for a girls summer trip and was very disappointed! If you book here, be sure you are aware of the Resort Fee...what a rip off and $9.99 per day for things we never needec or used. Lots of hotels on the strip no longer have resort fees...so do a little research and find one with out the extra fees and a pool that is open later than 7 PM!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland", "Title": "\u201cMore Unique and Special than other strip hotels\u201d", "Author": "SarahLovesLemonade", "ReviewID": "UR115894319", "Content": "What I liked most about the Tropicana is that although it is one of the original leading hotels on the strip, it has a rather serene, laidback feel about it. I find that most strip hotels have the same atmosphere when you enter them - huge, dull and noisy casinos packed full to the rafters with tourists and those folk who seem to be unable to move from their favourite gaming machine. The Tropicana has a uniqueness about it in that the casino is bright, clean and fairly quiet as far as Las Vegas goes. Both the casino and reception areas are relatively small, the hotel isn't over run with shops, bars and restaurants either and I liked this much calmer atmosphere. We arrived fairly late on in the day but were still able to get an upgrade to a strip view room. This was fantastic, we were on a high floor in the club tower which gave an amazing view of MGM Grand, Excalibur, Luxor and New York New York. Rooms are very spacious, well decorated and comfortable. A safe is provided in the room free of charge. On arrival, the bathroom in one of our rooms didn't look like it had been cleaned so we rang reception who sent a maid up straight away. Very impressed by the responsiveness of reception in sorting this out for us. Pool area is of a good size, towels are provided by the hotel for use round the pool. Cabanas and super comfy sun beds are available for hire each day, there is no rental charge if you spend a certain amount on food/drinks throughout the day. Tunes are played by the pool during pool opening hours and make relaxing by the pool extra fun. Other plus points include free self-parking which once you find your away around the hotel is only a short walk (unlike other strip hotels where you walk miles to get back to your room from self park). A good shortcut is through the pool area.

We stayed here during the third week of June 2011. The staff from check in to check out was fantastic. For example, we were upgraded to a mini-suite in the pool tower because it was our anniversary \"getaway\", although we had originally booked a deluxe room in the pool tower. The mini suite was spacious, and had a separate sitting area with a dining table for two. We truly enjoyed having the extra space and views from the mini suite. The room was clearly above average with amenities. Our two biggest thumbs up are for the bedding, (extremely comfortable and clean), and the television, (large screen plasma and excellent picture), and the soaking tub in the bathroom. The downsides to the room were the air conditioning and a faint unpleasant odor. The room never seemed cool enough to me, but my spouse thought it was fine. The halls and hotels have a great coconut/citrus smell, but our room seemed to have a constant, faint odor. We got used to it after the first day, and after that we only noticed it for the first minute or two after going into the room. The casino was small, but intimate enough to make it nice to come back to after the mega roll palaces and noises of the strip. We really liked the light, airy feeling of the casino, and found the slots to be pretty good compared to the other casinos on the strip, (downtown slots seemed much looser to us), but the Trop casino was OK. The absolute best attraction of the Tropicana is the spread out and cool pool. Actually, not just the pool, but the service you get at the pool. Many, many kudos to the pool manager Staci for such a fantastic job setting us up in a cabana, and also to the staff who seldom let the glasses go dry and were making us feel welcome. In fact, we spent morning to afternoon during our whole stay soaking up the pampering attention and great ambiance, and we don't regret one moment of it.

If you self park and come in via the rooms of entrance 5 do not be put off, they are not in use. I'm sure there will be something going in their place, maybe even new rooms? Everything is pretty much on the main floor, although there are shops and theatres on the mezzanine, which wasn't well signposted. Front desk: we arrived early bit were told we would get a call when the room was ready; we didn't but came back after some time at the pool and our room was ready ahead of normal check in. Whilst waiting though we were given dummy key cards so we could go to the pool so that was fine. The person who checked us in, Shonielle (? I think??) was terrific, she helped us out with everything we needed. You can also print your boarding pass for free at the machine in the lobby. The bell staff were courteous too. Casino: take advantage of the promo with $200 on them. It's complicated but worth it. I will say that when you use your free credit, everytime you win press cash out so you get your winnings. The free credit stays in the machine until you are done, so even if you win one dollar press cash out. Most waitresses were nice, although one in particular was not very efficient or pleasant. Facilities: this let's the place down a bit, there is a shop and a gift shop and stalls but not a lot on offer. There is also (although I have read differently on here) no buffet as such. For eating there are 2 high end restaurants and one very small, not cheap, but good food \"Food Court\". The gelato was excellent. Rooms: nice!! Very comfy bed, nicely renovated, a chaise lounge, a massive tv, decent bathrooms with shower and tub. Also nice tropical decor to the rooms and nice pieces of art. Terrific rooms and all less than 12 months old. Classy tropical would sum it up. Stayed in paradise tower (first one; recommend it as it is closer to everything) with a 20th floor view of Excalibur, Mandalay bay, Luxor. Pool: nice landscaping, the backdrop of the old motel part adds to the feel of old school elegance. The loungers and towels are really comfortable. There are just about enough for everyone. Borderline. Pool was what sets this place apart; this is where the fun was at. So for the summer, this is THE place. Maybe not as much to do in winter though?? But the rooms are great, location great and prices competitive. If we go again and it is pool weather we will stay here.

We ate most of our meals there and were not disappointed at any time. The breakfast buffet is to die for. There was some construction going on, but that didn't interfere in any way.

After surfing the reviews of the various hotels on the strip, we chose the Tropicana!! Great choice!!! Arrival check-in was easy, and desk clerk very helpful with our questions. The room was super clean, modern, and more than adequate size for my husband and myself. The bathroom was large, roomy and well lighted. Beds were more than comfy!!! Had a corner tub/shower combination for spacious and open for ease of comfort after being out in the warm sun or walking the Las Vegas strip. We would have really enjoyed a small refrigerator in the room, for breakfast snacks, and drinks...but, as with any resort we know the \"business side\" of not having them in room...It would had been a real \"convenience\" for quick breakfast before starting the day as well as for families with children to save money here to spend elsewhere... Thomas, a bartender at the Amhbar Lounge where we went for \"Happy hour\" was such a delightful individual... very social, friendly, and happy to everyone he greeted and served.... The Casino was light and bright.... smoke free, and spacious.... Not huge as \"get lost\" feeling as the other large resorts on the strip...just very very comfortable for all the activities between the tables and the slot area. We used the monorail across the street at the MGM to go to Harrah's for the Legion show... (9+) and walked the strip back to our hotel to take in the sights. We also saw the Mob Experience at the Tropicana and enjoyed the show staff personal involvement presentation and history detail during the tour. We also took a tour to the West Rim with the Skywalk experience through Las Vegas Sightseeing Tours/Greyline. Great day with stop also at Hoover Dam...Skywalk is truly an engineer's dream come true and so enjoyed the experience of the Grand Canyon below...Lunch was provided, their staff friendly and outgoing with \"all\" the number of people coming through. Food was very tasty we thought.... The resort buildings on the strip are amazing! So many new ones that have been built, with all the different designs, architectural detail, and the unending interior detail by each resort....one can spend days going through all them and just \"looking\"... Pretty incredible places.... My husband and I are little more conservative on pricing when eating out...Hotel restaurants were a little more expensive than what he & I wanted to pay, and walked the strip for other food dining choices which we felt more in line with our retirement budget... The restaurants were very classy and well designed and had many customers it appeared. So all in all, I would recommend the Tropicana and glad we chose the resort for our stay. Great fun time !!!

What a pit. I swore I'd never walk through the doors of that dump every again. As they worked on rejuvenating the property, I was impressed with the efforts they made. I stopped into the casino mid-2010 and was surprised to see that the casino was brightened and slightly cleaner. When early 2011 rolled around I decided I would be one of the guinea pigs to stay in the \"New Trop.\" Eating my words, I checked in to a Paradise Suite that was alllllll the way back in the Club Tower. Was I impressed? Eh. It was better than before. But great? Nah. Sorry. I know there are a lot of Tropicana cheerleaders out there, but I\"m not one of them. I think it was fine. Okay. A good substitute for a Hampton Inn perhaps. The room was spacious, clean (mostly), and definitely 800 steps up from it was in 2008, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are too many wonderful hotel choices on the LV Strip and I'm not going to choose the Tropicana again unless I'm desperate for a room, there's a gun to my head, or I lose a bet. I want them to succeed though. They've done a lot of work and it's greatly improved. It's a solid middle of the road option. The Mob Experience was amazing and worth checking out.

My daughter stayed in another room with spouse and they had to change several times due to odor in one and in the other they put them by the pool. The music was so loud they couldent sleep. They then had to move them again. I was very disapointed in the motel. I think it is another one that wasted their money on renovations. If they arent going to change some of the old habits in maintainence and cleaning then it will be another one to be imploded. People were unhappy and will stop comming back. And the parking situation was horrible.They don't have enough garage parking and lots of the other areas were for emlpoyees with un easy access. We found ourselves driving in circles most of the time in search of a spot. There was an officer on a bicycle that drove the lot at night which made it more secure than some others we have been to in the past.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Troy, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIt was okay... good thing you dont spend lots of time in your hotel room while in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "TrishaAmber21", "ReviewID": "UR115510991", "Content": "The mirrors on the ceiling above the bed rocked!

I have been a bunch of time since then but this was the first since the recent makeover. The first thing I noticed was the white on the outside, making the appearance almost non-descript which I was about to find out was a metaphor. I used to love the old style Vegas feel of the place and the rough around the edges decor gave it a sense of history. The blue sign over the entrance has been changed to red with a new font and that stale smell of cigarettes, gambling and spilled drinks has been replaced by a coconut infused scent when opening those glass doors. Mores the pity. Don't get me wrong, the new look is great and if you hadn't been there on a regular basis beforehand you would find it difficult to complain. The casino floor is clean and bright, the rooms spacious and nicely appointed (with the possible exception of the bathrooms - functional and clean but shower/bath is still a bit old school). It just lacks a little soul. I didn't check out the new Nikki Beach set up - I am a bit old for that scene - but the new Cafe Nikki was nice and the breakfast buffet, sitting outside by the pool was great. The new Starbucks and snack bar was a Godsend, especially at 3am after a heavy night drinking and gambling. Free in-room Wifi and the helpfulness and attitude of most of the staff was also great making the whole package difficult to beat from a cost/benefit point of view, not to mention the superb location. Its just that it didn't feel like the Trop I knew. I think they have gone too far chasing a new crowd.

The buffet was excellent and if you eat later in the morning they add lunch items such as JUMBO shrimps, smoked salmon and beautiful salads. Breakfast and lunch for $17.99 - crazy. It also included juice, coffe, tea. I personally could have eaten all my meals at the Tropicana. We didn't get to try BIscayne but the menu looked delicious. The pool area was absolutely heaven.

From the beginning of our trip, we knew it was going to be a great experience. Our limo driver was cordial, very helpful, and answered all our questions. Our limo ride was pleasant. As soon as we arrived to the entrance of The Tropicana, we were greeted in a friendly manner. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30 p.m. The front desk ladies were very friendly and checked us in immediately. Our luggage was taken care of and would be sent up. We ended up on the 21st floor of the Paradise Tower. As soon as we walked in to our Penthouse Loft, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful. We didn't get the loft with the jacuzzi downstairs (probably because it was just my husband & me) but nonetheless, the room was amazing!!! The penthouse loft had a dining area, living room area and a bar area downstairs with a gorgeous view of the Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and New York New York. There was also a guest bathroom downstairs. There was a refrigerator and a coffee maker with delicious coffee. As we walked up the spiral stairs, we continued to see how the Tropicana has outdone themselves. We got to the second floor and immediately loved our soft King size bed. There was another TV upstairs. The master bathroom was huge and very clean! There was a jacuzzi overlooking the strip which looked beautiful at night. Our shower was huge and the bathroom included a toilet and a baday. The hotel provided amazing toiletries that we definitely used. Since we had the $100 food credit, my husband and I decided to eat at Pellegrino's. We ate pizza, chicken strips, burgers, soups and other treats. The food was good for the price. The cook and the cashier were very good with us and even remembered us going there for lunch every day the five days we were there. We would highly recommend trying their pizza. It was great! Also, the casino area is small but intimate. It has the popular slot machines and you can't beat the Tropicana play incentives. We liked the Tropicana because it was bright. My husband is legally blind, having only 4% of his vision and the brightness of the casino allowed him to still be mobile around the buildings and casino areas without assistance. So, THANK YOU Tropicana!!!!! Our check out was smooth. Our overall experience was AMAZING!!! We hope to stay at The Tropicana in December again.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201camazing!\u201d", "Author": "lauradenes", "ReviewID": "UR115299879", "Content": "everyone was awesome! everyone that was working , took their time to make sure that we were taken care of and that we were happy....

We had no idea that because Britney Spears would be in town that particular weekend, all the room rates (at just about every hotel) would be higher than usual, so I cant say that we got a killer deal on our stay. HOWEVER, when I contacted the hotel to ask if there was any possibility of a room upgrade because of our special celebration, I received a gracious email from Kennon Wolff, one of the managers, who did indeed upgrade us to the extent he was able (the hotel was almost to capacity) and also offered us complimentary show tickets to Recycled Percussion (A MUST SEE if you get the chance, it was alot of fun!) Our room was on the 19th floor and was beautiful, clean and had a great view. The bed was comfortable and we even received a phone call from the front desk after checking in to make sure our room was to our liking! We found ALL the hotel employees pleasant and helpful, all of them giving the impression that they truly enjoyed their job. One of our days was spent simply laying by the pool, and we enjoyed the music and variety of people there (meaning, yes there were \"the beautiful people\" but also middle aged folks like ourselves as well as families with children ----no reason for anyone to feel \"out of place\" like sometimes happens at other places) I dont know what the \"old Tropicana\" was like, but the remodled version is beautiful, airy, and completely amazing. We are not gamblers, so we didnt spend any time in the casinos except to walk through them to get where we were going, but I have to say that the Tropicanas casinos were the least smokey and brightest of all the ones we walked through......it was a pleasure not to be hit by a wall of smoke everytime we went somewhere on the property. They even pipe in a breeze of coconut-ty scent throughout the corridors, which I personally found fantastic---not heavy or cheap smelling, just gave things a tropical feel. We absolutely loved our stay and we are already trying to figure out when we can get back there again!

We upgraded to a Club Tower Spa Suite - worth every penny! The suite had a separate living/dining area with a wet bar and 2 piece bath. The bedroom was huge and included a Jacuzzi. The main bathroom had a his n' her's vanity, steam room/shower and a sauna. It was great to come \"home\" to this after a long night of walking the strip to relax. The staff were attentive. I had brought some beer up to my room but did not have a opener for it. One call to the front desk and one was delivered within 5 minutes.

We spent every afternoon at the pool and it was great. Very relaxed setting. The music was great and not too loud. The water was nice and cool and there were plenty of chairs to go around. We ate at Biscayne one evening. The food was superb, as was the service. Our waiter, David, was very attentive and went as far as to ask us what show we were going to that night. When we mentioned we were going to see Carrot Top he shared a story of how he and Carrot Top used to shop at the same grocery store. A simple, but effective touch in delivering good, personalized service. We also ate at Bacio for one meal. The food was great again, as was the service.

I wanted to see how the remodel had gone. I booked online directly through Tropicana and after contacting Nicole Marshall, received an upgrade to a Strip View room and the resort fee waived. (resort fee is $11.99, not $19 as stated by another reviewer) The rooms have definitely been done over, and my non-smoking room did not have any hint of smoke in it. I think the only thing I can say about the remodel is that it's still a pretty basic hotel, but with new paint, wallpaper and furnishings. Not bad at all, but now blow-you-away great, either. I will include photos. The bathroom has a vent fan that runs as long as the light is on, which is a little annoying and the only towel rack for the shower is 6 feet away from the shower. I may just be spoiled by some of the other newer Vegas properties, but I still only stay at the mid-priced places, so I'm not comparing it to Wynn. The bed was very comfortable, and the chaise by the window was usable in that it didn't collapse like the one at Flamingo when you sit to change your shoes. The elevators at the Trop are really slow for some reason. There was actually a line I had to wait in when I was going up to my room with my bags. It seems that too many people stop the elevator at the Mezzanine Level and it holds up the people going to the rooms. It seemed like the elevator opened at that level every time I rode it, even if it was just some confused person standing there with a beer in their hand. Anyone who books through Tropicana is entitled to the VIP Breeze Check In which is a separate line that moves quickly and hopefully gets you early check in and late check out. Only problem is, that with them giving people 2pm check out, that means early check in probably won't happen. I did not get early check in. My room was ready at 3pm. (But I did get late check out.) Inside the hotel, all the employees were friendly. But the guys working valet were not so friendly. My friend valeted her car when we thought I'd be checked in, but when we went right back out to get it and waited in the wrong place (not clearly marked), she was chastised by the valet for not being there when he brought the car around. Well who would think the car would be brought up facing the lane where the cars enter the parking lot? That was just strange. Everyone else just uses another lane in the drop off area. Also, when I was dropped off by a cabbie who didn't realize that the completely empty North entrance was open, the valet there swore after him and the next one also yelled at him. Well, that's fine, but keep it civil in front of the customers. It looked to me like they didn't know which entrance they wanted anyone to use just yet. When I oringally booked, I was supposed to get some sort of deal where 2 pool chairs were reserved for me, but I don't know if that got lost in the shuffle when Nicole upgraded my room. I never had time to use the pool with my taking cabs all over, so it didn't matter. My \"Strip view\" was of Mandalay Bay/Luxor/Excal. It would have been nice without the banner over the windows. I guess most of the Trop is \"wrapped\" in a white banner at the moment. I'm not a fan of them. I like to have a clear view out the window. (that's just me) When I went to do the express check out on the TV, the resort fee was showing, so I went down to check out at the desk. I had my reservation printed and the friendly clerk took the charges right back off the bill for me. Finally, I'd say that the new Trop isn't bad at all - I personally like a more central location on the Strip, so I'd recommend Tropicana more to someone on a budget, someone with a rental car that is doing off-Strip excursions, or just likes that end of the Strip more. I would not recommend it for someone who likes the mid-Strip properties, or a bit more luxurious room. At least not the regular room - maybe a suite? All in all, it wasn't bad, but I just didn't get the vibe from it that I expected.

Our stay began with amazing, efficient check-in service from Ladonna, who waived the fee for a fridge and also moved us into the Paradise Tower from the Club Tower because we were worried about noise from the club. We would definitely recommend the Paradise Tower - we were in room #931 which was a King room at the end of the hallway overlooking the pool. It is much more convenient than the Club Tower and we never heard any noise from the club or the strip. Everyone we encountered at the Tropicana was very friendly and helpful, including the wonderful woman who cleaned our room (I am mad at myself for not noting her name; she cleaned our room from the 1st - 5th of July). The Tropicana is much cleaner and brighter than most of the other hotels/casinos that we walked through. They seem to cater more to their hotel guests than to the walk-in casino visitors. Our room and bathroom were spacious and clean. The wireless was easy to use and high-speed. We were able to easily find lounge chairs at the pool, which was busy but not overwhelmingly loud or crazy (we are in our mid-40's). The only downside that we can think of is the location ~ at the south end of the strip, so a long walk to some of the action/restaurants, etc; however, we knew that going in. Our visit ended with more wonderful customer service at check-out from Gwen, who reduced our room rate by $30 after she found out we had taken the red-eye home and left at 9pm (and this was over the phone after we had arrived home!).

Our room was very clean and the comfy bed was exactly what we needed after the grueling walk down the strip. Our housekeeper Jean was outstanding- so friendly and did such a great job. The only negatives I have were I wish the pool was open later, and a bartender who was at the sports bar made us a little uneasy. He was rolling his eyes and complaing about customers to the cocktail waitresses, right in front of us. He didn't even acknowledge us, another friendly bartender came from the opposite end to wait on us. I've been in the service industry for years and the Brad Garrett look a like bartender was completely distasteful. Hopefully he was just having a bad day.

We really enjoyed our stay. The first thing we noticed was how friendly all of the staff were; from the front desk to the folks we met in the elevator, they all had smiles on their faces. You don't get that treatment everywhere in Vegas. And they were able to accommodate our need for adjoining rooms, even when the hotel was sold out. The hotel is very clean. Everywhere we went someone is cleaning; sweeping the white tile in the gaming area, wiping down the elevator, emptying ashtrays in the gaming area. Our room was great - and it was their standard room. I've never slept better in a hotel, especially in Vegas. The mattresses are the best. Loved the layout of the bathrooms. They aren't huge, but arranged very well for their size. And my favorite thing: we didn't experience any \"hall noise\"!! No talking, slamming doors, etc. that normally wakes us in other hotels. We were in the Paradise tower and our room faced the MGM Grand. We heard the occasional helicopter or siren, but nothing that woke us up. We are a family of 5, with 3 teens, so the pool area is very important to us. The new Trop pool area didn't disappoint. We had an easy time finding lounge chairs and the kids enjoyed the pool. The location on the Strip is great, you can catch the tram across the street at Excalibur to go to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay, and the tram that rus the east side of the Strip is just across the street at the MGM Grand. The only downside was the pool was a little messy in the late afternoons and closed early. As much emphasis as was placed on keeping the hotel clean, it may have been due to the amount of wind that was occurring in the afternoons during our stay (blowing cups etc. in the pool. And it WAS much better on the last day of our stay. I think the management is very focused on the Nikki Beach experience and they need to work on the main pool a little more.

I have been to Las Vegas several times and have been disappointed more than once on an overpriced room in shabby condition. This was not the case with the Tropicana. From the moment we walked in the Resort doors I was impressed. It has just been renovated and it is in excellent condition. Clean, bright and well ventilated. And better than the resort's condition was the impeccalbe customer service. In this day and age not many companies put an emphasis on customer serivce. Not so with the Tropicana. Every employee we came into contact with greeted us and/or provided us with the best best customer service. Check in was easy as was being able to upgrade to a suite that became available. There was once person who impressed me the most and that was \"Yolanda\" at the front desk. She was very personable and focused on making our stay wonderful. I wanted to surprise my husband with a suite (we were celebrating his birthday and our anniversary) and Yolanda was able to make it happen. To top it off she had some chocolate covered strawberries and champange delivered to our room! The suite was huge, clean and the bed was so comfortable. the room also had, a fridge, coffee maker, safe, and internet (included in the resort fee). Now all that being said I do have only two issues of a negative nature. First is that I paid to be upgraded to the Paradise Suite with a strip view. However, our view of the strip was blocked by a massive sign hung on the exterior of the Tropicana. So all we got to see was the Excalibur and New York..And second is almost all the alcoholic drinks we received were pretty \"weak.\" Especially in the Brad Garrett comedy club. We basically paid $50 for two souvenir glasses full of pineapple juice... But that wasn't enough to dampen our impression of the Tropicana.

Just back from my second stay at the Tropicana, and hard-to-believe news is that it's even better than it was last fall. A stylish 'boutique' hotel experience isn't what you expect on the Strip - but the Trop delivers. And at very competitive prices, too. A few things to know up front: -- The Trop is big enough to stay interesting and vibrant 24/7, but at the same time it's manageable. Like Mandalay Bay, it's far enough south to provide a break from the relentlessly bustling, noisy and overcrowded sidewalks of the mid-Strip - so after a visit to the Bellagio fountains or City Center, you truly get the sense of \"coming home\" and escaping the mid-Strip bedlam. -- Guests stand a good chance of getting individual attention here. The Trop's staff are remarkably friendlier than you'll find at most Vegas hotels; best guess is that they're treated better by management, too. It pays off for the guests. In the course of a single day, the cheerful younger doorman at the side entrance, a guy named Vernon at the entertainment desk & a woman working at the tux/bridal shop had all struck up conversations with me. The Cafe Nikki waitress at dinner and the waiter at lunch were both personable and professional. Nicole Marshall could write the book on hotel hospitality. -- The Trop's casino, room decor and pool area tell you right off that this isn't a standard hotel designed by corporate beancounters. Instead, the casino is gleaming white with touches of dark, rich red - way livelier, brighter and fresher than anything you'll find on the Strip or downtown. The tropical theme of light colors (with plenty of cream tones and bamboo accents) is carried throughout the corridors and rooms of the two high-rise towers, the Paradise and Club. Lastly, the pool area landscaping is spectacular; lots of gently sloping lawns and palm trees rather than the acres of bare concrete so common at Vegas hotels. -- Even with the renovations completed, the Trop still offers value-for-your-money rates. Downsides? Not many. Like almost every Vegas pool I've visited in the past couple of years, the Trop's has louder music than I'd choose. It makes sense for the Nikki Beach operation to be all about a party atmosphere, but the general pool area has a different mix of guests - and dialing back the volume couldn't hurt (particularly in the morning). Similarly, it's becoming harder for popular Vegas hotels to keep the pools clean. The 'perpetual spring break' vibe of the Strip is growing, and young partiers seem accustomed to tossing their empty drink cups into the water. (This trend is even worse at MGM's lazy river).", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Casino\u201d", "Author": "FiftiesHavingFun", "ReviewID": "UR114962704", "Content": "This Hotel just went through a major renovation.

You are given a badge with a Mob Name to start (Bubbles here) and as you go along the exhibit your badge triggers things to happen. You get to select your \"guide\" at the beginning, we chose James Caan. Very interesting to see how Vegas got it's start and the Exhibit has a ton of information as well as many items and pictures from each of the Mobsters. What surprised me is how short in stature a lot of these Notorious men were. There is film footage as well as many boards you can read about the men and the mob. We were staying at the Flamingo this visit and there is information about it being the first big Hotel on the Strip. It was a lot of fun! Brad Garrett's Comedy Club- First of all I knew before we got to Vegas that Brad Garrett is not always at the club, again when we purchased the tickets the agent reiterated this. We went the night of June 25th and saw Bobby Miyamoto and Steve McGrew. The night was opened by a wonderfully funny black lady (sorry, can't remember her name). She got the night started on the right track and we knew were were going to have a fun evening. Bobby Miyamoto then came out and he was awesome, very dry funny guy. The headliner Steve McGrew was off the charts the funniest comedian I have ever seen in my life. He literally had the crowd laughing the entire time he was on stage. My throat and stomach hurt when the show was over. I can't for the life of me figure out why either of these guys aren't super famous by now.

The room smelled like a brand new car. and the bed - COMFORTABLE! (no saggy mattress - you know how they try and cover up an old mattress by adding new bedding); other amenities included a flat screen TV, Hi-Speed wireless internet (i usually dont connect to hotel 'free' wireless b/c it just isnt safe, but the Trop has Cox...) the rooms completely black out at night, NO VEGAS STRIP LIGHTS COMING IN...sometimes the curtains don't come together all the way and that one beam of light always finds your window...and, most importantly - the room smells good - NO SMOKE! whatever it is they pump thru the ventilation system in the casino...gently fills you room, w/out over powering your senses. What i really liked is that Valet remembered my name from the night before and each time i came back to the hotel...and the front desk reps have said \"Welcome back!\" every time. i've been back to the 'new' Trop many times after the first time, and have brought my friends and business associates - all hesitant but figured, if I can stay there and brag about it, it must be OK! The Trop has been my place to stay since Dec'10 and every month thereafter...both of my businesses are in LV so I have to travel back and forth, the Trop is home while I am attending to my business.

The Trop is on the south end of the strip, away from a lot of the crowds and activity, which we liked. It can be quite a trek to and from other casinos and shows, but there is a tram available for a small fee. We ended up walking most of the time, which got to be a bit much, but helped burn some of the calories we consumed on our vacation. We did have some trouble with the water working in our room one morning, but it was fixed fairly promptly. Also, one day our room did not get cleaned, and by the time we returned to our room that night, we were so exhuasted, we decided to forgo it. The next morning, I called when we left for the day and the housekeeping staff said they'd put us on the top of the list. When we returned in the early afternoon, the room had been cleaned, although the bathroom floor could have been done better. The only other negative part of our stay was the noise coming from the promotional videos being displayed on the exterior of the hotel.

Being in Vegas we were ready to be scammed but the prices were on the up and up! $100 in food and drink is all you have to pay to get a beautiful cabana for the entire day. Since this was such a good deal we just stayed put for 6 hours drinking pitcher after pitcher of Greyhounds and snacking. They upgraded us to a double since we were a larger group and they were available, at no extra cost. These are $200/a day in food and drink and we may as well selected a double from the start because we surpassed that in food and drink!! Easy to do when 6 people spend 6 hours luxuriating! We do love the bigger hotels as they are grander and fancier but for the money this is the best deal in Vegas as far as I have ever seen!!!

As a result, and because of an outstanding rate I was able to secure, my wife and I booked a seven day stay.

Their marketing seems to have been successful in bringing in a younger, livelier crowd while still retaining mature adults as well. The employees were very customer service oriented with a special tip of the hat to Kimberlee in VIP check in. The pool area was beautiful. The sports book has the latest state of the art tv screens. The room was great with soft, fluffy pillows on a very comfortable bed. Flat screen tv in the room. Ambhar Lounge situated off elevators very lively, good service, pleasant atmosphere although we were not thrilled with the bands they provided for entertainment. Las Vegas has some super local bands such as Front Page, Klique, Chaze, HNLV, which would have supplied a more entertaining sound for a more variety of guests. Cafe Nikki provided a wonderful outdoor dining experience during the evening hours. As with any hotel there were some problems. One evening no hot water for a period of time. Check-out morning no water at all. Computer down during check-out, however, just received credit card statement and all charges were correct. Check-in lines much too long and time consuming. And, of course, the deceptive resort fee.

We ended up at the Venetian indoor canals with the shops and we went into the Signature Galleries shop and I was interested in a piece and the lady actually put us in a room and shut the door! She was so pushy and desperate that I actually had to push past her and walk out!! Her name started with an F? She was a white lady in her 50's, I believe, with glasses, and thin.

I wasn\u2019t able to make a booking via the website, so I emailed the hotel directly and ended up getting a very good deal - decent rate, no resort fees, free late check out for our second stay (all of which were confirmed at our first check-in). Unfortunately, on our return visit we were charged the resort fee, but I didn\u2019t notice until we\u2019d arrived home. I emailed and got it refunded reasonably quickly. We were staying just before the \u2018Nikki Beach\u2019 opened, and enjoyed the fact that the Tropicana seemed to be quieter/calmer than the other hotels we saw - not sure if that would be the case if your room was overlooking the pool...", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Tropicana..My New Favourite Vegas Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "rachaelclement", "ReviewID": "UR114488678", "Content": "This hotel really didn't disappoint, exactly as expected if not more.

It was my boyfriends\u2019 first trip to Vegas so needless to say we were very excited about going. Prior to making the reservation I had read in several reviews that the pool area and Club Nikki was not completed in the time initially expected so I called the hotel and was assured by our visit in the beginning of May that both would be done. So I booked a five-day stay. Upon arriving in Vegas the weather was perfect and I could not wait to get poolside. We got a ride from a friend to the hotel and right away the exterior impressed us. There was only a brief wait at the reception (which was a plus) and even though we were early they were able to get us a room right away. I had been told on the phone that we may be able to upgrade based on availability but when I asked the clerk was VERY unpleasant and told us that it would be an additional three hundred dollars. I asked what the difference in the footage was for the room we had booked and the upgraded room and was told that she had no idea and she made no effort to find out. She also assured me the view was of the mountains in the room we had and so I settled on the room we had initially booked. When we travelled the substantial distance to our room and opened the door I was so sad. The room was small the view was of plastic! Not sure what they were doing but they had plastic covering the windows. Eventually this was taken down and then we got to see the not so lovely parking lot and airport. The hotel was still under construction and although the pool was done Club Nikki was not and the construction was loudly going on right next to pool. The worst part however was the bathroom. The toilet was stained, the shower had been broken and hanging from the wall and my poor boyfriend could not stand and shower because the showerhead was to low down for his 5\u201911\u201d self. He had to hunch over to get his head wet. There was no coffee maker or mini fridge so we had to trek down to the dinning area to get over priced Starbucks every day since coffee is mandatory for me to survive. On the plus side the bed was comfy, the room was magically cleaned whenever we got back no matter what time we left for the day and the casino was nicer then most of the other hotels. We also ate several meals there and found them to be decent. Biscayne is the steak house and the food was good but is going to have a tough time competing with the plethora of outstanding restaurants in the area especially since the service was pretentious and borderline rude. Would I stay at the Trop again? Maybe if I got a REALLY good deal I would give it one more try. Would I recommend it? Not sure. I would give the facts (including the very strong smell of fake coconuts being circulated through the air duct system 24/7) and let the person decide on their own.

You can sit your lawn chair anywhere, this mean around the pool or under a palm tree if that suites you. The restaurants looked nice, but just couldn't make time for them. Lastly, the people at this place are nice, being from the South it is important to me that people are easy to talk to and keep their word. We had some issue, but to there credit were resolved quickly. Now to the negatives: The air conditioning in the room is fair at best. The food and drink also is crazy expensive as compared to other places nearby. Lastly, the casino is almost empty at times and the table minimums are very high.

The front desk person, though pleasant, tells me that our room is not available - I say, I thought check-in was 3:00. She said, oh, it is. But I guess the guest in your room hasn't checked out yet. Okay, so when can we get in our room? She says, \"Hard to say, why don't you check back around 4:30\". 4:30?? No information on what to do with our bags in the meantime, no apology, no explanation except that she told me they were \"sold-out\". I walked away looking dejected enough that some other lady called to me and said, 'you look upset, can I help you?\" I was relieved that someone was going to give me some information. She told me to leave the bags at the bell hop's until our room was ready..then she launched into a sales pitch about Polo Towers, wanting to give me free show tickets to go hang out there for a 2 hour presentation. Nice. No Thanks. The front desk person also said that she'd call us if the room was ready. No call. Decided to check back at 4:00 to see if it was ready - it was. Interesting that she knew I was upset about waiting but still didn't even call when it was ready. The good stuff: We had an awesome room - it was clean, well appointed (except it lacks a coffee maker), great view, quiet and close to the casino and the pool. The only issue was we didn't have a Do Not Disturb hanger in our room and housekeeping gives one swift knock with about a 1 second wait until they just walk on in - had a few close calls! Pool was fun. Lots of seating. Pool is freezing!! But, when it's 100 degrees, a cold pool is nice. Drink service was pretty non-existent, but that's alright -the pool bar is very centrally located. Fitness center (stated as a $9.99 value) is fine. It get's the job done, but I'm not sure it should be touted. 3 treadmills to service the entire hotel? Overall - good stay.

We hadn't stayed at this hotel before it was renovated, but after reading some older reviews and seeing the place now - it definitely has come a long way! Everything seemed brand new, from the pool, to the comfy lounge chairs, to the plush beds and the huge flat screen tv, we were more than pleased. We checked in on a Wednesday afternoon and it was a breeze. No line ups and super friendly staff. Since it was our anniversary and we were staying there for an entire week, management was nice enough to waive the hotel fee and offer us a free mini fridge for our room. That was just an added bonus! The location is super convenient being right next door to MGM where you can catch the monorail to any part of the strip. Also, there are convenient bus stops right outside the hotel if you're adventurous enough to take the bus around town. Cabs are also reasonable if you're visiting another hotel along the strip. Cafe Nikki was excellent - I recommend the Fantasy sushi roll - I couldn't get enough of it! My husband had the Nikki Cuban sandwich which he thought was just okay. The restaurant patio overlooking the gardens is beautiful, and they have a light mist coming from the above to keep you cool on those hot summer days. We were saving the Bacio italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner, but sadly it's closed on Mondays. We'll definitely try it out next time though. They also have a great gelato shop right on the way to the pool, perfect after a long day in the sun. The housekeeping staff were very good and we always returned to a spotless room. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the loud club music at the pool. There are two sections to the pool, one side for Nikki Beach Club, and the other is the regular pool. I'd suggest keeping the club music for Nikki Beach side and offering a more relaxing atmosphere for the general pool. (Don't get me wrong, I'm in my mid-twenties and I actually liked most of the music they played, I just wish I had a choice of a quiet pool area to doze off in the shade).

It was our first trip to Vegas and the Tropicana was a good home base. The staff was so helpful everywhere we went whether it was checking in, the doorman (Jake was a delight!), the bartender, or the wait staff at Cafe Nikki. The first night we received an upgrade to a spa suite which was fabulous! Although for the rest of our stay we were in our orginally booked room in the Paradise Tower. I should note that the spa suite was located on the top floor in the Island Tower and for those who think or read on here that is a long walk from the entrance...it's not. Maybe if you had trouble getting around it might be then I would recommend a room in the Paradise Tower. The walk to the Island Tower is nothing though compared to all the walking you do in Vegas. Not a big deal. Our room was clean and comfortable. The remodel really looks great! The bedding was simply amazing! The pillows and sheets are so comfortable...it was just what we needed after long days (and nights) in Vegas. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was lots of counterspace which was nice as I like to take over the bathroom as my boyfriend puts it. The walls are a bit on the thin side as we could hear music from the pool area (our room was on the 10th floor) but that wasn't really a big deal. I heard no noise from the airport whatsoever. We never did give room service a shot but we did eat one night at Cafe Nikki and the food was delicious! Maybe a bit on the pricey side for what you get but it was good nonetheless. We often went other places to eat during our stay. We did visit the pool once and it was very relaxing! Perhaps that is because we went to the crowded family-oriented pool at Excalibur with friends the day before (not our scene). The water was a bit cold I thought but there were loungers available so no complaints. Bring your wallet though if you want to have some drinks poolside-you will need it. We also didn't gamble too much in the casino so I can't say much about that. It looks a little on the small side but very bright and airy. It also smelled great compared to several other places we went. All in all I would stay at the Tropicana again on future trips to Vegas! Stay here before the rates go up as it really is a great value for what you get. It is a bit south on the strip but with taxis, buses, and monorails available for far travel it isn't a big deal.

Upon check-in, the front desk clerk, Evie, informed us that unfortunately our requested room type was not immediately available. However her demeanor and willingness to suggest alternatives made us feel welcome and defused a possibly uncomfortable situation. Without provocation, she elicited the assistance of the Hotel Manager, Thomas Martinez and the eventual resolution far exceeded our expectations. As a matter of fact it seems as if the management has inspired all their employees to embody an element of service from a past era; understated, attentive and friendly without being gratuitous. Customer service is not the only impressive feature of this destination. Contrasting the usual glitz and overstated glamour of the Las Vegas Strip, the Tropicana has been transformed to embody a clean, relaxed, understated style, the likes of South Beach and the tropics. From the hint of coconut when you walk through the doors to the cascading waterfalls and whitewashed towers, no element has been overlooked. The rooms defy any visitor to feel as if they are staying in a hotel. Natural wood tones, wicker and bamboo are contrasted by crisp white linens and panama shutters and complimented with accents of the hotel\u2019s signature orange-red.

If I were a supersticious man, I would suggest that I felt the presence of Meyer Lansky in those exhibits. It was both strange and scarey. Bravo to everyone involved in this magnificent endeavor. It was more than worth the money. And the promotion was great too! We also were honored to spend a night with Gladys Knight. Her voice is as strong and soulful as ever. She made us feel a part of her family and took us on a sentimental journey that we will never forget! After seeing the shows, we enjoyed dining in the new restaurants located in the Tropicana including Cafe Nikki, The Marketplace and our favorite-Bacio's. Bacio's is simply our favorite Italian restaurant in the world! We ate there multiple times. The food is exquisite, the ambience superb, and the celebrity chef, Carla Pellegrino is charming, delicious and a delight to be around! It's a great dining experience and we look forward to our next trip to the Tropicana, and of course Bacio's! And we wish both the hotel and this wonderful restaurant the greatest success possible!", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "dagmara56", "ReviewID": "UR113542621", "Content": "Most casinos are like a dungeon, not the Trop.

Additionally, when we checked in I did the famous \"$20 sandwich\" trick, and it earned us a great room in the island tower on the 17th floor and a \u201cfree\u201d refrigerator for our stay. The room was extremely clean, new and fresh. The tile in the bathroom should be re-grouted, but the vanity and sink are new, and we were happy with our accommodations. We LOVED the view of the strip and the pools. The TV is a large new flat-panel, and the in-room safe was deep enough to accommodate at laptop. We had dinner at Biscayne on our first night and did the Prix Fixe meal with wine pairings for $39.99. The first course was a vidalia onion with spicy ketchup, and we all agreed, it was sort of a joke. It was half an onion ring, and while it was tasty, it was a bit of stretch to deem it the first course even if it was supposed to be an appetizer. The rest of the courses were fabulous. We all enjoyed the wonderful room service and we heard great things from fellow visitors about Cafe Nikki. The casino is bright and clean and the coconut smell, by our accounts, was subtle. Every single staff member we encountered from the dealers, valet, room service, front desk, phone operators, you name it, were friendly and helpful. As much as we enjoyed visiting the Mandaly Bay, we found the staff to be rude and unhelpful with the exception of the wonderful waitpeople at MIX. Our experience there made us appreciate the Tropicana staff even more. The pool area was great, super clean with plenty of chairs, towels and wait staff. We enjoyed our hours at the pool, especially the people watching. The music was a bit grating, but I don't dig on Rihanna, Pitbull etc. We enjoyed our stay and would more than likely return. We chose the Tropicana because of it's history--it's 54 years old--and because of the recent renovation. However, it is clear that the Trop is aiming to attract a younger crowd. The club Nikki nightclub opened while we were there, and some staff encouraged us to check it out, so we did. In our 40's, we don't feel ancient, what with 40 being the new 20 and all, but it was clear to us the clientele was no older than 24 and frankly we felt unwelcome. On our last day, we called for a bell boy and that's when we met the incredible Edward (Eddie). Out of all the friendly staff members we met, Eddie was truly the gem that stood out. Eddie has been with the Tropicana the longest out of all their employees, but you would never know it, the way he was handling our baggage with ease. He told us stories about the Trops history from the Folies Bergere, to the famous people who have stayed there. We encouraged him to tell us more, but he had work to do. We could have listened to him all day. Eddie should be cherished and valued as the wonderful employee he is. I embrace change, and the Tropicana's remodel is a major step in the right direction. My hope is that while they aim for a more youthful market, they also respect the Trops history and the fact that there is huge demographic of people who are well over 25 and would like to stay in a historic property, have a great time in the clubs, and enjoy the historical perspective some of the employees offer.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAfter a glitch with check in the hotel was great.\u201d", "Author": "discodollydiva", "ReviewID": "UR113158601", "Content": "Stayed here over New Year's in the new rooms they had remodeled.

I can certainly tell you that the Trop did not let us down. The rooms were modern, with Kohler fixtures in the bathroom, VERY comfortable beds, and rooms that didnt have that normal \"hotel\" smell. From our first encounter with Terry at the front desk to our help with baggage from Jake as we left, the Trop has certainly placed customer service at a premium. I have to admit, we immediately went to the new pool, and had concerns. Because the Nikki Beach was having an industry day, the cacaphony of sounds from the techno beats of Nikki to the music from the regular pool was deafening and irritating...the initial stay at the pool was unpleasant. However, later in the week when Nikki was closed during the day, the regular pool was great. However, on Thursday, the music was WAYYYY too loud, and kept a number of people away. I was told that this is something they are working on. I have a feeling the pool is still a work in progress. The room was quiet (thank goodness Terry put us AWAY from the Nikki Beach side!) and we got GREAT sleep when necessary. We did not try Biscayne or the Italian restaurant because they were a bit pricey. The first floor restaurants were a bit pricey but normal for the strip. By far, the all star team member was Maria from housekeeping (for the Club Tower). She as professional, welcoming, and a VERY hard worker....the Trop (and Las Vegas) needs more great people like these in their hotels...kudos for Maria!!! The Trop casino was unlike others on the Strip....it was open, airy and well lit. If you like old school, dark, dingy and smoky...you wont like the Trop casino. Special props to Ed, Wally and Todd in the Poker room. The Trop has just redesigned their poker room; its small, but WAYYY nice....hopefully business will improve. If you are a poker player, you need to check out the Trop poker room. Most importantly, we felt safe at the Trop. Security personnel were visible, but not obtrusive. My only concern is wide open access for non-guest access to the pool (other hotels restrict access). We did venture mid-strip on evening, and DID NOT return...the volume and class of people, were...lets say less than desirable...we will continue to stay south or off-strip for future trips. The only other issue we had was an encounter with a less than caring female bell captain on the last day of our trip. She could have cared less about customers...this was VERY quickly taken care of as Jake and Nick saw what was happening and intervened. As a side note, I left a golf hat in my room hidden in a room lamp (yeah I know...stupid!). Josh from security was helpful the next day and went the extra mile trying to locate it. Unfortunately, other security staff could have cared less, as I made other inquiries the day after....I have given up the hat as a lost cause.

It's clean, it's fun, it's pretty, it's laid back. I've stayed at a lot of the fancy Vegas hotels - yawn. The Tropicana felt fresh. Very resort-y like old school Vegas. The room are darling...very Havana, Cuba. Comfy, functional, great, big TVs. And the beds are like sleeping on a cloud. You need to recover from something or many things? This is the bed to do in. And QUIET. Nikki Cafe has great, interesting but not weird food and really good service. Good coffee! Very important! Sit on the balcony ifnit's not too hot. The pool was awesome. Lots of chairs, good service, fun locale. Again, very resorty. Very diverse in all aspects, you'll feel comfortable. Stay away from the Nikki Beach side if you're not into loud pulsating music. I didn't go in but I peeked and it looked like a lot of fun if you're young, fit and into drinking beer at 10am. : ) The views, especially at night, of New York, New York and the strip are amazing. And it's a short walk to both NY NY and MGM where there are a whole bunch more, shops, shows, resaurants. Very convenient but just a *tad* set away making it really feel more exclusive. My only suggestions to the Tropicana are these: 1. Back it down a notch with the coconut-pineapple air freshener in the hallways. 2. MORE Tropicana-themed souvenirs! Like the Flamingo and their signature pink you should use that gorgeous coral and Tropicana brand everything.

The property is renovated, upgraded and beautiful. We were offered the choice of two rooms - a tower closer to the casino or to the pool and we took the tower closer to the pool, which was PERFECT. Great view of the Strip, at the end of the floor. And the rooms were almost sound-proof! You couldn't even hear the planes coming into the airport nearby! Went and saw Gladys Knight in concert. Worth the general admission ticket. Make sure to get in line early for good seats to see the show. Cafe Nikki has a really good happy hour - $5-6 apps and drink specials. Try the mojito! Or the bloody mary. This resort is strong on customer service! The employees were VERY friendly, helpful and courteous, from a housekeeper who gave us extra towels to someone who walked us out to the pool when we were lost and a chef at Pizza Pellegrino, who offered us a full menu even though we wanted pizza. A couple hiccups: We checked in to the Tropicana at 2:30 p.m. and our room wasn't ready, so we had lunch at Cafe Nikki. My only concern was that we were at the restaurant during a certain window of time, when only a buffet was offered and we could not order off the menu. We were told that there would be a phone call letting us know when our room was ready (after 3:30 p.m.) and we never received a call, so we had to wait in line again for our room - which was ready. Never mind that we had to haul our luggage while we were waiting because there was no attendant at the luggage storage area. (Not fun) Also, our television did not work the first day of our stay. We called the front desk who told us it was a property-wide problem because of the television/satellite/cable provider and they offered to comp us on-demand movies. But, if you think about it, who goes to Vegas to watch television? The first day of our stay we went to the pool and it was filled with teenagers and college students, who were loud, running around the pool and making a mess, strewing empty beer cans, bottles and cups across the pool. Yet the next four days at the pool were nothing like that - completely relaxed, quiet afternoon at the pool with lots of sun and lots of adults.

The Tropicana did not deliver any of these so we will not stay there again, but if you have different requirements, there\u2019s a lot to recommend about the Trop. The Trop did a nice job with their remodel. This is not a luxury property, but it is good value for the price. Everything looks up-to-date and fresh, and the smoke factor is really low here. Employees here are some of the most helpful and friendly in Vegas, esp. the valets and bellmen. Property looks really clean. Elevators were fast and available.

The Trop doesn\u2019t have enough gaming tables, and the minimums were $15+ even on Sunday night. The casino itself is mostly slots. The pool is clean and nicely landscaped, but otherwise average.

The Trop has been advertising in L.A. like crazy, trying to attract the hip and beautiful crowd with Nikki Beach. So far it\u2019s not working.

The Trop doesn\u2019t have any packages that include entry to Nikki Beach so there is no advantage in getting in. Nikki Beach was a disappointment. Unless you rent a daybed or cabana, there is no seating at all. The pool looks like it would fit in a standard backyard.

We arrived excited for the grand opening as well as a fun and relaxing weekend. We were not disappointed. We had been at the Tropicana property just six weeks earlier and we were amazed that they had been able to complete the construction so quickly. Six weeks earlier they were just breaking ground on the pool and club area. VIP check-in was a breeze. The front desk staff is courteous and accommodating without any wait at all. Our room was on a ground level floor as requested, on the opposite side from Nikki Beach in the far tower. It's a bit of a hike through the casino and over the pool areas. But once we got into our room we were able to relax in our very comfortable room. Any opening night for a night club creates opportunities for missteps and production snafus. Nikki Beach has a reputation for attention to detail and high production value. We were not disappointed. Checking into the invitation only grand opening event only took a few minutes (the staff was cleverly using software on an iPad) and we were greeted with smiles and cold beverages immediately. The indoor space is low on dance area and high on VIP and lounge space. The outdoor pool area cascaded down towards the pool with levels of bedded areas and lounge chairs. There was plenty of passed food, free cold beverages and interesting ambient entertainment. The music was a more relaxed lounge-house sound and seemed appropriate for this more social invite-only event. Celebrities included Halle Barry, Gladys Knight, and a few other unexpected names that I can't recall at this time. At approximately 10pm the club and opened up to the general public and DJ Robbie Rivera took over the decks, who played a much more energetic and heavy house set, perfect for getting the energy pupped up in the club. The dance floor was busy for most of the rest of the evening. The Nikki Beach / Club Nikki was well staffed for the evening and all of the staff seemed to be well trained and on purpose the entire evening. They were friendly, attentive and kept the space from getting to crowded by keeping the flow of the club moving. Later that night (early in the morning), we returned to our room and ordered room service. The food was delivered within 45 minutes (as stated) and was hot and delicious. Quite a surprise for room service food. We also ordered room service again, the following morning, just before checked out and had the same experience. The food was warm, savory and delivered on time. I highly recommend the Cuban Breakfast Wrap - best room service entr\u00e9e ever! Check out was quick, efficient and pleasant. We had our receipt in our hands, our luggage stored for the day (until our departure) and were on our way for a final day of shopping and sight-seeing. In closing it's important to point out that, as someone who grew up in Las Vegas, I was very surprised to see so many young persons on the Tropicana property at almost any time during the day. Much different from the Tropicana's previous reputation for catering to a much older clientele. I assume this is all part of their upgrade and partnership with Nikki Beach. The younger crowd brings fun, playful and beautiful to the property.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAll around wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "roeman218", "ReviewID": "UR110549994", "Content": "After a rough flight to Vegas from Canada there is nothing more that I wanted than to get checked in quickly and efficiently so that i could relax and I got just that!

Not a lot of noise at all, just from emergency sirens.Our room was large, spacious, spotless, very large bed which was extremely comfortable. The room was about a good 7-10 minute walk from reception, but not a problem, when you walk miles everywhere anyway. We didnt eat at the hotel resturants but you can get 50% off your meals if you buy a $3 coupon from the ticket booths on the strip. Where we also got show tickets for Jersey boys, and the rat pack shows. Both well worth it. The Tropicana is south of the strip so you do a lot of walking to get around. You can buy a 3 day hop on bus pass which runs up and down the strip for $7. Well worth the money , as it stops at every hotel and can take upto 1 hour to run from one end to the other. Or the express bus which only stops at certain stops and is obviously quicker. The pool areas look great, lots of bed both in the sun and shade, always beds available when we looked. The casino is very small when you see other hotel casinos, it depends on what you want. A great smell of sun cream is noticable around reception and parts of the casino, apparently it makes you spend more money? I cannot fault this hotel for the money we paid, friendly helpful staff and always plenty around.

The rooms were spacious and everything was new. What I was frustrated about was not getting the room type we reserved and paid extra for. I booked a city view room and they did not have any note of that when we checked in so we took another room with an airport view that is on the other side of the casino. It wasn't that far of a walk, but after being out walking the strip it would have been nice to walk in and go straight to my room. I called travelocity to try to get it straightened out, but they weren't much help even though I had paid extra for each night to have a city view room. The best they could do was move us to a room with two queen beds instead of the king bed room we were in and by that point we had already been there 2 days and were leaving in another 2. I asked about a refund and they claimed the room we had (not city view) was the same price as city view even though the website clearly had different rates. I didn't want to waste time arguing with them over what amounted to about $60 so I let it go. We ordered room service the first night we were there and our food was fabulous and the service was great. We had our food in less than 30 minutes. I think the food came from cafe nikki. That was the only food we had from this hotel. I went to the pool once. It was extremely crowded, but otherwise nice. If I return to Vegas though I'll probably stay somewhere a little more in the middle of the strip. I've only been twice and the other time was at Mandalay Bay (much better pool there by the way).

We wanted somewhere on The Strip but as we were there for the gambol/poker we weren't concerned too much about a luxury spa etc. We got a great price on the Trop and as we heard it had been done up, we plumped for it. I had also been swayed by the good engagement on here by Nicole - I like a hotel that takes the time. I'd got in touch but due to the guys wanting to book just after payday, we booked through a third party - Nicole got back to me a few days after with a better offer that I sadly couldn't take up but once again, excellent. The hotel itself was perfect for us and our needs. The place looks fresher than a lot of the hotels at the South end and the room was perfect - comfortable and clean. The pool was great. One or two gripes - the resort fee is standard Vegas fare so I don't mind but non-residents could just wander out to the pool and use it - some other hotels check room cards etc and I prefer this. This was the same for tower access - any random could get in a lift without a room card, I never like this. That aside, the Trop won't have the same footfall of randoms as the middle of the Strip hotels so it may not be such an issue or they may be addressing this as the makeover continues. Food wise we ate at Nikki Beach which was dead on - good clubs, burgers, sushi. The waiters were good and the outside deck is lovely. Biscayne was really good though. We had a really good time - top steaks, great wine and the crab/cheddar mash is something I'll need to try and recreate! We didn't gamble much at the hotel, some roulette & blackjack was all. The poker room looks nice but with few folk about, most beginners will just head across to the Excalibur for NL1/2 rather than the NL1/3 on offer in the Trop (change this!). As it was usually fairly empty, we played elsewhere. In all though, a great hotel if you get it at the right price as the money you save will go a long way in this town.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPlanning my Return ASAP! :) Grand Opening Nikki Beach!\u201d", "Author": "JesseFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR108861730", "Content": "If Nikki Beach was open during my stay, I might not have left the property.

Pre-Check-In: After booking the hotel via Expedia, I found out on Facebook that Nicole Marshall is one of the nicest guest relation people in the whole city. Wrote her about my trip and asked her if it would be possible to get a fridge for my medication (the trip was a mix of birthday present and reward for being healthy again) and a quiet room. She responded within 24 hours that it wouldn't be a problem and told me that she would place a note on my reservation. Check-In: Arrived at 2:15am to see that there was no line at all and I could check-in right away. The way to the front desk, doesn't give you the whole casino tour, as it sits on the left side of the main entrance. That's a big bonus, since you don't have to move your luggage across the whole casino in order to check in. The women at the check-in gave me a warm feeling, called housekeeping because of the fridge and told me they'd knock within 5 minutes. Just as I got up to the room, housekeeping already knocked and helped me set up my fridge. Room: I had a room in the Paradise Tower, which has it's elevators right at the entrance to the right. From the entrance to the elevator it's about a 7-10 step walk, so you get in and out of the hotel fast, if you want to do some shopping/seightseeing/... . The rooms are big, even compared to other (more expensive) hotels on the strip. I had enough room to move around, set up my computer on the table without feeling like a canned tuna. It was a pretty quiet room for Vegas standards, which I really loves, since I am still recovering and needed some sleep aswell. Only downside, I got veeeeeery loud neighbors the last 3 nights (weekend), but since I already saw they were very well booked and since I also didn't want to change rooms, I didn't mention it. But it doesn't change my opinion of the hotel ... they couldn't have known. Also on a plus-side ... I had some friends stay at the Treasure Island and they complained that they didn't have a docking station for their IPod ... Tropicana has a very nice IHome station that also works with IPhones (which is rare, most docking station are IPod only). Nearly forgot ... there's a huge safe in the room, that handles a 17\" Laptop with ease ... I had a big camera, laptop, mobile phone, car keys, and and and in the safe and there was still enough room for another laptop and some more stuff ... safe didn't work when I arrived, but within 5 minutes security was there trying to help me. Sadly they couldn't fix it either, but the next morning a locksmith replaced the lock and it worked like a charm. Casino: They had the \"Even the Odds\" promotion still going, which gives you 50% of what you lose (in slot play) back on the same day and 50 additional percent back on your next stay (between 1 and 12 months later). So even if you don't plan to lose, it is pretty nice to have a fallback-option ;) The casino itself is bright, unlike most other Vegas casinos and while it feels different, it's a very nice feeling to play in a friendly environment. Pool: They have a great pool that tends to get a little overrun on sunny days, as it's very inviting. The water was a little cold at first, but after some 85-90\u00b0 days it really heated up and it was great to swim some laps there. Nikki Beach is opening in May aswell, so they'll add another pool to the mix, where I'm sure people will meet to party and enjoy themselves. Construction looked pretty much done when I was there and I got a sneak peak of what to expect ... it looks very promising and could become a got-to-be-there spot in Vegas, if the management does a good job promoting it. Housekeeping: Unlike some other people writing reviews here, I had no problems there ... they cleaned every day (except for my second to last day ... but that was because I told them it wouldn't make sense, since I had to leave at 3:00am in the morning) and did a pretty good job. Overall: I already told people to take a good look at the Tropicana, if they don't mind walking a little to the to the crowded places, to get the most bang for their buck on the Strip. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat ... would love to check out one of the suites next time.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cStaff, and service was terrific can't say enough about Kennon Wolff.\u201d", "Author": "tropicanvacation", "ReviewID": "UR108680925", "Content": "Tropicana was a great hotel.

We were 2 couples and we had all been to Vegas before. After reading all the good reviews for the Trop we decided to give it a try. I must admit we were all slightly disappionted. Don't get me wrong it's a nice hotel, but they've done a good job on selling themselves and we found it's not quite as it seems. We all agreed that if it was your first visit to Vegas you'd be more than pleased. But if you have been before, you tend to do comparisons a little too much. Having said that our negatives didn't ruin our holiday. I really don't know where all the over friendly staff were on our week, we didn't find this the case at all. Not that they were rude or unwelcoming, but neither over the top friendly either. In fact most of the staff seemed to be new and unsure what they were doing. The rooms are really lovely, we upgraded to a deluxe room and it was great, with a fab view, and as sooo many say, the beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable...we had no probs sleeping, which definately helped with jetlag!!! Love the smell of the hotel, wafts of coconut but not a strong smell. Loved Cafe Nikki, nice ambience and yum food! The size of the hotel is great not large and easy to get around. The pool area is very nice, music is a bit repetative after a few days! The cocktail girls aren't assertive enough, our friend on the last day said they hadn't asked her once if she wanted a drink, we had to call them over, and they weren't overly friendly. We tended to go get our drinks in cafe Nikki ourselves. We were very disappointed with the Ambhar lounge, we had the impression of a cool lounge bar, with cocktails, music, etc, but this really was a let down. Its a small area with sport on the screens, which confuses me when there is a sports bar. We did spend time there though, happy hour 4pm-7pm half price cocktails! We ate at Biscayne, bit of a strange ambience, waiter was humourless, which made us laugh!! Food was OK, mediocre, you can get much better in other hotels. My Husband tried the taster meal, it wasn't good! Didn't eat in the Italian, it looked nice, but both restaurants a weirdly situated. The casino is bright and airy, my husband enjoyed some gambling. The drinks girls come round more often there than round the pool, and the drinks are free in there!! All in all we had a great holiday, nothing ruined it. It'll be even better when Nikki beach/club opens this week, it looks very nice, a bit smaller than I had imagined. It's a great value hotel but not in the same league as some of the others, once they've ironed out some teething problems it'll be much better. I wouldn't stay there again as I like to try different hotels but I would recommend this hotel.

I contacted Nicole Marshall as you will notice many people say. She was absolutely awesome. Did it take her a minute to get back with us? Of course. But imagine how many emails she must get a day from ppl wanting some sort of deal, \"hook up\" or assistance with something for their upcoming trip. Anyway, from the moment we arrived at Tropicana, we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and a smile. Our room was absolutely SPECTACULAR. It was a Penthouse Loft and it was just amazing. What I loved most about the room was the small dining table on th lower level. A lot of suites make the mistake of having some huge dining table that takes up most of the room as if you will have a huge sit-down dinner in your hotel. However, I did end up having a dinner in once and from our windows were able to look out onto the strip while enjoying our meal. The jacuzzi upstairs in the bathroom was ridiculous. It was so deep that a \"little person\" standing in it would drown if the water was filled. Again, there was an awesome view of the strip from the tub. As for the rest of the hotel, I would have been content to just stay there at night. The casino isn't too large and unlike my voyages into other casinos and hotels, I didn't get lost when trying to leave. The band playing in the Ahmbar Lounge was SPECTACULAR. After a night out, I'd often headed back to the lounge only to wish I'd have stayed there in the first place. They played modern songs and encouraged audience participation. The bartenders were AWESOME and the Berry Beach drink had me tipsy before I was finished with the first. I got a cabana during my stay and it was totally worth it. The cabanas are GORGEOUS. All white with a few red and island accents. Many hotels make you pay a large amount of money for a cabana and then on top of that, you buy your drinks and food. Tropicana charged us an amount and it included that set amount's worth of drinks. Completely worth it. I am from Texas. I am used to seasonings, flavor and tad bit of spice in my food. After visiting several Vegas restaurants, I was left disappointed in Vegas food. I'd wished I'd packed some Tony Cachere's seasoning in my purse. I'd given up and accepted the fact that in other areas, people just don't cook the way I'm used to. Then I went to Bacio inside the hotel. Our waiter was absolutely delightful and our meals (Chicken Parmesan and Filet with Lobster Hash) were the best food we had in Vegas...seriously. I still dream of the lobster hash some nights. HA! It made me wish I had taken the time to visit Biscayne while there. I did, however, have some of the Spicy Havana Nights sushi rolls while at the pool and those were pretty good as well. The only issue I ran into was WiFi. It was spotty and sometimes worked and other times did not. Not a huge deal as I wasn't planning on working while there, but when trying to use my Nook to purchase a book to read while relaxing, I ran into some issues. Of course, this was a level 1 problem on a scale of 1 - 10 in my book. I've seen complaints of the section of the Strip. To each his own, I suppose. We ended up walkign down to Venetian once or twice but really, we would have been content to just stay on our end. I love NY,NY's rollercoaster. There is a small food court between MGM and Tropicana. We went to Excalibur for ice cream one night after clubbing and walked to MGM for KA on our last night. For me, everything I really needed was in that area of the Strip unless I wanted to venture out to sightsee the rest of the Strip. However, this was trip number 4 for me and I've seen the rest of the Strip. For those who say the walk to the other tower was bad, I disagree. While my room was in the main tower, I'd gone exploring the hotel once and the walk wasn't that bad. Was it a minute or two? Yes. But hardly the hiking trip many ppl have made it seem. In conclusion, I would readily stay at The Tropicana again. It wasn't too large, the staff was awesome and while I had never seen the hotel previous to my trip - it was beautiful in my opinion. I have stayed at Venetian before as well as Treasure Island and I would, without a doubt, choose Tropicana again.

The pool was large enough to accomodate everyone - I like that part of it is in the shade so if you get really hot/sunburned , you can chill in the cooler areas. We got lucky both days with finding lounge chairs but it can get crowded - I do have to give kuddos to the lifeguards/employees who were always helping guests locate chairs - they really went above and beyond with customer service. We didn't utilize any of the restaurants in the resort as we were traveling on a budget but they did have a 24 hour starbucks and small cafe type place which is really nice.

The Nikki Beach area wasn't open yet - they are still finishing construction but we never were woke up by it. It looks like it will be really cool once it's all complete Oh and don't forget the 24 hour hot tubs - OMG - that was WONDERFUL - especially after a day of walking all over the strip - total relaxation for sore muscles - take advantage of it - there are 2 of them!

The \"new\" Tropicana Las Vegas is GREAT! It was with more than a bit of trepidation that we booked a weekday getaway for ourselves and family visiting from Manila at the newly renovated TROPICANA resort in Las Vegas, but let me begin by saying that we could not have been more pleased with our visit! If you've been to Vegas in recent years, you would know that the Trop has had a horrible reputation and it deserved it. But this is no longer the case. This hotel has had not only a complete renovation of the buildings and rooms, but the staff seems to have benefitted from this makeover as well. From the parking valet to the doormen, everyone actually seemed to care! (Next trip, we'll be reviewing the restaurants) The only \"bump\" in our visit was when we got to our rooms and the carpets were still damp from shampooing. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I REALLY can't complain about a hotel being \"too clean\", so it was no big deal to call the desk and let them know we'd like to change rooms. Since the bags were not up yet, a short jaunt back to the desk to pick up our new room keys took all of 15 minutes. AND we were able to get the adjoining rooms that were not yet available when we first checked in. On top of that, the desk clerks Ladonna and Gerard were SO nice, they made sure we were sent free in room coffee makers for the \"inconvenience\". Keep in mind that we were not paying top fare for the rooms, so this made their gesture even nicer. Mr. Yamenidjian, the new boss, has done a fine job of staffing the Trop with some of the most professional, welcoming and courteous staff in Vegas and he should be commended for it! The rooms were spacious and SPOTLESS. They were welcoming and the beds were wonderful. The bathrooms are also very nice, but the grout on the floors could use a bit more work. Showers on the 6th floor where we were are full pressure and the convenience of the in room safes and FREE WiFi cannot be overstated. BIGass flat screen LED tv's and comfy lounges had us kicking back and relaxed enough to plan the evening in no time. Even being close to the airport at the south end of the Strip, the rooms were so quiet we never noticed any jet noise. The alarm clocks even had Ipod docks! We didn't have the chance to check out the restaurants, but that can wait until our next visit which will hopefully be very soon. Being just across the street from the MGM Grand and the monorail, the Trop's location is almost perfect. Just far enough away from the rest of the Strip to be quiet, but close enough to the monorail to be able to do the entire Strip in one day! In a nutshell, we have found a new favorite place to stay in Vegas and we will continue to visit as much as possible. The Tropicana has gone from \"rundown\" to \"wonderful\" and is at the time of this writing, the best VALUE in Vegas.

A couple annoyances...the check-in desk is on a raised platform with 5 or so stairs up. This makes checking in with suitcases inconvenient. There is a small ramp, but it's on the opposite side of the check-in area from where you enter at the main doors. Maybe it's a minor inconvenience, but if they just spent millions remodeling the place, why didn't someone think this through? The Island Tower is quite a trek from the casino floor without many distractions along the way. The room was adequate. Best part was the bed--so comfortable! Much more comfortable than Treasure Island, if not Cosmopolitan as well. The recent renovations meant my room was fresh and in good shape. I think the decor will quickly be outdated in another 5 years though. Table minimums were much higher than I expected--$15 most nights with a rare $10 table. Food options are pretty bleak. Thankfully, Starbucks opened the week I was there. The noodles restaurant and side by side cafe were overpriced for the quality of food. Unfortunately, didn't have time to enjoy the pool because it looked like a great setup. The gym was very strange. It was essentially within the wide hallway that led to the pool. 2/5 cardio machines were broken. Overall, my stay was fine. Nothing major to complain about, but I also wasn't as impressed with the renovations as most reviewers seem to be.

It was great value for money I think we paid under 500 GBP to stay here for 10 nights! We were treated like royalty by all members of staff who were all so friendly and helpful.

The room was tidy and clean - we were in a smoking room too :-) A massive TV along with lots of wardrobe and drawer space, the bathrooms were big and updated the added extra which made it for us was the Ipod/Iphone docking station with alarm and radio, we got new towels from housekeeping every day and our beds were also made every day - housekeeping even came back when we were still in the room at a more convenient time - they didn't just leave the room uncleaned We ate in the chinease takeaway, the starbucks and the other restaurants within the Tropicana and the staff including the chefs and counter staff were just amazing, they made conversation with us and made an effort to get to know us individually, they never seemed unhappy to be there which was amazing.

We must have taken too long to get out of the room because it never got cleaned. Not the end of the world, but having someone to make my bed each day spoils me while on vacation. I tipped them every day, so they missed out on that the last day. As mentioned in other reviews, they have doormen to hold the doors for you. What a nice touch to be greeted with a smile and a \"Good Morning/Afternoon\"! They helped us find the Pawn Shop and genuinely seemed to care if you were having a good stay. All the employees had smiles and good attitudes. We really felt like they put forth their best effort to be welcoming and we would return. We had no problems with anyone and we were there four nights. Overall I think the property has come a long way. I have to admit, I was doubtful about the whole package: the promises with our existing reservations right through to the customer service. But, no worries. They came through 100%. Everything they promised us at checkin was given without any issues, the renovations were all as described and the customer service was top notch. Thank you Nicole, our vacation was wonderful! The reviews that talk about the \"long\" walk to the pool if you are in the Paradise Tower are ridiculous. If that is considered a long walk, somebody needs to get out and exercise more. This is a smaller size property and not scaled to the size of the MGM or Wynn or Venetian. If you enter the front door you could be at the pool or up to your room within 5 minutes. I like not having to walk for 20 minutes and get lost several times while trying to find something. The elevator wait got a little long Friday evening and Saturday. I would definitely return to this hotel. They are on the right track with all the improvements and it is obvious that they are taking the customer service seriously", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansing, MI", "Title": "\u201cEnoyed our stay at the Tropicana with one exception\u201d", "Author": "santa4four", "ReviewID": "UR106522365", "Content": "After a 6 hour flight delay we were more than ready to get into our room.

The first time was in the summer of 2006, before any renovations happened, the second was the summer of 2010, when renovations were under way but not nearly completed, and the most recent time was spring 2011, when things were really shaping up at the place. I gotta tell you, the incredible changes - all positive - I have seen at the Trop have been astounding. In '06, we went there because it was cheap and affordable, and we couldn't get be picky with where we stayed. The subsequent visits, however, boasted comparable prices with rooms and amenities that rival the best of the best in Vegas and around the world. The rooms were gorgeously decorated in the style of South Beach, with lots of warm whites reminiscent of flowing linens in the sun, and vibrant hot hues like oranges and yellows. The furniture was very well matched, and mostly made of wood. There were beautiful paintings depicting music and dance scenes from South Beach adorning many of the walls. The rooms themselves were wonderfully spacious, and the beds were to die for. When we first checked in we were greeted by a delightful Filipina woman named Yolanda, who held pleasant conversation while simultaneously being of huge assistance. As we walked the short distance to the rear tower, we were greeted nicely by virtually every staff member along the way. There were also a smattering of actors from the Trop's new Mob Experience (mroe on that later), who always stayed in character but still mingled and greeted guests, which was a lot of fun. The view was stunning, as the Trop is located at the same intersection that is shared by the MGM Grand, the Excalibur, and the NYNY. The TVs and all the other applicances/furniture/amenities were all brand new! At one point I called down to guest services and spoke to someone named Pat, and they were so pleasant and helpful. We were able to see the new Celine concert, Beatles LOVE, Ka, and go to attractions like Shark Reef and the Springs Preserve Museum, all because of the help of wonderful staff. Incidentally, we rode to the airport in a cab driven by an older Japanese-American man named Eddie, who said that the Trop has been his beat for over a decade. He asked us how we enjoyed our stay, to which we of course replied that we absolutely loved it. He then told us that he has seen a huge increase in the numbers of people (and therefore, business) at the Trop in the last year, and that every single one of them has been gushing about their stay at the place. He said that the positive changes in guest feedback have been completely consistent and entirely noticeable, whereas before the Trop was just another casino. Now it's a place to be. The place to be. In summary, if you're going to Vegas, stay at the Trop! There is no way that you will regret it!

This hotel was the only one we noticed that had doormen opening the doors for you every time you left and came in...little touches mean a lot! One day we went to the pool, and while it is still partly under construction, the open area was wonderful. It was a little crowded and one of the gentlemen working at the pool area told us to wait while he rounded us up 2 lounge chairs together and brought towels. What a relaxing day we had at the pool!! We spent one evening in the hotel lounge listening to a great band. Our bartender, Pat, was super friendly and mixed awesome drinks!! The Mob Experience was REALLY fun...even more so than we expected it to be. It was easy to walk to many other hotels and to catch the tram right across at MGM.

A few problems such as: a) their Deluxe rooms not Deluxe and pictures on internet does not properly reflect the room, I even showed them to a few of the staff and they basically squinted and then laughed \"no way\"...\"those are some good pictures\" they said b) their very nice website insinuates that all rooms have been remodeled when really only the Go Deluxe rooms were remodeled, I thought the only difference between GO DELUXE and DELUXE was the fact that the Go room is more for business travelers with iphone stuff, etc...but the truth is that only the GO rooms are remodeled the others are from 20 years or so ago... c) they seperated their swimming pool (probably the best thing of the hotel) which has three slides into two pools; 3/4 of it went to the ADULT POOL and 1/4 of it to the children/family leaving only two working slides out of the three slides available; in addition to the fact that the slide pool is tiny. Also there was no vibe or atmosphere in the family pool...just because we have children doesn\u2019t mean we dont' enjoy nice music...ALSO NO JACUZZI IN THE FAMILY POOL...

Then after visiting the pool area and having to sit on a rock while my son played on the slide, it forced me to go complain to Manager.

The view with the waterfall beautiful! I used to stay at Tropicana in my 20's and always enjoyed the atmosphere although the rooms were run down. To my surprise everything has changed and the Hotel, the Service exceeded my expectations fully! Tropicana may not be glitzy with all the expensive stores like Mandalay Bay or MGM...but it is a great value. Very clean and very friendly. I will highly recommend it to my friends with kids and those without kids espcially when Niki Beach opens...BEing alone there with my son, I felt safe in the Tropicana environment...felt welcomed and taken care of.

I generally find that \"casino hotels\" are a bit \"tired\" for all the wear. And some of the other places we were in had that smell of stale tobacco smoke Our room was very clean and quiet and had a comfy king bed w/heavy comforter. I was very happy here, particularly for the convenience of walking back to my room after a late night at the casino.The casino is bright and cheerful .The lobby/check-in was well staffed and friendly, and eager to help on a moment's notice. We checked in early and our room was not yet ready but we were offered another room in the Island Tower. I have read the reviews and it seemed people have found staying there was a long and boring walk to their room, so we decided to check our bags and wait till or room in the Paradise Tower was ready. The next day we decided to see for ourselves how boring this walk would have been. i can honestly say that is quite the contrary. The walk down the connecting walkway was no trouble at all.(6-8 minutes) And the views from that tower were fantastic. I would stay in either tower when we go back. Unfortunately the pool was closed during our stay but it sure looked very inviting and the grounds just added to it. Also the location of the hotel is at the quiet end of the strip which was quite nice if you wanted to go out for a late walk. All in all the tropicana is a great place to stay. Good service and it seems they are always willing to help or improve if anything needs it! we will definately stay here again", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NH", "Title": "\u201cRECYCLED PERCUSSION - AWESOME SHOW!\u201d", "Author": "NHlakelover", "ReviewID": "UR105152856", "Content": "What a great show!!

We usually choose a hotel more central of the strip but because of a huge convention going on that week, we were not willing to pay the overpriced hotel rates that were posted for that particular weeks stay. The Tropicana hotel was much more affordable so we booked 6 nights from March 23rd to the 29th. Gerald or Gerard (not sure) was very nice at the front desk for accommodating 2 couples who were joining us a few days later and had reserved rooms next to ours upon their arrival. The rooms were clean and beds were quite comfortable. The casino was nice and the tables were affordable ( not like $50. min. bets) and lots of slot machines available. Very friendly staff at the small gift shop at the entrance. The dealers were very nice except for the ones on the craps table commenting that they had a audience and that they would charge $20 for watching. We found that pretty unprofessional as we were only trying to learn the rules of the game so we could try playing, but with those comments, we just walked away. We were quite pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had to take taxis mostly everywhere because of the location of this hotel. Of course we stayed at the Ceasars Palace, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Luxor the other times and Tropicana is not comparable, but on the other hand, when you stay at those fancy places you have to go elsewhere to play the tables because of the high limits they have there. I would probably stay more central next time only because we like to walk and visit around and Tropicana was a bit too far on one end. Another great service at the front desk was they printed out our boarding passes for our early morning flights and let us check out the night before.

In a bit more detail: 1. Hotel is easy to find from airport as it's at the airport endcof the strip. Parking's easy. Chek-in was fast. Room pleasing. 2. Yes, the hotel is a little out of the main drag but it's next to MGM, New York New York and Luxor so no big deal. 3. It's very easy to get to the I15 which is a great way of avoiding the Strip when you're driving. Once you've driven the Strip you'll know why that's important! 4. Wi-fi was a pain. We had three devices none of which worked at various times. Very frustrating. 5. Housekeeping was desperate. To the point that we were clearly totally missed one day. 6. Good parts about being in this location include the fact that there's slightly less hubbub at night, and it's near the Town Centre Mall which has a good cinema and eating options and is so simple to drive to. You can get the deuce bus to it too. 7. Didn't use the casino but as an observation it's far less smokey and much brighter than others. Many reviewers have commented on the aroma throughout th hotel. I found it quite pleasant. 8. Pool area will be good. Massively under construction as I type so we're like sardines on the sunbeds that are round the open part of the pool. It's ok though and I think it will be very good once completed. 9. I must comment. You can walk to The Cosmopolitan Hotel. They do a buffet there, the Wicked Spoon. It is brilliant!

On the way to Cafe Nikki you'll find a 24-hour coffee shop and a separate 24-hour deli. The latter has generous sandwiches for under $9, but beware the $7 beer. I had a delicious cheese steak sandwich there. The also have a 24-hour mini-store near the main entrance with $4 sandwiches.

Two floors, spiral carpeted staircase between, a master bath complete with garden tub and a walk in shower that could fit six people easily, a second bathroom downstairs, and our favorite- the jacuzzi hot tub on the main floor. The room offered a great view of Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and the Excalibur. The Tropicana sits in a great location on the strip, some may say it's too far south, but with tram access to MB and the Luxor via the overpass to Excalibur, and the overpass walkway to MGM the Trop sits in the main action on the southern half of the strip. We were able to gamble quite a bit and I will commend the blackjack dealers on having a personality, at times that's a rarity in a casino, and they have good overall table odds on all betting levels (3:2).

After reading many positive reviews on the New Tropicana I thought I would contact Nicole Marshal to check out what kind of deal we could get. She is the main reason we decided to book, she is prompt, helpful and very nice to talk to on the phone. The only thing is we did try to meet her during our stay and we were never able to thank her in person. I digress, before the trip started, Nicole gave us great deals/rates for our five day visit that I cancelled our free/comped stay at MGM as I figured it was worth a try. She made our dinner reservations at Biscayne for us and the meal was very good, got us tickets to Recycled Percussion which was fun, but was very short, not even an hour long. I read that staff at the Trop are exceptional, we on the other hand never met any staff that left any lasting impression on us. None were rude but none went out of their way to help us except for Patrick the doorman/bellman, when we arrived he was very attentive. The casino is bright, abit too much for me, but was clean and enjoyed the cocunut scent throughout the property. We did play slots quite abit here, never won anything, and we would have liked it to have been bigger with more selection, but that is just our personal preference. Food choices are not great at the moment but were told that quicker food options are underway, which will be nice since right now there is no place to pick up a quick slice of pizza, coffee etc. Our room was nice, clean, and a good size for a standard room, but I was dissapointed on the floor and view, since I did request higher/strip view, and we received 10th floor facing construction and Hooters, but again, we do not stand looking out the window for hours on end so this was not a huge deal for us, just would have been a nice perk to have had it. The bathrooms like others have said, still look abit worn and dated, but they serve the purpose. Housekeeping was always done when we returned to our room around 5.00 pm everydaynto freshen up except the very first day it was still not done, but we just went downstairs for about an hour and when we returned the room was cleaned. We had internet in our room that worked quickly and was nice to have. All in all, we will definately stay at the Trop again, we like that location, but we like to walk alot. We hope our next visit the construction is done, and the food choices are better. Thank you to Nicole for all she did to make our trip nice, it was much appreciated. Oh one more thing, our flight home was not till 8.30 pm, and she arranged a late checkout for 4.00 but mentioned to ask that day to see if we could extend it till 6.00 pm and the front desk did, for free. No other hotel has done that for us before, and this was really nice to have the day of our leaving since we had access to our room and did not have to worry about moving our bags early in the day.

To start with the positive, the hotel\u2019s staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from the door staff and front desk right through housekeeping. Brad Garrett\u2019s Comedy Club is fantastic, and if you get a chance to see comedian Michael Loftus when you are in Vegas, take it! The guy had our diverse group crying. On the down side, the awful odor of fake coconut that pervades the property is truly nauseating, and even extends to the restaurants. I\u2019d guess that since the hotel likely has a higher proportion of chain smokers than many others in Vegas, they are trying to compensate with the Smell-O-Vision, but it doesn\u2019t work. That, along with bright orange 1970s-era carpeting and a preponderance of trashy clientele (even by Vegas standards) made me regret my choice. The Tropicana\u2019s location at the end of the Strip gets annoying very quickly, especially when you realize that its amenities (many still under construction) don\u2019t measure up to the rest of the Strip. The restaurants, like many in Vegas, are staffed by well-meaning but untrained waiters. The pasta restaurant served me a $22 plate of the \u201chouse special\u201d rigatoni which was simply inedible. The waiter did ask me how the food was, 20 minutes after serving it. While adequate, our room was nothing like the others noted in reviews below, lacking a fridge, coffee maker, or new decor. We weren\u2019t offered any \u201cfree upgrades\u201d, and we were charged a steep $75 for a late checkout at 5 p.m. The verdict: you can do a lot better for the same price in Vegas, and even the best staff can\u2019t make up for a remote location and a bad smell.

I always enjoy my visits, partly because I'm a pretty low maintenance person and partly because I'm prepared to roll with the punches to make the very BEST of my precious vacation time. We decided to stay at the Tropicana this trip, and I was so impressed with the place that it may become my new \"regular\" hotel. The service started before we ever left home. I emailed Nicole Marshall with some questions and requests, and she responded promptly with all the information I wanted. Hooray! I did not run into one grumpy or rude staff member the whole time I was there. Our waiter at Bacio was particularly awesome, as was the woman who checked us out. I wish I could remember their names to give them proper credit, but I'm terrible at that. One evening we needed more towels, and housekeeping was at our door within ten minutes, towels in hand. The room was fabulous. We got a suite in the Paradise Tower with a beautiful view of the Strip ... we could see MGM, Excalibur, NYNY and Monte Carlo quite well. We had a coffee maker, a refrigerator with bottled water, a desk, a couch, a nice chair with ottoman, a big flat screen TV and a bureau in the living room area. In the bedroom, of course, there was a cushy, inviting King bed, another TV, another chair, a closet with full length mirrored doors, two nightstands, and a safe large enough to store our laptop computer with plenty of space to spare. It was clean and spacious, and if there weren't a thousand things to do in Vegas, I could've spent hours just enjoying the room! Our room was cleaned and our amenities were replenished daily. FYI, they have hair dryers in the rooms, and they provide some pretty good smelling shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion if you want to travel lighter and leave yours behind! The casino was pleasant and enjoyable. I only play slots, so my opinion doesn't factor in table games, but they had a good variety of slots. I didn't win big, but if I held that against a property, I'd have to dislike MOST places in Vegas! The good news is that I didn't lose big, either. And although the casino is a bit smaller than surrounding ones, I liked it because I never felt disoriented. We ate once at Cafe Nikki and once at Bacio, and both meals were good. It's true that the Tropicana doesn't presently have a huge variety of eating options, but being located within easy walking distance to other places made it an absolute non-issue for us. The pool and hottubs were fantastic. Even though it was fairly busy while we were there, we found chairs by the pool pretty easily. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that if you want to use the hottub at night after the pool closes, there are no towels available nearby. So be prepared to bring towels from your room if you go down after 7 pm for a soak. During the day, there was ample staff to provide us with towels and drinks poolside!

This was my first time in Vegas, and we prepared months ahead to ensure that we had an amazing time. Reading all the fabulous reviews about the Tropicana and the details and attention they have towards their guests, we decided to give it a shot. I started exchanging emails with Nicolle Marshall, guest relations manager, explaining to her that we were getting married and that I wanted to treat my wife to an special week in Las Vegas. Since I read that so many guests got upgrades and gifts for this special ocasion, she was kind enough to offer us a free upgrade upon availability. Lets divide this review into different aspects: Check in: Quick. Theres always a little line of people but nothing that will keep you waiting for more than 10 min. Upon check in, we were told that there was nothing available for an upgrade in the paradise tower (which is the one on top of the casino) but that we were gonna get a mini suite in the island tower. I like to walk, and the first two times we walked towards our room we were fine. But after the second time, it gets annoying. It is definitely a long long walk, and it feels longer if you've been walking all day. We were located in the first floor, last room. First night went by, and exactly at 7:45 am in the morning the construction of the new club (Nikki Beach) started. Someone with a motor drill was right outside our window drilling in a way that it felt he was inside with us drilling the bathroom. Needless to say I WALKED all the way to front desk and complained about it, and we were told that if we wanted to relocate to the paradise tower all they had to offer us was a regular room. Of course I took it cause id rather stay in a smaller room without the noise of a construction outside my window. We were offered our first night on them, a nice detail I guess, but I didnt get my sleep after that. Cleanliness: The rooms are nice. Clean. They can improve the bathrooms a little more, since they look old. But in general the renovations in the room are really nice, Nice TV, ipod dock, and cold A/C. Casino: Small, to me it was great cause since Im not a gambler, I could just walk around between the few tables they have and gamble here and there. One thing to note is that if you are playing slots, you will rarely be offered any drinks, as a matter of fact there were 2 times that I couldn't even see or find someone to ask for a drink. On the other hand when I was playing roulette and poker drinks were flowing all the time. Costumer service: Excellent. To me the nicest people in the hotel have to be the valet service, Outstanding, nice people that are always ready and running to get your car. People in check in were really nice as well. Food: We only had the chance to go to Cafe Nikki for breakfast, we got there around 10:15 am to find out that we had to wait 15 min to be sat, not because there were no tables (half the place was empty) but because they didnt have enough servers at the time. I was bugged by it. I wanted a nice patio table (there were like 6 open tables there) and I was told by the hostess that patio wasn't open anymore, that we had to wait for something in the dining room or we could just self sit ourselves at the bar. Needless to say, we sat at the bar, the breakfast buffet was great with really good and fresh food and at a decent price (16$). It really got me thinking why would you only have staff for half a restaurant and make people wait. Its just not my style to have breakfast at the bar, but then again, a lot of guests had to sit there in order to get quick service. Bartender was super nice. I cant give a review on the rest of restaurants since we didn't eat there. Rooms: The regular room that we had to get in the paradise tower, was between 2 suites, connected through doors. Which means if you have no luck and someone decides to throw a party, you are in for a long night. Luckily enough only one night we were bothered by noise coming from one of the suites, but be aware of this. Pool: Small nice pool, with people always offering you towels and making sure you are having a good time. Nothing outstanding, but im sure when the renovations are over is going to look much better. Check out: When we got to the check out, this lady handed me the final bill, which didn't have the first night that was i offered off. When i pointed this out, she said that there were no notes on it, and looked at me. Of course i asked for a manager, which came out immediately and was really nice and helpful. He just asked me for the name of the manager I talked to. Thankfully i remembered the name, but im so distracted that normally i tend to forget names, so be careful and if you talk to a manager or costumer service, make sure you remember the names of the people you are talking to. He then took off the night and offered us to waive the resort fee for all the hassle we went through. Conclusion: Tropicana is a nice hotel, with nice rooms and great costumer service. Sadly all this reviews saying that you get free stuff and upgrades, on my personal experience, didnt happen at all. All we got offered when we were walking to our room the first night was a \"complimentary dinner\", which we accepted, only to find out after more than 20 min talking to an asian lady that could barely speak english, that we had to attend a timeshare exposition the following day at 11am, and then find out that they were completely booked, so we wasted our time, their time, and we got no complimentary meal. My final thought is that you will have an average experience at the tropicana, with nice rooms and smiley people, but after my first time in Vegas, i realized that for the same price, or maybe a little more, I cant get a room in a much bigger and better managed property. All we got for our wedding week in Vegas was a waived resort fee, and a free night because there was a construction outside our window, otherwise, it would've been a regular hotel stay. No upgrade to a suite, no free tickets, no coupons (they were out of coupons books...really? in vegas?), not even a coupon for their comedy club. No hard feelings at all cause at least we got a clean room and nice service, but I won't be staying in tropicana next time I go to vegas. As for Mrs. Marshall, I emailed her the day before our check in to confirm everything, got no answer, or no follow up on our stay. Keep up the work. communicate better with your guests, finish those renovations, and im sure that the Tropicana will be a much better hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Luis Obispo, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "mamalad", "ReviewID": "UR103348199", "Content": "Had a wonderful time at the tropicana this week!

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect staying there, as I had only been to Vegas one other time, 5 years ago. Well, I have to tell you, I was delighted with my experience. Here are some details. The property: It looks pretty good, but they are clearly working on it right now to update it. I think in around 6 months it will have a new pool and a dance club. The room: The room was clean as a whistle with contemporary styling. The bathroom was a bit older than I would have liked. I actually informed the management of a problem I had with the bathroom, and they were able to move me to an upgraded room for my last night. All hotels have problems and it is how they handle them that makes the difference. One of the highlights of the rooms (both I stayed in) were the beds. They are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. They were absolutely wonderful, and I did not want to get up in the morning! The bedding is attractive\u2026it has the European look where the duvet is white and they put on accent pillows. No old school bedspreads\u2026yay! By the way, flat screen TV too. The entertainment: The timing was such that music legend Gladys Knight was doing a show and I was able to see it. I could not stay in my seat- song after song of fantastic hits, bringing back memories and making me smile. She really connected with the audience which made the experience even more special. A gem of a show. The lounge outside of the theatre also had some really fun entertainment. I saw the Brad Garrett comedy show too on another night and that was good for a lot of laughs. The food: I ate at Caf\u00e9 Nikki twice-once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food is fresh and wonderful. Never made it to the steak place (Biscayne, I think?) but it looked top notch. The pool: I enjoyed one entire afternoon at the pool reading and relaxing. I sat next to a friendly group of 20 something guys. The guys were drinking up a storm and enjoying what sounded like their 3rd or so afternoon at the hotel pool. The service for drinks was great- the waitresses were around a lot to keep the drinks flowing. It would have been awesome to eat lunch poolside, but they do not offer that. There were lots of security-looking guys who kept making the rounds at the pool. I was finally wondering if there was a celebrity around or something, to explain why. One young, handsome employee in a suit (he was not a security guy, I don\u2019t think) started talking to the guys sitting next to me. He brought up that he wanted to try to set the up the guys at the Excalibur pool for the next day. It seemed odd that he was sending business (tons of drinks, for sure) to another hotel. Staff: Every single employee I dealt with was exceptionally polite and friendly. Where ever I went at the Tropicana, there were always employees around to help with your needs and answer questions. So, I recommend the Tropicana for a surprisingly luxurious bed, the awesome Gladys Knight show, delicious food, and the really friendly staff who do their best to please.

I had the best cocktail of my trip at the Ambhar Lounge during happy hour one day...cucumber...mmm. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We ate brunch at Cafe Nikki on our final day and I had the best eggs benedict I have ever tasted. We also spotted a celebrity at the table behind us which also speaks to the quality of the new hotel. Nikki Beach (currently being built) is opening soon and it looks so cool I think we'll be heading back to see it this year. I used to travel to Vegas twice a month for work and have had the opportunity to stay at many places.

This trip we were going to celebrate my birthday. We typically stay at Harrahs but because of the excellent reviews and the crazy price we got through the airline we decided to give the trop a try. We arrived via taxi to the hotel. First thing we noticed was the area was under construction. Which didn't bother us just a bit of an eye sore. We pulled up to the entrance, which has been updated and seemed very nice. There was no one there to greet us or to offer assistance with our bags. This really didn't bother us but thought I would mention it becuase I remember other commenting on the greeting they recieved. Walked into the casino/hotel lobby and had to find someone to ask where to check in. Found the check in and everything went smooth. No upgrade offered nor did we ask. Got up to our rooms which was not that bad of a walk. The room was nice and updated. Bed was comfy and for the price we were happy. The casino, just was not our style. Seemed older and just no real atmoshphere. We did play a little bit but just wasn't feeling the vibe. One note, we didn't get any cocktail service while we were playing and come to think about it I don't remember seeing any CW around the machines. Did see a few around the tables though. I ended up moving to a video poker machine at the bar and the bar tenders there were always great, friendly, and on top of things. I guess the bottom line here is we spent most of our time at other casinos gambling. As far as eating we had other food places outside the trop on our list so we didn't have any major meals here. However, we did come in late a couple of nights and ate at the sandwich place in the trop. the first night it took along time to get our sandwich (30 minutes) but once we got our food it was really good. The second night when we came back in late we decided to give them another shot and service was much better and the food was great again. One other negative for us there was no starbucks or coffee house in the hotel. Each morning we ended up going over to the MGM to get our starbucks fix. So the only major negative that happened to us was during our last night there. We got back to our room around midnight and noticed someone had checked into the room next to us. They must have decided to have a private party and had there radio sitting right next to the door that adjoined our rooms. So instead of making a fuss about having them turn down the music and calm down the other things that were going on in there we decided to move. We called down to the desk and requested to be moved. They had no problems moving us. This was a pain to back up everything and move to a different room but seemed to be a better option then fighting with strangers in the next room or laying awake listening to there sounds all night. When we got down to our new room it was all good. But I noticed that this room also has an adjoining door to the room next door. Lucky for us there was no one in the room so all was calm. It just seems strange that after all the money they spent to upgrade/update there rooms they would have sealed up some of the adjoining room doors. Not sure, but I am assuming most of the standard rooms have the adjoining room doors. In my past experience these adjoining doors always allows for to much noise to be shared. To sum things up, we are planning another trip to vegas this summer and have decided to stay at another property. Just becuase we like a different casino vibe and like to have lots of things to do in the property we are staying at. But for the price we paid I have no issues with the trop.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Big Change\u201d", "Author": "cgarmer", "ReviewID": "UR102904654", "Content": "Wow, this is an all new Trop. The change is a total 180 from a few years ago. We were upgraded to a suite and loved the room. It was larger than other suites we have stayed in, in Vegas. The bed was way comfy. The iHome made getting ready to go out a lot more fun. Loud music and beer with your \"s#!t, shower and shave\" is always a good time. The tub did need to be redone; it was the only thing not remodeled. The casino was different than most others. The Trop has a more laid back feel. You will not see the 35 person craps table with the screaming, yelling, high fives and billows of cigar smoke. You will however be able to find a table or slot in a nice atmosphere with comfy chairs. The white interior mixed with the dark wood and the red lighting does give the Trop a Miami feel. My wife and I had a great time losing our money there, but an even better time winning it al back right before we left. This is a gem on the strip. Most people do not know about the remodel or the quick cocktail service. The only negative, and it is not even a negative about the Trop, is the area you need to walk through to get from the middle of the strip to the Trop. Between the Plant Hollywood and the MGM there is a stretch of Las Vegas Blvd that is a little shady at 3am. We did it one night then decided that was enough and got a bus pass.

The hotel is very close to the airport and we paid 15 dollars for the cab ride as the driver decided to take the long way. It should not cost that much. We booked our stay at the Tropicana over three months in advance since we saw a crazy deal for $144.51 for four nights tax included. Based on the reviews we contacted Nicole Marshall to verify our reservation and get a room with two beds in the Paradise Tower which is near the strip and front entrance. We were very dismayed to upon check in to find out our room was in the Island Tower. The desk clerk said there were no rooms with two beds available in the Paradise Tower. So much for booking ahead of time. The last thing we wanted to do after walking all day on the strip was to walk another two blocks just to get to our hotel room. The room was very nice and looks just like the photos on the hotel website. The beds are very comfortable and we had no issues with the room except the location. The casino is bright and cheerful instead of dingy like it used to be. Its nice to gamble in and the drink service was better at night than during the day or early evening. We knew about the slot promotion so we decided to get a card but the line up was long so we got one later after losing a lot of money in the slots and never bothered using it. We asked for a coffee maker and did receive a Keurig coffee maker and all the stuff to make coffee with which was good. We knew about the resort fee which is $9.99 per day plus 8% tax and did not feel we got anything of value for paying it as we didn't go to Vegas to sit by the pool. We never ate anything at the hotel as the dining options were expensive. We spent most of our time at Planet Hollywood seeing shows and eating at the buffets so probably after wasting time walking back and forth we should of just stayed at Planet Hollywood which has no resort fee. We looked at the sky high menu prices of all the Tropicana restaurants and it would be nice if there was at least some specials in the restaurants. We don't want to eat greasy fast food but a restaurant with reasonable prices and we probably would of stayed gambling more at the hotel. I know we gambled enough at Planet Hollywood because we were there eating most of the time. Its a nice hotel and I would recommend staying there at least once while its new but I don't think I would stay there again.

I've been many times but never stayed at the Tropicana. After reading many reviews and reading about all the changes, I was curious. I was able to get a great deal which included airfare and 4 nights at the Trop (through Expedia). There were a few issues. I had read about the bathroom floor tiles being old and some were dirty/chipped, so I expected it. Too bad that they renovated the washrooms and didn't bother to replace the floors, looks bad. Also the bathroom doors are very old, knob was very old looking and the door itself was dirty and looked like it needed to be painted. The bathtub and shower is ok, but they have one of those curved shower curtain rods, with only one curtain. So if you leave the curtain on the outside of the tub while showering, water gets all over the bathroom floor. And if you leave it on the inside of the tub, the curtain slowly starts to open at both ends and you still end up getting water all over the bathroom floor. This should be fixed, very poor design. I ended up having to request extra bath towels so we could cover the floor near the tub. We arrived late at night and the only place to eat was at Cafe Nikki. We were too tired to start walking around the strip to look for other food options. It wasn't very busy at Cafe Nikki but we still had to wait for a table due to the fact that they didn't have enough servers. The late night menu was very limited, compared to the regular menu. It took a long time to get our food, and when we got it, it was average. The dressing on the caesar salad was below average, I'd say. The people who work there are friendly and generally nice, they try their hardest to please. Currently there aren't a lot of options for food, but they are working on a Starbucks and a marketplace with casual food/fast food. One day I wanted a latte and I asked at Cafe Nikki where I could get one. I was told that I could order one at their bar (inside Cafe Nikki), so I did. They use Starbucks products, but I paid a lot more than what I would have paid for that same latte had I gone to a Starbucks (over $2 more!). The room was nice and clean. We had a view of the strip, which was nice. The flat screen tv is nice, but there's not a great selection of channels. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it wasn't a big deal. The pool that is open, was nice. I understand they are working on a large beach-style pool area, called Nikki Beach, which is supposed to be really nice. I like that the casino isn't huge. It does get busy but you can still get around easily (unlike at some of the bigger hotels/casinos). I also appreciate that once you enter the front door, the elevators are close by (for the Paradise Tower). You don't have to walk through miles and miles of smoke-filled casino to get to your room. When you first arrive, there are stairs to get up into the lobby. We asked about that and were directed to the right, where there is a ramp to get in. I don't remember seeing any signs directing us to the ramp though. There were usually one or two bellmen at the front doors who would open the doors for some guests, but at times there was no staff around or they were busy talking to each other. When my mother and I got inside, we were greeted by more stairs, on the left side, where the registration desks are. We asked the bellman to help us with our bags, which he did. We were later told that there is also a ramp (to the right of the front desk). It can get noisy outside at night, and we did hear sirens on a few occasions. In all my previous stays (at MGM, Mandalay Bay, Treasure Island) I don't remember hearing as much outside noise. Also, the construction that is still going on (on the outside of the property), started at 6:00 am. Our room was on the 9th floor, and we were able to hear it, although it wasn't bad enough to keep us awake. We gambled and ate at some of the other casinos on the strip and mostly just slept at the Trop. As far as some reviewers who mentioned that there is mostly an older crowd at the Trop, I don't agree. We saw quite a mix of people, ranging from their 20's all the way up to 60's/70's. I think a lot of the younger people are seeing what a good value this hotel is, and are giving it a chance. Overall, the rooms are clean and the beds are super comfy. Water pressure in the shower is good once you turn the dial on the showerhead to the 'massage' setting. Bathrooms could be better, but they are still decent. Tip: bring your own bath soap because they don't have any, just hand soap and a shower gel (I'm not a fan of shower gel and theirs did not have a great scent). Carpets everywhere are new, and the hotel staff are all very friendly and willing to help when necessary. It's on the south end of the strip but easy to get anywhere. We tried the bus ('the duece') and for $5 you get a 2 hour pass, or for $7 you get a 24 hour pass. There are stops at most of the hotels. The bus is a bit on the slow side because of all the stops it makes and how many people get on and ask questions, etc, so not a good option if you're in a hurry.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cGood Location on South Strip\u201d", "Author": "WardCleaver", "ReviewID": "UR102567658", "Content": "We stayed for two nights during Spring break.

The bed was awewome. Service was pretty good. We ate at the Nikki cafe which was good food and also the Biscayne which was a nice expereince. I didn't find that they were overpriced, they were comparable to every other place in Vegas as far as I could see. We were able to get a late checkout until 3.00 but our friends staying in the paradise tower in a standard room weren't. The smell when you entered was actually very nice, not too overpowering. The music in Nikki cafe I thought was crap, definately for a younger crowd. The band in the casino was awesome. Overall I would definately stay again, however would probably try something more central. The resort fee definately is a pain, I had to do my own boarding pass which was a pain as I couldn't figure it out at first and no one was around to help. The internet was quick in the room.

We went to see Recycled Percussion while we were there (thanks Nicole), also a fantastic show I highly recommend it. I want to preface by saying that I have previously stayed at Caesar's, The Mirage, and the Wynn. I think the Trop culd be competitive with these properties, except they need more restaurants/coffee shops. We found ourselves leaving the property every morning to grab coffee and a bite elsewhere. Which usually meant we would do our gambling elsewhere. Location is a bit south but we enjoyed the walk, so that was not a problem. The location of the Paradise Tower was fantastic at the end of a long day. Gambling at the Trop is tight in the day and loosens up at night. The only problem we really had was at check-in. We were early (around 11:30AM) so understandably our room wasn't ready yet, but the bellman suggested we go try the front desk anyways. The guy behind the front desk (Terry) was very rude how he told us we were too early to check in. No smile No hello. Just rude. He told us to come back at 2pm for checkin. Well, at 2pm the checkin line was huge and after waiting over 30 minutes, luck of the draw we got Terry again. Even ruder than the first time, saying he told us we were wasting time and that we could not checkin until after 3PM! We reminded him that he told us 2pm and that we just waited so long in line, and that tons of people were being checked in in front of us, we saw them leaving with their keycards. So finally he brushed us off and said come back in half an hour and just come straight to him and we won't have to wait in line. When 3:15 came around we made eye contact with him and approached the desk as he was finishing up with someone, he took off in back and then we saw him slip onto the casino floor leaving us hanging. Thankfully the line was shorter now and we were checked in by Evie who was a doll. Tropicana if you are reading this, so something about Terry!

We flew in late from MSP and were exhausted after getting through the airport and picking up our rental car. When we arrived at the Tropicana, we easily found parking in their covered parking lot. There was absolutely no line at the desk to check in and 3 people available to help us. This trip was for my 30th birthday, and our first time in Vegas, so we wanted it to be special. We asked if they had any rooms available with a King sized bed. The woman at the desk was trying to be helpful and look up rooms, but she wasn't sure what to do so she called over her manager, Thomas, who quickly found us an incredible suite on the 19th floor. He also bought us dinner at Cafe Nikki, which was delicious and completely unexpected. When we finally made it up to our suite, the view of the strip was amazing. Yes, it was a bit of a walk to Paradise Tower, but completely worth it to stay in such a luxurious room. The bed was huge and incredibly comfortable. The $10 per night resort fee was completely worth it for use because we used the internet every single day. The bathroom was large & our sitting room with mini bar & fridge was very nice also. The alarm clock with radio & ipod player was a nice touch. Our only complaint about this room was that the TV in the bedroom did not work at all! There must have been something wrong with the connection because the picture came through all fuzzy. We ordered room service from Cafe Nikki one night after returning from Arizona on a day trip and it was very fast and tasty. The casino itself was very nice, a little on the smallish side, but that was almost refreshing after walking through the MGM casino atleast 20 times to get to the shuttle. We played a ton of blackjack late night/early morning and the dealers were very friendly and nice and even waved at us a few times when we were just passing through. I also LOVED the slight coconut scent that seemed to infiltrate the entire casino and hotel. I don't know how they did it, but we loved it. The tropical music was fun as well. We regret that we did not get to experience the Mob Show, but next time for sure! It was fun to see the characters walking around the hotel. The renovations did not bother us at all, probably because we were so high up and couldn't even hear them. The pool area will be amazing once they have it finished. All in all, we easily gave everything about this hotel 5 stars. From the minute we walked in the door of the Tropicana, everyone on staff helped make our trip unforgettable.

I am, frankly, puzzled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. It ain't that great....by Vegas standards. First, note that the hotel room, while recently \"remodeled\" is pretty much your standard 1956 Holiday Inn room. It was two beds, a TV and a phone. No fridge, no microwave, none of the modern trappings you might find in pretty much any two and a half star hotel near the freeway. The bathroom was a similar 1956 style. The \"remodelling\" consists of new bedding and new wallpaper. There were new sinks in the bathroom, but the shower was the standard tub with shower like one might have at home in the basement bathroom. Nothing glamorous about this place. The rooms were relatively clean--although it took until 6 p.m. to get maid service. Some folks are picky about dirty tile grout; if so, you won't like this place. The tile is all original to the building. And is dirty. That's a picky point, but when the selling point is the $80million rehab... Some folks have raved about the service here; I would comment on it if I actually got any. The luggage help was non-existant, and no one was at the door to even point us to the front desk. The hotel restaurants are OK, service there just OK, but the prices are gigantic. You cannot get breakfast here for under $16.00. Beer at the bars: $9. Shot of tequila: $14. There are a couple of specialty restaurants on the Mezzanine level, one steak/seafood, the other Italian. Those are also Vegas-expensive and forgettable. Now, about the Casino. Suffice it to say that this is NOT the HIP casino on the strip. It is more like the \"hip replacement\" casino. The casino is VERY small, and in three nights playing there I never once saw anyone screaming that they won...the slot games are dated and old. There were only a very few card tables. Most of our group went elsewhere to gamble. This same group stayed at Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, on our last trip. This hotel and casino is the polar opposite of that. Would I stay here again? If I needed a cheap place to stay, yes. If I were looking for a luxurious Vegas experience, no. The primary reason to stay here is price. You get a plain-jane 1956 era hotel room that has had recent paint and bedding changes. No glitz. No glamour.

They then had a replacement fridge moved in before I had even finished unpacking! We were on the 20th floor and the hot water for the shower/tub was almost instantaneous -- I don't have if they have a boiler or a booster on that floor, but it was impressive. We both ate at the Nikki several times and quite enjoyed it (although we found it was quite noisy in the evenings on the weekend). We did not try the Biscayne or the Bacio and the Ocean Deli (Beach Deli?) was closed for renovations. As it was my birthday, we were given the 'Romance Package' free of charge, which was very nice. There was a slight glitch, however, as I had asked that it be delivered around 8:30 in the evening when we returned from supper and instead it was delivered at 3:30 in the afternoon, before I even got back from my conference meetings and so caught my wife somewhat off guard! The pool was not yet open when we were there (unfortunate, as there was a heat spell and the temperatures were in the high seventies to low eighties) but it certainly looks like it will be one of the better pools in LA when it is ready.

While waiting outside for our cab at the airport, we could actually see the sign for our casino. However, the cab ride there was about $22! I forgot to tell him to take a certain way there that I had read on the internet (not that I even know if he took that way or not) but let's just say that the cab ride back to the airport was $10! We got to the check-in counter at around 9:30PM and up to our rooms in about 10 minutes tops. The check-in was efficient, the lady at the counter was polite, and we had no problems finding our room. The hotel is relatively easy to navigate through and the only place we did find difficult to find from our room in the towers was the pool because of the lack of signs. We could see it from our room, we knew where it was when we got near it, but we didn't know which door to take to get to it. We often found that at most hotels, they want you to get lost. One could easily take out their frustration (money) on a slot machine! The rooms have been recently remodelled and so they do not look as dated as the lobby - very modern. The shutters are beautiful AND hide the lights, both at night and during the day. The beds are very high and comfortable and we were able to fall asleep with ease. The only complaint I have about the sleeping conditions is the construction happening just outside our window. They are now in their third phase of construction on the hotel and it just so happened to be right below us. It wasn't THAT bad, and the guys worked very hard at it all day long, but I did wake up a couple of mornings from the banging. Problem solved by buying ear plugs the next day at the pharmacy. There were some window washers one morning at 9am and again, it's their job, but it would have been nice to see them at the window a little bit later. We never really saw the maid but she was always there to make our beds and fold our towels for us. My blow dryer didn't work the first day and she was quick to replace it when I left a note and a couple of dollars. I was very appreciative. The casino here was relatively small compared to the bigger places, but we enjoyed this because those long walks everywhere else tired us out! There were always enough slots, and the centre tables were pretty busy at most times of the day. My friend went up to a \"Let it ride,\" table and asked the dealer to teach her and he had no problem helping her out. We went to see \"Recycled Percussion,\" which was located right near the entrance of the hotel, and it was fantastic! There were also people walking around advertising the \"Mob Experience\" show and we would have loved to check that out but there wasn't enough time. We went swimming on the second last day and the temperature was great, the pool was busy, and the life guards/supervisors were very friendly. Only half of the pool was open due to the renovations but that was the side that got the sun at the end of the day! We ate at Cafe Nikki the last morning and had a nice meal before our flight. They had a breakfast buffet for $16.99 and the food seemed to look very good. I had oatmeal with dried fruits and it was delicious and cost $7.00. Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to friends. We got it for a great price and I'd be excited to go back and see how the outdoor renovations turned out.

The lady at the VIP check-in asked for a credit card and I gave her my visa to which she sighed and said the money would be taken out of the account because the card is hooked up to a checking account. So, my friend gave her a credit card. I understand she probably has to explain this to alot of people but it was a bad first impression. On the way to the room, me and Carri talked about how rude she was. The room looked good, standard 2 bed. Very clean. But there's no microwave, no coffee maker and no fridge (oh, unless you ask for one ahead of time and then it's $20. a night). This made things hard if you're trying to keep drinks in your room and snacks. We kept things in bags of ice in the bathroom. By the way the ice bucket is very small- so, you'll be making many trips to the ice machine. And we never got to use the coffee we bought for our stay. After partying all night, we got back to the room and noticed the bottom lock would not lock. It would not turn over. So, we only had the latch lock on top. It was 6:30am and all we wanted to do was go to sleep. I called the operator to tell her so that maybe they could fix the lock the next day. I told her, we have a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door but I just want to make sure that housekeeping doesn't come into the room. She instited to have maintence check it out. We waited. I called the operator and they said \"they will be there in 3 minutes\". We waited. Now I was getting mad, this was the 3rd phone call I had to make when all I wanted was for them to not disturb us!!! The man on the phone said \"would you like to be moved to a different room tomorrow?\" and I said I guess so. We were never moved to a different room.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with smiles and positive attitudes. The moment we pulled up to the front door until the moment we checked out we were treated like VIP, although we were just there for one night, it didn't seem to matter to the hotel staff. The hotel staff made us feel like our business was truly appreciated and they wanted us to have the best experience possible within the hotel. I have to say, walking in through the glass doors and into a bright environment with the white marble floors and colorful decorations was refreshing. It really started the mood for the whole trip. As we walked to the front desk, which is less than 60' from the hotel entrance, which is awesome, I didn't feel lost not knowing where the front desk was. The first thing that really impressed me was the friendly front desk clerk that engaged in conversation with us. The check-in to the hotel process was a smooth and easy. We have stayed in Vegas hotels many times and I am one that gets impatient while in hotel check-in lines. Not the case at the Tropicana. We were not in line for more than 5 minutes before we were checking in to our beautiful suite. Our room was immaculate! We had a suite which we were told was just refurbished through a hotel renovation. I have to say, I was truly impressed with the decor and comfort that our suite offered. Our friends were staying at another hotel, the MGM, they came over to our room and and their jaws dropped as they walked through the door saying, \"we got ripped off, your suite is amazing!\" I have never stayed in a hotel in Vegas that I didn't wake up the next morning with back pain from a very uncomfortalbe bed. I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed, no back pain and ready for day two in Vegas. I would truly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas.

The hotel is being renovated, but it's still very pleasant and will be even more so when the work has been completed. The restaurants were quite satisfactory. Cafe Nikki provided a nice breakfast brunch. Foodies should check out the prix fixe at Biscayne for dinner; on the night I went, I had a choice between Ostrich Tenderloin and Seared Bronzino for main courses, along with suitable wine pairings. As of March 2011, the pool was a work in progress, but was already lovely, with a sloping green lawn and plantings leading down to an art deco shaped pool surrounded by chaises and cabanas. The casino has white walls, which makes it a little brighter than the usual cave-like Vegas gambling den. The waitress came around twice during the time I was playing slots, and like everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The room was terrific, recently renovated in soothing desert colors. There was no minibar, but ice and soda machines are available in the hallway. The only reason I'm assigning 4 stars instead of 5 is that I requested a view of the Strip, but instead was given a room facing the rear of the building, with a view of about 1000 acres of parking lots and the airport in the distance. Also, when I checked in I was told that the hotel didn't have a room of the type I'd reserved available at the time, so I was going to be upgraded to a suite, and then moved after 2 nights when a King room became available. Therefore I had to wait around on day 3 to check with the front desk, and then pack, move to a new room and unpack for a second time. While all these machinations didn't totally destroy day 3, they didn't make it any better either. But when I told the front desk staff person that the room change was disruptive, she immediately waived the resort fee, which made me feel a little better. While it still isn't clear to me why a room that was reserved two months in advance, and then confirmed by telephone two days before check in, wasn't available upon arrival, it all worked out. And everything else was great. The hotel has a really cool, laid back, relaxed Miami feel, with white walls and marble floors in the public areas. The restaurants are good and more are coming.

I'm aware of this issue with cards hence, I always kept it in my pocket far from anything the might demagnetize the card. Plus both our cards didn't work.

After booking it we saw some good reviews and some bad reviews. That is just typical on here. All in all to start off: we are not picky people! All in all we like a clean room to sleep in! So we arrived on February 21 and staying for about 8 nights. We had delayed flights so we were a little on edge and tired. We pulled up to the Tropicana and were super impressed of the new renovations from the outside! We haven't been here since 2009 and no offense it was a major dump than! So this was a good start pulling up. Everyone was super nice and polite from holding doors open for us, trying to help us with our luggage, straight through to the check in process! Its bright and lively when you walk in and its CLEAN! :) The walk for us didnt bother us at all. We wanted the exercise anyways. We were put on the 4th floor. Decent. So I walked into the room and told my husband not to touch anything. ( I use to be a housekeeper in my younger days) lol The odor hit me in the face and I knew right there something wasnt right! To keep this section short and sweet : lets just say that they shut the door and forgot to finish cleaning that one! ... BAD! Even though to some that seems horrible the ladies at the front desk promptly changed me to a mini suite down the hall! I told them I would get the key myself so I didnt have to wait 20 min for someone to come up. NO BIG DEAL! They were nice and very apologetic! This room was a lot better. Corner suite with an ok view. 10 minutes goes by and the front desk called us to make sure everything was ok! A+ in my book for checking in with us! We went to Nikki's cafe for a bite to eat which we had wonderful service late at night there! bar tender -- forgot his name-- gave us great ideas for our trip, talked with us and was super friendly!! A+ We went to the fitness center which was ok! I didnt realize how many people are on vacation working out! Until I was here and people were waiting in line to use equipment. If any recommendations can be made; I would suggest adding another treadmill / elliptical or two. This is what people were waiting for while I was there during my visit! Along with adding an additional water cooler, and more towels. Everything was out and it was usually only 8 am when we went!!! Housekeeping was ok, several days I think she forgot that we use towels to shower and soap as well, so we used the one that was still left! Other than that was good. All in all the tropicana is a great place to stay. Good service and it seems they are always willing to help or improve if anything needs it! I just wished that we were placed at the other end of the building. Unfortunately our room was right under the construction site! YIKES!!!! I was up every morning at the crack of dawn hearing \"BEEP BEEP BEEP, BOOM BOOOM CRASH CRASH!!!!!!\" Ear plugs worked well! Didnt take the smell of the demolition away though. Again pretty easygoing people, so we really grinned and barred that situation trying to take into consideration that they are fixing things. Wasn't too thrilled of sleeping like that though for my anniversary trip! Oh Sunday was an amazing sleep in day! Of course no construction workers! :) Again nice and can't wait to see what else they do with it!

My father was actually booked for Monday the 7th and Rose made sure that we would have connecting rooms. My brother also was booked for Monday the 7th and we were all on the same floor. We were also able to check in early. Like the airlines(with there added fees), hotels are adding a so called resort fee. At the Tropicana that fee is 9.99 per day plus tax, which allows you to use all the Hotel's ammenities. I'd rather they just add it to the room cost so you know right up front what your total cost will be. You basically have to pay that fee. Because it was my Dad's 80th when i went to check us out Rose waived that fee for my Dad's suite. As far as I'm concerned Rose went above and beyond. I will definetly stay @ The Tropicana again. There were a couple of negatives that hopefully will be resolved when they complete thier remodle. (1) There wasn't a lot of options for reasonable priced food. I'm sorry but $16.99 for breakfast buffet is not a deal.I understand they are building a marketplace with various food options . Also I when I ordered a coke @ the bar I was charged $4.00 which is fine if you can get refills, I was told no refills. (2) While the TV's are new and a great picture the delay is crazy and needs to be resolved, also it is not real user friendly .

Had a fantastic stay from the moment we arrived. Check in was quick and easy and Melanda (check in) gave us a corner room which is slightly bigger and overlooks the strip to Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, New York New York and MGM. Thanks Melanda. The rooms are fresh and bright and the beds very comfortable. My room was in the Island Tower which alot of people on this website are saying in their reviews is a ridiculous walk from the front desk. Well that's ridiculous. The only way this walk is a problem is if you're an invalid or more than 20 stone (300 lb). It's not very long at all. Some people just need something to complain about. Also, there are 6 elevators serving the Island Tower so you never have to wait long for one. The casino floor, although probably the smallest on the strip from what I saw, is clean and bright. Not like the rest of the hotel casinos, you can actually tell whether it's night or day. Not dark and dingey. All the staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant and helpful. Yes, there is construction work ongoing but this doesn't bother or affect any of the guests. The pool area looks like it will be great when it's finished, which I was told will be around the start of April. I didn't eat at all in the hotel so I can't comment on the quality of the restaurants. I did read the menus and the prices seem to be consistant with the restaurant prices all along the Strip. When I stayed, the hotel didn't offer a breakfast buffet which seem very popular with holiday makers, including my wife and I, but it's a very short walk to other hotels that do offer breakfast buffets, (The Cosmipolitan's is the best by a long way). I went to the car hire desk to get a car for the following day and when I went down next morning to collect the car, it wasn't ready so got a free upgrade to one that was, so was able to drive out to see Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon in a convertible Mustang.

If you're looking for a large casino in your hotel, the Trop is not the place for you. It has probably the smallest casino (by a long shot) on the strip, but it is probably the brightest and best smelling (if you're bothered by smoke filled casinos). They really pump the tropical air freshner into this place! We stayed in the Garden Tower, which is a good bit of a walk to the southeast of the main part of the hotel, through a long hallway, with the pool areas on both sides. Speaking of the pool area, it is all still under renovation and probably will be until at least April. Of course, that's about the time it would normally be opened up, so it shouldn't be too much of a big deal. They have renovated the rooms and I was very impressed with the cleanliness and bed. Also, be aware that you are charged an additional $10/night in addition to the regular room rate for a resort fee, which during the winter months amounts to nothing more than \"free\" internet. Bottom line: If you want a lower priced, but very clean and casual room that's within close walking distance to all of the casinos on the south side of the strip (right across the street from MGM, Excalibur, and New York New York, with very easy access to all), this is a very good choice.

We had a group of approximately 25 people come to stay at your hotel for a wedding. The bride is very detail-oriented (as she should be, it was HER wedding). She planned out everything, talked to your staff countless times and after all that, we show up to...excuse my profanity, a $#@% show. There is one easy way to remedy this. May cost you some money up front but in the long run, it may just work: Could you all maybe get the same computer system? So when Thomas at the front desk says that all the tuxes will be taken care of, the lady in the tux shop knows this? Or when Alaina(I believe thats her name) says it would be more than okay for us to store our hand made food w/ room service...when we called them they wouldnt answer, so I had to go to the bell check(?) desk and THEY couldnt even get a hold of room service. To the bell desks credit, they let me store the 2nd round of food in their break room refrigerator. (By the way, these promises were made due to room screw ups, etc) I am not writing this to be rude. I am not asking for anything free. I am pregnant and could be doing a lot of other important things w/ my time. I am typing this in a frenzy because maybe the next wedding party you have there wont have to endure the same problems(I didnt even get into all we went through). We do have mutual friends getting married there in May and I was told by a friend who was present w/ me at the wedding that shes already informed them to cancel their reservations w/ The Tropicana and go elsewhere. My friend, the bride, spoke w/ the vice-president of Tropicana when we got back and he couldnt have been more rude. Really unnecessary in my book. Also, we live in a fairly small community(but a college town, nonetheless) full of service industry workers, white collar, blue collar, trust funders, etc. To your vice president, what Callie had to say didnt matter one bit. Here, before we even stepped foot back in Montana, everyone knew about The Tropicana. On a high note, the room my husband and I stayed in was nice and clean. We took quite a bit of money from your casino, that was a plus. Alaina (again, I think that was the managers name~pretty, long dark hair), was very nice. Thomas was very nice, the day he was working. Too bad none of them ever worked more than one day in a row...which is where your computer system would come in handy! Imagine being able to type in a room # and know whats gone on w/ that room, what needs to happen, what was told to the guest, etc. If you have that capability, it was never used, and that is truly unfortunate. There are so many places to stay in Vegas. Obviously, individual business doesnt hold much weight in the eyes of The Tropicana. People will continue to book reservations w/ you, and you will continue to look at your year end numbers and not wonder what you can do to make someones experience the best it can be(for your price range). We know we didnt book at The Bellagio. No one in our party has champagne taste on a beer budget. Just stop promising things you cant follow through with.

Picked the hotel because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and the reasonable price. Check in was was quick. There were no long lines like we saw at other hotels. Rose at the Front Desk could not have been nicer or more professional. It was our anniversary, so she upgraded us to the 21st floor of the Paradise Tower. (Try to get a room at the Paradise Tower, if you are able.) I tried to leave her a tip, but she refused to take it, saying it was not necessary. It was the perfect start to our vacation. Thank you Rose. The room was new, very clean and had a nice view. Our luggage arrived moments after we reached the room; he even brought us a bucket of ice and answered some of our questions. The room was kept clean daily and twice we had turn down service in the evening, including a bar of chocolate and a bottle of water. Since we did not expect this, it was a nice touch. We even got a little hand written \"thank you\" note from the maid on the last day. The Tropicana seems to pride itself on its new image. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Customer Service was beyond our expectations. We saw almost none of it at any of the other places we visited, except, of course, from people trying to sell you something. Upon entering or leaving the hotel, we were always greeted with a smile and an open door. We are not big gamblers so we only played the penny slots for a short time. We were asked if we wanted drinks twice. The hotel is very convenient and the monorail is right next door at the MGM Grand. Also, it is very bright and the cigarette smoke is not overwhelming, as it was in many of the hotels. If you are looking for a nice, clean, new room and a friendly staff, this is the place to be. If you are looking for something else, Vegas has plenty of options. One problem was that are only a few restaurants, but we were told that more are on the way. We cannot wait to visit again once they have finished construction.

I did book at the last minute (a night before) and I can see why there was a vacancy. Check-in was quick and the staff seemed nice, but right away we realized the \"Island Tower\" where we were appointed was really like walking to an Island. The walk from the entrance to our the elevator was a very long one. Our FIRST room was on the 18th floor at the end of the hallway. My husband inserted our room key and two young men were sitting on the bed and watching tv. We were shocked and I'm sure they were caught by surprise as well. One of them comes out and lets us know there was a mix up with the room and the bellhop was due any minute to bring them their new key and take them to their new room. They quickly got their bags and left us in the room. Needless to say we both felt kind of uncomfortable that two complete strangers had already been in our room for who knows how long. At first, we decided to make the best of it and just chalk it up to bad luck. That was until I went to the bathroom and saw the dirty bathroom floor. When I mean dirty I mean PUBIC HAIR on the floor, dusty, and what looked like to me haphazardly (if even) swept/mopped. I guess they don't expect people to walk barefoot in it or at least that's how it was cleaned. That really pissed me off and my Husband and I decided to call the front desk for another room. They apologize and say they will send a bellhop up to give us a new key. While waiting, the previous bellhop comes knocking for the previous \"tenants\" room key. We were annoyed, but finally we get a new key. My husband tells the bellhop that because of their mistake we're now late. He continues walking away and says, \"I'm just here to bring your key, I don't know\". Anyways we get to our room on the 14th floor. Bathroom floor still dusty, but we're over the room situation and get ready to go out. We come back around 2am and after the long trek to our room realize that somehow the SECOND key is not being read and the door wont open. My husband calls the front desk and they say we'd have to pick it up because the only bellhop working is unable to take it to us. So we're tired as hell from walking and drinking the last 6 hours, but my poor husband has to make the trip back and forth. We didn't have enough energy to make it a big deal. PROS: Bed is comfy (most things are when drunk) Easy to find Close enough to a Monorail Station (MGM Grand) Flat screen TV (we probably watched 30 minutes total) Hotel/Casino looked clean CONS: Walk from lobby to Island Tower Staff was unhelpful Unorganized and understaffed No fridge", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ystrad Mynach", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "Orland0belle", "ReviewID": "UR97212130", "Content": "Stayed for 6 nights during the Rugby 7s last week - chose the Tropicana as it was one of the 'partner' hotels for the Rugby and we got a very good deal.

Beds & pillows were super comfy but the constant sirens, road & advertising noise from outside were not conducive to a good night's sleep. Rooms were a nice size ,well decorated and functional. Bathroom area was adequate, tiles were not new which seemed a little strange against the rest of the refurb going on. Toilet had a habit of 'running' continually and on occasion the shower took ages to heat up. Room was only cleaned 2 days out of 5, only once was a card left outside indicating that our room had been 'missed' due to us being in. As there was only me - it wasn't an issue as I had plenty of towels & did not make a mess. Loved the tropical smell in the corridors, hated the cigar/cigarette smoke everywhere else. Casino was light and not at all intimidating for a first timer, though we never once saw a cocktail waitress whilst playing. Great place to people watch. Ambah Lounge had a great atmosphere too. My real bug bear was the dining. Firstly no coffee makers in the rooms. If you are not going to provide the facility PLEASE provide somewhere to grab a cup in the morning!? Five times I trekked to the Island Tower coffee stand, only once was it open. No opening times posted, no 'back in 5 minutes' just the lights on but nobody home - very disappointing. Cafe Nikki - ate breakfast there one morning & were not made aware there was a breakfast buffet by hostess or server. Same thing happened at dinner, we overheard the server at the next table making reference to it after we had ordered. Aside from the restaurant the staff here were excellent, doormen, gift shop, even just walking around - everyone was friendly and approachable. Not particularly happy about the resort fee for no facilities either. We had 2 rooms and it cost us almost $130 for no pool, did not use phone or internet or fitness center or need boarding cards printed (which we mentioned at check in). Would I stay here again?

The \"long walk\" that everyone seems to complain about is not really that bad. My opinion is that elderly persons and persons with disabilities should get first shot at the Paradise Tower. Seriously, after all the walking a person does in Vegas, the walk back to the Island Tower is nothing to complain about. The room was great. It was nice to have so much \"new\" and the bed was very comfortable. The room wasn't anything fancy, just very nice. The bathroom, while not remodeled, was also something that wasn't worth complaining about. It was large, clean, and had good hot water. I had to fix the chain in my toilet to keep it from running all night, but again no biggie. All of the (hotel) staff went out of their way to be helpful. Housekeeping/ room service/ front desk/ doormen-- all of these contacts were extremely positive. As for the tropical odorant-- I was really looking forward to this as it is one of my favorite scents. I'm not sure it is going to work, though. I think it is because of it mixing with the odor of smoke in the casino, but every time I walked in the door, it smelled like-- hate to say it, but, farts. The sports book-- I have to have a good sports book at my Vegas hotel-- was a complete catastrophe. I have probably visited 90% of the sports books in Vegas, and I am always my happiest when there. Now I know that Tropicana's is a brand new operation, but every single experience I had at this one was a mess! The people did not know what they were doing, they had terrible hours (don't want to hear about the construction, they have a remote station but didn't open this at the promised time, either). I could go on and on with the negatives, but I'm getting mad and I don't want to. My friend and I took most of our gaming business elsewhere because of this. Also, I contacted Nicole Marshall by e-mail prior to my visit to ask two simple questions. After not getting a response in two weeks ( gave her the benefit of the doubt, I know weird things happen in cyber-space) I very carefully typed in her address again and waited patiently. No response. I mentioned in the email that I got her name from TripAdvisor, so I thought she would be motivated to respond. Because so many people on here sing her praises, I would say that my biggest disappointment in the Tropicana would be that she didn't respond to my simple questions. So, overall, worth going to the Tropicana. Steer way clear of the sports book.

Great new comedy venue (Brad Garrot), spelling of his name?, and great shows at the Tropicana. Bad 1. No cafe or coffee shop, breakfast not our favorite meal, do not like to spend $15 for a buffet at the Niki for coffee and something light. Long trek to the MGM (casino I hate due to the heavily perfumed odor and sheer size), each morning for coffee and food. If you go now you will have this problem - they plan to add a deli and cafe. 2. Uneven maid serivce - don't get it, although I did not alter my usual daily tip. 1st night I had to call for service the floor, tub and sink in the bathroom were dirty. Not just a little bit - hair all over the floor, countertop, in the tub. When you see that, you wonder about what you don't see. It appeared the beds and living room area were clean and comfortable. 3. Maid service - one day left one wash cloth, one day no bath mat? 4. The $10 a day charge for amenities that do not exist - no pool, no spa, we did not use the phone or internet. The charge was waived for the couple we traveled with - by the way I picked the hotel. When checking out they were asked how was the internet, they did not use it and the charged was waived. We were charged. Frankly if they had a coffee shop I'd paid $10 a day for it! 5. The highly promoted Mob experience is not open and the preview is just gift shop with a few small to scale models. Overall - we loved it, and we and the other couple are returning next year.

The hotel has been decorated to a lovely standard. The casino is lively and the public areas are clean and airy. We were in Paradise Tower on the 14th floor and I was impressed , it appeared to have been updated recently although I suspect that bathroom was still to be updated as the grouting was stained, some tiles chipped and the general design did not seem to go with the rest of the room. But it was clean. The bed was lovely I felt like I was being wrapped in snuggleness whenever I got into it and had no problem falling asleep. I found the Tropicana to be a real oasis, initially I was disappointed that I had not booked a 'themed' hotel however after traipsing through other hotels I appreciated that generally the Tropicana had guests and not just tourists hanging around it which I preferred. I also liked the fact that I did not have to spend 20 minutes walking from the car park, through shops and casinos get to my room. It was perfect. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food. During a week stay there are likely to be a few problems wherever you stay and we encountered a couple which were quickly rectified. During our first night and exhausted from travelling we had problems with noise from our neighbouring room. It sounded like high spirits but it was late, I couldn't sleep through it so contacted the front desk Within 5 minutes security attended and the late night revellers quietened down. After a few days the air con did not seem to be working as well as it had . A call to the front desk had this quickly sorted out. I really would recommend staying at the Tropicana. It's a great location and as it was not high season the roads were not too busy and we were able to drive around really easily. There is self parking available in all the hotels and we found this the easiest way to get around in the evening if we were heading to the north Strip or freemont. During the day we tended to walk, good exercise! Our trip coincided with the Super bowl and the hotel was extremely busy.

I stayed at the Trop my first trip to Vegas 17 years ago and it was a dump and i swore never to stay there again. However i was impressed by the changes and decided to give them a shot. it was a mixed bag. I made my reservation 6 weeks in advance and approximately one week after I sent Nicole Marshall an e-mail. Never heard from her, not even a thank you for your e-mail. I was ensured I would have a paradise tower room when i made my reservation. Check in: Arrived 7 PM on a Friday evening and was greeted by a somewhat stand offish reservation clerk. She checked me in and when I seen I was in the Island tower i voiced my displeasure. She stated rather coldly that is the room that was reserved for you. When I asked if i could be switched she said sorry we are sold out.( I booked directly with the hotel not some third party sight). After shlepping all the way to the island tower I realized the room would not work due to the airport noise. I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. they gave me the supervisor who was an extremely nice young man. He explained I was given the Island Tower because I requested a king and he could put me in the Paradise in a double Queen if that was acceptable. I stated yes and schlepped all the way back to the front desk. I will say it was a quick transfer as he had the key waiting and just handed it to me. The Room: Very nice, extremely clean and comfortable. Quiet also. rooms are pretty sound proof here. Could of used an additional lamp but no biggie. Cafe Nikki, had the Buffet one morning and the Oatmeal and Eggs were cold. I offered feedback to the Manager Justin and made it very clear i was not complaining just passing along some observations. He comped my Buffet despite my insisting to pay. I returned the next morning and had the Breakfast from the Menu. Excellent. I will say the Buffett has one of the absolute best fruit selections i have ever seen. Each morning I would make the long walk to the coffee stand in the Island tower until I learned on my last day you can buy coffee in cafe Nikki. They have a walk up station at the front of the bar. Will Definitely do that next time. Aside from the check in lady all the employees at the Trop are extremely friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The dealers are great as are Door men Steve and Dean. Each morning I would stand out front with my coffee and chat with them. Sportsbook: Very nice, except for the vendor selling sports memorabilia at the entrance. Tacky Overall: I would absolutely stay at the Trop again. It is the best value for the money.

After reading some reviews on this site I emailed Nicole Marshall who is the hotel experience manager and explained that it was my wife\u2019s birthday and it was a surprise holiday for her and it was going to be our first time away and first time away without any kids. In the email I explained that I was a little disappointed that the pool was closed whilst we were there. Nicole quickly sent a reply explaining that the pool was closed due to it being winter but because of my disappointment she would waiver the resort fee. I felt that this in itself was a great gesture, but the email continued to say that due to it being my wife\u2019s birthday she would throw in 2 tickets free of charge to see Brad Garrets comedy club. (Which was an excellent show as I laughed from start to finish). When we arrived at the hotel there was a package for my wife which was a small birthday present which included the tickets for the show and also a las vegas photo frame and a pack of playing cards. Again what a nice gesture. After the first day me and my wife went back to the hotel for a shower, after she dried her hair she plugged in her hair strengtheners to find that they didn\u2019t work. We presumed that because they worked at home before we left that it must have been a problem with the electricity in the hotel so we contacted reception who said they would send an electrician. The electrician didn\u2019t turn up for a while so I said to my wife to go and get her hair straightened at the hotel salon whilst I waited for the electrician. When my wife came back she was furious as it cost her $45 just to straighten her hair. So we went down to reception to complain. The staff were great about it and gave us a $45 food and drinks voucher as a good will gesture. They then rang the electrician who stopped what he was doing and came to our room to see what the problem was. After checking every thing it was actually the hair strengtheners that didn\u2019t work. He took them away to try and fix them, but he didn't have the part to do so. He then rang the hotel manager to ask what he should do and the hotel actually went out and bought us some hair strengtheners for us to use whilst we stayed there. I\u2019ve never known a hotel to do so much to keep its customers happy. The room we stayed in was fantastic and I have never slept so well in any bed than I did in that one. The internet connection was extremely fast also. Also I have read a couple of reviews that said the cocktail waitresses never ask if you want a drink. In my experience that could not be further from the truth, I barely had sat down and they were there in a flash. We had the breakfast buffet in cafe nikki one morning and it was nice, but if you are going to eat there, please try Biscayne restaurant. The service and the food was excellent. I had the rib eye stake with mash potato of the moment and I can safely say it was the best meal I've ever had. My only regret was we ate there on the last night and I wish I tried it on the 1st. Overall it is the best hotel I've stayed in, especially for customer service and the for the cost of staying I would have still been as pleased if I\u2019d paid treble the price Thanks for an excellent experience Iain Gascoigne", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I expected!\u201d", "Author": "Love2Travel4931", "ReviewID": "UR95616067", "Content": "I stayed at the Trop during the SEMA Show.

We went for 5 days 4 nights with the thought he would be working two days and have two days to explore together. Well, he ended up working for all 5 days! When I read reviews of this hotel I was skeptical of what to expect with all the recent remodeling and the location on the strip. Some folks didn't like the fact that it was on one end of the strip. At the end near right next to the airport. The hotel sounded quite simple and nothing special. Our room was booked by his employer so obviously we stayed where they booked us. I have to say I was pleasantly suprised. This hotel was very clean and our room was wonderful. And the location turned out to be one of the better ones on the strip in my opinion. Yes, it was a bit noisy being so close to the airport, yet it was fun watching the planes take off and land all through the night and day. I enjoyed watching them. When we first checked in we requested a room with a king bed. The front desk gal, Victoria, was as nice and personable as she could be. However, after dragging our luggage the mile or so to our room (yes, we were too cheap to pay to have them brought to our room - I would recommend you have the bellman take your baggage up to your room as the walk to the north tower is quite a hike. Perhaps it is different if you are in the front tower where the elevators are next to the front door.) we entered to find two queen beds. So after a quick call to the front desk they told us to stay put and they would send up a bellman with a new key to another room which had a king bed. Not sure what we were getting ourselves into as the room we were in was nice and we hated to give it up, but we really wanted a king bed. We waited almost 45 minutes until finally a gentleman tapped on our door and gave us a new key card to another room up one floor. Yes, we dragged our luggage up to our new room not knowing what to expect. (the bellman did offer to help us, but we refused. ) Well, when we opened the door to our \"end of the hall ,corner unit\" room, we were both relieved to find an even better room then our first. This room, #1250 was a lovely room with a great view, in my opinion and perfect for our needs. It was a corner room with an extra sitting area with a panaramic view with 4 or 5 windows to look out. Our view was of different parking lots, a church, the airport with planes taking off and landing and a section of the strip and oh, did I mention parking lots? I suppose I would rather over look parking lots and a distance then a building directly infront of my window. The view was lovely at night looking across to the Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Exchaliber resorts across the strip or a.k.a. Route 15 North. Sunsets each night were to die for with the back drop of the mountains and the colors were amazing. Our room was perfect since I would be spending lot of time in it. Since my husband worked every day. I myself worked in the room for two days on my lap top and got quite a bit done. No problems hooking into the hotel's free wireless internet. And the reception was great in our room. The room was a lovely retreat to be confined to for two days. Their TV had a choice of music channels which were nice to utilize as I worked on my cell phone and computer. I enjoyed pampering myself and even ordered room service for lunch each day, The first time in my life and I have to say it was quite yummy, although I still have a hard time justifying my $38 and $59 lunch tabs. (Cesear salad with chicken, execellent black bean soup complete with two dinner rolls and two bottles of budweiser! ) I will say both times the waiters advised me that the tip was included. I appreciated their honesty and bringing this fact to my attention. The food was hot and arrived in a timely manner. The bed was quite comfortable and the pillows fluffy and fresh smelling. Our sheets were changed once during out stay. We had a rental car so loved the free parking. Which was included in the $9.99 daily resort fee. If you are a member of AAA , be sure to tell them so and this resort fee can be waived. Victoria waived ours once we mentioned that we were AAA members. The dissappointments were: The bathroom - Nothing to write home about. Simple corner type tub/shower combination. I would think for such a lovely room, the bathroom would have had a jetted tub or just been a bit more \"special\" or elegant looking. The hike to our room - Although our room was lovely, it was such a long walk out to the front door or casino. Only two dinner restaurants in the hotel, both are only open at night. No cheap easy places to get a quick bite to eat. Both inhouse specialty restaurants were expensive. Each had very few customers while we were staying. The 24 hour Cafe which we thought was less expensive was still pretty pricy for what you get and the food was not that good. ( Although I think this is the restaurant where my roomservice came from and that food was pretty good. hmm??) We tried the breakfast buffet our first morning and were very dissapointed. Oatmeal looked like wallpaper paste, eggs were cold, rubbery and tasteless, muffins and breads were stale and dry. No waffles or pancakes for my husband who doesn't eat anything with eggs in it. I think a bit over priced for what you get. At lease the coffee was tasty and our waiter was attentative. The high priced drinks and gift shop in the lobby. With all the interior smoking going on my allergies were acting up so I bought a small bottle of visine. Price wa $10.49! Also drinks were expensive - $6 for a bottle of budweiser. Cabs were very easy to obtain at each hotels main entrance there always seemed to be a supply waiting on hand. I felt the housekeeping staff was very pleasant. But other then those two women and my roomservice waiters, most other employees were not very friendly. This would included the front desk gals (with the exception of Victoria), the doormen and especially the bartenders. Bartenders didn't like giving you drinks for free whether you were playing the games or not. They also took their time to acknowledge your standing or sitting there. And they certainly didn't advise us of that Las Vegas tradition. We had to find out the\"Tricks\" in another hotel casino from a very friendly staff member there. Who explained the way the drinking and playing the games works in Vegas. Needless to say we gave that bartender a rather large tip for his helpful hints. The pool was closed as it was way too cold to swim during our visit. Still construction going on near the pool area and on the side of the resort where the two floor older resort stands. All in all I would recommend a stay here at the Tropicana. I took several walks down and up the strip and felt very comfortable walking around alone during the day and in the evening while my husband worked. I wondered for a couple of days by myself and worked in our room for a couple of days. I did a little shopping here and there and walked through several of the large lobbys of neighboring hotels by myself. I would say Las Vegas is definately a place everyone should see once in their life. Personallyl, not a place I would want to call home - but a fun place to visit just the same!

Setting forth the good and the bad.... THE GOOD Great location Good price The friendliest staff you can imagine (people are always smiling and seem generally happy to see you). The rooms are pretty large and very clean. THE BAD When I went to check-in they couldn't locate my reservation - I will chalk this up to Orbitz (who eventually helped sort things out) however it meant spending forever and a day in the check-in line. When I got to the room the air conditioning was broken the safe didn't work and I couldnt' access the internet. This was all taken care of the next morning however. In what was a good faith attempt to make up for the above, the hotel comped me breakfast one morning. I went to their Cafe Niki which was decidedly middle of the road. However, the interesting thing was that despite the fact the food was comped they did bring me a check. When I went to look it over I noticed that the prices on the check did not match at all the prices on their menu. When I complained they took care of things, after quickly shuffling me off in a corner. But I warn anyone - - MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL. This could easily have gone un-noticed and the difference was fairly substantial (30% of the price).

We could not find the fitness room to save our lives, so once again, we had to ask at the front desk. It is downstairs where they are doing the pool renovation, but the fitness center has not been renovated, just an FYI. My husband was a little disapointed due to the fact that he likes to use the sauna (esp. since we were paying $9.95/day for use of it and the internet, which did not work in our room).

I stepped foot in the Tropicana approxiamtely 10 years ago and did not get much further than the front door. It was disgusting. Now, you enter a completely redecorated casino and the tropical scent of coconut embraces you first. Then you start to notice the plantation shutter accents and the updated decor. We checked in at the VIP / Breeze desk. The desk personnel was our first experience with the staff. They have clearly been through extensive customer service training, because she was very nice and attentive. This was consistent throughout our stay. We had a suite in the Paradise tower with a view of the Strip. The suite is about 900-1000 square feet and nicely laid out. The decor continues with the tropical theme, but not in a kitchy way. Think Bahamas / English tropical decor. Dark rattan furniture, sisel rugs, muted fabrics with punches of color. Loved it. The bed and linens are excellent. The noise from the street below was audible, but it did not prevent us from getting excellent nights of sleep. But, if you're sensitive to noise, you might want to bring earplugs or download white noise to your ipod and use the dock next to the bed. We ate breakfast at Nikki's both days and it was very good. We at a late supper on Saturday night at Biscayne. Again, the service was excellent, as was the food. We walked around the hotel quite a bit.

My sister had stayed here 2 or 3 years ago and warned me about the hotel saying the rooms are old, and even the non-smoking rooms smell like smoke. However, Trip Advisor was telling me otherwise, and I read that the whole hotel had been renovated and completed August 2010. So, as Trip Advisor has been good to us (always use it before booking hotels and rarely been disappointed), we decided to go for it. Overall, it was a good, cheap place to stay while in Las Vegas. The room we had was renovated, spacious, and didn't really smell of any smoke. However, that might have been masked by the sunscreen smell of Tropicana which is all right I suppose (you'll smell that when you first walk into the lobby doors). The rooms were well furnished and clean. The location is sort of near the south end of the Strip. We found it to be no problem. The best thing about the room was the bed. It was probably the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on in a hotel or at home. If you're looking for a really comfortable bed and good sleep quality, you'll definitely want to stay here. We knew about the resort fee which is supposed to pay for free wifi internet. The internet was great, no problems with that... but honestly, the resort fee should just be built into the cost of the hotel. There is no reason that you should have to pay again when you get there... but maybe that's the standard in Vegas. A tip on transportation to and from the airport. I tried to search this specifically for Tropicana but I couldn't find anything. Since Tropicana is one of the closer hotels to the airport, should you take a shuttle or taxi service? We did both... the shuttle costs $6.50 per person... so $13~$15 depending if you tip the driver. When we left, we took a cab to the airport. It was early in the morning so traffic wasn't too bad, although the driver said it was more than usual at that time as people were probably going back home for Christmas. The trip turned out to be about $11 before a tip. The bonus at Tropicana when taking a cab is you don't even have to drive on the Strip to get there, so you might be able to avoid some traffic. If you have 2 people in your party I'll let you make the decision on which form of transportation to take. If I had to stay here again I would.

Upon entering the rooms we noticed our room had no towels and our friends room had only one dirty towel, a used bar of soap and trash in the ice bucket. We called for house keeping and the bathroom oversight was corrected in a timely manner. We also called and requested our luggage be brought up and were told it would take 20 minutes. Over an hour later, and only after placing a second request did our luggage finally arrive. This was after 10:00pm on a Friday evening, and very few people were checking in or out at that time so it seemed rather peculiar that our luggage would take so long, never-the-less we brushed it off. Trying to sleep that night was not easy. we were very tired from our long trip so we chose not to request that the bed be re-maid due to the fact that the bed was short sheeted. Also, because all the pillow cases were too small for the pillows a good portion of the pillows were exposed. Just imagine how many heads laid on those pillows without a clean, proper pillow case - gross! Sleep that night was fitful at best. The second night I got up at 3:00am to use the bathroom. Upon returning to the bedroom I noticed something on the bed and turned on the light. It was a bug so I grabbed a napkin that was on the nightstand and picked it up. This was a bed bug, and it was filled with fresh blood that left a very large stain on the napkin when I squished it. To say the least, my wife and I were in utter shock! What happened over the next three hours was almost surreal. The clerk at the front desk told me \"to be honest with you we've had many complaints like this in the past, before the remodel.\" The security supervisor said \"we can't control the bugs.\" and the security officer assigned to us couldn't get his camera to focus when he tried to take photos of the bug, so I took the photos for him! I was then told that the only way I could report this If I filled out an accident report, so, at 4:15am I filled out the report including describing the incident in \"my own words.\" We were then offered a new room and a reduction of one night off our 3 night stay. Wanting nothing more but to go home - but being exhausted, we accepted the new room. So - we then had to go back to the room pack up all our stuff and wait for the bellman. After the security man called a second time for the bellman he finally showed up - without a cart. Eventually by 6:00am, we left our 6th floor room with a view of the strip, and got settled in the first floor room with the roar of the ventilation fans just outside the window. This room also had pillows sticking out of the ill fitting cases - plus - the TV in this room would not bring in most the of the channels! The last night we just couldn't sleep because we kept on checking for bugs! Three nights at the Tropicana without sleep, without relaxation & without satisfaction from management! We were told by every employee whom we encountered that they have done everything they can for us and to talk to Heather Katz risk manager. When we checked out at 10:45am and asked for her we were told she was at lunch so we had to leave a phone message for her as nobody else was authorized to help us in her absence. Heather did call us at home the next day. she actually had the Gaul to request that we send her the bug! She clearly was not interested in putting our satisfaction first, her concern seemed only in analyzing the bug. We asked for nothing in compensation from anyone at this hotel, and what they gave us was the big run around, and one nights refund for a ruined 3 night stay.

The only downfall is the lack of casual restaurants in the hotel. We did try Cafe Nikki's lunch buffet, but it is certainly not worth the price ($17.99 I think). The service was also very slow and honestly they seemed quite uninterested in serving us at all. I know the restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, so perhaps it will improve with time.

The colors and decor of the rooms are nice, the bathrooms are clean and modern. The beds in the rooms are extremely comfortable, the rooms themselves are beautiful. Only one small downfall is not having a fridge in the room. Its so hot in august and I had so many water bottles, it would nice to keep one cold in your room before you head out walking. The pool was awesome, clean, the waitstaff were very quick to serve and friendly, we spent almost every morning out there. We did want to float on the water with the blue floats they rent, but $15 is steep. $30 for me and my husband to float on the pool? I wish these would have been cheaper we really spent alot of time out there and wanted to float.

There has been quite an improvement over our previous stay. The rooms have been updated to a nice modern fresh look and feel. Let's just say they are very spacious and comfortable. The flat screen tV's are big, the beds very comfortable and the bathrooms have been redone. The casino and restaurants have been updated with a modern look and feel. The variety of live shows and comedy is outstanding. On the positive, the staff has obviously gone through some extensive customer service training because everyone could not have been more helpful and friendly. Our entire reservation had to be changed due to our flight being cancelled because of the blizzard in the east. Everyone we spoke with went out of their way to accomodate our ever changing travels needs. We especially like the fact that a doorman holds the heavy glass doors for everyone walking in and out - very nice touch. The unfortunate part of the trip is that the renovations are still ongoing. Currently there are limited eating establishments,, so if you want a quick meal, we had to use the property accross the street for light meals. The buffet is very small, but good and has been incorporated into an existing restaurant where as it used to be on its own. Would love to see a large buffet on the property and maybe thats in the plans. The sports betting parlor is a 20 foot long desk with no seating. We were told that a new parlor was being constructed and that would be first class. There is only one row of table games, so when the casino gets crowded, we were forced to visit other properties on the surrounding corner (Trop Blvd. & Strip) to play table games. The pit boss said that an expanded table area was on the way. While the room was outstanding, there were some minor annoyances. The bathroom timer light switch was broke and the lock holding the suite window (yes the windows do open) was loose and our window kept rattling in the high winds. While these things are minor issues, a good quality review by the housekeeping staff before the next guest arrives could have caught these issues. My wife would have liked the room to have a fridge. You can rent one. On one occasion, the housekeeping person knocked on our door at 9:00 AM. We told her we were leaving in 5 minutes. We came back at 3:00 PM and the room had not been done. So what was the point in knocking on the door at 9:00 AM? A call to the housekeeping office and a housekeeper was at our door in 5 minutes and the room quickly and efficiently cleaned. As I have been to almost every large property in Vegas, one recommendation I have for this property is that as improvements are made, that the ventilation and air handling systems are updated. The smoke in the gaming area is much worse than in other properties. Hopefully one day Vegas will go non smoking with a smoking area like the rest of the country. I continue to recommend this property and believe it will be a great property when all of the improvements are finally completed.

I have visited the casino, since the renovations, but this was my first stay at the hotel since last November. While there are some nice changes, my overall impression was not so great. The room was very nice. Very comfortable beds, that are a vast improvement from the old ones. Considering the \"newness\" of it, I was upset to see the scratched night stand, and less than impeccably clean shower. The tiles were a bit moldy. The staff was much nicer than they had been in the past, and that is a plus. The construction was not much of an issue, except for the fact that much of the casino is blocked off. There is a major lack of dining options. If you just want a quick snack or sandwich, there are no options. The South Beach Deli that is advertised on their website is closed. There is a steakhouse, an Italian restaurant, and Cafe NIkki. The Steakhouse and Italian restaurant are not open during the day. Cafe Nikki is not a good choice if you just want, say, a BLT. It has a very \"club-like\" feel and is very Cuban influenced. That is not a bad thing, necessarily, if there had been other options. There was a small coffee stand that offered \"gas station\" style pre-packaged egg salad sandwiches ( no thanks), and excessively priced pastries. It was open on Sunday. It was closed Monday, and literally gone on Tuesday. If you don't mind leaving the hotel for coffee, and snacks, I guess this would be ok. I think that once all of the refurbishments are complete, this will be a nice place to stay. In my opinion, they should just close for 6 months, and get everything done. But as it is now, I don't think I could really recommend it. We ended up leaving a day early, as we just felt so \"blah\" about the whole thing. My final disappointment came after arriving home to find that my card had been charged, even though we presented a different one at check in(my husbands). They had done this to me before, and after a very unpleasant phone call to the front desk, I swore I wouldn't stay there again. That was last year. I thought with all of the changes, they wouldn't do this again, and yet they did. I did call, and the woman I spoke to was pleasant about it, but it left me with a bad feeling. Overall, yes the rooms are nice, and the employees are more pleasant, but they have lost a long time customer.

I had to go to other casinos to play this game. The rooms were nicely done and i had no trouble with the shutters as many have stated. Just make sure the shutters are pointing upwards when u closed them. We stayed on the second floor(im a smoker and those rooms are on the 2nd and 18 floor, i think) Our room was in a dead area where the reception was terrible for the internet. Our first day we had zero connection to the internet and they waved the resort fee for our first day. They offered to move us but, we had connection for the final three days of our stay, so, we turned down the offer to move(didnt want to pack everything up) The pros were this. 1/ good customer service 2/roooms were pleasant 3/they had a scent of hiawaiian breeze threwout the hotel and it was a pleasant odour.(better then smelling smoke, and i am a smoker) 4/price was right and location was average Cons were 1/ The atmosphere, because not many people were in the hotel, it seemed not as exciting as other hotels that were crammed with people. 2/ wifi can be a bit dicey. 3/ The cocktail service was unacceptable when playing slots after midnight.

(all i wanted was a coffee)I searched the entire gaming area and didnt find one waitress on the floor. 4/Cafe nikki was over priced.

I couldnt find a place to do just that in the Tropicana. Also the boutique buffet was something like $22. I would have thought they would have started with a lower price and because of that, we didnt eat one meal at the Trop. Overall, i liked the place. It seemed very small compared to other casinos and it seemed very tranquil compared to other casinos. We didnt eat here, didnt gamble much here (no paigow poker and no cocktail service after midnight while on the slots)and basically just used it as a place to sleep.

While the location was ideal for our trip to Vegas to visit family and friends (easy access away from the strip), the hotel itself was not ideal for our needs. The rooms were surprisingly spacious, however, we were surprised that we could hear street traffic on the 16th floor. We were unaware when we booked this hotel that because of the construction they did not have a front entrance ramp. Since we were traveling with my 90 year old grandmother, a ramp would have made the scooter we rented a little easier to maneuver. After three days at the hotel we were finally informed of the rear entrance that had a ramp, but it was in the bowels of the hotel. The fact that we had the scooter delivered to the hotel and that they had to retrieve it for us but never mentioned the rear entrance lends to our second concern which was general customer service. We found it lacking and a general sense of dissatisfication with the current ownership and its direction. My favorite incident was while approaching an information desk on the casino floor, I indicated that I had a question. The woman pulled out a mirror and began to check her makeup before she turned her attention to me. Housekeeping could never seem to get the towel situation right. The first day we left just the face towels on the floor to be replaced. When we returned later that night, all the towels had been taken (with no replacements). We called for towels and within 20 minutes we had our towels. On the second day, we repeated the same incident. So by the third day we got the hint and left the do not disturb sign on the door (although I was tipping daily). Overall, the hotel provided a convenient location for our stay, but the lack of a ramp, poor customer service, and uncertain housekeeping, I would be hesitant to stay at the Tropicana again. I will note that upon mentioning these issues to the front desk (Yolande who was great), apologized and waived our resort fees.

We did stay in the farther tower, which can be a bit of a pain when you want your morning coffee, it's a bit of a trek to get it, lol, but I think that's more of a Vegas thing than a Tropicana thing.

Very comfortable bed, beautiful refurbishment and renos, and new carpets in a cheery white \"South Miami\" style made that part very enjoyable. Ditto the food: while 2 of the Tropicana restaurants were closed or opened sporadically, (and many restaurants generally in Vegas/casino hotels were closed until Dec 23rd), the Cafe Nikki was open, featuring a variety of excellent food at reasonable for Vegas prices. Unfortunately, the Beatles cover/tribute show was taking a week off before the expected Christmas rush.The staff was extremely helpful in every way imaginable from serving staff to doormen to concierge arranging a tour for us, to front desk. In our case, we needed to have our bags held over past checkout until we could catch the airport shuttle. No problem: the front desk staff allowed us to check out at 3Pm, and we had a rest in the room until that time. Overall, a maximum effort in the midst of timely renos that will eventually bring the finished Tropicana to a new modern height.

Both of our rooms in the Paradise Tower were clean and comfortable and we both really enjoyed the \u201cbeachy theme\u201d which is such a departure from the standard Vegas hotels. We also enjoyed the very subtle scent that was reminiscent of suntan lotion, but not overpowering as some hotel signature scents can be. The location in the Paradise Tower, steps from the elevator to the Casino and entrance is wonderful!! To those who have complained about light coming into the room, the beauty of shutters is you can close them in a downward position to let in a little light, or close them in an upward position to block any light. The shutters also can be opened right up to have an unobstructed view. The iPod docking station and large flat screen television are also a nice touch if that is important to you. The front desk staff are wonderful (kudos to Doug for setting the tone for our stay); very helpful. ALL our interactions (with the exception of some spotty cocktail service in the Casino and some non-existent at times) with the staff at the Trop went above and beyond service levels I've experienced in \"higher end\" Vegas properties. What the Trop lacks in \u201cglamour\u201d is definitely countered by friendly, helpful staff. As you enter the Trop each and every time, the doorman is quick to open the door and offer a greeting. As I started away from the front desk on departure, the Bell staff was quick to rush over to \"schlep\" my luggage. We both enjoyed breakfast at Nikki Beach and I am really looking forward to seeing the pool area when completed as on visits years ago, I always \"loved\" the Trop pool so can only imagine how much better it will be with the renos complete; I do hope the Cabana prices don't rival those of other strip properties. I had really hoped to try the 4-course sampling at Biscayne, but with previous plans made had to add that to my \"list of things to do\" for the next trip. I did have a look at the menu though and it looks wonderful both for the samplings and dinner menu. I really enjoyed the bright feel to the Casino (the glare from the potlights on the VP machines adjacent to the white walkway was a bit much in the wee hours for tired eyes though, but what the heck\u2026.that\u2019s what you get for staying up until 4:30 a.m. daily and I did locate some in a darker corner). The band that played at night was FANTASTIC and I enjoyed listening while playing VP (in the afore-mentioned darker corner). I really enjoyed finding some slots that are hard to locate elsewhere on the strip and not having to \"wrestle\" for a seat at them. The staff at The Trop is definitely what sets it apart; I have been travelling to Vegas for 29 years, many times a year and haven't experienced better customer service anywhere.... high-end hotels I frequent included.

BIG MISTAKE. The first \"new\" room my girlfriend and I got was in the Island Tower. The only thing new about the room was the furniture and the bedding. When we woke up in the morning to take a shower, we had to actually duck our heads to shampoo our hair, keep in mind I am only 5 foot eleven and my girl friend is 5 foot ten if your over 6 foot don't even bother trying to bathe on that side of the hotel. When we called the front desk, they did accomadate us by moving us to the Paradise Tower early in the morning on the second day of our stay. The room in the Paradise Tower was better, however, it wouldn't of taken much to beat the Island Tower room. The good thing about the Paradise Tower is that you can be out of the Hotel in under 2 mins. According to some reviews on here the vanilla smell that is piped into the casino and hotel is \"pleasant'; We did not find this to be the case. I would compare it to sitting in a car that has too strong of a vanilla airfreshener and after a few days that starts to wear on you. I would of liked to take my girlfriend to a spa, however, there is no active spa here due to the renovations. Also, we only ate once at the hotel at the \"South Beach Cafe\" this place is a total joke. We had two burgers and some cheese sticks for 40 dollars. In comparison, we had an a couple of sandwiches over at the sports bar of New York, New York and it was under 30 bucks. The good thing about the Tropicana is the location as it is right across the bridge from both MGM grand and Excalibur/Luxor/Mandalay Bay. I can't envision a scenario that would make me stay at the Tropicana Hotel again. The constant loop hyping the \"mob experience\" in the hotel elevators was enough to almost make me loose my cool. What a dumb idea for a vegas hotel, other hotels have cool themes like greek/roman gods iconic cites paris/new york but their idea to get hip is to try and capitalize on the Soprano's? That was popular like ten years ago way to get with the times! If you are looking for a hotel that is attached to a nice shopping center with great places to dine you are looking at the wrong place, spend more money and stay elsewhere. Further, the sportsbook was not even open I had to walk across the bridge to the MGM grand just to lay some sports bets.

We had a room on the ninth floor of the Paradise tower. The casino is a big improvement, with a light, open, clean feeling. When I visited a year ago, it felt a bit grim and grungy. The staff was unfailingly polite and pleasant to deal with, from Doug at checkin, Rose helping with boarding passes and the quick and polite response when I requested an additional luggage rack from housekeeping. Room Pros: Comfortable king size bed, very roomy, safe, big flat screen tv, new furnture. The look is understated tropical, I was expecting a few more bright splashes of color with the South Beach theme. The wall art was of Jazz musicians, and seemed to evoke New Orleans a bit more than South Beach, but it was fine. Plenty of hangers, an i-home clock radio with an i-pod dock. Bathroom was a good size with a nice layout. Room Cons: Window treatments were shutters rather than curtains, and they were difficult to close tightly to block light. This was a particular problem since we were right across from the MGM electronic sign, that flashed and blinked all night. They shutters look good, but really need to be paired with some sort of blackout curtains, after all, this is Vegas and there is a good chance you were up late. Also, the first night was very noisy. We discovered that one of the windows had not been closed properly. It is nice to have windows that open, but quick check to make sure that they are closed correctly when the room turns over seems like a no brainer. The bathroom had a nice updated marble counter, new sink and faucits. Unfortanatly, they stopped short of a complete re-do, and left the old tile. This would have been fine had they regrouted and replaced any broken tile, but in our room the floor grout was stained and there was a broken tub tile. It did not affect the functionality at all, but left an overall impression of old and dirty when compared to the rest of the room. if you are planning on using the fitness room, the new upgraded room will not be available till spring. The current room is small and light on cardio equipment. There was no exercise bike (bummer for me, I'm supposed to bike for physical therapy for a bad knee) 2 elipticals and a few treadmills. They are well equiped for free weights and weight machines, a bit ironic since most of the demand seems to be for cardio. I'm looking forward to checking out the new facility when it opens. The parking got a bit dicey as we approached the weekend, there is a very small parking garage, and half is dedicated to valet. We had one evening that it took us 20 minutes to find a spot. I believe that they are going to build a new garage over where they imploded the old tower, but parking will be a challenge during busier times untill then. The wifi included in the resort fee was fine, we never lost signal, and it was great to have. The business center is closed, and since printing of boarding passes was included as well, they took care of that at the front desk. A couple of (very) small quibbles with housekeeping, we did not have the disposible bag for the ice bucked replaced the entire week, and a wire coat hanger was left on the bathroom counter one day. Also, kudos to the social media team. I joined the facebook page, and posted a question before we left, and had a response promptly. Overall, I feel we got an outstanding value, and do want to go back for pool season.

The wi-fi worked great. Large soaking tub. The towels leave alot to be desired. Also very convienient to the pool and gym. A little disappointing that the Spa is closed so a massage was not an option. I think it is being rennovated along with many areas of the casino. The sportsbook is closed and is also a work in progress. They anticipate opening the sportsbook in May 2011. It is a 5 minute walk to the MGM Grand Sportsbook. The pool area is also under construction but looks as though it will be very nice. The gaming area is small consisting of 2 roulette wheels 2 Craps tables and about a dozen or so Blackjack and assorted card games. Plenty of slots in a rather simple to navigate casino floor. You will never get lost or separated from your party. Very nice sports viewing lounge with plenty of TV sets. Purchased discounted tickets for the Yesterday Beatles Tribute show. Very entertaining. Cozy theater with great acoustics and very comfortable. They are advertising another interactive show called The Vegas Mob Experience which opens soon and looks quite fun and historically educational. The staff was very gracious. I only ate a sandwich and fries and a coke at the Cafe for $16. It was very good. They had a classy looking steakhouse and a pasta place as well. No buffet if that is important to you. Overall a great value and convienient walk to MGM, Excaliber and the free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

We also ate at the buffet for breakfast on Saturday for $9.99 each. Not a lot of choices but for the price reasonable. We also ate at Pampas which is located in the PH Mall area $5.99 for steak and eggs this was pretty decent. We did a lot of walking but we also would catch the monorail which is located right next door at the MGM. We took in 3 shows. Defending the Caveman at Excalibur which was not bad. It was all about relationships so if you are married especially it is funny. We saw the newer show called VEGAS the show. This was entertaining and well done. We enjoyed it and bought our tickets at half-price shows on the strip. This was about $40 each. The final show we saw was Nathan Burton we found free tickets online, before we arrived.

I booked the Tropicana because of all of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor about the renovations and changes that were made recently. I never had gone into the Tropicana during my previous Las Vegas visits, but I would hate to see what the old Tropicana was like if this is now the newly renovated version. Don't get me wrong, the hotel looks nice but I wasn't overly impressed. To me, it just seemed like an average hotel when you walked in. The casino was bright but not overly big and impressive. There were really no wow features at all to look at., The new rooms however are indeed nice and comfortable and we did enjoy our beds at night. They are renovated but I noticed that it appears it wasn't a full refit as the tiles in the bathroom still looked a bit dated so you could still see remnants of the old rooms. A lot of users commented on the staff. Again, not impressed. We had arrived at the hotel after 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon and was told we could not get a room until 4...when check in was supposed to begin at 3. I didn't feel like the woman was very accomodating and also felt that the bell hop was rude when asking about holding our bags. When we arrived around 4:30 (i was afraid to arrive any earlier with fear that the room would still not be ready), the only room they could give us was one facing a cement wall and roof area? Not thrilled, but I knew we wouldn't be in the room much anyway. The check in woman commented that check in was 3 so other rooms were already given away....I complained that why did the previous woman tell us to show up at 4 then! She didn't seem to care. Staff did open the doors for us almost each time we entered and exited the hotel, but other than that nothing to brag about. To sum it up, the hotel doesn't have any wow factor. There isn't much to do in the hotel as far as good restaurants and entertainment so don't expect the hotel to be a real happening place....perhpas this will change once they open Nikki Beach? We did visit the pool once and it's nice but again wouldn't say its the best pool in vegas like the hotel sometimes states. The location is on the south end but the Excalibur is across the street which has a tram to the Mandalay Bay and Luxor and Tropicana is also across the street from MGM which can connect you to the monorail system so you can still get around somewhat easy to most areas on the strip. Regardless, I would stay at the hotel again though for the value of it but at least next time I would know what to expect. So I would recommend the hotel if you want a comfortable place to sleep at an inexpensive price but I consider it to be more of a regular hotel than a casino resort.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at the \"Trop\"\u201d", "Author": "billcop", "ReviewID": "UR86810655", "Content": "Just returned from our trip to Las Vegas, where we stayed at the Tropicana.

He was so extremely nice and was sincerely concerned with my bad experience. He invited me back to come experience the new casino. I must admit, I was hesitant to go back, but Arik had gone so far above and beyond his call of duty I felt obligated to give it another chance.

We were put up in a corner suite with the best view of the entire strip. We had a bottle of champagne waiting in our room right when we arrived. We were also introduced to the head of service, Kennon. Kennon is probably the best thing that has happened to that casino and hotel. Not only was he extremely hospitable, he was genuine. He personally wanted to make sure that me and my friends had an amazing time. Amazing does not even come close to how much fun we had! Everyone working in the hotel and casino were always smiling, everyone from dealers to waitresses to housekeeping, to floor supervisors would constantly being saying hello to all of the guests. I dont gamble all that much but was having fun playing three card poker on this trip. The dealer even remembered my name! Being that she probably deals to hundreds of people a day, I was very impressed by her attentiveness. Customer service and hospitality at the Tropicana is through the roof. Bottom line: Tropicana looks amazing. The rooms are glorious and the service is even better.

The casino has a nice ambiance and is clean but there were little to no waitresses to bring drinks (I hear free drinks at casinos are becoming a thing of the past anyway). To top it off, my husband and I were tired of spending all of our money on food/drinks and went to the store to bring a few things to our room to help cut cost. We had to pay $25 for a tiny refrigerator which looked like it had been thrown down the stairs and when we called to ask for it we were interrogated about why we needed one in the room...I was very offended that I was treated that way. The room was very nice but for some reason it was impossible to get the room cool enough despite putting the thermostat on 63 degrees, we were burning up. Going through the hotel it's obvious that a lot of effort has been put into the remodel and it does look great. I really was looking forward to a relaxing time for my husband and honestly am not that picky (you'd never be able to tell from this review) but we both just felt like it was one thing after the other.

The room was on the corner, and was one of the remodeled rooms. For the price paid (about $80/night), I'd say it's probably right at a good value for the money. There was nothing to hardcore complain about during the entire stay. I was a little hesitant to stay here at first, but one of the things that helped convince me it'd be okay was that I noticed that the hotel was fairly reactive to the comments left here, which indicated that they were paying attention to feedback, and reacting to it. For some reason, that helped reassure me. That being said, the staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs, the room was clean, spacious, and was very convienent to the south end of the Strip and neighboring hotels. BUT, be warned that the food/beverage offerings in this hotel are severly lacking. Only one option for breakfast, and a small grill at that. With literally countless options surrounding the general area, from expansive buffets to something as simple as Denny's, I felt disappointed by this lacking. Not anyone's there fault, as I really didn't see a lot of room anywhere in the hotel to put another restaurant - but this really should be addressed. Also, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of staffing at Bell Services and Valet outside the main entrance in the morning hours. The front canopy was getting fuller and fuller of people checking out, and only ONE person handling luggage outside? Of COURSE he's going to get overwhelmed, but come on, get the guy some help! Valet also seemed understaffed at this time, though the staff was extremely friendly, and will always offer great directions and/or suggestions for things to do that are sometimes off the beaten path. Overall, the hotel's a good place to crash at the end of a long day, but I wouldn't consider it a \"destination\" hotel as the \"makeover\" appears to be trying to make it.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "99112624", "ReviewID": "UR86077179", "Content": "Hotel fully renovated.

We had originally planned to stay in the MGM for 1 wk and TI for the 2nd wk, but had seen pictures of the rooms refurbished and the prices were amazing so thought we would take a chance. First impression on entering the hotel was good as it was nice and bright. Although no ramp to get our heavy suitcases up :-( Only problem we had in the whole 2 wks was at check in. I paid $850 for the room upfront at check in. The next day in Abercrombie & Fitch I tried to use the same card for $300 at the check out and it was refused (very embarrassing) so i paid with a different card and contacted my card provider. They said that the Tropicana had taken 2 payments, $850 and a separate $700. I questionned this at reception who said that it was $50pn for incidentals. I was very annoyed that when i checked in and asked the amount being taken from my card I was told $850 and never said anything about the other $700. The whole transaction had to be cancelled and paid with a different card, but I had to wait 7 days to get the money from my my card issuer as they had to wait for the transaction to expire. Don't know if this is a common practise in US hotels, but i would have at least liked to have been told or asked if I required that service. Anyway, pleeeeaaasssseeee don't let that put you off as the rest of the 2 wks were perfect. Genuinely friendly staff, clean nice rooms with the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in, we stayed in the Paradise Tower 17th floor with great strip view, great location by MGM. NYNY & Excalibur, beautiful pool which will be even more amazing when Nikki Beach is finished. Didn't eat in restaurants so can't comment on them, but South Beach cafe was nice. My only worry is that the prices will rise a lot due to all the renovations putting prices similar to MGM, TI, Mirage, etc. I'm going back to Vegas twice next yr and if i can get anything near the price i paid this time then i won't even bother looking at other hotels.

I liked it, that once you have purchased a coffee at the South Beach Cafe, if you kept the cup refills were free. I lost my ink pen and went to the Tropicana Hotel Store to purchase one and the cashier pulled out a can of pens and gave me one which again I thought was a nice touch. We contacted the front desk and were given a late check-out which was real good of them, they didn't have to do it. The access to the hotel parking was very good and we never had trouble finding a parking spot. My only complaint was the room noise.

Our room in the Island Tower was great - very large, the bed very comfortable, and with a nice view of the MGM and New York New York Casinos. The temperature indoors was perfect. Generally, the Tropicana has an aura of \"newness\" which is in stark contrast to some of the old, out-dated interiors that I saw at various locations on the Strip. Unfortunately, however, the Tropicana needs to improve in a number of areas before it can even come close to competing with some of the other establishments on the Strip. Our hotel room didn't have a services guide (the booklet you're used to finding in your hotel room that tells you of the resort's services and facilities). When I called housekeeping to request one they said they'd deliver one immediately; however, I got a phone call 5 minutes later saying they didn't have any spare, but that I should dial 0 on the phone if I needed anything - a bit rough considering that without the resort guide I didn't know what was on offer! So my husband and I decided to look up the Tropicana website for details of the services and facilities provided - only to find that the promised free wi-fi connection didn't make it to our hotel room. I would have really loved to know that there was a fitness centre before now..! Granted, when I found someone in the lobby who I could speak to about the lack of wi-fi access he offered to move us to another room, but as we only had 2 nights remaining we didn't want the inconvenience of moving all our belongings. The bed linens and towels in our room smelled of smoke, although I'd requested a non-smoking room. We carried our own bags on arrival and departure, with no offer of assistance from hotel porters. The casino lacks an exciting vibe that makes you want to actually stay there (we spent all of our time elsewhere, and returned to sleep). If there's one thing I dislike whilst on holiday, it's having to chase up the services and facilities you know you're already paying for - I just want to enjoy myself with a minimum of fuss! I do think the Tropicana has a lot of potential, but really during our US trip we stayed in some very basic hotels that were able to provide free wifi access/non smelly linens/attentive staff, so it's a shame the Tropicana couldn't deliver.

I was told that they would put a rush on house keeping to get our room ready and to check back in a hour or so, 2 hours later our room was still not ready. Tried back at 3pm which is normal check in time and our room was still not ready, got told once agian to try back in an hour or so or that they could put us in a smoking room with 2 beds. Went and played some games and tried back about 3:45 just hoping that our room would be ready and yet agian it wasnt, go the just another hour or so spill agian. Needless to say this was getting out of hand!! So I went and found the hotel manager, he went up to the desk and came back to tell me that the room was being cleaned and it usually takes about an hour to get the room clean. I had a few choice words with him and he went back to the desk once agian and came back with keys to the room. Bt the time this ordeal was over I was so peeved that I couldnt see strait. I did end up getting comps for $50 dining and the resort fee being waived for the duration of our trip to some that would be worth the aggravation but not for me.

Having been to Vegas a few times in the past we had a very different picture in our mind's eye of what the Tropicana was than what we saw on their website. But due to the great deal we took a chance that they indeed are \"changing everything.\" First thing you'll notice when you walk in is that the hotel is bright compared to other hotels on the strip. This was refreshing. And when I checked in there was not a wait and the staff was friendly and quick. Also refreshing if you've ever waited in a long line at a Vegas hotel only to be greeted by a grumpy hotel clerk. The tower our room was in was a bit of a walk away but this is norm in Las Vegas. What was nice was the quick escape from the casino. And shortly after that you escape the second hand smoke due to the business area part of the hotel being smoke free. This was really nice. The rooms are indeed \"best in class.\" Much nicer than the room we had a few months early at a hotel just across the street. Nice and clean with a very bright and modern vibe. It was a great room to come back to after long days of conferences, shows, and casinos. Not to mention free wi-fi. Our room did not really have a good view though unless you like airports. And forget about looking out the windows after dark. Large spotlights pointing directly at the windows make that a blinding experience. Also the windows only had shutters which did not block 100% of the light from the spotlights at night. So it was impossible to make the completely dark. Tropicana please consider installing some shades guests could pull to completely cover the windows. Those of us that light it completely dark while sleeping would appreciate it. Over all it was a great place to stay. At every turn the staff was friendly and really helpful. In fact we found the dealers at Tropicana to be really good for us novice gamblers.

Casino floor personnel were also very friendly and helpful, including the maintenance staff and slot attendants.

The location is perfect at the Strip and Trop--easy access to all major properties by foot, taxi, or tram. Surprisingly, valet delivered our car each day in a very timely manner--not the case with some of the other larger LV resorts. Rose at Front Desk went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations from a service standpoint. We went there to mail some cards and she asked a few questions, and before we knew it, she helped print out our boarding passes, escorted us to the Promotions booth and had our charges picked up based on our play.

Be sure to check with the Promotions Desk to see what specials they have in regards to signing up for a Player's Card. If you are going to gamble, it's smart to get credit for it and thier program seems to be very generous in comparison to other properties in Las Vegas and other gaming destinations. While we were there (3 days) their current promotion changed twice, so be sure to inquire. Although they were busy with lots of customers, they were VERY patient and happy to help. This is not a big fancy hotel. It is one of the oldest properties in Las Vegas that has undergone some much needed renovations and face lifting that have made it great. We stayed there about 5 years ago and checked out early due to the uncleanliness and poor attitude from the staff. You will get a good value for your dollar here.

This time I stayed at the Tropicana from Oct 16 through Oct 19. The price was excellent (part of an Expedia fly-hotel package). The check-in was fast and the clerk was polite and friendly (as were all of the employees I ran across). I had to sign a waiver which stated that there was a $9.99 daily 'resort' fee (which I already knew about) and that I would have to pay for any damaged and 'missing' (i.e. stolen) items from the room. I haven't seen that waiver for years, and only in those hotels in my student years which were, how should I say, 'budget' hotels in the Tenderloin district. We last stayed at the Trop approximately 10 years ago, and our room at the time was in a 3 story '60s type motel near the pool. It was quite basic and badly in need of refurbishing. This time, we stayed at their advertised 'best-in-class' room in the Island tower. I assume it\u2019s called the island tower since it's approximately a long city block away from the check-in counter. You walk through the casino, past the pool (shortened by at least half due to construction) and the aforementioned motel rooms, past their convention area. Fortunately, there are water stops (cleverly disguised as restaurants) about half way along the trek. This tower is not for anyone who has difficulty in walking. Try to get a room in their other tower, the Paradise Tower, which is only 30 or so feet away from the registration area. As far as I could tell, the rooms in either tower were identical. The room itself was tastefully done with modern conveniences such as a LED flat panel TV and an alarm clock with IPOD and other MP3 player access. Mine was on the 6th floor with a view of the airport and employee parking lot (which I was told I couldn't use; that would have shortened my walk approximately 90%). The windows were covered by wooden louvers which unfortunately failed to block the light from the powerful spotlights which illuminated the towers. Fortunately, I was able to cover my head with one of the many pillows provided on the bed itself, thus blocking out most of the light. The room was very quiet (it was a long way from the main area, remember). The $9.99 daily resort fee included Internet access, fitness room (which I didn't use) and 2 for 1 cocktails (not too useful if you're a teetotaler) as well as a boarding pass printout. To their credit, management had previously stated on their web site and Expedia that this daily charge will be assessed. Unfortunately, the charge had mushroomed to $11.90 per day on my bill, which I assumed was from taxes and did not need to be stated in advance. I will refrain from proselytizing on my opinions of resort charges since this is a family web site. Just be aware that some (fewer and fewer) unrepentant hotels still impose this charge. There now is a $10.80 weekend hot breakfast buffet available in one of the watering stops (Bacio Pasta). Unfortunately, it is only available on the weekends.

No brad garrett..( left with Bruce Baum...not funny at all) 2. No life in casino floor at all 3. Bars have no atmosphere (crucial to the sucess of any bar...anywhere) 4. pool area not done It is understandable how hard it is to compete with the super casinos on the strip so i think with the changes (i.e. nikki beach) there may hold hope for the tropicana... nikki beach will instill life into the resort. I do think the general casino area should be redone. i dont think the white walls work its not a comfortable gaming colour. On the upside... i was considering squuzing every last pillow into my suitcase... unbelievable pillows and bed over all... the rooms are really nice. i stayed in the mirage before it had renov. work done in the rooms. and the tropicana's rooms are better. fantastic value on the rooms... Also check out the eggs or sandwiches in the south beach deli... fantastic... Overall i was only looking for a nice room as i didn't plan on staying there other than to sleep (guns to fire, celeb birthday parties to go to). So essentially this was great for us. location is a bit out there however you do have mgm and new york close by. So, definite thumbs up for the rooms and the future of the pool area. location isn't THAT much of a burdon but unfortunately it is the casino area (gaming and bars) that let the tropicana down massively.

My bathroom glasses were not cleaned or replaced in 3 of the days we were there and pretty much the only thing the cleaning staff did each day to the room was make the bed and replace the towels. If you left clothes on the floor they stayed right there. I will say most of the hotel staff is very nice and accommodating. The bell hops are all friendly and very hard working! The table area of the casinos is very small and only 1/2 of the tables are open the entire time I was there which was Thursday - Monday of Columbus Day w/e. The bar in the casino is way too quiet ~ no entertainment ~ and boring and a couple of the bartenders were as slow as could be! Many of the other people staying in the hotel are 60+.

Since my casino host offered for us to preview the changes on him, I couldn't resist. My problem in reviewing the hotel is that it really has a way to go to be completely remodeled. I recognize that, so I won't be too hard on them, nor will I pick them apart. The rooms were remodeled and I had a great corner suite overlooking the strip. Problem is that there are so many sirens throughout the night, you almost think you are sleeping (when you can) next to a fire station. Oh...you are...well that and an ambulance station too. The sitting/living room is huge! The bedroom is also a good size, but I hated that the bed was literally two steps from the bathroom door. The remodeled bathroom was not as nice as I thought it would be. Seems like they cut costs on showers and toilets....nothing special at all. Not sure I dig the tiki motif; sort of bland for me. Service was very good (dealers, front, other staff). Pool was nice, but there were no tables to eat lunch at. We had to sit on lounge chairs in our clothes. I understand they are opening a Nikki's Beach there...so that should be amazing. Casino is small....6:5 on blackjack is the worst. No poker or sports betting yet. The 24 hour deli is too small to deal with any kinds of crowds and there is no buffet. Biscayne was excellent and I did not get to try the Italian place. Brad Garrett bought the comedy shop and it was about half full. On a side note...haven't actually walked the strip in about 10 years (walked to Planet Hollywood for show), and if it is another 10 years before I do it again, I won't be sad. Streets are filthy, drunk people everyone spilling beer on you everywhere, and assaulted by no fewer than 20+ people banging pamphlets of naked women in my face. Really? Walking with my wife? The cards and pamphlets are everywhere on the street...a shame for what was once an exciting walk. I will evaluate it again when everything opens and the Trop reinvents itself next year.

I would highly recommend this newly renovated and classy hotel/casino to anyone! We had a beautiful room in Paradise Tower on the 2nd floor - very clean and we loved the color scheme. Also loved the shuttered windows, which allowed us to let in varied amounts of light. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and did an outstanding job! Tropicana's entrance is elegant and makes a beautiful first impression. The double set of glass doors is always clean and friendly staff are at-the-ready to welcome and get the doors for guests. Unlike many other hotels which are jammed with noisy slot machines from the front door inward, Tropicana has its beautiful gaming tables up front under a breathtaking stained glass ceiling. Slots are off to the side and spaced to allow room to manuever, which was a definite plus. The entrance and check-in areas are elegant, and lend an impression of class, not clutter. We were out and about in the evenings, but had lunch and a few early dinners at the South Beach Deli at Tropicana. The food was excellent - freshest sandwiches and salads we've had anywhere, and delicious french fries! The fresh breads and ingredients made these sandwiches and salads/fries a much better choice than some of the buffets and other dinner deals in Vegas - highly recommended! The portions were huge, so you won't go hungry after eating at South Beach. We couldn't finish all our food, but it was absolutely delicious! South Beach also offers morning coffee for a comparable price to other places, and refills are free. The pool at Tropicana is truly a gem - gorgeous, well-maintained grounds with plenty of pool deck space and elegant cabanas! One truly has the experience of being in a secluded resort while swimming and relaxing. Pool staff were very friendlyand welcoming, and wait staff there did an excellent job. The woman who served us at check-in was not friendly and, had we allowed this first impression of staff to influence our stay, it would not have been pleasant. However, all other staff truly made up for her rudeness, and left us with a great overall impression of Tropicana staff. Our only real complaint was the resort fee, which was not mentioned in our package. Our travel package clearly stated \"all taxes and fees included.\" This is something which needs to be corrected, as most people want to know the bottom line when booking a hotel stay.

My advice: Visit now. The Tropicana's renovation is truly making the place altogether fresh, and it's sort of going counter to the recent Vegas trend. Many Strip hotels have been \"de-theming\" themselves for several years, and now a lot of them are getting a homogenized, chain-hotel atmosphere. One looks a lot like the other. Not the Trop: This place is aiming for unique. The casino is glistening white, utterly unlike anything else on the Strip. The hotel is a South Beach theme with lots of bamboo-style decor and wicker, plenty of whites and creams and soft colors throughout the building. It's both attractive and distinctive. The Paradise Tower is freshly remodeled, and - at least for now - the rates are a remarkable bargain. The scale of this property seems to work nicely; I didn't see the massive registration lines that are common in bigger hotels, and the casino and grounds all have a \"manageable\" feel - big enough to be interesting, but not so large that you can get lost. Nicole Marshall, who responds to many postings here, is serious about providing customer service. The staff throughout the hotel is notable for friendliness & concern for the guests; Barbara at check-in went out of her way to be sure I knew about the hotel's amenities, the dining options, etc. You could get the same information at a lot of hotels, but it would be a rushed, mechanical speech - with Barbara, I got the sense that she sincerely wanted my stay to be enjoyable. Several other employees provided that same feeling, and I never encountered anyone who appeared bored with the job or impatient with a guest. The location is way south on the Strip, but the MGM's monorail station isn't far ... and the walk to the center Strip from the Tropicana is both safe and interesting. (Unlike the Strip's northern end, which is neither). The pool area is extraordinary; the pool and main hot tub are both attractively designed, and the landscaping is gorgeous. Many Strip hotels, even a couple of the 5-star properties, provide nothing more than a rectangular pool surrounded by concerete; the Tropicana's is an entire experience. I'll hope it doesn't get too popular after the remodeling; at least as of October 2010, though, it's the pefect mix of lively but not overbearing. For long-time Vegas fans, this is a property you've got to see again. If your memory is about the Trop of the past 20 years, you'll be thinking of a once-terrific place that is long past its glory days (similar to the Sahara or the Riviera). But that's last year's news; this remodel is much more than just paint and carpet, and the Tropicana of 2010 is unlike anything before. My hope is that it doesn't become too trendy in the next year or two; for right now, I doubt you can get a better mix of quality and reasonable price anywhere in Vegas.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel to stay in\u201d", "Author": "4freemind", "ReviewID": "UR82788761", "Content": "Everything was great.

Negatives: (1) The large screen television was on the dresser next to a stand for another television. When I turned on the TV, it didn't work. I called down and was told an engineer would be \"right up\". An hour later, a very friendly engineer came in and explained that the hotel ran out of plasma televisions, so the rest of the room just had flat screens. And those new TVs didn't work all the time. Fortunately, it was an easy fix. About 45 minutes into watching television, it turned off by itself. I knew the problem and fixed it this time myself. (2) The room only has shutters over its window (probably to keep with the tropical theme). However, at night, with the lights of the building shining up the sides of the tower, the room is very bright even with the shutters closed. You can get up and move around without a problem in the middle of the night and see everything in the room. If you are a light-sleeper (like myself), this is an issue. I was facing east, so when the sun came up in the morning, the room was lit up like a spot light! (3) The windows were in dire need of cleaning. Otherwise, not a bad room for one night in Vegas. If I go to this event again next year (I was there for a hockey game), I will most likely splurge and stay somewhere else. If you are short on cash and want to stay on the strip, this isn't a bad hotel. It's comperable to a Super 8 hotel or any other average hotel, room-wise. The room was clean and comfortable.

All I can say is that our stay was WONDERFUL! Nice sized rooms have been tastefully renovated (beds super comfy), beautiful 42\" LCD TV's, great pool, (enough sun and shade, comfy chairs with pads, & free water with lemon/lime or cucumber), music, great for young and old! Improvements still to come. Staff is very friendly and helpful! Duece bus stop ($7.00 for a 24 hr. pass) directly in fromt of hotel.

Reasonable rates, easily accessible, new and clean rooms, friendly staff, bright casino, and short walk to elevators to get to your room. My only negative comment was that they need a buffet to entice people to stay a little longer. Not to worry, combination buffet along with short menu restaurant (sandwiches, salads, etc.) opening soon! Nikki Beach opening in April 2011!

We stayed there September 19-23 Seems that resort will be wonderful after the remodeling will be finished in Spring 2011..until then...not so much. The pool time was very challenging. Let me guess if you are visiting Vegas in Fall, you probably are coming from cooler states and want to prolong your summer - lay in the sun by the pool, get some tan and swim. Well, that was pretty difficult because the pool was half closed for all 5 days we stayed there. Lots of work was done, we saw lots of construction workers walk around, construction fence separates the pool from other (possibly more pools?) areas, the noise sometimes was so loud, we couldn't hear the music at the pool area. Unfortunately if you are an early bird, there is NO sun at the pool area until 10.45am - the hotel building make a big shade that covers entire pools side. A few hotel guests, including us, were trying to find a sunny spot around the pool in the morning ( that was difficult too because the pool is surrounded by the construction fence) but we were kicked from different locations because we were interrupting remodeling. You would think that the hotel would do everything possible to make your stay there less inconvenient? Nope. Actually guests had to do everything possible to have their remodeling going smooth.. You will see lots of workers in the resort and lots of people in suits with clip boards in their hands who are supervising them. Every morning we woke up around 7am to a drilling sound or hammer or something else from remodeling. You will see their motto everywhere' We are changing everything\" Yes, they are, indeed, at your expense. The hotel has enough guts to charge you additional $9.99 per day fee even during that inconvenient time! Now, don't get the wrong idea - there is no construction dust. The hotel is actually very clean. It smells good, the room was very sunny and clean. Bed was incredibly soft, linens are higher quality. Nice big TV in the room ( if you went to Vegas to watch TV). Bathroom was spacious, clean with nice big bath tub. Our window was overview the pool and main strip. Room was very quiet, we didn't hear any noise from the strip at night. Food: The have South Beach cafe in the building that open 24/7. It serves decent breakfast for the cost of $7-10. Coffee, pastry, fruits, drinks are at additional cost. OR you can walk to your next door neighbors Hooter hotel, that is literally in 5 minutes walk, and get a buffet brunch at Mad Onion for $9.99. For the same price of one meal in South Beach cafe you can get all you can eat including fruits and pastries. On Sundays you can have brunch with bottomless champagne for $12.99 They have 2 restaurants - Bacio and Biscayne. We didn't go to Bacio but dined at Biscayne. It was ok. Don't plan to get any glass of wine under $12 there. We ordered a prime rib that was $30 and was just OK. Any side dish at that place is for additional cost. ( the Hooters offer prime rib dinner every day for $9.99. We never made it there but would love to hear some feedback on that) The restaurant is meant to be fine dinning but something is missing there. The idea was right but the ambiance just didn't work The hotel doesn't have bar in the gambling area so if you like to sip on your drink and watch people, that won't happen. They have Celebrity Lounge in the corner, nice bar but hardly any people there. One night there was band playing. The music was so loud, we had wait when a song is done before ordering our drinks. Service in the gambling area was incredibly slow. You will finish your game and still won't get your drink. We lost couple of ordered drinks because couldn't wait any longer. The service at the pool was very efficient - we got our drinks very fast and the waitress checked on us regularly if we need anything. Once again, it will be a very nice hotel next spring when remodeling will be done. Looks like they are opening more restaurants and more pool area.

Bathroom not totally redone - tile not replaced in shower or on floor, but everything else seemed new. Did not swim in the pool and only tried one restaurant - the restaurant was nice. The Trop is on the south end of the strip, but even if you stay centrally on the strip you still have to take a bus here and there and this was a great location to catch the bus or tram and go wherever.

The front desk staff person was really personable and efficient. The room was spacious, the bed extremely comfortable with a clean, crisp white sheet over the bedding - instead of the usual comforter or bedspread that rarely gets changed! The windows had louvered shutters instead of dusty curtains, and were aesthetically more pleasing. Nice big HD-TV. The view was decent, and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Now, the not so great stuff...We were a bit disappointed to find we had been checked into a room that clearly had not been finished by housekeeping. Within a few minutes of getting into the room, a housekeeping staff member used her key to open the door unaware that we were in the room. She then asked US if the room had been cleaned, which was upsetting. The bed was made and the room appeared to be \"ready\" at first glance, however, after the encounter with the maid (who brought a bath mat), we took a closer look. I immediately noticed there were no washcloths, so I caught the maid on her way down the hall and explained we needed them. She stated she didn't have any, that she was leaving, but would send someone up with some. Getting back to the room, and looking further, it was obvious that the carpet had not been vacuumed and that the bathroom floor had not been wiped clean. There were black streaks and hairs present. Other issues with the bathroom were mold in the shower, the tub was not a tub you would dare to take a bath in (dirty no-slip strips) and dirty areas in the tile floor grout. When there is white grout on a tile floor, housekeeping had better be prepared to keep it white. In this room, it was not, and was really dirty looking at the sink area. Later that night, upon returning to the room, well after midnight, we still had to call for the washcloths. The response was prompt and the staff member was apologetic. We had a comfortable, quiet night's sleep. The next morning we were up and out of the room by 7:00 am. We returned to the room to get ready for the evening only to find it had not been made up which meant no new towels. Another call to housekeeping...they said rooms were cleaned anywhere between 9 am and 5 pm. It was 4:30. So we asked to have the room made up while we were out and were accommodated. The next day we called to state that we would be out until 3:30 and requested that the room be made up by then and had no problems. Our request for the maid to clean the bathroom floor and the tub were honored to the best of her abilities. She placed an extra bath mat on the floor to cover the dirty grout near the sink. Hopefully it was scrubbed clean after we left since we called it to their attention. Other annoyances were: the track of the closet's sliding doors was bent to the point that only one door slid easily, the other literally had to be lifted from the track to open it to gain access to that side of the closet, and there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling where the sprinkler system came through that was way bigger than it needed to be. Minor, but it added to the sloppiness of the bathroom in general, as did the misaligned tiles and mismatched grout in the shower stall. The hotel room did have lots of hangers, drawer space, nice, hot, soft water and a multi-setting shower head. The towels could have smelled fresher, though. The location of the hotel was decent, with easy access to a number of other casino hotels and a walkway to get across busy Las Vegas Blvd. We did not use any other hotel amenities. Late one night we went to take a stroll around the pool area, which we were told was open 24 hours, but the sprinkler system was on, so that was a no-go. Would have used the pool while my spouse was using the hotel's sports book room, but it was closed to begin construction on a new one which forced us to venture out to other hotels instead of spending more time here. What we liked best was the friendly staff, and what we liked least was obviously the condition of the bathroom.

Unfortunately, after having spent most of the night (and morning) gambling at the casino downstairs (the roulette gaming staff were great fun, and having $5 roulette tables probably made me end up spending a lot more than I would have at a $10 table :) ), and having a late lunch, my friend and I got suited up in our swimming gear, went to the pool, only to find out it closes at 6pm. This probably suits the older clientele that the Tropicana attracts (we were one of the few people under 50!), but for us it was a major let down. All in all though, the place was great. I'd like to see where the Tropicana heads with their new \"changing everything\" direction.. I purposefully chose not to go to one of the more \"party\" casinos, because I wasn't really interested in hanging out with \"the beautiful people\" and the associated posturing, but likewise I found the Tropicana a bit too much of a retirement home.

The bed was extremely comfortable, and the walls were virtually sound proof (great for sleeping in after being out late.) Compared to the stay we had last year in the other tower, it was a completely different experience (kinda dark and dumpy last year). We talked to a manager to compliment him, and he said the hotel has a new owner and wanted to completely redo the \"feel\" of the hotel from old and dark to bright and new. I say he has succeeded!

My younger sister arrived at 9:30 am and had no problem checking into her room as she was the first to arrive. Once she got to her room an inspector was checking to make sure a spill was cleaned up and asked if they needed to clean it again which my sister didn't see anything so told them no. My husband and I arrived at 3:30 and had no problem with any lines to check in. My sister's room was in the Paradise Tower and was double, we were upgraded to a suite in the Paradise Tower that was absolutely AMAZING! I can not rave enough about our hotel stay at the Tropicana! I also had a friend get in at 9am the next day and was able to check in as well and the hotel accomodated us by placing us all on the same floor. I had no problem with the elevators which I thought were very neat inside. Yes, there might have been a few minute wait later in the evening but nothing you wouldn't get at any other hotel in Las Vegas on a weekend night. The rooms were so clean and the air worked completely fine. The TV's were great and in the rooms you just felt very comfortable. The beds were so fabulous and comfortable as well. The view from our room I absolutely loved as you could see right now the strip, it was like watching a movie with views of the strip. Gambling was one of the best parts of our stay, I am a roulette player so it was just awesome seeing a $5 minimum bet even on the weekends. Also, the casino floor may be smaller than some other casinos but in my opinion this is great if you want to get service. You are not sitting there long before someone walks over to ask you if you want a drink. All of the dealers as well as the cocktail services were so friendly. Moving on to the pool. It is a beautiful pool with lots of lounge chairs that are very nice and comfy. On Saturday the pool was pretty busy but we just asked a pool guy if we could get a couple of chairs and he had no problem going to get us a few extra so we could sit together. They also have a grill outside where they cook food. The best part about the pool is that there is a sushi restuarant that is set up serving their sushi and it was the BEST sushi I have ever tried. I recommend trying it to anyone. The cafe that is open 24 hours was a really good spot to get something to eat late night or anytime during the day. The breakfast was huge portions and at night it wasn't busy at all. Another plus is that if you order a drink you are allowed to go back and get refills throughout the day. There was always someone outside to direct you or help you with anything. We had 6 people in our group and the max allowed in a cab is 5 so the bellman suggested we take the Tropicana limo which was $60 and seeing as we were going down the strip pretty fair it actuallly made sense to take it as we would have probably spent $40 for two cabs. We had an enjoyable ride down the strip and had comp water to sip on. Instead of riding in a cab that we have to make go the back roads to keep the cost down. We also took advantage of the comedy buy 2 for the price of 1 tickets and the show was hilarious. I laughed so hard that I was crying. They really have a great comedy show at the hotel and it's a great size of room. Also make sure you sign up for a players card because I was really surprised at the end of my trip when I found out we had over $100 in comps to use however we wanted. All in all this was the best trip to VEGAS I have had and that is all thanks to the Tropicana as well as Nicole Marshall. Nicole really helped in making this trip the BEST and I really appreciated all she did for us. Don't think twice about the Tropicana, because it is the place to stay and they are continuing to make changes and listening to what the customer says. You will be very happy with what you get.

The bed was very comfortable and the large flat screen TV was great. Plus it had a safe large enough to store a laptop unlike some other hotels in Vegas that have the smaller sized version of a safe. The casino is small though that is still being worked on, though it was no problem to get on a table. Plenty of slots. Not much for entertainment during the middle of the week but maybe that will change as all the rooms are completed and the hotel fills up. The pool was great and they had comfortable lounge chairs with padding unlike a lot of the other locations in town.

In fact, I was a bit embarrassed to admit I was staying at the Tropicana when asked which hotel I would be staying during my Las Vegas trip. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very freindly and courteous door man named Dean. He informed us that perhaps we would be able to check in early which we were able to do.

The room had a very tropical feel, was very clean, and had a great view. The pool area was amazing. All of the staff were very courteous including the front door, the front desk, the pool staff, concierge and housekeeping. We made requestes for an extra door sign and for extra towels which were delivered promptly. All questions were answered respectfully and all the staff was very helpful.

As many have noted in other reviews, the beds are so comfortable, just this side of heaven, with down comforters. Even the 42\" plasma tv was a nice bonus.

Their new marketing showcasing the much needed renovations is what changed my mind. The group: I think it's always helpful to know what kind of people are writing the review so you know what our expectations/needs were. We are laid-back late-20-something professionals from the midwest, somewhat low rollers (we like $5 blackjack). Four of us had just been in Vegas in February, staying at the Aria. One other had stayed at the Encore the last trip, and the other was a Vegas virgin. All of us understood that we were taking a step down staying at the Trop, so we had certainly adjusted our expectations. The hotel generally: the renovations look great. There was usually somenoe at the door to open the doors for you, always with a smile and a hello. Once you walk in through the newly done entrance, the airy, light casino floor opens up. After staying at the Aria my last trip (I know, quite a different type of resort!), the big thing I noticed was how bright everything is at the Trop. The renovations are ongoing but mostly out of sight - there are temporary walls erected around the casino so you don't have to see the men at work. There is a slight coconut scent in the entrance area - one out of the six of us did not like it, I liked it a lot, and the other four did not mind it much. Definitely not as overpowering and offensive as the scent in the Venetian. The rooms: We had three rooms - two in the Paradise tower and one in the Island tower. All the rooms we had were newly renovated. I'd say the rooms are solidly 3.5 star rooms. Everything is clean, and, like the hotel, airy and light. The 42\" plasma TVs have HD channels, which is not always the case for a lot of the 3 to 4 star hotels on the strip. Toiletries were adequate - your standard shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, lotion and soap. They were scented with a coconut scent to go with the general motif of the hotel - again, I found it very pleasant, but one friend thought it was tacky. The bed was very comfortable. I understand the complaints people have with the shutters. They definitely do not block out all the light. I personally didn't mind because I woke up around 7:30am anyway, but I can see that if you're a light sleeper, you might not like it. None of the people in my party seemed to have trouble sleeping well into late morning, however. One bonus was that you are able to open the windows just a crack, to let some fresh air in. Island Tower vs. Paradise Tower: The rooms are essentially identical, but I think if I were to go back, I would stay at the Paradise Tower - it's very close to the casino floor and the entrance. In fact, it's so close to the entrance that I realized that the MGM Grand casino floor is closer to get to for someone staying at the Tropicana Paradise Tower than for some of the folks staying at the MGM Grand! However, the Island Tower would be very nice for people who want to use the pool - the elevator takes you basically right up to the pool. Which brings us to... The pool: I read in a review that the Trop has the best resort rate to pool quality ratio, and I have to agree with that. The pool is relaxing and unassuming - an \"ultrapool\" it was not, and that's a good thing. About 1/3 or so of the pool area was closed for renovation, but we were always able to get 4 chairs together (2 of our friends weren't much for the pool) and they always kept the free water filled (one was cucumber infused, one was lime infused). Drinks were a little overpriced - we did not order drinks after the first day. The gym: there is a small gym near the pool area. It was hardly used but had all the basic equipment you need - treadmills, a few machines, a variety of freeweights. Not great but, hey, it's free. The casino: The casino was very small, although I didn't mind that much, since I only play at one table at any given time anyway! Plus it made it easy for us to say \"meet at the blackjack tables\". As of last week, there were about a dozen tables open and a bunch of slot machines, but I understand that another renovated section of the casino is opening soon. I appreciated the fact that there was 3:2 $5 blackjack basically all the time. Swim-up blackjack was also pretty fun - a little gimmicky (you basically just sit in about 3 ft of water while you play) but fun for an hour or two. The casino never felt super exciting, even when it got fairly busy, probably because it was so small. The restaurants: There were 4 restaurants when I visited, including the steakhouse which had just opened. We tried all but the steakhouse. Bacio is the mid-range Italian restaurant. We had pasta dishes, pizza and salad among us. The portions are huge (2 or 3 people could probably have split the spaghetti) and quality is decent enough for the price range ($11-16 entrees). The Havanna Cafe was a good cheap option - cheap but not poor quality, mind you. My girlfriend said the veggie reuben was probably the best that she's ever had. The South Beach deli is open 24 hours and very mediocre - I would not recommend it unless you just need a quick bite at late hour. We also had coffee from the Starbucks kiosk near the conference center area - the coffee was not burnt, so that's always a plus (I noticed that a lot of coffee kiosks on the Strip burn their coffee by keeping the coffee on too long). Complaints: I do have a couple of minor complaints. First, there was a timeshare scamster set up as an \"information\" desk right near the check-in on the casino floor. Very tacky. I walked away saying I just want to go to the room, so you would think they would've taken a hint, but when I came back down to the casino area they tried to talk to me again (\"all settled in?\" etc). Second, more minor complaint: there were two conventions while we stayed, some kind of kids' martial arts convention and a kids' dance competition. That filled the hotel up with a lot of families, some with unruly kids. I understand it might be good business to get those conventions in there but THE reason I don't stay at the Excalibur is because of all the unruly kids - it'd be nice to phase out the family events. Lastly: there was almost no shopping to be done. I understand that part of the renovations includes putting in new shopping, though, and it's certainly not a priority for me. Final words: I enjoyed the Trop immensely. I had low, low expectations, which were certainly exceeded and then some. For the price, I don't think you can get much better than the Trop right now on the strip, in terms of hotel/room/pool quality and location. And the renovations keep going! I'd be very curious to see what the Garden rooms look like after the renovations - it would be awesome if they were as nice as the Island and Paradise rooms, and they keep the balconies. I also would love to return when the Nikki Beach stuff is done.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbia, sc", "Title": "\u201cClassy and clean with a fabulous staff!\u201d", "Author": "webb2010", "ReviewID": "UR77583669", "Content": "When we pulled up to the Tropicana we were promply greeted by the bellman.

After spending the first night in a room with an airport view, I kindly requested to move to a more appealing room with a better view, since this was my husband's first time in Las Vegas. Kimberlee quickly obliged with a smile, reserving us a room which would be ready in the early afternoon in the Paradise tower with a much better view at no additional charge. That's right folks, free upgrade! When it was time for us to move, my husband was busy in a poker tournament and so Chuy came to move our things from one room to the other. He was super friendly, and his service level again, was out of this world, right down to setting up our suitcase on a luggage rack in the new room. While we were there, we decided to eat at the South Beach Cafe, which is open 24 hours for room service as well. A really nice staff member there let us in on a little secret that is the $8 coffee tumbler. This got us free coffee for the entire time we stayed there, which is a HUGE savings with the way we drink coffee! We ate there several times for a few reasons: 1. It's SUPER cheap, compared to the other options out there. 2. The portions are HUGE, so hubby & I were able to split our meals. 3. The food is AMAZING! 4. They're FAST. We made our way down to the pool a couple times to take a quick dip and cool off from the hot desert sun, but this isn't finished yet. The open pool was far less exciting than the old one, but I have to give them a break here since the remodel won't be complete until next year. I will say that it was fairly large, not crowded, good temperature & had REALLY comfy lounge chairs. The swim-up blackjack tables were closed both times we were there, which kind of bummed me out, but other than that, it definitely got the job done. The location of this hotel was also perfect for us, since we stayed primarily on the south end of the Strip anyway. Although, even if you plan to venture further north on the strip, transportation options are abundant and easily accessible. The monorail is quite close at the MGM next door, and the Deuce has a stop right out front of the hotel. Overall, the Tropicana WELL-exceeded any expectations I had going into this trip, as I was just hoping for a bargain hotel and wasn't expecting any great service or luxury experience. We chose the Trop simply because it was a cheap bed for the night that was close to the action. We got WAY more than I ever expected, and I was pleasantly surprised! Thank you to the staff at the Tropicana for making my husband's first visit to Las Vegas unforgettable, in the best possible way!", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cJust ok\u201d", "Author": "crucibroke", "ReviewID": "UR76977823", "Content": "I choose the Tropicana over other comparable hotels due to the fact that they boast newly remodeled rooms in the Paradise Tower.

Cons: Check-In took way too long - about 20 minutes before we even reached the counter. The line was all the way down the lobby, and yet they only had 2 employees staffing the counter. Such an antiquated system \u2013 they still use adding machines to total your bill! The lady helping us had to redo her math 3 times! We believe the air-conditioner in our room was leaking condensation. There was a huge wet spot in the corner of the room. House-keeping said we could either have someone sent to assess the situation or we could opt for a new room (we didn\u2019t want to deal with the front desk again). We declined. While it was unsettling to step barefoot into a puddle of unknown substance, it wasn\u2019t ultimately bothersome. We had to call to get our room serviced. House-keeping somehow missed our room after the first night. We opted for the delivery of few towels, as we didn\u2019t want to leave and wait for housekeeping to show up and clean. While the room was nice, the tile in the bathroom was pretty worn (a relic from the room pre remodel?). It detracted from the overall appearance. Don\u2019t trust the advertising regarding the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Legends. They promote a $34.99 four course meal with wine pairing. Sounded great until we were seated and found that it\u2019s only a \u201ctasting\u201d menu (small portions) and the wine (not even full glasses) is not paired with the last course. If we had been aware of the bait-and-switch, we would have gone elsewhere. Because we were short on time, we had to stay. Service was terrible. Not exaggerating, we sat for 15 minutes with finished plates and empty glasses between EACH course before we were even acknowledged. Food wasn\u2019t great either.

However, the floors were a little dirty with tons of scuff marks. Other than that no complaints. The water pressure in the shower was awesome! The casino area was good. Everything was spread out a little due to the ongoing construction, but it wasn't bad. I didn't think there were that many table games, but am hoping once everything is completed there will be more. There were a nice assortment of slot machines. The service in the casino was a little slow, but not bad. We spent Saturday afternoon by the pool and had a good time. There were plenty of servers and Lifegaurds on duty. Our server, Cory, took great care of us. My only complaint is that it can get slippery by the pool, I was walking over to check in and slipped and fell. I wasn't hurt, but have a little bruise on my knee. Another woman slipped as well. Hopefully when the pool gets redone, they can put another kind of floor in. I think it gets slippery because its so smooth, maybe a more textured floor would be better. The pool area is great, lots of trees which provided nice shade. There was good music playing and people were having a blast. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night. It was ok. The penne I ate had lots of veggies in it, but didn't really have much of a sauce. My boyfriend had the chicken picatta, which was slightly overcooked and a bit dry. However, the clam chowder was amazing!! The best we'd ever had. We would probably try it again and order different things. Overall, we had a great time at the Tropicana.

I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for around $50, but not in the summer months - too hot and rates are really competetive I would stay here in a heartbeat in cooler months. Mostly because I love the fresh rooms and it is a little smaller than other casinos.

I came across recent reviews and pictures of the Trop and decided to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. I had booked an Island Tower room but was upgraded to a 20th floor strip view Paradise Tower room when I told the friendly front desk agent we were there to celebrate my birthday and had a very long day getting there thanks to the airline. There were literally no lines at check in. The room was spotless. It was a smoking room but I couldn't tell other than the ashtray and matches in the bathroom. It felt like we were the first people to stay there. The 42\" HDTV was incredible. The bed and sheets were beyond comfortable and on most nights I slept great, however the walls are incredibly thin. Our second night there our neighbors had a raging party and it sounded like there were 30 people in the room. I realize this is Vegas so I didn't raise a stink and luckily I was so exhausted from my day I fell asleep again in the middle of the festivities. The next day I could literally hear every word of one guy's phone conversation in the same room. The other problem with the room is the blinds on the windows let in an incredible amount of light in the morning, despite the fact that I had them completely closed. It woke me up every day and it was tough to get back to sleep. I think they could easily install curtiains in front of the windows and blinds to correct this. The bathroom was nice, but I think with the upgrades they could have done more. The tub and shower were standard and I would have preferred a stall shower similar to what Mandalay Bay has. The sink area was great. The maids did a good job cleaning up but for some reason didn't like replacing our soap. Twice during our stay they took the bar of soap that we had just opened and didn't replace it. They also didn't replace our bath mat one day and we had to use a towel instead. I can't comment on the pool because we never used it. I wish we could have but it was over 110 degrees and the thought of lying out in that heat wasn't appealing to me. It looked great though, and the lounge chairs looked really nice as well. In visiting the other casinos on the strip you get the idea of how tiny the Trop is compared to everything else. This was both a good and bad thing. It was great because I literally had to walk a few feet to the elevators after checking in and when coming back from being out all day. The down side is that there really isn't anything going on at the Trop at this time. I know they're renovating but there are hardly any dining options or stores to check out. Other than the comedy club there aren't any shows, and the casino was tiny and due to the renovations it's kind of scattered. There are slots thrown here and there without any organization. The location of the Trop is ok, but be prepared to walk or take a cab to the heart of the strip. The walking was rough in the heat and cab prices added up very fast. As others have stated, the service is very friendly. We were greeted by everyone we passed and when we asked a maid in a hall for some soap, we were gladly given several bars.

I noted that the Paradise tower had been completely remodeled in January of 2010. I noted the pictures of the renovated rooms and they looked pretty good. I decided to book a room for three nights. The end cost before resort fees was $160.00. Upon arriving the bellhop were nice and we tried to check in (9am) and unfortunately they sold out the night before so rooms would not be available until after noon or so which was not an issue as check in is at 3pm. Upon arriving to the room it looked new nice and fresh. The rooms, hallways and elevators were much nicer than last year. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. I am thinking of purchasing the same brand due to how nice it was. The AC was set to 60 degrees in the hotel and it stayed that way the whole time we were there. It was nice to come back to a comfortable hotel room after a days walking around. One day we arrived back at the hotel at 3am in the morning. I decided to go alone into the casino to see what was happening. There were a few people around a craps table having a great time and the staff was into it and laughing along with everyone. I watched the craps table for about an hour. The rest of the casino (which is ridiculously small as compared to other casinos) had maybe 10 people on machines 10-20 people in the table area. I noted that there was a woman walking around that looked out of place. She seemed to have no direction except eyeing people. She was very skinny and very tall black woman dressed with minimal clothing. After she wandered around for a while there was a very built black man and a very skinny tall black woman wandering around in the same manner. It appeared that they didn't know where they were going and looked out of place. The first thing that came to my mind was a pimp and a prostitute. Giving the people the benefit of the doubt I shrugged the thought off. I walked around the slot machines for a while and noticed a third skinny tall black woman that again looked out of place. This woman had her arms around two obviously drunken looking white men in their 20's sitting at a couple of machines. It was obvious that she did not know them and was propositioning them for something. I try to give the people the benefit of the doubt as to what this woman was up to but there were too many factors that this person was out of place and trying soliciting something. I didn't see anyone of the staff members or security approach these people and ask what they were doing. Besides that the only negatives were that one morning there were loud indistinguishable noises coming from the hallway or above floor like maintenance work. I think I would recommend this hotel for its price and value but I will personally be staying somewhere to get a little atmosphere change and be closer to the middle of the strip and a hotel with a decent casino.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cnice new rooms....excellent service\u201d", "Author": "phoenixdeb", "ReviewID": "UR74777383", "Content": "after seeing so many good reviews of this hotel lately we decided to book a new room, as there are some really good deals out there for this hotel during the summer months. we were pleasantly suprised at the quality and cleanliness of the new rooms and we were very pleased with the excellent customer service we recieved form everybody. our check in was fast and courteous, all requests were graciously honored and early check in was not a problem. since the hotel is undergoing renovation, there isnt a big selection of places to eat, so if you are looking for a \"destination\" resort, look elsewhere...if walking across the street to other hotels to eat for a better selection of restaurants is ok with you, then this lack of selection will not be a problem. the steak house is open, but pricey and the coffee place is open and is very good for breakfast and quick sandwiches. gaming is ok.......table games were fun due to great dealers and low minimums for betting......slots were new and fairly plentiful. of course, there will be alot more gaming when all is done and from what i can tell, the casino will be beautiful. the pool is up and running, but there are even more plans to expand and renovate it. the pool is still surrounded by lush gardens, grass and trees that are still there from the original Trop (YEAH!!!!). i cant wait for end-of-renovation-day as i think this will be a beautiful, fun place to stay in a year or so. for those of us who are old enough to remember the original Trop this is a very welcome renovation. there wasnt a better place to stay and play than the old hotel, so i hope they get it right again. i cant wait!!!!!", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "mmarnimitchell", "ReviewID": "UR74767295", "Content": "I stayed at the Tropicana for 3 nights from the moment I walked in the door the service was outstanding and the pool was great.

I thought I knew what we were buying, when we booked our room at the Tropicana, I had stayed there several years ago. I was completely wrong\u2026 I could hardly believe what I saw as I walked in to the Tropicana. I knew the property was undergoing a renovation, but this is complete transformation. If memory serves me correct, the hotel was dark, dingy and very smoky. I walked through the door and saw bright, crisp clean and new. Add to that, no trace of cigarette smoke (which is a HUGE bonus in my eyes) and I knew this stay would be nothing like the first time I had visited. That was just the beginning. When I got to my room the bedding and furnishings were also brand new, including new flat screen TV\u2019s. One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in while traveling. And, I travel for my job, frequently. Absolutely incredible! The guestrooms & bathrooms are both very spacious. The pool, which is where I spent the majority of my time was still wonderful. The pool attendant also mentioned that it would be resurfaced and have a little \u201cfacelift\u201d once it closes for the season, sometime in October. However, the pool at the Tropicana has always been wonderful, so I\u2019ve got no complaints. Finally, I know construction was taking place during our stay, but I definitely did not hear any \"construction\" noises and I was completely impressed with what is complete so far. Everything from new carpet, wall coverings, linens, the casino and I know more is coming.

After reading several positive reviews about the Tropicana, I decide to book a room and take advantage of their summer deal ( 3nights stay with the 3rd night free). We arrived ten minutes before check in so we toured the hotel. Although there were some construction going on, it was not distracting. The walk ways were well let. The hotel had a delicious but not over powering coconut smell to set a tropical mood. The pool was very clean and attractive for all ages. It was not overly crowed like other resorts and there were plenty of lounge chairs for guest. - Gerad checked us in quickly. He was very friendly and full of smiles. He went over all the hotel fees, attractions, and entertainment. He made us feel like VIP; Thank you Gerad. - We stayed in the new rooms in the Paradise Tower. BEAUTIFUL AND SPACIOUS. The rooms are a must stay. The decor was modern. The king size bed was very comfortable and supportive( especially after long walks on the strip). There were plenty of closet and bathroom space. We had a fabulous view of the strip. The blinds kept all the flashy lights out so we slept peacefully. -The pool staff was friendly. They always made sure there were clean towels. The life guards were aware, professional, and enforce pool rules when guest were being reckless. - The sandwiches at South Beach Cafe were delicious and quite big. Had to share a sandwich with my husband. The Questionable: - Right after we checked in we were approach by Peter from guest services. He explained about the Polo Tower hotel tour and wanted set up an appointment. I kindly thanked him for the offer but explained it's our first time in Vegas and decline the offer. I then asked him about the hotel's reward services and if he could direct me towards the reward center. He told me,\" It's my first day working at Tropicana so I don't know. You'll have to ask another staff.\" I just stared at him as he turned around, drank his coffee, and began a conversation with another staff. I was extremely shock by his rude and unprofessional behavior and attitude. Every time we think of the beautiful Tropicana we will always think of Peter's horrible service. - Check-out was complicated. Gwen checked us out but over charged us for an extra night. I had to pull out my first receipt and explained that I had book for the summer package. She apologize and corrected the situation. We spent quiet some time waiting for the mistake to be cleared; We waited a few days for the money to be returned into our account. - Housekeeping was okay. They were friendly and provided my husband and I with clean towels. However, on our last day we decided to sleep in until 11:30am (since we don't check out until 1pm). We put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door handle. However, house keeping knock on the door and woke us up so they could come in. Overall, the Tropicana is a beautiful hotel located perfectly on the strip (not too far but not too close to the traffic). Some staff provide great customer service and others need to be re-trained. I'm not sure if I will stay at the Tropicana again after my bad experience but I would suggest it to others who may have better luck and not experience what my husband and I went through.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe had an excellent time at the Tropicana!\u201d", "Author": "chrisandbrent", "ReviewID": "UR74225876", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from 4 nights/5 days in Las Vegas. We were celebrating our 16th anniversary so it was important that this trip go well. We have only been on one other 'major' trip (to Mexico) and I managed to get 2nd degree sunburn on the 1st full day so we were confined to our hotel room because I couldn't walk. Needless to say, that trip was a wash............ I contacted the hotel via email a few days before we arrived to ask about setting up some type of surprise for my husband, maybe chocolate covered strawberries in the room or something (I wanted to make up for the last disaster). The person that I corresponded with was very pleasant and advised me that they would have 'amenities' in our room, compliments of the hotel staff . (I apologize if this seems long winded but if you want to know what the hotel is all about, read on.) We arrived at the hotel just after noon on Sunday and found the lobby to be quite busy with check in/check out. The line up was kind of long but one of the hotel staff asked anyone waiting in line if they would like a bottle of water. In speaking to the front desk clerk, we were advised that our room was not ready yet and that we should come back in roughly an hour or so. I had to ask if there was something that we could do about our luggage because we didn't really feel like dragging luggage around outside in 103 F temperature. The clerk suggested that we find the doorman. We did look for the doorman for about 20 minutes but I guess he was on his break so we decided to sit outside and wait it out. I am not going to fault the hotel for any wrongdoing because the check in time is 3:00 PM (I believe). The Room: We stayed in room 2025 which has been recently updated. Nice room, super comfortable bedding/linens, large flat screen tv and a nice day bed lounger in front of the window. The only things we found wrong with the room were 1) looks like someone left some dark clothing on the tiles in the bathroom, which unfortunately stained the tiles & 2) there is a cover on the glass of the windows that makes taking pictures of the view kind of difficult. It would have been nice if the covering on the windows had been plain instead of black with little holes. Other than that, room was great! Location: The Tropicana is located at the intersection of Tropicana & Las Vegas Blvd South. The other three hotels at the same intersection are the MGM Grand, The Excalibur & New York New York. There is tons of stuff to see so make sure you have good soled shoes because you will do plenty of walking. It would be nice if the hotel was a little further north down the strip but you still have access to take the monorail or the 'Deuce' (double decker bus) to go further north down the strip. For us, the only major drawback to the location of this hotel was the fact that all of the helicopters use Tropicana Avenue as their guide to get back to the airport. The helicopters are going all day long and it can get annoying after a while. Restaurants: We only ate at the South Beach Cafe here. Menu is somewhat limited but the food that we ordered was excellent. Really good chicken wings! One thing that really impressed me about this little restaurant was the staff. They were pleasant, friendly and always smiling. Menu prices were reasonable. Pool Area: When I originally checked out this hotel on the hotel's website, I found it to be lacking information & pictures. What little pictures and write ups there were lead me to expect something other than what was actually there. On the website, it offers 'swim up to your own private island ($50/day)'. I was expecting that you would swim to this little island but in fact, it is just part of the pool deck sectioned off....you're still at the main swimming pool. To me, it just seemed like you would be paying $50 to reserve a lounge chair at the pool. As for the pool itself, it's a nice large pool and you never felt like it was over-crowded. There were always lounge chairs available. One thing about the lounge chairs on the pool deck was that it reminded me of a cruise ship, with all the chairs lined up in rows which kind of sucks because you don't really have the option of moving them around too far. The pool deck seems to need a little bit of grit or something on it....my husband watched a kid slip on the deck and fell onto his head. Be careful when getting out of the pool and walk slow. The lifeguards are on duty and won't hesitate to blow the whistle at anyone running on the deck. They also use a squeegie type tool to push the pooled up water on the pool deck into the drains. There were a couple of drawbacks that we noted...1) as they are still renovating, they have a section fenced off and on the other side of the fence, it looks like there might have been a pool or lagoons or something. Every now and then, if the wind shifted the wrong way, you would get a strong smell of sewage. I am assuming that it was just the stagnant water on the other side of the fence but it was unpleasant at times...and 2) there is a sign in the hotel, at the doors leading to the pool, advising guests that there is to be no 'outside' food or drink beyond the sign. I can understand not having glass containers brought down onto the pool deck, but I still think you should be able to bring your own bottled water, juice or pop (as long as it is in a plastic bottle), as well as snacks. There is a bar at the pool offering beverages (kind of pricey) but they do have two containers offering super ice cold water (for FREE). One container has lemons/limes with the water and the other has sliced cucumbers. I was a little sketchy about the 'cucumber' water but you have to try it.....it was really good and refreshing! The Casino: I can't really comment too much about the casino, to me, they are pretty much all the same. This hotel does offer you to sign up to be a club member (as do most, I believe) and during our stay, there was also a promotion to scratch off an amount on a ticket. Both my husband and I both got the same amount ($10) but that $10 was loaded onto our member cards and gave us $10 in free play. I thought that was nice of them to give you money to play with. (We made our way to the Riviera and signed up as 'club members' there and they gave us a WHOLE DOLLAR!) Housekeeping/Cleanliness: The housekeeping staff member that I met was great. I had to run back up to the room for something and she was already in our room. I said hello and she was very friendly and very apologetic when she asked that I put my card 'key' into the door, for security purposes. I had no problem with that and thanked her for doing that. I appreciated the position she was in and doing that was fine with me! Our room was always clean and the little shampoo/conditioner/shower gel & lotion bottles were always replenished if they were getting low. Some hotels give you the token bottles but they never get replaced so that was also a nice touch. The rest of the hotel was always clean. The Staff: So remember earlier, I mentioned about the staff member that I corresponded with via email and was promised complimentary amenities in our room? We arrived Sunday, got up to the room and nothing was there. No problem, I figured that they were waiting for me to check in. Sunday evening, nothing. Monday and Tuesday go by with no contact by the staff member or the other four staff members that were also copied on the email. On Wednesday, I was a little annoyed and went to the front desk to ask that a message be left with that particular staff member to advise her that we had checked in on Sunday and would be checking out on Thursday. One of the front desk staff members, Gwen, overheard my conversation and pulled me into another area (away from my husband because it was supposed to be a surprise) and asked me to explain the situation. After explaining, Gwen was horrified that a staff member would do such a thing. I suggested that maybe there was just a communication error but she was still shaking her head saying that what happened was wrong. She sent my husband and I to the South Beach Cafe for a complimentary breakfast and when we returned to our room later that afternoon, there was a beautiful wine & cheese basket delivered to our room, along with chocolate covered strawberries and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, which was signed by all the Front Desk staff working that day. Gwen went out of her way to see that the error was corrected and I cannot stress enough how thoughtful that was as well as appreciated. So now to the pros & cons: PROS: 1) Cleanliness of the hotel, 2) The Staff, 3) Nice pool, 4) Relatively good location on the strip, 5) Our flight didn't leave until 7:55 PM but the Bell Desk stored our luggage until our airport shuttle arrived, 6) Ice makers on every floor, along with pop machine ($2/pop). CONS: 1) Helicopters use Tropicana Avenue as their guide to get back to the airport and these things are flying non-stop all day long so it can get annoying, 2) No fridge in room, 3) If you don't have a credit card, you have to have your phoneline 'turned on' in order to make a local call, 4) Resort fees.....if you have to pay the resort fees, the internet should be included. I did bring our laptop but it was $12.99 for 24 hours, which I certainly wasn't going to pay since I didn't plan on sitting on the computer long enough to get my money's worth. I just wanted to send our kids an email to advise them that we arrived safely but it was cheaper to text, 5) Telemarketers right in the hotel lobby, trying to sell you timeshares. We had never been to Vegas before so we had no idea what was really going on. We had only just arrived when we got cornered by two woman, which I thought were part of the hotel staff. We were offered a ride in the limo, free dinners and show tickets and we stood there listening to all of this until she mentioned '2 hour presentation'. STOP! We're on vacation.......not shopping for condos! (Just as a side note: these people are not limited to the hotel lobby, they are EVERYWHERE, in every hotel and I swear, on every street corner! Just learn to say 'no thank you'. Also, while I'm on the topic of street corners.....both men & women will be on the sidewalks, spread out along the strip. They have business cards that they 'snap' and 'click' and try and shove into your hands. These business cards are for 'escorts' (ya right). They even have a catalogue! Only in Vegas, LOL! To the women reading this, don't be offended if your husband is offered these cards, these people offer this stuff to EVERYONE, including kids, so if you plan on bringing your kids along (which I personally wouldn't recommend), have a pep talk with them BEFORE you start your journey. You will also find many, many vendors on the walkways/sidewalks offering you water for $1. If you go when it is as hot as it was for us, you will appreciate paying the $1/bottle, and the water is ICE COLD! Also, if you are in the mood to get a tattoo, we found a shop further north down the strip, Rockstar Tattoo, located between the Wynn & the Riviera. Shop rates $100/hour much better than the rates charged further south on the strip in hotels.) This hotel is in the middle of a major transformation. There were guests of all ages but it seemed like there were a lot of 'mature' adults. It looks to me like the Tropicana is trying to bring in a new group of guests and they are well on their way of achieving their goals. There is a new 'beach' concept that is scheduled for completion in 2011 which looks really cool. So would we recommend this hotel to others or stay there again?? Most definately!! Even though there were a few bumps along the way, we had an excellent time. We will definately be back because we didn't see half the stuff we wanted to and I am rather intrigued to see the completion of the renovations. Not to mention the staff, their kindness did not go unnoticed and they need to pat themselves on the back for a job well done! No one was rude, other than a lot of tourists, who don't know how to say please or thank you when the door is held open, etc. We could always tell when someone was Canadian because they were either smiling, thanking you or apologizing for bumping into you.

I have been to Las Vegas numerous time and this was the best hotel so far. To start, upon check in we were given vouchers for free shows and drinks, not buy 1 get 1 or $ off the price, it was totally free. That was so great! To feel valued right from the moment you check in. Actually, come to think of it the doormen were also great even before we got into the hotel and help us to get our bags inside and up the steps. Our room was not the fanciest but still, it was clean and comfortable. We asked for a strip view and were given a room on the side looking out to the MGM and a part of the strip. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting for a view but still was beautiful. We were 3 floors up but there was no noise from the strip below. We had a television, safe, couch and table in our room with the king bed we requested. After leaving our room, we went to the bar near a little restaurant, I think it may have been a deli, the bar was in a corner with only a few machines and sort of away from the main crowd. The bartender was extremely nice and friendly and new we were Canadian by our drinks. He proceeded to tell us the origin of our drinks and how they related to Canadians. I thought it was very nice that he went out of his way to know facts about other countries and to share them with us. It made us feel special. The drinks he made were perfect, I don't always get my drink exactly as I want it but he got it bang on. We had a few drinks and then left. We had gone back later and each day after in hopes he would be there again but no luck. We ate at the deli/restaurant near the theater and elevators to our room, it was great. I tried several different items and all satisfied me quite nice. We also ate at the buffet, you can get a 24 hour pass for $30, not a 1 day pass but a 24 hour pass. We got ours early in the day so we could have breakfast, lunch, dinner and then breakfast again the next morning before it expired. LOVED IT!!! The food was good, great selection, and the wait staff were very friendly every time. There is a self serve drink station but a few times the wait staff would go and get our drinks for us. Very nice! There is a resort fee but I can't remember what it was or what it included. I have read alot of reviews complaining about this fee but it seems to be becoming popular among the hotels in Vegas, so get used to it.

We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and our 10th wedding anniversary. We booked our room from the hotels website and got a package deal which included a standard room in the Paradise tower. Before we left I contacted Nicole Marshall, the Guest Experience Manager. I explained to her the reason for our visit and asked if I could get a free upgrade or discount. I honestly did not expect to hear back from her but a few days after sending her the email she replied telling us she arranged for us to stay in one of their suites for no additional fees. We were very surprised and couldn't wait to get to Las Vegas. Our package included VIP check in. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and went to the VIP line. There was one other couple waiting to check in in this area and about 20 people trying to check in in the non VIP line. We waited only a few minutes and then we were greeted by Doug. Doug explained to us that our room was not ready yet and to come back around 1pm. He informed us that we could check our luggage at the bell desk, which we did. We went and had lunch and returned at 1pm. Doug explained to us that our room still was not ready and to come back at 2pm. It was a little frustrating but well worth the wait. They did not want to move us into another suite because the one we were booked in was a great suite. So at 2pm we finally were able to get into our room. All I can say is WOW - WOW - WOW! It was unbelievable. I have posted some pictures for you all to see as well. Two HUGE rooms and the view was outstanding. We were right on the corner of the strip and could see MGM, NYNY and all the way down the strip. We took a look around the room and everything was just perfect. I could still smell the fresh paint. The bed was so comfortable my husband even made a comment about it. He normally wakes up with a sore back but he said that with this bed he did not. There were only a few things that were not working right - the brand new TV in the living area would skip channels (so we just watched the TV that was in our bedroom) and the AC unit in the bedroom would make a terrible noise during the night. (On the last night my husband got up and tapped the unit a couple times and that made the noise go away). The hotel itself was still being remodeled but it was very clean, NO NOISE at all!! The pool was great, very clean and refreshing. The casino/hotel is much smaller than the ones close by but this is what we liked. It was easy to find your way around. The elevator to the Paradise tower was right by the front door. The elevators are not air conditioned but we did not have to wait for the elevator like others have mentioned in their reviews. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The people that work there were always very friendly and because of the upgrade that Nicole gave it made this vacation one to remember. My husband and I did not want to leave. I would highly recommend staying at the Tropicana!

There are signs that clearly state that Tropicana is not responsible for anything that happens to your car while parked there, however, it seems like security guards might notice someone attempting to break into a car with a crowbar. We understood the casino not being liable for the damage and when we noticed the damage we tried to file a report so the insurance company and rental car companywould know of the damage and attempted break in. This is where we had problems. We talked to a security guard who referred us inside to talk to a security supervisor named George Cardenas who was EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL.

After waiting in a long line to check in, after seeing a scared face of a lady that was checking us in, I asked what's wrong and she said there is a problem with a room- meaning- there isn't any for us!Come on, we paid for it in May!And we were on our honeymoon which made us much more angry. Some other guy came and started to search something in the computer with no comment. We stayed there for I think 15-20 minutes. He told us they are overbooked because it is 4th of July so he will give us a room in the old Island Tower. We said we don't want the old one, because we booked our room in May and paid for it 120 $ per night. He told he can't do anything and left. with now I am sorry or anything. Nothing. We didn't like that- no appology at all.What could we do, it was 4th of July weekend and everything was booked so we had to took the old room. The room was huge, but very old, like from the 80, but the view was spectacular. Trully , we were affraid to walk barefoot on the carpet. It was hideous with some red stain just in the middle of the room. Everything was old, even tv. The next day we were told , we can move to our new room. First they told us, someone will come to pick us up and our luggage, but when I called the reception we end up going to the lobby with our luggage, waiting in a long line again to get the key to our new room. Our new renovated room was wonderfull, worth the price 120$ a night. Everything was new, even shampoo and gel shower was different- better!( we could compare). It is like a different world. In the end, we liked the hotel, the pool area is great, though casino is small which is not a problem, because MGM is really close.

I was not sure what to expect but Nicole Marshall answered all of my questions and reassured me of whatever I was questioning. She is definitely an asset to the Tropicana and without her assistance I would have picked another place to stay while in Vegas, but I sure am glad I went with the Tropicana. I did tell one of the front desk staff to tell her I said thank you because we had a wonderful experience. This was our first time in Las Vegas and everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and helpful. I actually liked the size of the casino at the Tropicana because it was adequate and I didn't get lost like I did in some of the bigger hotels and casino's. Even though the Tropicana is at the end of the strip, it always had a lot of people in it. We stayed in the newly renovated Paradise Tower and it was absolutely beautiful. The beds were especially comfy and cozy and my fiance' certainly enjoyed the size of the T.V., when we did watch it. We had a wonderful view of the MGM and could see the beautiful lights at nighttime. The bathroom was nice as well and the room service was great. We always had fresh towels and our bed linens were changed about every day, even though we didn't request our bed linens to be changed everyday, clean linens are always great! When I showed pictures to my family, they all thought the hotel and bedrooms were beautiful. If I had a question the front desk answered it and they always were very helpful. Even though the Tropicana is at the end of the strip, there was transportation available in front of the hotel (across from Excalibur) or you could walk over pass the MGM and buy a $7 24 hour shuttle pass. I only had a couple of issues with the hotel. The first being the elevator's were extremely hot but I am pretty sure they were trying to fix that. The wait for the elevator to take you to your floor or to the main lobby/casino level took FOREVER and there was always crowds of people waiting. There is only four elevators and I didn't see any stairs to take. We were pretty much at the top of the hotel but I wouldn't have minded walking up them if it meant not waiting forever. The hotel is clean, but they always had cleaning ladies directly in front of the elevators or near the elevators mopping or what not, but oh well, at least the floor was clean! It was kind of annoying because there's really only one or two ways to get to the elevator's and it was blocked by the cleaning ladies, or the crowds of people trying to get on the elevator. There was also a pretty long line checking in, but probably not as bad as some other hotels, it didn't really bother me. They were extremely nice and thorough when they checked you in and very friendly, so that's all that matter's I guess. The one thing that did bother me is when we first checked into the hotel, the person at the front desk told us the pool was open until 7pm during the week and 8pm on the weekends. However, we rushed back on a Saturday from what we were doing to go enjoy the pool since it supposedly closed at eight. When we got down to the pool one of the staff members let us know that it was closing at seven, which was in 5 minutes from when we got down there, needless to say I was not pleased. I even looked at the brochure when we first checked in because I thought I misread what the person at the front desk wrote down, but it did say the pool closed at 8. This was another issue because I did not like the fact the pool closed so early. I have never heard of a pool closing at seven during the week, and especially on the weekends, and in Las Vegas no less?? I think they should definitely consider closing at a later time. The pool was nice and I would have liked to been able to lounge around pass seven. There needs to be better communication between the front desk and pool because when I questioned the pool staff girl, she automatically said, \"Oh, did the front desk tell you that it closed at eight?\", to which I responded, yes. So i knew there wasn't great communication there. The pool issue really bugged me, but oh well, I did enjoy the time I did get to spend there, none the less. Although the hotel is under construction, it didn't phase us at all. We did trying Bacio, the Italian restaurant at the Tropicana and it was very good. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anybody and I have recommended it to family and friends who regularly go to Vegas or want to go.

The Tropicana is currently promoting itself with the tag line, \"We're changing everything.\" Well, they might be changing everything, but the job isn't done yet. It will be a while before they truly can claim to be \"best in class.\" Right now, the Trop has good points, so-so points, and a few downright down points. That doesn't mean you should rule it out, but you should go in with an open mind to the idea that this is a hotel in transition, and there are still some warts around the edges. We stayed in the newly remodeled Paradise Tower. It is important for anyone staying at the Trop to understand that they are undergoing a remodelling that began with their Paradise Tower, and is moving through to the Island Tower now. The \"garden rooms\" have NOT been renovated at all as of this time. We had time to explore all areas of the hotel, and there are still vast differences between the newly remodelled tower and the other parts of the hotel. The overall effect is sort of schizophrenic as a result, which likely accounts for the wild disparity between reviews. First, the positive: The Trop is a very convenient place to stay if you want to be near all of the action on the strip. It is an easy walk across the walkways over Las Vegas Blvd. to MGM Grand, Luxor, NY-NY, and the tram to the Mandalay Bay. We liked the fact that the Tropicana is not as \"hustle and bustle\" as the other hotels and casinos nearby. A plus is that you do not have to walk through miles of casino space to get to the elevator to the Paradise Tower. Parking was ample and free. Our deal, booked through the hotel, was three nights for the price of two, $69 a night plus resort fee of $8.99. The deal included two free drinks in the bar (well only) for each night of our stay, as well as a free apetizer in Legends, the Trop's best restaurant. Check in was speedy (our deal included VIP check in). Our room in the Paradise Tower was nice. Everything was new, down to the wallpaper. Comfortable bed, spacious room and bath. A nice touch was the hand makeup mirror in the bathroom. Although our room was right by the elevator, we weren't bothered by any noise. Overall, it was very comparable to our room at the Bellagio where we stayed several years ago. Now, for so-so parts of the Trop. Construction is definitely occurring here. I am putting this in the \"so so\" part, because, honestly, it really wasn't all that obtrusive in most parts of the hotel. (See the section on the Garden View rooms below however). Yes, there are some large white screens in the lobby/casino, and, from time to time you might hear a bit of noise while walking through the public areas, but, overall, it was easy to ignore. The Trop's restaurants should also be classified as \"so so\" It does have several places to eat --- two of them are more coffee shop, order at the counter types of places. We had dinner at Legends, the Trop's \"upscale\" option our first night. NOTE: The Trop is currently advertising a $34 \"four course\" dinner with wine pairings at Legends. Sounds like a good deal, and that is why we decided to eat at Legends. However, our waiter immediately warned us that this is really to be considered a \"tasting menu\" not a DINNER. When we looked at the actual menu for what was being served, we both had a good laugh. The four courses were as follows: First course: One scallop Second course: One shrimp and two mussels Third course: One short rib Fourth course: cup of sorbet We couldn't help wondering if the wine would be served in a thimble. We felt that this was something of a \"bait and switch\" -- get you in the door for the \"price fixe\" then tell you that you will starve to death if you don't order something else. Still, our regular dinners were fine (nothing out of this world), although we would have probably given the experience a higher rating if the view had been a bit better (our window table overlooked a flat empty roof). There were also some aspects of the new rooms that we found lacking. For instance, the shutters in the rooms look nice - until you turn off the lights to go to bed and realize that all the lights of the Strip are shining directly between those shutter slats. They really need to have some sort of black out curtains! Also, the \"daybed\" that they show in all of the pictures looks great, until you realize that it is impossible to sit on because there is no back to it, and there is only ONE \"real\" chair in the room, a very hard desk chair. If you have more than one person in the room, the other person will end up having to sit on the bed. Finally, we couldn't remember the last time we'd stayed in a hotel where there was no coffee maker! These are the little things that really make you feel comfortable and at home, and they were just not quite up to snuff. I wonder whether the interior decorators actually spent a night or two in the rooms they designed. :) We also felt it was somewhat off-putting that there was a sign on the desk warning us not to damage or remove any of the furnishings. Made us wonder just what type of people the Trop thinks their customers are. Again, a small thing, but left a strange taste in our mouth. Internet access is $12.99 a day. When you're paying a \"resort fee\" one would expect free internet. Now, the Trop's real downsides. The Tropicana is one of the oldest hotels on the strip. While the renovations in the Paradise Tower have brought it up to modern standards, there are still many areas of the hotel where it is obvious upgrading still needs to be done. For instance, the hallway to the restroom in the casino is lined with mirrors. Several of the mirrors were broken and had been taped over with duct tape. Rather odd to see something like this in a hotel that is claiming to be \"best in class.\" The worst area of the hotel are the \"garden rooms\" which are the original parts of the hotel. We walked through here several times on our way to the parking area, and we had the opportunity to look into several of the rooms. At best, this area resembles a Motel 6 - dark hallways, doors with worn numbers on them. Furniture in the rooms resembles a Motel 6 as well. While we saw housecleaning in this part of the hotel, they don't appear to be really taking care of the public areas of this part of the hotel. The floor of one of the elevators was covered in big clods of dirt for our entire stay. I'm talking BIG hunks of dirt. While it is likely that this was dragged in by the construction workers, there really is no excuse for something like this not to be cleaned up immediately (how about putting some plastic down if the workers are going in and out of this elevator?). Also, we noticed that a lot of the construction equipment and supplies were stored directly outside many of the garden rooms, so it seems likely that there will be more noise there than we experienced in the Paradise Tower. DO NOT stay in the Garden rooms, unless you are on a severe budget! However, if you're staying in the Paradise Tower, you probably won't Other public areas of the hotel also aren't living up to the standard of \"best in class\" that Trop is advertising for its Paradise Towe rooms. For instance, the walkway from the parking garage to the front is literally a hot alley between a cement wall and the airconditioning unit. The lobby itself has not been renovated yet, and feels dark. Worse, you have to go up two flights of stairs to get to registration and there is no ramp for your bags. We found this an odd set up, and somewhat unwelcoming. So, should you stay at the Tropicana? If you can get a great deal like we did for the Paradise Tower, the answer is \"yes.\" While there are some warts around the edges, we enjoyed our stay overall. However, be sure you know exactly what you are signing up for - ask questions about whether you'll be staying in the Paradise Tower, and do consider whether you'd prefer to stay at a more \"happening\" place while in Vegas. In spite of the downsides, overall, we enjoyed our stay, and, if the price was right, would stay here again. But, by the same token, we could see how the Trop might not be right for others. If you're looking for \"best in class,\" it probably would be best to wait awhile to stay at the Trop. If you're OK with a few warts around the edges, and can book a good deal in the Paradise Tower, I would say you shouldn't have any worries about the Trop.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guam, Tamuning", "Title": "\u201cit was the most beautiful and special place in Vegas \" Tropicana Hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "yunibear", "ReviewID": "UR71695445", "Content": "it was the most beautiful and special place in Las Vegas.

A senior staff member assisted our group in obtaining an excellent group rate, for which we got a remarkable stay. While not as flashy (or expensive) as some of the gaudier hotels on the Strip, the Tropicana offers a truly high-class experience to guests who choose to stay there. I'll try to touch quickly on the rated categories above, in order. The Trop is kept quite spic and span, and the rooms are daily prepared to a state of comfort and beauty that recalls the hospitality of times past, when the customer was king. The bed was amongst the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The room was spacious and well-furnished. The service is wonderful. Employees at the Tropicana are amongst the most polite and accommodating I've encountered in a hotel. They hold doors open for you, they smile, and they generally try to ensure that your stay is worth your while and dollars. The location was, in my opinion, ideal. The Trop is situated just off of the Strip, which allows you to venture onto it during the day and enjoy the various hedonistic pleasures that Las Vegas has to offer, yet permits you to retreat to a place of relative calm in the evening after a show (though, of course, the gambler will not be disappointed by the Trop's casino). The value was excellent. It was easy and pleasant to negotiate a rate which was affordable for our group, and needless to say the experience was worth every penny. The rooms are, as i mentioned, splendid. They have dual large beds, comfortably outfitted with high-quality linens that ensure a good night's sleep after cavorting about the Strip. Each has a large flat-screen TV and cable. The bathrooms are spacious. I find it sort of odd that sleep quality is listed a separate category, but since it is, I'll put in a good word for it. I slept very well at the Tropicana. It was quiet and off the Strip. My one complaint is the high expense of the sandwiches (which, like everything else, were very good).

When i went to the MGM to buy the tickets for KA, all the people in line were complaining about how the MGM does have enough staff and how there stays were horrible. So staying at a smaller casino definetly was a benefit. The paradise rooms are really nice. There is a information booth in the casino were they will ask you to go to a timeshare presentation, which isnt at all that bad and you get a free $100 gift card for any shows or restaurant at the mgm locations. We went to see KA by CDS. it was awesome.

This was a short 3-day vacation and a first to Las Vegas for all 4 couples. If we ever go back, we would definately check into staying at the Tropicana again. PROS: *It was a short ride from the airport. *The hotel room was WONDERFUL!! Clean, remodeled, had a great view of the city, and very worth the price. No COMPLAINTS about the rooms!! *The RTC (public bus system) has a stop right in front of the hotel. We bought the $7 passes to use for 24 hours while there and it was a life-saver. Consider doing this if you want to explore the area. It even goes to old Las Vegas (the Fremont Experience) and that alone is worth the cost of the ticket. *The pool area is nice...and it will be nicer when the renovations are over. Currently they are working on expanding it, so it will probably be spectacular when done. *There were parts of the hotel that were still original to the building and it was kind of neat to see. They may not be there after renovations are done, but we enjoyed the old and new atmosphere. *The location. Some may not like the location of this hotel, but we found it was exactly right for us. Our hotel was one of the very first stops on the bus going toward Fremont Street, so we found that being able to get on the bus and get a seat was a great advantage. It also has 4 overhead walking bridges to get to Excalibar/Luxor/Mandalay Bay, New York New York and MGM. No waiting for traffic lights to cross to these resorts, just take the pedestrian bridge. CONS: *The old rooms the (the pre-renovated ones) look really old and \"well-used\". I wouldn't want to stay in any of them and would have been upset if I got one of them. *There is construction going on with the renovations. Nothing to disturb you, but it does distract from everything. Outside, inside, the lobby, the casino...drywall and workers everywhere. *The casino wasn't as classy as most on the strip, but after renovations are done this may no longer be the case. We did play some slots in our casino, but found it to be lacking compared to the rest on the strip. It also wasn't very busy. This could be a PRO or a CON, depending on how you look at it.

It seemed pretty different then all the others. The floor was a little smaller than most casinos, but still pretty nice.

Check-in around 3PM was kinda long (could have had more people working the front desk), but was expected. We stayed on the 12th floor of the Paradise Tower. It was a really nice room. My room was right next to the elevators and I had no problems with noise. This was only my second time in Vegas, my first hotel was TI. I'd say this hotel was on even playing ground for me, minus any shows like the Sirens of TI. For the price, you couldn't beat the location. The sports bar was pretty nice also. Nicole was really nice and responded to any little question I had about the hotel prior to my arrival. Go check out the pool too! Awesome pina coladas! Swim up black jack table as well! Very friendly staff at the hotel! The cons: I wasn't really impressed with the food. My room had no towel bar outside the shower. The blinds in the room suck, really need black out curtains.

We arrived late on Friday night, only to be told that there were no renovated rooms available in the Paradise Tower - - even though we had paid in advance!

Cracked counters with cigarette burns in the bathroom. Stained carpet. Tiny TV. On the positive side, we called the manager to complain, was given a reduced rate, and was moved to the paradise tower two days later. We heard similar stories from other guests who had the misfortune to stay at the Tropicana - one woman had no air conditioning the first night and was moved three times. Also, the hotel failed to provide us with the \"special\" offer items even when we asked. Hotel negatives: constant charges for everything other than a bed. A refrigerator costs $25 a night! You have to pay a daily resort fee of $8 for the pool, even if you don't want to use it. Wireless internet is $13 a day. Limited TV - no premium channels. Hotel seems like a construction zone.

The work on the front entrance did not get in the way, traffic flow is a bit tight, as it is around any construction.

Ipod docking station for the radio had great sound, but don't use it as an alarm, slept through its electronic dinging twice, I need a good buzz to wake out of a buzz. The bathroom was odd, light switch on the wrong wall, towel holder out of reach, and then the plumbing had a gurgling sound and tub wouldn't drain.

The rooms are nicer now than MGM, Mirage, Ceasars Palace and other mid range hotels in Las Vegas where we have stayed recently. We stayed in the Paradise Tower. About the only thing we did not like was that the new window coverings let in too much light in the A.M. They do look very nice however. I have never stayed anywhere that had over 100 T.V. stations in H.D. Now, that's service and on a 42\" T.V.! The casino and other areas are still very much under construction with stark white panels in place. When it's completed later this year it should be very nice. One big turn off in the table area was that it has very bright lighting - the brighest I have ever seen in a casino. It made it very unpleasant. They need to cut down the lights. I heard others complaining about it too. For that reason alone we did not play any table games there. We went to the MGM across the street to play table games. We would had preferred staying at the Trop to play but could not stand the bright overbaring lights. The pool area is great and I would rank it up there with some of the best in Las Vegas. I have been to just about every pool in town. The major complaint is that they seem to let in anyone and not just hotel guests. I saw people changing clothes in the bathrooms just inside the doors leading to the casino. They obviously were not hotel guests. Someone, I later found out it was an adult, made the pool their own bathroom so the pool had to be closed for awhile. I am sure it was not a hotel guest that did it. I think other L.V. hotels are allowing non guests to use the pool but that really is a policy that needs changing. One day it seemed that about 40% of the people there were not guests of the hotel. I talked to a L.V. local that was in the pool and he admitted to me that he and his five kids just wondered in!

We plan our trip around lounging and relaxing by the pool. We have stayed at different resorts over the years, but have found that the pool at the Tropicana is our favorite. This year as we were planning our trip we learned that the pool at the Tropicana was under major construction and we could not be guaranteed that it would be open at the time of our vacation, so sadly we booked at another resort. We chose a resort close to the Tropicana so we could easily visit the casino and other attractions the Tropicana has to offer. We love everything about the Tropicana, but a huge thing we love is the people who work there. We remember from year to year the same employees, coctail waitresses, dealers, pit bosses, among many others. We know they all see thousand upon thousand of guests every year and couldn't possible remember us, but they always great us warmly and sincerely. It is because of the atmosphere, the employees, the pool, and everything else the Tropicana has to offer that make it such a great place for us. When we arrived for our vacation we found out that the pool at the Tropicana had opened earlier than the expected. We were so disappointed not to be staying on this resort, and now to find that the pool was actually open was an even bigger disappointment. Each night as we made our way back to the Tropicana for our usual evening of fun at the BlackJack table we would find ourselves in convesations with the dealers, the cocktail waitresses, the pit bosses about how we loved their resort. One night as we were about to head out for some much needed rest we were presented with the most beautiful and delicious cocktail. We were being told of the amazing rennovations that were occuring not only at the pool, but with the entire resort from the fabulous resturants, the gorgeous rooms....everything. At this point we were surprised with the most amazing gesture. We were graciously given a beautiful room for us to spend our last night in Las Vegas. Along with that wonderful gift, they allowed us an early check in so we could spend the entire day lounging at the pool. We could not have been more surprised or blown away by their gererousity. It truly made our entire trip, and we can't wait to come visit again.

I mean, who goes to Vegas to sleep, but with beds that comfy, I enjoyed every minute! The pool is very nice (music could be turned down a bit) and I enjoyed starting my day off every morning on a bench in the garden area. So pleasant and quite listening to the water fall and birds. It was before the pool opened so the gardeners were working and were very polite and friendly. The South Beach Deli has great food, large portions and at reasonable prices. The staff was friendly in every department from the casino floor, restaurants, housekeeping, etc. Everyone had a friendly smile and was friendly. I got the impression they enjoyed their jobs (and that says a LOT about a company). Great Job Tropicana!

The new Paradise Tower is now completely remodelled and the rooms are impressive. Large in size, especially the bathrooms, great bed, and good sized flat screen TV! The place still smells like new carpet (not a bad smell in my book). Check in was with Rose who was very accomodating, We were checking in early (11AM)and hadn't really expected our room to be ready but Rosemade some calls and told us to come back at 11:30AM and it would be ready. We went back to her, and low and behold she handed over the key and went through the property highlights with us and we were on our way up. Shack was the bellman who brought our bags to the room, and wow was he on his game. Went through all the ammenities and even got us ice! He saw us a couple of times during our 24 hours there and made sure to ask how we were doing and if we were having a good time. There is construction going on as they remodel the whole place but really didn't affect our stay too much. You do have to go a little out of your way to get to the bridges over to Excalibur or MGM because the front area was being worked on, but it really wasn't bad. You can totally tell the new sections of the casino as opposed to the old - and the new is really nice and clean and bright as opposed to the old sections being much darker. Overall impressed with the hotel and can't wait to see the whole place finished!

They had MINIMAL staffing (2 ppl) working in the lobby at a time that you would think they would be much more heavily staffed (Friday at 11am). Waited an hour in a line that didn't move, then they gave priority to those checking out even if they got in line 45 minutes after you. Couldn't take it, went to the pool for an hour and a half, came back and waited another hour a half in line. Check in way too difficult! Took a little less than 25 minutes to get a prebooked room. One reason is because he tried to give me a cheaper room than I paid for! Then had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to still get the room I had already paid for (Paradise Tower), I managed to squeeze out a \"Yes\" through my clinched teeth... Finally I get MY room. I return home only to find that they have charged me twice for the room! Apparently this is normal as the lady I spoke to (who was nice) knew my problem without me even saying it...

Wanted to see how the renovations are coming along. There aren\u2019t a lot of places on the strip where you can stay on a Friday night for under $100. My three nights, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday went for $238.50 resort fees and taxes included, not a bad deal at all. The standard room in the Paradise tower seems to be larger than the other standard rooms I have stayed in on the strip. I really loved the daybed/couch or whatever you call it. The shutters are a great idea and add a lot to the \u201cambiance\u201d, and the fact that you can open the windows, priceless. My room had no noticeable noise from the strip. The orange color accent was a refreshing change from the rest of the strip. I really liked it because it was not overdone. The furniture was not cheap, but rather solidly built. The wooden ice bucket was a nice touch. The noise from the room next door was noticeable. A group of women checked in the next night and they all congregated in the room next to mine with lots of laughter and screaming as girls on vacation will do. Guys do the same, only differently, so no offense intended. This went on for a half hour at about 11:30PM. On the brighter side, I did not hear anything from the hallway. The television worked, but the remote did not. I know I could have gone and had it fixed (or perhaps the batteries replaced), but I don\u2019t like to do things like that, so I just went and used the buttons on the TV. The selection of channels on the TV was very limited. I do watch TV when I go to Vegas and I like to purchase a movie or two as well. The remodeled bathroom was nice, but basic. However, there is a fan over the toilet that is connected to the light. It is a very loud fan and not something I expect to find in the better hotels. Subtract for the noise. I absolutely loved the Kohler sink. I do not remember turning on a water faucet so easily. I don\u2019t know why I was so fascinated. Guess it doesn\u2019t take much to amuse me. The hotel has a beautiful garden area that provides an escape from the outside world. I happen to think this area rivals the Flamingo\u2019s garden area for it\u2019s beauty, but it doesn\u2019t have the size or animals. I know next year they are planning to rev up the place and make it exciting, but for now, it seemed to be rather quiet and stress-free. After they redo the Garden Rooms in the fall, I think it will be really nice with your own balcony overlooking the Garden and pool. The pool looks great. I would imagine when the hotel is at capacity, the pool will be really busy. I did not see the swim-up blackjack they promote, but I was only there on Thursday at 6:30 AM and 2 PM. They still have work to do, but what is open does look great and there will be more. The casino is pretty small and I don\u2019t think you can get lost in it like some others. The one pit they have looks nice, but there\u2019s still more to do in that casino. The Sports Book is a tiny room stuck in the back of everything. Very sad. But, it is scheduled to be moved to new digs in the front in about 6 months, at least that\u2019s what the guy working there said. He was very much looking forward to the move. Drink service was very good. I know that not many use the hotel laundry, but I always do since I only bring carry-on and bypass all the lines at the airport. Here\u2019s an example of the attention to detail I think they are trying to achieve; I had written a note on the laundry ticket that a shirt put in the bag was missing a button for the collar. The Tropicana\u2019s service actually found a button similar to the one that was missing and sewed it onto my shirt. Give \u2018em extra points for that. That shirt still has one more season left in it. I did get my haircut here. Barber was nice and small talk was enjoyable. Good job with all the usual amenities. Cut was $40, no shampoo. I only ate at the Tropicana once, for breakfast. Had three eggs over easy. It was quick. Nothing special, nothing bad. Pretty underwhelming. Very pleased with the improvements. Glad I stayed and will definitely stay here in the future. Really looking forward to the Island Tower Spa rooms and Garden rooms being completed in the fall. I definitely recommend this hotel and with each completed renovation, the recombination is stronger.

The last on my list was the Tropicana. My wife and I had stayed there several years ago and felt it was a good value.. not the glitziest hotel on the strip but nice for the price. Since I've seen the ads for the remodel decided I'd like to stay there again since the price is still the best for a true Strip Hotel. Wow... The pictures don't show the depth of change the place is going through. They aren't just throwing a new coat of paint on the walls and calling it a remodel like a few other hotels have done. The Paradise tower room we stayed in was clean, roomy and had a very nice view up the strip. However what set the place apart was the staff. Everyone was genuinely concerned about our experience and what we thought of the renovations so far. We had stayed in one of the newer hotels on the strip that runs 4 x the price and we couldn't even get an ashtray sent to our smoking room in a timely manner (after 3 requests over an 8 hour period finally gave up). At the Trop we had a problem with the AC and within 30 min of contacting the front desk someone was there to work on it. Additionally, my mother went on the trip with us. She had a problem getting around as Vegas has changed considerably from when she traveled there in the 70s. Kimberlee, the front desk clerk who had checked her in, was leaving for the day when she saw my mother having difficulty, instead of doing like most people who are no longer on the clock and ignoring the situation, she stopped, discovered the problem and offered solutions. There are currently some inconveniences caused by the remodel but overall you won't find a better value near the strip much less in such a nice location as the Trop. My only recommendation is that if you plan on sleeping in after a long night and light bothers you bring an eye mask. The windows are shuttered but a lot of early morning light still comes through. One other thing I need to say concerning the difference between the Tropicana and other hotels.. at the Trop you feel more like a guest vs feeling like one ant trying to navigate the kicked over ant hill at the \"Mega-Resorts.\"", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary canada", "Title": "\u201cTropicana did fantastic reno's\u201d", "Author": "jimbow1961", "ReviewID": "UR67186381", "Content": "I stayed at the Tropicana from May 29 to June 5 and it was a better than expected experience. Originally I was going to stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations on the Strip but switched to the Tropicana about 4 days before leaving after finding a great deal on Expedia(40 % off room rates). I stayed in the newly renovated Paradise Tower(room 1225) and it was very well done and smelled new also. Initially I wasn't too happy with the layout of the bathroom but I got used to it. The rest of the room was very nice, shutters on the windows instead of drapes was a nice and unique touch and I had a nice strip view looking toward the MGM. About the only fault I could find and it was hard to find one, was that there may not have been too much soundproofing around the room as I could hear the couple in the next room(they were loud, though) and I could also hear music playing from some outdoor party going on nearby on my first night there. The 24 hour South Beach Deli had a good selection on the menu and seemed reasonably priced. It came in handy after some very late night poker sessions across the street at the MGM Poker room. Very friendly staff right from the front desk to the housekeeping crew. I didn't spend time in the somewhat small casino because I'm not a regular blackjack or craps player anymore. In the Las Vegas magazine for May 2010 that was in the room, a daily poker tourney was advertised. After a few trips around the casino I couldn't find the poker room. I finally asked the front desk about it and was informed that the poker room was closed due to layoffs but that they hoped it would open again soon. I had dinner at both the italion restaurant and the steakhouse and both were excellent and well priced. Just watch which days you go because there's 2 nights where the steakhouse is closed and then there are 2 nights where the itallion restaurant is closed. The itallion restaurant did offer a steak dinner special on the 2 nights where the steakhouse was closed. They are still doing further reno's to the Tropicana although I'm not quite sure when they will be completed. Tropicana is very well located and near the MGM(across the street) and it's across the street the other way from Excalibur and kitty corner to New York New York.

Because our friends were getting married of course! :D we needed to do the trip on a budget and so when looking online at the various hotels along the strip, the Tropicana seemed like the best option in terms of price, location and quality of rooms. I emailed Nicole directly and she was very very helpful. Got a great rate on one of the newly rennovated Paradise Tower rooms....Thanks Nicole! :) Got to the hotel and checked in nice and quick....no queues! awesome! the casino and bar areas were busy and everyone was having a good time and there was a great buzzing vibe! got up to the room and my girlfriend was very impressed.....and so was i! for the money, it definitely is best-in-class without a doubt. friends of ours who stayed in the MGM Grand said our room was bigger and nicer than theirs and they paid a lot more!! On the second night, we went out with all our friends around the various hotels along the strip. The Bellagio, Vencian, Ceasers Palace etc were all fantastic and very grand......but after a while, all our friends wanted to go back with us to the Tropicana even though some were staying right at the other end of the strip!!

Our hotel room was cleaned thoroughly everyday....my compliments to the maids! we ordered room service one morning which took a little while to arrive (45mins) but was lovely food. the expedia local travel experts in the main lobby area were very helpful with helping us book tickets for various things. they gave us lots of info and helped us book tickets for cirque du soleil at the whynn hotel (which was amazing!) and also managed to get us on a helicopter tour of the grand canyon at very short notice. we rang them at 8am and they got us picked up in a limo at 1pm. very efficient!! gambling at the trop was brilliant.....all the dealers at the tables were very professional and friendly and the waitresses were always on hand to bring complimentary drinks. on the first night, 3 of my friends won over $200 each and i even i managed to win $100 and I don't gamble! if you're a non-smoker and new to vegas, then be warned.....smoking is allowed in ALL casinos in vegas. dont be put off at the tropicana if it smells smokey as you walk through the casino....it's like that in every hotel! me and my girlfriend hit the pool a few times during our stay and found it to be very nice indeed. not too big, not too small. cocktail bar with waitress service which was great. there were some private cabannas which could be hired at a cost. my only recommendation would be that the jacuzzi/spa be made to look a little nicer and maybe be upgraded. it was warm and relaxing, but their wasn't much in the surrounding area around the jacuzzi. a few palm trees, plants etc would make it feel a bit more luxurious. so to conclude....our stay at the tropicana was excellent. staff were great, gambling was good, the room was spacious and tastefully decorated with all new modern fittings, the location of the hotel is great. what more can I say? If you're looking for an intimate feel hotel, on a budget...but getting a lot of bang for your buck, then stay at the tropicana and you won't be dissapointed.

I found a very good rate online, and a 3 night stay at the newly upgraded Paradise Tower came out to the same price at a \u201cstandard\u201d room at other casinos, so I figured the decision was a no-brainer. Arrival: We took a cab in from the airport. Since this is a southern strip hotel, you should ask the cabbie not to take \u201cthe tunnel\u201d to the hotel, since this way is longer and more expensive. We checked in with no problem; no major lines. The lobby was somewhat small but the process went by pretty quickly. Rooms: We stayed in the recently renovated Paradise Tower on the 18th floor; the room had great views of the Strip (Mandalay Bay, Luxor, NY NY, Excalibur). Bathroom was large w/ a tub; ample closet space; flat screen LG television. No fridge though, which was only a minor drawback. Overall the room was great, although not as luxurious as some of the Harrahs property rooms I\u2019ve stayed at in Atlantic City (Caesars and Harrahs). Still, for the price paid, this was a great value. Casino: The casino was definitely a lot smaller than some of the other casinos I visited in Las Vegas. I\u2019m not a big slot player so I don\u2019t know how loose or tight they are. I found the casino to be adequate, with mostly $5 and up tables. Food: I only ate at the casino once, very late at night. There is a deli that\u2019s open 24 hours which had $7 sandwiches; pretty filling and convenient. I believe this was the only late night option inside the casino. Pool: The pool appears to have been renovated recently. The outdoor area is very nice, and is filled with flowers and trees that provide a nice atmosphere. The pool itself is fairly large, and there were definitely plenty of seats available by the pool (contrasted with some other pools I visited in LV, which had almost no seats available). Water was kind of cold, though. Also the hot tub was separated from the main area, so it wasn\u2019t as appealing to jump in. There was music blasting from the speakers, so if you\u2019re expecting a nice dip or lounge by the pool, this wouldn\u2019t be a good fit. Servers walked by regularly so you could order drinks without having to get up. There was an entire section walled off where more renovations were (I think) taking place. They didn\u2019t affect the quality of our stay, however. Final thoughts: I\u2019m not sure what the Trop was like before, although from some of the older reviews, it appears it was a pretty beaten up place. The Paradise Tower rooms are a huge step up, then, but no one will confuse these rooms with high end rooms at other locations. Similarly, the Trop itself pales in comparison to other LV casinos. However, at the right price, the Trop has a good option for large, clean and recently remodeled rooms. The remaining will be renovated by the end of the summer, giving you more options to stay at the Trop.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, MD", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time!\u201d", "Author": "saintWoodstock_MD", "ReviewID": "UR65948843", "Content": "The Tropicana has gone through a great many renovations in the past year.

I can't say I liked having to get up and get dressed then go down 19 floors to pay $6.38 for 2 cups of coffee everyday, then go back up to the room !! Other than that i would recommend that anyone stay here. Hopefully we can make it back soon depending on how much the rooms and packages are going for in the future.

There was no evidence of current casino construction other than workers finishing polishing a small brand new section of the floor. Sports book has no racing options but a new SB will start construction very soon. Casino was plenty big and bright with many machines but only two craps tables but at least they had a $5 minimum as were their BJ and other table games. Their Deli is modest but excellent as is their coffee shop 'which serves Starbucks.

I went crazy looking at reviews for where would be a cheap but clean and safe place to stay. Well I was very pleased that on arriving at the Tropicana I was not dissapointed. When we arrived we were given a room that wasnt really what we had in mind (they are in the process of fixing up some of the rooms etc) so we called the front desk and with no problem at all they were understanding and upgraded us to a jacuzzi suite. They could have just turned around and said thats the room you paid for - but they didnt! The service they provided was really amazing, everyone who worked there is very polite and helpful. We did not encounter 1 person who was rude or unhelpful. I would like to point out we didnt pay much at all for the 3 nights we were in Vegas - so really we were not expecting much - but the Tropicana really did more than I ever expected, their hotel is clean (apart from what I assume is the old building which does smell of smoke - but like I said it is all being re-done - so next time I go it will look even better). When we booked it did say that they were doing works on the hotel and that the swimming pool would not be in use. But I believe it will be or probably is already because when we left the pool area looked amazing. And apart from this it just has a nice atmosphere - from the front desk to the ladies who clean the rooms are so helpful, polite and just really friendly - what more could you want from a hotel? This hotel is very close to the aiport - we paid about $10 for the cab. And it is right next to the MGM Grand, a few mins walk away from Luxor etc where you could go and have buffets. My advice is if you are on a budget you will need to bring some good walking shoes because the strip is really long, and theres so much to see and do. Catch a bus to Fremont if you want to see the light show- definetly worth it!

The staff all seem upbeat and positive and all want to serve you as best they can. Well-done, Tropicana! And thank you to Nicole for all of your help with our reservation!! The only kicker was that on our last night there, we really wanted to play blackjack but all 3 $5 blackjack tables were all full. We were busy doing so many other things throughout the week that we didn't really have time to play on any other night. There was another couple also looking to play $5 blackjack that night, and a man from the pit declined their request to open another table for all of us to play. There were a few stragglers wandering around asking if anybody knew where there were more tables to play at. Maybe the dealers were short-staffed, who knows? We all thought that the hotel would want to open another table and let us all play, but oh well. My wife and I stood and waited at one table for more than an hour (it was fun to watch the particular table we were watching win as much as they were) but we finally had to call it a night. We were tempted to go next door to Hooter's for $3 blackjack, but were just too exhausted! Overall, this hotel is well-worth the trip! They have some of the closest rooms to the strip in the Paradise Tower. The day we left is when they were just putting the Tropicana sign up strip-side, as well as remodeling where the valet parking check-in area is. It looks like some of the glass and artwork (outdated) is being pulled from the ceiling. We can't express enough how much we love and always will enjoy the Tropicana hotel. Maybe it was a good thing we didn't gamble when we wanted to, but we both definitely felt that energy that the tables were \"hot\" that night.

Great beds and fixtures. The bathroom upgrades were a huge improvement (some of the rooms had their original fixtures and were desperate for an upgrade). We also had a chance to dine at the newly remodeled Deli. The food was reasonably priced, and outstanding in quality. Added bonus: The room service prices were the same as the prices in the deli, which might make the Trop the best bang for your buck room service in all of Las Vegas! The Tropicana is undergoing a very significant remodel, and you should expect some construction noise and issues that you would expect while everything around you is in the process of changing (literally, signage, paint, and carpets changed in the three days that we were there).

I did a quick search on-line while driving to Vegas and the Tropicana was one that was reasonably priced and showed it was recently renovated. The woman on the phone told me that we could get a room for 2 adults & 1 child for $50, which seemed very inexpensive. Now we know why! We arrived and found a nice lobby, still under renovations and were told that the room would be $70. I had just hung up w/them not 10 minutes before so they honored the quote of $50 which was nice. We drove around trying to find our entrance for a good 15 mins. The signs were not posted, possibly because of the renovations? Finally found our room located on the ground floor. It smelled musty & it looked like it had not been redecorated since 1950. It certainly was not the room the advertised in the picture on-line, not even close! But we figured for $50 we couldn't complain. So we changed clothes & headed out for dinner. When arriving back in our room we found a cockroach on the wall. I called the front desk & was told they would send someone over to kill the bug! NO thanks - if there is one there are probably many more so they offered to upgrade our room to a \"suite\" in the new building at no charge. So we packed up & headed to the newer building. This was not a suite however, just a typical hotel room. It still smelled like paint so we were hoping that the cockroaches had not found this building yet. This room was definitely much nicer but still not nearly as nice as other places in Vegas. Their was hair in the bathroom, both on the floor and in the shower when we first arrived. The decor was a step up from our basement room but still not very modernized. The bed was comfortable however and that was all we really needed.

I was able to book for $59.00 a night for a three night stay-so far so good. Upon check in the front desk lady was extremely helpful and fun, she needs a raise. We told her it was my father in law's 50th birthday and she gave us a few free drink tickets which was a nice touch. All of the staff I came into contact with was by far some of the friendliest most helpful people I have ever met. Now the bad. The room was exactly how most descrive on here, on it's last leg. The air didn't work, the tub did not drain, the tile was pretty gross with mold. The room smelled and just was over all unpleasant. With that said, with the price I got what do you expect. The casino only had maybe seven or so table games open at a time, so finding a seat was tough. We ended up gambling elsewhere for this reason so the Trop definitely lost out on some easy cash. So to summarize, if you are not going to be in your room for long (only to sleep and shower) and want to be on the strip I would say go for it. However, I will never stay again because I feel the extra money would be worth it to have a room that functions better.

It's been three weeks and still haven't recieved anything. I was travelling with my family (mum, dad, teenage brother, and older brother) and booked two rooms for three nights. We chose the Tropicana for the location and the price. We were checked in my Gerard and advised that there were no adjoining rooms; but were given room next door to each other. Made our way to our rooms and found them to be outdated and tired. The bathroom looked very old and had mould around the tub/shower. However, the linen and towels were clean. We decided to have lunch at the buffet (which for the price was very disappointing and had very little selection). On the way through, we realised that the place was being renovated which meant that the pool; business centre; and outdoor courtyard area was not available (so why am I paying the \"resort fee?\", I thought). We were later to find out that there WiFi was only available from the courtyard (which was closed for renovations) and the tower rooms; that the poker room was closed; that I had to pay to use the computer and for printing at the \"business centre\" (which was a computer in the VIP room as the original business centre was closed); and that the concierge is outsourced and knows not much about Las Vegas. We were also sent on a wild goose chase for a Bank of America. Gerard at the reception desk informed us that it was one mile away, by the time we had walked to the airport we realised that he might be wrong...in fact the bank was about four miles away. All this on the first day. To add to our woes, we were unable to make local or long-distance phone calls without going through the front desk because Gerard had not entered my credit card details into the computer despite the card being swiped twice when we checked in, and it being already charged the \"resort fee\". I found out late on the second day that three x 3-minute phone calls that we had made to LA, had cost us more than USD$30. By this stage, my patience had worn thin and I approached the front desk and spoke with the supervisor, Richard. I explained all the problems to Richard and the \"best he could do\" was to refund the \"resort fee\" on both rooms; he also used his computer to print out our boarding passes for our flights. With regards to the phone calls; not being made aware of renovations; and not being able to use the business centre he could only apologise. Furthermore, he suggested that I go and buy a phone card from the casino gift store if I \"didn't want to incur excessive phone charges\". Not suprisingly, the gift store hadn't sold phone cards for the past year. On our departure, we had to use the elevator to get all our bags to the car, and as luck would have it, the elevator was not working. We had to haul our bags down two flights of stairs at 5:30am. I was going to opt for an express check out but instead I went to the front desk to once again speak with a manager about her unsatisfactory stay at the Tropicana. I was told that a manager was unavailable until 7am, however Rose at the front desk was very understanding; wrote down all my complaints and assured me that a manager would contact me; or a letter would be sent to me with a response regarding my complaints. I'm still waiting. We were on a six week holiday through Canada and the USA; and I had been to Las Vegas and visited about 35 states in the USA and I can say without hesitation, that this is the WORST hotel experience I've ever had. I will never stay at the Tropicana again and I will never recommend the Tropicana to friends, families, colleagues or aquaintences.

For $30 bucks a night it can't be beat. We had a real nice room in the Island Tower. The Buffet was fine, but not one of the top ones in Las Vegas. Having good coffee every morning at the coffee shop was a plus. We worked out at the Fitness center everyday. It is small but served our purpose. Our room was in the iland tower and was real nice. No complaints. Only complaints were Wireless Internet service was a little slow and didn't work 10% of the time. It may have just been our room location. It would of been nice if Pool area would have been open, but it was flagged off as a construction area. They have one of the top 5 pools in Las Vegas. Go in the summer, what a place. There is lots of construction going on and the Trop will be one of the top hotels again when all is complete. All rooms are being remodeled now.Their location on the strip can't be beat, The staff is super friendly and helpful. Nicole was a real gem and treated us really special. The Magic show was Great since it came free with the room. We are looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas to stay at the Tropicana. If they don't raise the room rates much, It is going to be the best deal on the strip for the dollar. P.S. For what it is worth, I like the Miami theme that they are remodeling to. With that pool area it is going to be a hit, Hopefully the construction will be done by next winter and they can keep the pool area open year around.

The building is undergoing some renovations, and it should be looking quite different next year, which is a shame. Aside from the Sahara, there are few Strip resorts with the Old Vegas vibe. The ones that are still kickin' (Riviera, Circus Circus) don't strike me as anyplace I want to stay anytime soon due to some pretty bad reviews. The moment we checked in, we were treated wonderfully by Trop staff, most notably a front desk staff member by the name of Kimberlee who had been with the resort for several years. She was a great conversationalist and saw to it that we enjoyed our stay. The buffet was quite good, our Island Tower room was great, and I found the casino staff to be friendly. If you've never played at the Trop, the casino itself is rather small (generally only one open dice table at a time), but the table minimums are very reasonable, and besides, you're at the end of the Strip within walking distance of Excalibur, New York New York, MGM Grand, Luxor, and even the Hooters casino. Chances are you'll find a place you like. The only problem we experienced at the Trop was the morning the elevators decided to stop working- we ended up using the freight elevator with security, but it's a high-volume hotel. These things happen, and it really didn't bother us as much as it apparently did other people. One word of advice: go during spring-summer when the pool is open.
