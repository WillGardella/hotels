Much impressed by my initial contacts with the restaurant manager and staff, Perry and Betty, we have decided to relocate to the HK Gold Coast on our final three nights of stay in Hong Kong from the JW Marriott to host the event.If one is planning for a unique unforgettable event, this is the place. The pictures on the WebPages did not do justice for the real experience.The hotel is a resort and is a departure from the business hotels in the Central district from its hustles and bustles and jammed with traffic and people, strategically we picked this location in hope for an relaxing retreat and an unforgettable evening with friends at the conclusion of our trip. We were delighted that we have made that choice. The hotel room charge is obviously shy from the Central area. While the location may be a concern to some, the availability of complimentary shuttle services and choice of public transportation are making that a non-issue. We managed to get to most destinations in 30-45 minutes from the hotel. We hired a taxi from to take us from the JW Marriott to the Gold Coast and the fare was $250HKD. We paid the similar fare to go from the Gold Coast to the airport. For the overseas tourists, this is more like a fraction of what we would pay for a similar commute. Riding in a taxi afforded the opportunity to experience the beauty of the city.Upon check in, we were rather disappointed with our room assignment, as we were greeted by parking lot noises as well as a poorly cleansed room. Over the concern of the hotel reputation and our first impression at a breakfast conversation with the Cafe Lagoon Restaurant Manager, Perry had taken the initiative to make alternate arrangement to correct the situation. This recovery itself speaks volume; the hotel management had more than made up the inferior first impression. All other services were professional, courteous and expedient.  The highlight came at the dinner reception on Nov 2 as our guests arrived, many from overseas. The environment, the services, the food and an going the extra mile attitude by the restaurant management and staff had turned this event to an unforgettable memory.  We had the reception at the Cafe Lagoon Terrace, an outdoor setting surrounded by tropical vegetations by a pool overlooking the ocean, a picture perfect opportunity for lasting memories. Live music was provided. Our guests were most delighted with the BBQ and freshly prepared buffet. The icing on the cake was the care of the restaurant management to fulfill a last minutes request for transportation to Tsim Sha Tsui with a 50 passenger tour bus. As we bid farewell, most of our guests were enjoying a care free ride on a private bus taking in the night scene of a romantic city along the coast line.This property is about an decade old and may be in time for a renovation to keep up with an upscale resort status. Proper attention to the house keeping will definitely made it a superior choice for a get away retreat and we are looking forward to return to see the improvements. All said, credit must to the hotel management and specifically Perry who has gone out of their way to make our dream come true, an unforgettable evening with friends and laughter.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR886602094", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JLInternational"}, {"Content": "Excellent value The hotel was the venue for my company sales conference.Arriving at the airport I made for the Sino Hotels desk where I was escorted to the hotel shuttle.

The bed was horrible (the worst part of this hotel) - a very cheap mattress - I could feel all the springs and some felt like they were about to burst out of the mattress at any time. The only thing we really liked about this hotel was the free shuttle into downtown Kowloon. There is a large pool but, as we didn't swim, I can't speak to that.

The bed is great, the rooms very large by HK standards. The Lobby and atrium are beautiful, and the glass elevator is great! The common areas of the hotel were stunning, with beautiful gardens. Unfortunately, the Pool Area was roped off and out of bounds during our entire 2 night stay, because of forecast thunderstorms. Unusual, because in Queensland this practice is not followed, nor at the Hotel we stayed at on Hong Kong Island. Very disappointing, bad form by the hotel I say. Breakfast was great, and plentiful, while the A La Carte restaurant served fantastic food, at reasonable prices. My only criticism of the hotel (apart from closing the pool!) was the Concierge. They were entirely unhelpful, and it seemed like a sport to them, to try and hinder my enjoyment of my stay. I tried to book 1 day ahead for the shuttle, and was told its not possible, but I could awaken at 7am in the morning, and come down to book it with them. So I did this, but it certainly didnt assist in my having a relaxing time at the hotel.

It was planned as an extended stop over to break up the long journey from Heathrow to Sydney.We had pre-booked (500HK$) a Mercedes Limo from Hong Kong Airport to the hotel, on arriving at the arrivals hall a smartly dressed man was waiting for us clearly displaying a board with our name. He promptly showed us to the Limo and we were taken directly to the hotel. The hotel is a 25 minute journey from Hong Kong Airport.The lobby of the hotel is very impressive, polished marble everywhere and very clean. We checked in, and our luggage was taken to our room. The room was clean and bright and had a lovely balcony over looking the sea and marina. There were 2 double beds, however were not the standard size and were a bit small. The most comfortable way of sleeping was if my wife and I slept with one of our children rather than together.The hotel has a beautiful lagoon style pool area and very well established fauna. There are cabana\u9225\u6a9a available if you need to get out of the heat of the sun, however there is plenty of palm trees for natural shade. Lying by the pool you could be in any tropical country it\u9225\u6a9a absolutely gorgeous. There are two water slides, that can keep children occupied.The hotel has direct access to the beach; however the beach is used more by the locals than hotel residents. The beach was clean, had a shark net and life guard, however the sea did not look too appetising.Logistically the hotel does seem to be a little way out of Hong Kong; however there is a hotel bus that leaves either end [Hotel to HK \u9225?HK to Hotel] on the hour, the last bus back from HK is at 11pm; the journey time is about 30 \u9225?40 minutes depending on time of travel.

Reasonable prices and periodic special offers makes this hotel a decent choice offering value for money and would rate this hotel to be a good 4 star resort hotel. Thoroughly agree with previous posting on this resort. Don't expect pool area to be open from morning till night when there is a potential threat of thunderstorms during monsoon season. Some pool staff were also fussy , told my wife off for using the water slides when playing with our ten year old , must be under 16 to use, even though the pool area was empty ! There is also a health club offering massage treatments at reasonable prices , gym with sauna and steam room. Last weekend of August was very busy, hotel well suited for families with kids, facilities included indoor playroom with table tennis, snooker, amusements, , indoor war game area, tennis courts, outside kids play area, pool and 2 water slides. The complimentary shuttle bus to Tsim Tsai Tsui was a welcome bonus and included in our stay, departs on the hour until 11pm.

If you wish to go sigtseeing, head for Lantau Island to see Big Buddha, take the hotel free shutte to Tsing Ye, then MTR to Tung Chung. From there, either take bus or taxi, costing around $170 HKD each way, well worth the visit. Although the hotel offered good service and accomondation, having stayed once here, I don't think I would stay this far out of Hong Kong again, and would probably try out Shatin on my next visit which also offers decent hotels at reasonable prices with easy access to China and Hong Kong being closer to the KCR and MTR Rail network.", "Date": "Sep 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR236204088", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Kripp11"}, {"Content": "Gold Coast Resort The Hotel was quite nice and well located.

We stayed in a Deluxe Balcony room, but it was definitely smaller and less luxurious than the last time, so I can only assume we had a different deal before. The room was still fairly large by Hong Kong standards, with a king size bed and good sized balcony. Worst thing was the room not being ready when we arrived, 25 mins before official check-in. Ok, fair enough. However, we were advised it would not be ready for nearly an hour. Would we like to upgrade (extra cost) to a room that was ready now? We thought this was just a ploy to extract more money, so declined. However, the room really wasn't ready for 55 mins, and we weren't the only ones waiting in the lobby. Amazingly, we weren't offered a free coffee, half-price dinner, or any other practical apology as compensation. We ate in their Cafe Lagoon restaurant, which offers a buffet dinner or a-la-carte.
