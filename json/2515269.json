The hotel is comfortably located near the Prote orleans (metro line 4) metro station. We took a taxi from CDG airport, but it is relativity easy to get there by train if you arrive in paris before 11 PM (the last train leaves at 10:55 PM). We got a room on the 7th floor, the only downside about that is that the elevator only reaches the 6th floor and we had to walk up the stairs to the 7th floor. also, the elevator is old fashioned , and can only fit 2 people with 2 suitcases, in the morning in the housekeeping time the elevator was occupied with the sheets and blankets and we had to use the stairs to go down - which was not so bad. The room itself was small - but sufficient if you only plan on sleeping there and being out all day - like we did. the room was very clean - sheets and towels were changed every day. The bathroom was newly renovated and also very clean, we always had plenty of hot water. The room had no air conditioning but did have central heating - since it was cold at night when we stayed it was perfect - not sure about how it would be in the summer when it's hotter. Anther downside - which was minor for us - is that the walls are very thin, you can hear everyone's everything. during the night it wasn't a problem, but in the morning when we got ready to leave we heard what was going on in the hall and the rooms on our floor. overall, it's a great hotel and great value for money! one tip, the hotel offers a shuttle to the airport for 18 Euro per person - this is a very good price and saves you the trouble of taking the train. you need to book this option one day in advance.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201csmall and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Hagai9", "ReviewID": "UR120770780", "Content": "i have a good stay, the room is very small but must of the hotels in Paris are. the room is clean and looks new. nice small balcony to the street . breakfast has only coffee/tea. bread, orange juice and yogurt. location is good, just 5 steps from a subway station (1.7Euro to Eiffel tower) nice coffee shops and restaurants on the hotel street area", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSo wonderful\u201d", "Author": "s e", "ReviewID": "UR119774552", "Content": "What makes this hotel is number one, the staff; our lovely little balcony in the trees, overlooking the street; clean, comfortable room; and of course, the coolest elevator.

Never having been to Paris before we read the hotel reviews and were a bit apprehensive about its location. We flew from Glasgow to Beauvais and then transferred via the shuttle bus which took 1 hour and 20 mins into Port.. Maillot. Once at Port Maillot we found the metro and after changing lines only once we arrived at the Port D'Orleans. We had been travelling a while and dreaded a long walk to the hotel. How marvellous was the site of the hotel as we ascended the steps from the metro. Seriously it was just a few steps away from the front of the Hotel. The staff on reception are very friendly and helpful and all speak English well. Patrice is an excellent Manager and a star of trip advisor (read previous reviews) but he has a real challenge for the crown from Tariq who can not only speak English but many more languages as well and is a lovely person. THE HOTEL The hotel in general is small. The rooms are small but very nice and have everything you would ever need. The are modern and light, wh had a room on the 4th floor (404) which faced the front of the building, we also had a small balcony. The cleaner came in every day and made the beds, changed the towels and tidied. The lift at reception is brilliant! It is very small and can only take 2 people with bags, it is very old fashioned and quaint,lovely. The hotel is also in a very safe area. THE METRO We had Paris Visite passes which we bought online from a British company (hello paris) which were cheaper than anywhere else. They deliver to your home address. This gave us unlimited travel on the metro, bus and RER train as well as the Montmarte Funicular. This was great and we used it well. There are other tickets you can buy for the metro, you can buy 10 tickets for 12 euros which are good value. Each journey only uses one ticket. (Sometimes you might need to change lines several times and as long as you dont come out of the underground you only use the one ticket.) The transport system is fantastic, trains are constant and it is very easy to understand. The situation of the metro to the hotel makes travel easy. Unlike home the metro does not finish early but it is still a good idea to check when it finishes on a nightly basis. PARIS There is so much to see. There are so many beggars but they do not bother you if you say no. There are also warnings everywhere about pickpockets but we did not feel threatened or worried about anything. Infact I felt is was no worse than being at home or in any other city. In the area around the hotel there are places where you can buy sandwiches etc as it is very expensive. Round the corner to the left of the hotel is an area called Alesia and this is a good area for reasonable shopping and eating. Don't be too quick to jump on the metro and miss the opportunity to have a walk here.

Tarik and his colleagues were extremely patient answering our million and one questions on where to go to and how to get there, how things work with public means etc. etc. All answered in English to our relief. Although I must say that we didn\u2019t have any problems with being assisted in English at all in Paris. All in all, go to this hotel! You won\u2019t regret it (if you buy some kind of a public transport pass).", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLooking for a value? This is a great deal. Nice room, nice staff. Good (not great) location.\u201d", "Author": "TravelerCharlotteNC", "ReviewID": "UR73389508", "Content": "SUMMARY: Good, inexpensive 2 star hotel option located 20 minutes by Metro from Notre Dame and the center of Paris. I would recommend this hotel to a friend. THE GOOD: Very fair price for lodging. Metro stop is 2 minute walk (maximum) to hotel. Metro line leads directly to center city. Staff is helpful. Room is clean. Water pressure and temperature good. Comfortable bed. Neighborhood safe with inexpensive dining options. THE BAD: Not near any real nightlife (although cafes are nearby and open past midnight). If you are really here for the night life understand you will be taking the bus when the metro closes (1 or 2 A.M.?). No Air Conditioning and small shower (these two are not really \"bad qualities\" as this seems typical in Paris). I\u2019m from the States and stayed in Paris 6 days. This is my first trip to Paris, so I can\u2019t compare this hotel to other hotels in Paris. I have traveled in over 20 countries, so even though I can\u2019t compare the hotel to other Paris hotels, I\u2019ll try to give a good general overview: STAFF: Patrick at the front desk is excellent. He is a cut above most employees anywhere. That being said, the entire staff is friendly and helpful. Most at the front desk speak good English. They are very helpful telling you the transportation options. COMFORT: \u2022 The room was in good shape and clean, although small (but I would think most Paris rooms are small). There is a decent sized closet and a small desk area to leave your computer. The bed was comfortable. \u2022 There is no Air Conditioning so ask for a room away from the street if noise bothers you. I was there in July but the daytime temps never exceeded 80, so when I got to the hotel at night I opened the windows for 10 minutes and the room was very comfortable. \u2022 The shower is small (2 feet by 2 feet), but the water pressure and temperature are very good. HOTEL AREA: The area in which the hotel is located is safe and people are at the cafes past midnight. NIGHTLIFE: There are some cafes and a bar within a close walk, although true nightlife is not at this location. If you are here for the tourist sites, this location is good\u2026 if you want nightlife outside your door, you may want to consider another location. INEXPENSIVE DINING: \u2022 There is a Crepe and Sandwich Kiosk between the Metro stop and the hotel. There sandwiches are 3 to 5 Euros and very good. \u2022 Just past the bus stop (for bus 68), there is both a supermarket and a bakery. It is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel (walk out the hotel to your left, go to the intersection and turn left\u2026 the supermarket will be on the right side of the street). Go here for milk, cereal, fruit, sandwiches, etc if you want to save a few dollars. \u2022 There is also a Pizza and Gyro spot across the street from the Supermarket, so cheap eating is plentiful. \u2022 There are plenty of Caf\u00e9\u2019s are in the area as well. Breakfast (Coffee, Crepe, Bread, and Juice) is 7 Euros minimum. TRANSPORTATION: Transportation options are plentiful. The hotel is a 60 second walk from the Metro exit, the bus and tram stops are also within a 3 minute walk. Most of the central tourist area is a 20 to 30 minute trip. \u2022 Underground: It takes about 20 minutes to take the Metro (direct with no stops) to Notre Dame; less to the Latin Quarter and Luxemborg Gardens. Most areas of the city can be reached with only 1 transfer from the 4 line and are within about a 30 to 40 minute ride. The Louvre, Orsey, Army Museum, etc are about 30 minutes. \u2022 Bus: Don\u2019t discount using the Bus system. The Invalades (Napoleon\u2019s Tomb / Army Museum) and other sites are a direct bus ride and can get you to places quicker than the Metro. The hotel staff will give you details. AIRPORTS: Generally, one transfer will get you from either Orly or Charles Degaul. \u2022 Arriving from Charles De Gaul Airport was easy. The RER Train goes to the Denfert Rocheret metro stop, and one transfer to the 4 line takes you to Port Orleans (the end of the line). If you follow the hotels directions to the Metro exit (Brune N\u00b0 impair), you will leave the metro stop and arrive on the street less than 100 yards/meters from the hotel. \u2022 I departed to Orly, and bus 68 takes you to the Denefert Rochereua bus stop, which connects you to the Orly airport bus. Plan about 90 minutes to get to the airport, although you will probably make it in an hour or a little less. If I do this again I may try the RER train instead as the bus was very crowded. However, hotel staff recommended the bus so they probably know better.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "SydneyMountaingoat", "ReviewID": "UR69130916", "Content": "This is a great little hotel only minutes from the subway station Porte de Orleans and a quite reasonable tariff.

As with other French hotels, the room was small, very clean and very comfortable. The excellent location was a big bonus. When you step out of the Porte D'Orl\u00e9ans metro station, you see the hotel. The lobby is tiny, and the elevator is one of the smallest I've ever experienced. it's rated for three people, but the two of us felt claustrophobic in it. We were on the fourth floor (fifth floor for Americans) and walked up the winding staircase many times rather than wait for the elevator. We had a room with twin beds facing the street. It was very basic, with a writing desk, cabinet for clothing, bathroom with shower, and two beds. A smallish television rests on top of the cabinet. Six or seven channels, the only English one being CNN. But you're not in Paris for the television, right? We purchased a Carte Orange, which gave us a week travelling throughout Paris on the Metro and buses. The Porte D'Orl\u00e9ans is a major transit hub, so expect lots of traffic, but you also can get anywhere in Paris in a relatively short time. Due to the heat, street noise was pretty obvious (we left our windows open). If night time noise bothers you, bring earplugs. One night the Paris bicycle rally went by our window. That was pretty exciting. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. I'd recommend this place as long as you don't have any problems with a tiny elevator (or problems walking up stairs).", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cA Great Base for Exploring at a Budget Price\u201d", "Author": "Tammer1969", "ReviewID": "UR16044493", "Content": "I've just spent 5 nights in this hotel with my girlfriend.

I was looking for accommodation for a long weekend and after checking out the hotel I stayed in a few years ago (the excellent Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles in the Latin Quarter), I realised I would have to think again if my plans for a \"budget\" break were to be realised. I chose Hotel Terminus based on favourable reviews on the Trip Advisor website. It is farther out from the City Centre than I hoped but a saving of 60 Euros a night was not to be sniffed at. The Hotel is at the end of Metro line 4 with the station only 50m from the hotel entrance. This makes it an easy trip from CDG airport with only one change from the RER to the Metro at Denfert Rochereau, three stops from the hotel. The hotel is less than 15 minutes to the City Centre on the same line and Tram line 3 stops directly outside the hotel making a visit to Versailles an easy option. The hotel itself is basic, comprising a reception, small breakfasting area and six floors of rooms. There is a small, typically Parisien lift. Our room was small but adequate and was well furnished with a small but well appointed en-suite. The bed was on the small side, being no more than a standard double but sheets and towels were changed every day and everything was very clean. Our room faced the rear and looked out onto nothing in particular but as a result it was probably quieter than those facing onto the busy street. Breakfast in the hotel was an adsditional 6 euros per person and could be described as \"typically Parisien\" or \"adequate\" i.e croissant, roll, juice and tea, coffee or chocolate. One advantage of staying out with the immediate City Centre was the lower cost of dining out. there are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, all of them less expensive on a like for like basis than City Centre establishments. All in all the hotel provided comfortable accommodation at a reasonable cost and the distance from the City Centre was offset by the excellent transportation links and lower cost of eating out. I would certainly consider using it again.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSmall, Friendly, Clean, Good Value\u201d", "Author": "mrsmith-underwear", "ReviewID": "UR13132739", "Content": "Our stay (3 day / 2 night business trip) at the Terminus Orleans was in a very small room with a tiny bathroom, but the place was friendly, clean and good value for the relatively low cost. Room was at the back, so minimal noise from the busy street, but it was on the first floor and right next to the stairs & cleaner's cupboard, so there was a fair bit of disturbance from those sources. Would recommend asking for a room on a higher floor (or away from the stairs) if the climb (or the miniscule lift!) don't bother you. Ideally placed for the Paris Exhibition centre at the Porte de Versailles (only 8 minutes on the excellent new tram line, from a stop right outside the hotel). Also really not too bad for the city, with a Metro (line 4) station entrance even closer to the door, and a trip of 30 mins or less depending on destination. If coming from CDG, take RER B and change to Metro Line 4 at Denfert Rochereau. Very easy. We had good weather for January, so on a spare afternoon took the tram to its western terminus at Pont du Garigliano and walked along the banks of the Seine to the Eiffel Tower, very pleasant and more to see than in the Metro. Didn't take the breakfast on offer, but the 5 euro price doesn't seem excessive. There are plenty of bakeries / patisseries nearby offering a 'sit at the counter' type 'petit dejeuner' for about the same, and a couple of reasonable Brasseries very nearby. Overall a good experience, excepting the slightly noisy room location, and we would return to the Terminus Orleans.
