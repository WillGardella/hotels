I even went out and bought earplugs but they did not drown out the sound. The rooms look like dorms - certainly not romantic or welcoming. The bathroom was very clean. The wi-fi did not work the entire time I was there, and although I asked about it I was not offered a partial refund for that important amenity.

Located in a scenic neighbourhood, the views from our fourth floor room were charming, overlooking a bustling playground and a bustling little street that was filled with character. The hotel is superbly located within yards of the local metro and we found it easy to access most of the major attractions from our base. Around the corner from the hotel are a number of cafes, one of which serves a delicious breakfast for 9 euro, and we often took a metro just two stops to Montemartre, where there are lots of affordable restaurants, for an evening meal. The staff at the hotel were a pleasure to deal with and were most helpful. The only small criticism I would make is that it appeared that our bath was not cleaned during our four night stay, but in all other respects the cleanliness was more than satisfactory. We will be booking for a return visit in the future and would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a great French experience on a budget.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montpellier, France", "Title": "\u201cClean and cosy, very long check-in\u201d", "Author": "Hikingirl", "ReviewID": "UR126029387", "Content": "The location is central, close to St Georges station, very convenient !

What we liked is that the bathrooms are not cramped - this is sometimes an annoyance in other Paris hotels! The second time we stayed we booked last minute (ours before arrival) and had probably the smallest room in the hotel - it was still very comfortable though. Then, because it was only available for one night and we needed to stay for two, we needed to book a more expensive room. They then also upgraded us, so we stayed in a suite! We didn't need all that space, but it was nice anyway, and I liked the view up the street. Breakfast is delicious and there is a lot of variety - it's worth the price. The staff are very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. But we did have a problem with one particular staff member. First of all he took a ridiculously long time to check us into our second room, even though we thought we sorted it out earlier. I was standing there in reception for 20 minutes! Then I asked him to book us a taxi for a specific time, and when we came down later we discovered he had forgotten! We were very upset as it almost made us late for a wedding.

The hotel runs a shuttle to Disney, which was quite expensive, so we didn't use it, but it's an option if you don't want to bother with a rather tedious train journey on a very crowded train.

The staff was incredibly helpful throughout our entire stay with everything from making restaurant reservations to helping us book and print our Eiffel tower tickets. A special \"thank-you\" to Riadh who went above and beyond to meet our every need. Our rooms were average sized for Paris - not unbearably cramped but not large by any measure. They are modern with new furniture and fixtures. Very comfortable beds and free WiFi that actually works! Everything was very clean except for the carpets which are in dire need of replacement - something we were willing to look past given the quality of everything else. American breakfast is \u20ac12 and well worth it - a great selection of food including basic omelets, fresh breads/croissants, cereals, yoghurts, etc. Housekeeping was outstanding with fresh towels and sheets every day.

Well, I paid around $50 for the motel in Ohio and over $250 for the hotel in Paris. I rather stay on those side of the road Ohio hotels. Issues with this hotel: 1. Room smelled. 2. Internet didn\u2019t work. 3. Maids knocked on the door even when the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign was on the door. 4. Room was smaller than normal (even for Paris). 5. Many staff were unfamiliar with customer service. 6. Had to borrow an iron and ironing board from downstairs. 7. Two twin beds pushed together is not a queen. 8. When I plugged into the Internet, it said that I had to pay. Turns out I didn\u2019t, but wasn\u2019t told that Internet was free when I checked in. Look, I can go on and on. We actually had checked into a smaller room, but when the queen size bed took up the entire room, I asked to change. Since I had used the bathroom (number one), I actually had to pay for another room if I wanted to change. Fine. This room was so small that I couldn\u2019t walk around the bed without touching the walls. You get bigger rooms as a prisoner in Guantanamo. Better lighting too. The second room had very low ceilings. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and I was almost touching the ceilings. The room had a strange smell. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it, but then realized that the maid was taking out the drain and leaving it out. This exposed shower drain to the pipes below and emitted the smell. That or the carpet had previously housed breeding rats. The Internet didn\u2019t work. We tried it with two computers and were told that both of our computers, a Mac and a PC, weren\u2019t compatible with the system. I called during my stay to complain and walked through my laundry list of issues. The manager didn\u2019t do anything to fix my complaints, but dropped off what she said was the \u201cbest champagne in France\u201d. I used my blackberry to see how much it was (my internet wasn\u2019t working) and it costs $25 in the States. Suffice it to say, I returned the bottle.

On Saturday morning, they said we could have a shower in a hotel that belongs to the same company 200 meters away and that we could move there. We didn't bother, as we didn't want to move all our stuff there. We also thought the problem would be sorted during the day. It wasn't. They didn't offer a discount or another kind of compensation. Warning: you can hear the metro going under the hotel. So about every 3 minutes, it's quite unsettling, especially as you don't know what it is first. Then I remembered vaguely I had read this on this site (after booking it, of course). On arrival, I found a short black hair on the bathroom shelf. On Saturday, when we came back to our room in the evening, there was a used pillow case left on the desk and the 2 items that go in the plughole (of the shower) were taken out and left on the shower tray, leaving a big gaping hole . I had to put them back myself. Not complicated but you don't expect that kind of thing. However, the breakfast room is lovely and there's a nice selection of things to eat and drink. Great atmosphere and decoration in this room. Lovely staff. And you can have breakfast till 11am, which was great for us who like lie-ins. About the reception staff: it depends, some were really nice and helpful. On the last day, we could really feel we were bothering the 2 ladies asking about compensation. But one lady gave us the manager's card and said we should ask money back through the web agency we used to book our hotel. But that if we had trouble, we could contact the manager of the hotel. We'll see what happens. About wifi, when my boyfriend went down to reception to ask for the new wifi code, he was left feeling like he was asking for a favour. When you look at the hotel's pictures, you can really be misled into thinking your room and bathroom are going to look big like their pictures. Our room was really small and the bathroom too. But it was modern and had a nice flat screen TV.

Had to close the windows AND use earplugs to avoid having our clothes and room reek of cheap cigarettes. Convenience to the Saint-Georges metropolitan stop was very nice though.

There is only 1 negative remark I can make and that takes the 5th star off my rate: the fact that the bathroom got so WET so fastly is really unacceptable. They should do something about it, put a glass door around the bath or whatever..Because the guests can get injured But let me tell you the housekeeping saw that we'd put towels on the ground so we wouldn't fall, they gave us 3 extra towels each day so we could keep the floor dry after taking a shower...That was very nice of them.

I'd certainly recommend the \"No Stress Cafe\" - it summed up this hotel and its surroundings for me. One small tip - if you are travelling by Metro, the St George station is almost outside the front door, while Pigalle station is well within walking distance as well - in fact it is probably quicker and easier to walk from that station than to transfer to the St George if you are coming from that direction.

Sleeping area, sitting area, flat TV screen (but who would use it on holiday in this City?) and a quite small bathroom, all very clean. Room was not too big, but we only wanted to stay there for sleep and what for having a huge room then? Many \"hot spots\" are very close and within walking distance, metro is quasi near the hotel (one block). You will find many nice restaurants within 5 min walk around the hotel, either french or foreign like indian, lebanese, japanese, chinese, greek,... all tiny restaurants, cute and friendly. we did not book anything for new years eve but found a perfect restaurant without problems. 7 min to Moulin Rouge - and some bigger discos/clubs for \"night owls\". 20 min to Sacre Coeur. 20 min to Louvre. 10 min to Galery Lafayette/Haussman and also the Opera. NEUTRAL Info Take care of your head, if you are bigger than 180cm ;-) as you are directly located under the roof - see the pics. You could feel (we never heard it) the metro especially in the lower floors eg. breakfast room. But up there in the 6th floor never.

CONs Some othere reviews were telling about fire alarms. I can confirm this, as I myself activated it one time. It was really cold in the room, allthough the radiator was on. It did not have more then 18/19 degrees celcius - and the bathroom had no radiator/heater/underfloorheating at all. obviously there is a bad insulation (as mentioned before you are directly under the roof) so it was really [-] cold in the bathroom - definitely 2 degrees below the room temp outside - this IS inconvenient to my opinion. additionally there is a van running day and night in the bathroom (which btw is quite noisy if you want to leave your door open to get it at leat a bit warmed during the night) with such a strong pull that that you felt in on your body. well, take a hot shower and find out what happens with the quickly developping damp... it soon caresses the fire dedector on the quite low roof and - yes - activates it. Well, they definitely have this prob more often, because when they phoned us they just asked: is there really a fire or is somebody taking a shower and left the door open?...

We must have had good karma when we booked as our room though as it was huge (#202). Well appointed, immaculately clean and with some fun touches such as the perspex chairs, we were extremely impressed. Not quite luxe boutique, but the price reflected that. The rest of the hotel lived up to the images on the website and then some. The location was perfect for our first-time trip to Paris, a great base from which to explore the local Montmartre area and right opposite a metro station for forays further afield.

I'm not a fan of Best Western properties but the pictures and previous reviews on Trip Advisor made me decide to take a gamble which I'm delighted to say paid off! The hotel is a bit of a trek from CDG if you go by train (RER and 3 Metro changes) but I made it by myself with a suitcase as my fiance was already in Paris working. The hotel is literally one minute walk from St Georges Metro station and is in a very quiet location with a few brasseries and shops nearby. The public areas are lovely, a mix of very modern and traditional and simple but it's a shame there is no bar. There is a lovely little wine shop around 100m up the road on the right hand side so take a cork screw! On the plus side, the hotel is very quiet at night because of there being no bar full of people. You could hear the Metro under the hotel but it stops at around 1am and it was actually quite soothing to listen to. I'm a very light sleeper and it didn't bother me! The rooms are small with the creakiest floors ever but this just adds to the charm. We could just see the Eiffel Tower at night twinkling in the distance (room 406!) which was a real bonus. We found that buying Metro tickets in books of 10 for 10.90 was the best way to travel as you can use the same ticket as many times as you like for 2 hours. One book lasted us most of the weekend. Head up on foot to the Pigalle at night and go into Chao Bar for some great cocktails and comfy seats. I just wish the no-smoking ban had reached Paris as we smelled like ashtrays by the time we left!

Not in walking distance from Moulin Rouge and Montmartre, we walked it and it was at least 2-3 miles to and fro. Restarants around area just fair. The bad- which was tolerable I guess. The rooms are SMALL, the beds are not full size twin but a 3/4 twin, pushed together, and they are so hard you wake up aching and hurt when you turn. The noise is almost unbearable, if you sleep with windows open you will not sleep. We awoke to sounds of trash truck every morning breaking glass, etc. dumping a very large dumpster, a trumpet playing a wake up call one morning, a jack hammer fixing a hole in the street, and various other early morning noises. We went to sleep each night with the rumble of the metro under the street and this goes on all night and we were on the second floor. Horns beeping, ppl yelling, but they do settle down especially if you have a pillow on your head. Concierge not too knowledgable but kind. Arranged a shuttle to airport at a fraction of cost of taxi, or so they said. Breakfast cold rolls, and hot water for tea/coffee. No coffee maker in room, or tea, will give you one for one night if you request it. In UK there is a nice tea service and goodies in every room. Missed that. The only way I would stay here again is if I got a bargain price, would rather stay in Rue Cler, or Latin Quarter.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwell worth considering\u201d", "Author": "CW88", "ReviewID": "UR4991209", "Content": "Having recently returned from our second stay at the Lorette Opera we would certainly recommend it as a clean and good value option.

The hotel has been recently refurbished, and the communal areas are lovely - very stylish. It does look just like the pictures! Yes, the room was tiny - the double bed took up most of the floor space - but it was very clean and the furnishings were new. The bathroom was pretty small - there was a small bathtub with an excellent shower over it - but again new and spotlessly clean. If - like us - you'd prefer a small but modern room to a larger but dated one, then this is the choice for you. The heating was on in the hotel when we were there. Yes, the room was very warm, but this was quite welcome given how cold it was outside! There is also an opening window - ours overlooked a pretty courtyard - if you need to cool the room down a bit. I did notice a slight rumbling noise from time to time, which I\u2019d guess was from the Metro, but it didn\u2019t bother me too much, and in any case I don\u2019t think the Metro runs into the night. I wouldn\u2019t say the staff were particularly friendly, but they seemed helpful enough. Breakfast in the hotel is a bit steep at 11 euros each for coffee, croissants, bread and yoghurt, but worth a try one day just to check out the breakfast room! The location was also pretty good - within walking distance of Sacre Coeur (although up a pretty steep hill), the Opera and the big department stores - and possibly also other sites, but with a Metro stop literally opposite the hotel, and French taxis being relatively cheap, we didn\u2019t try this out. The only downside is that there's not that much in the way of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. It's a shame there wasn't a bar in the hotel because it would have been lovely to relax in the stylish surroundings. All in all, this hotel served us well, and we would probably go back if we return to Paris. I would probably prefer to stay a little more central - nearer the Seine and the Louvre - or perhaps in the Latin Quarter - but no doubt we\u2019d end up paying considerably more for a hotel that wasn't so nice.", "Date": "November 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, good area\u201d", "Author": "Karen/KLondon", "ReviewID": "UR4130334", "Content": "Great hotel for the price.

I think of myself as something of a veteran of Paris so the things that might bother others I guess I might be used to. The last reviewer comlpained about the A/C being turned off, and it was, so when it got stuffy we just opened the window. This is no big deal. Ok, for the review: Overall, this was a very nice hotel. Its very close to a metro stop, which is very convenient. Its also in a nice area. On the first day there we walked to Sacre Coeur, which took a leisurely 15 or 20 minutes. On several other days we walked to either the Gare du Nord and St. Lazarre, as the hotel is situated roughly right between them. The hotel staff was also professional and helpful, and they answered questions whenever I wanted to know something. The hotel also had all the modern things I needed... in spite of my promise to myself that I would not check email while I was on vacation I did it anyway, and they had a nice computer downstairs set up with a little terminal to swipe your credit card. They also had TV in the room with CNN and BBC in English - much to my dismay they also had Al Jazeera, but then it is France. The hotel property is nice, well decorated, and even charming. There is a neat little courtyard at the ground level. The breakfast area is also very nice, with stone walls and roof. Very European. We didn't eat breakfast there because they wanted 14 euros each for it, and it was much cheaper in the nice little cafe right outside the hotel. The room was small, but there was ample space in the closet for all of our things, and also for our empty suitcases. The bathroom was nice and clean, and the shower was actually quite nice. Good hot water, very good water pressure, and good shower fixtures. I don't have much criticism, really, but here's all that I can think of: some have noted before, the shower in the room leaked water onto the floor, but it wasn't terrible and the hotel provided three smaller sized towels each day to put outside the shower (in addition to the large towels for us). It worked fine. The bed was probably a little too firm for our liking, especially after long days on our feet - but that's not much of a complaint, really. The last thing is that the Pigalle district is not that far away. You'd never know it unless you went looking for it because there are no real tourist landmarks there except the Moulin Rouge - but if you go there then you're going for the specific reason of seeing that area. My girlfriend and I went to see the Moulin Rouge the night before we came home and we were prefectly safe at 10pm walking down the crowded streets full of other tourists doing exactly what we were doing. I can understand that some people might decide due to jet lag, or the stress of traveling long distances that they did not enjoy their trip to Paris. I'm convinced, however, that the only reason you would be disappointed in this hotel is if you just decided you didn't like Paris.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201c'What can I do?!

From CDG Airport, the Roissybus Opera dropped us off adjacent to the oppulent Opera House. From there we took a cab to the Hotel. That cost us \u20ac10 but we could have easily taken the metro to Saint Georges station which is a stone throws away from the hotel. Whatever you do use the Metro. Its efficient and cheap but be warned changing lines can be frequent and to change means plenty of walking up and down stairs. A great way to digest your meal though. The hotel is in the St Georges area and it seemed that the locals think of the place as a mini village within the city. On Sunday morning, they all come out with the roads behind Rue Notre Dame de la Lorette closed to traffic. The shops are open and it has a real sense of community. Very Nice indeed especially the deli which has a great selection of cheeses. There is a good wine shop too. I can't tell you the name of the road I'm afraid but its directly behind the Hotel. Inside, its decorated in white with wood flooring and with sparkling lighting. The room I had was clean, with an excellent bathroom - and yes the shower was great.
