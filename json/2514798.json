Francois and Claudia at the front desk deserve extra kudos for their great attitude and recommendations! The property itself sits in the Latin Quarter - an easy walk to the L'Ouvre and the Orsday, as well as many great restaurants and boutiques. Make sure to take time to explore the neighborhood, you will not be disappointed! The rooms were spacious - make sure if you are traveling with 3 you request an executive versus just a standard triple. The difference in size is well worth the price. Every square inch of this property is spotless, which was a big hit for my family seeing as my daughter is asthmatic! The breakfast was a delight with subtle changes day to day on the menu for those of us staying multiple nights. The workout room was very nice and I was the only one using it each morning of our stay! If you are looking for quiet in a great location, this is the place!

The only negative was Wi-Fi and internet connection which were troublesome. We had been told that certain areas of the hotel had internet reception difficulties and this was certainly true. Eventually, we had to work out of the hotel lobby computer area. The room was comfortable, clean, well- appointed and quiet! The price was on the high end but worth every penny!

I've stayed in hotel rooms in Europe that were too warm, especially during the winter, so it was good to have the option of temperature control. The bathroom was very clean and water pressure was very good. Breakfast was not included in the room rate and at 28 euros, was a bit steep so my companions and I opted to eat at the nearby cafes. There's a cafe half a block away that has a very good International breakfast (tea/coffee, orange juice, croissant, bread, and omelette) for 15 euros. Laduree was also within walking distance (about 10 to 15 mins, depending on walking speed) so it was yet another good breakfast place to go to.

It was very nice, clean, comfortable and in an amazing location. We walked around the area with great ease, firstly up to the Montparnasse area then down to the river and across to the Louvre. Great seeing the Place de la Concorde Obelisk and big wheel to the left and Notre Dame to the right. Lots of shops, bars, restaurants in the area too. There was a metro station pretty much right outside the hotel (Rue de Bac). We got a direct train from there to Montmartre (Abessess) and back again, from Pigalle, going past our stop up to Montparnasse. A handy route. We did the Red Bus open top tour (brrrrr freezing cold). Not the best I'm afraid. The driver sat at stops for ages with nobody getting on or off and the temperature was around -8 C. Other tour buses went past us and the service was supposed to be every 10 minutes. Anyway, we survived. Back to the hotel...breakfast was very nice, continental with hot scrambled eggs and crispy bacon as well. Lots of baguette, croissant, pain au chocolate, bread, fresh fruit, fruit salad, yoghurt, cheese, cold meats, cereal, fruit juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Really nothing to complain about. There is a small but well stocked bar in the foyer area, where coffee as well as alcohol is served. There is a limited menu, I you want to eat in the hotel in the evening, but there are so many eateries close by that are worth investigating. We went to La Fregate, right by the river at the foot of Rue de Bac, the street which runs down from the hotel across Boulevard St Germaine. It was lovely inside, with friendly staff. The food was average unfortunately. We'd had better steaks in Scotland, but the menu was extensive and the wine delicious (every cloud...). The other place we ate in was Cafe Le Flores, round the corner from the hotel on Rue de Grenelle. A bustling, warm and inviting bistro bar, with a good looking menu and wine list. We preferred the food here as well as the ambience. We'd go back. Roast chicken tasted like chicken should and the veal with Morel mushroom and cream sauce was well cooked and very tasty. The only issue in the hotel, in my opinion, was the other clientele slamming their room doors, most unnecessarily. Oh I also liked the shoe polishing machines on each floor. Simple things, but necessary when we were there because of the salt on the pavements to melt the ice. My boots were always cleaned on return to the hotel. We had a room on the third floor (315) which was overlooking the street. No real issue with street noise. This was classed as an executive room. Not massive but a decent enough size with a nice bathroom. Toiletries provided (shower gel, shampoo, body lotion, soap bars) which were replenished each day, whether used up or not. Hair drier in the bathroom seemed adequate enough. Although I didn't use for my hair, it quickly cleared the steamed up mirror after a shower. Wifi access available, which was really only of use in the business area in the foyer, as the signal wasn't strong enough on the 3rd floor. Business area included 2 computers and printers, so we accessed the BA site to check in and print boarding passes. Laptop connections available in the room when wifi was weak.

Thought the location to the elevator might present an issue, but it didn't at all. We loved our (Classic) Room: it faced the street, which was very quiet, and had a quintessential Parisien street view; it was surprisingly large, very warm and cozy, and clean. Thank you, Cedric, for offering us this room. In general, staff were pleasant. Some front desk staff at times appeared rather serious, but very busy and dedicated. We seemed to interact most with Raluca, who was particularly approachable. All front desk staff were very gracious!! Breakfasts were excellent and served in a warm, inviting room. Although hot items included only bacon and eggs, there was a large variety of cold items which was filling. Delicious smoked salmon was offered every second day. The coffee was excellent and the croissants were the best I've ever had, anywhere! Unfortunately, the dinner menu and the one dinner we had (offered in the bar area), were disappointing, especially in comparison to K & K hotels in other cities. As mentioned in one of Rick Steves' Christmas television program, Christmas in Paris is rather understated. And, it certainly is. We were in Paris two weeks before Christmas, and only a handful of cafes/shops were decorated. Our hotel was not decorated at all. The 'huts' at the Christmas Markets were a rather cold white and blue color, as opposed to the cheerful colors elsewhere in Europe; did not see true handcrafted items for sale. The lights along the Champs Elysees (which are apparently different each year) were disappointing; according to one front desk staff, many other people thought so as well. However, the huge Christmas tree under the beautiful stained glass dome at the Galeries Lafayette is worth a visit. Apart from the 'must see' city attractions, one of particular interest was the Sunday morning market on Rue Mouffetard in the Latin Quarter (a long, but do-able) walk from the hotel. From 9 am to 1 pm on Sundays, at the lower end of this market in the Pere Medard Church square, a couple play an accordian and sing, and people (locals and tourists, alike) dance. Aso, the Opera House is stunningly beautiful both inside and outside. Memorable (simple) meals include Au Pere Louis for the cassoulet and french onion soup, the Creperie des Arts for crepes, and Angelina Tea Salon for croquet monsieurs. Favourite macaron was Ladouree's salted caramel.

The towels were very nice but the bed linens and pillows were not the best. There was no way to adjust the heat (other than to open the window) and there was no ventilation in the bathroom.

We did enjoy the buffet breakfast, which had a good selection of quality dairy products, meats, breads and pastries and was accompanied by coffee served by a very pleasant server who knew just when to offer a refill.

We're both young professionals in our 20's. For some perspective, this is my second time to Europe for pleasure and our trip was approximately two and half weeks through many parts of Europe. We stayed at the K+K for three nights. K+K was definitely our best experience of any of the hotels we stayed in. First, we booked a classic room with the \"romantic\" package-basically it was their classic room with an included Seine River Cruise. We were surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to a larger room with a balcony and overlook of the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides' dome. The staff had provided a letter congratulating us on our honeymoon and provided a nice box of chocolates. Later that day we received a knock on the door with a complimentary bottle of champagne! Room: The room was very clean and nicely furnished. We had some trouble with the bed (wood pieces under the bed had become disassembled), but I was able to quickly repair the problem myself and thus never brought it to the staff's attention. Internet was complimentary and provided in the room (this is a BIG deal to me. I would have a hard time rating any hotel in this price range a 5 or higher w/o complimentary WiFi). They also provided a fixed Cat 5 line for those customers wishing for a more stable connection and better transfer speeds. Staff: The staff was extraordinary. Of the other non-English speaking countries we visited, the staff at the K+K was equal only with our hotel in Rome in their excellent command of the language. Also, unlike many places we visited in France, the staff here did not make us feel unwanted for not speaking French (although we did try as we felt it was right to try-we suggest this for any American in France). When they didn't understand something they very politely smiled and laughed with us as both parties tried to reason through a problem. No smirks, no side conservations, no laughing (yes, this did happen in some locations). One of the male staff members (I do wish I remembered his name) helped us our first day. We saw him at a local convenience store one day and he was sure to identify himself, smiled, and said hello. Really everyone was very warm and friendly. Location: Excellent location in the 6th arrondissement. Near shopping and several restaurants (although all were pretty touristy). The hotel is literally 25 meters from the Ru Du Bac Metro station. Unfortunately this is on line 12, which really doesn't go to any of the major tourist destinations by itself. You'll need to make transfers at Concorde for the Louvre or Arc de Triomphe. Take the line to Pasteur to transfer to line 6 for the Eiffel Tower or RER Line C. Building: This is a big deal for us. I get sort of sketched out by any location that looks shady. The front of this hotel was impeccable. Very nice. Looked to be in a very safe area. Due be careful of Paris at night, especially the roads and alleys immediately behind Boulevard Raspail between the Invalides and Eiffel Tower. Paris has perhaps the worst lit streets I have ever encountered in a major first world city of its size. My wife and I got caught out after midnight one night and thought we'd walk back (reasonable distance) given what we perceived would be relatively ok streets and neighborhoods. It was a bad idea, even for people like ourselves who have experience in some shady locals (personal and job related). Be aware of what is behind you, watch dark alleys, and practice very good situational awareness. Ladies: Under no circumstance would I walk alone after dark in Paris-anywhere. We had multiple experiences that reinforced this point, even in this excellent area, but they're not appropriate for elaboration here. Summary: Excellent hotel. Excellent, friendly staff. Large(r) hotel room and good amenities for it's class in Paris.

You can easily walk to many attractions in Paris like the Louvre, Orsey, Notre Dame, St. Chapelle, Rodin, and Napolean's tomb. If walking is not an option, the Rue de Bac metro is right across the street from the hotel. I also like it because it is in a neighborhood and not a major tourist area. I would say the hotel is a mid-sized hotel, modern in style, very clean with a very nice and attentive staff. Rooms are small but modern and clean. I have to say the staff is exceptional. I would like to name names, but I don't want to leave some people out. The bartenders will come to your room and open wine for you or bring you a glass of wine in a matter of minutes. Same thing if you need and extra pillow from housekeeping. The front desk knows your room key number within one day and haves it waiting for you as they see you coming through the door. All of the staff greeted us with a smile each day and asked sincerely how we enjoyed our day. I would have an afternoon glass of wine with the bartender while my husband napped, and they were so sweet and genuine with me. Even if they hated every minute I didn't know it. Only four seats at the bar. The only thing I would say is don't let the guys at the front desk send you to restaurants that Americans or all tourists eat at. I felt like they wanted to send us to places that they thought that the American might want to go to so I had to be clear that I wanted to eat where locals ate, but I still don't think I got that across too well. Definitely go to La Ferma Saint Simon around the corner from the hotel. The little Cafe St. Germain by the hotel is nice for a night cap or afternoon drink also. Good place for people watching. We also did not have our breakfast included (27 euro per person is high when you don't eat a lot in the a.m.) so we would either walk to the market down the street (opens at 8) and get a pastry and yogurt or La Grande Epicerie, a gourmet market behind Le Bon Marche. What a beautiful place. I haven't been to a place in the U.S. that I could compare it to. Maybe a Whole Foods on steroids. One day we went there and got sandwiches, a fruit cup and some divine desserts then walked to Hotel des Invalides for a tour and picnic lunch, but I think Luxembourg Gardens might be even nicer to picnic. If you love mustard as you can see I do, don't miss La Boutique Maille at 6 Place de la Madeleine 75008. You can also buy several flavors in tubes at the gourmet shop and they are easier to transport. Stop by the Barthelemy cheese shop near the hotel also.

I would probably give this hotel a 3.5 stars if the option is available. But since I had to choose between 3 and 4 stars, this hotel is definitely more of a 3 than a 4. First, the first impression of the lobby was good. Everything looked great. Until you go to your room that is.... I read some of the reviews complaining that rooms were tiny. It was alright. Having just came in from Buddha Bar Hotel in Prague, the K+K room was easily half the size. But then again, Paris is a more expensive city so I guess that's to be expected even though I'm paying $100 more per night. The ceiling was average 8' which doesn't help when you have a small square footage room. You would think that a hotel in an old building would easily have 9' ceiling. The photographs on their website made the rooms look really good (like a clean minimalist chic). But in person, it looked almost like a cheap student dormitory. The finishes were really cheap looking. Even the flat screen TV was like 19\" or 21\"(and 30\" TV is so cheap these days!). It was just small. The bed was made of two singles so if you normally sleep on a cal king, it's kinda uncomfortable. Also the bed is really soft. The bathroom was adequate but again, quite cramped. My room had high speed internet but no Wi-Fi. The only place to get Wi-Fi is in the lobby or breakfast room. I had a Ipad so every time I want to use it, I had to get dress and go down to the lobby. The pluses: my room faces the main street but it was quiet. The bathroom floor had radiant heat so it was nice. The breakfast was included and it was fairly descent. Overall, I would not have complained much at all had my room rate being around $200-$220. But it was around $350 so to me, this is definitely not a $350/night hotel hence all the complaints. I would shop around some more if you are looking to pay around $350/night.

My wife went back for seconds to Le Sarah Bernhardt Cafe at 1 Place du Chatelet for chocolate chaud (hot chocolate w/ steamed milk) with THE BEST whipped cream for our late afternoon hot beverage, hanging out and a nice pick me up. You can also get a great crepe from the shop on the corner connected to the restaurant for that meal on the go. Not far from the Moulin Rouge on our first night we stopped at Le Lux Bar on 12 rue Lepic and received a great welcoming to Paris with enjoyable wine and a most generous plate of cheese and pork that was like a meal for only 10 Euros. After a visit to Nepoleon's tomb we had a nice dinner at a reasonable price at La Source Bar-Brasserie, 49 BD De Latour-Mauborg.

Its about 10min walk to river Seine and louvre and the start of the Champs Elysees, then either turn right and half hour to Notre Dame or turn left and about 40min walk to eiffel tower.

The 2 computers in the lobby were a nice amenity, although at times could be hard to get on. The continental breakfast was fairly basic but as others have mentioned, a great way to fill up before heading out for the day. At the breakfast table, I found it helped the staff to just leave my room key facing up on the table in plain view so they didn't have to ask what room I was staying in. And be sure to leave 1 euro per person seated for tip, because the restaurant staff take away your plates and are constantly asking if you take tea or coffee. People are complaining about the size of the room, but nobody is talking about the quality. The rooms are very modern and stylish and the climate control thermostat makes the rooms very comfortable. Again, leave 1.50 euro per day on the bathroom counter for the chamber maid as recommended by Rick Steves travel guru.

However I could not and the cumulative effect of the below is I won\u2019t be going back to this hotel unless I have to: It took the receptionist 5 minutes to recognise I wanted to check in rather than watch her surf the internet. A notice in the lift \u2013 not mentioned at check in informed me of the hotel would have no hot water from 10.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m the next day. Of course this was no fault of the Hotel\u2019s, being necessary maintenance work affecting all buildings in the immediate area, but they could have made this known on their web site before I booked and were not prepared to offer a price reduction. My colleague stayed at the Hotel Bonaparte, a few streets away, and when the hot water issue affected him, he was given an entire night for free. The room was perfectly good and the TV seemed to have a few more English speaking channels than French hotels usually do. A small packet of Jeff De Bruges chocolates in the room was a nice touch. Room service food was ok for flavours and quality of cooking but was cold by the time it arrived and expensive - 43 Euros for soup, boeuf bourguignon, water and a diet coke. They had obviously ran out of diet coke so gave me a normal bottle of coke and took the paper off so I would realise it was diet coke. Being a coca-cola addict their efforts failed, the coke was left unopened and the cold food eaten as I was starving. I didn\u2019t have the energy to complain and wait for another delivery.

Having spent a lot of time in Europe over the last year I was careful to try to find just the right hotel: great location, slightly upscale but quiet and friendly. The Hotel Cayre was the perfect choice. The hotel is located just outside the Latin Quarter. It is convenient to the subway and about a 15-minute walk from the Seine, the Louvre and the Eifel tower. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area. I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel Cayre. This is the best hotel I have encountered in Europe including the major Marriotts in Rome and Zurich. The room was great. I upgraded to an Executive room and it was worth it to have the extra space. It had plenty of space for the 2 of us. The bathroom was well appointed and had a heated floor that was nice in the mornings. The king size bed was great and had comfortable down bedding with lots of pillows. Although on the main drag (Boulevard Raspail just off St Germain) the hotle was unique in that you can get a quiet room but still have a nice view (of the Eifel tower). I am a very light sleeper. Our room was on the 6th floor and very quiet. The staff was impeccable and fluent in English. Everyone we encountered was always friendly and helpful. They recognize you. There was no indifference on the part of any staff members (as you encounter in some establishments). There is some debate among travelers about the desired language skills of the staff. Some travelers want to immerse themselves in French but I have stayed in hotels where English was not even the second language and it can cause some problems. While in Paris, if you don\u2019t speak French you will find it important to have a hotel staff that does. The restaurant was very good. We ate every breakfast there over a 4-day stay. It is open for a buffet breakfast and carried the typical European fare as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. They open early and stay open until 10 or 11am. Thereafter, they can serve on an as-needed basis and handles room service needs. The bar is small but very functional. In-room internet is free.

Some of my family and I went on a wine tasting tour with Donna Morris one evening. Here is her website: www.bestfriendinparis.com. We visited three cavistes and had three bottles of wine at each place. It was fantastic. We had a nice progression of wines from the bubbly to the deep red (last stop). Donna is very easy-going and entertaining and provides a glimpse of how the local Parisians buy and drink their wine. I would definitely do Donna's tour next time I visit Paris.

The Rue de Bac Metro stop is outside the door; there is a bus stop across the street.

We found the hotel was even better the second time around. Three years ago, we had a standard room, which was good but a bit cramped. This time, we reserved an \"executive room\" and found the extra space made a significant difference that was well worth the relatively modest extra cost. (Oddly enough, the larger room had a smaller bathroom, but it was still OK.) The first visit, our room faced a quiet courtyard, which we assumed was essential as the hotel faces fairly busy streets. On the recent trip, we were assigned a room facing the Rue du Bac. At first we thought we'd have to ask for a room change. But -- surprise, surprise -- the soundproofing was extremely effective. So we had a very cheery light room (401) with a pleasant view of a charming street. Rooms facing the busier Boulevard Raspail conceivably might be noisier, but we're told they're OK too. One reason is that while the Cayre looks like an old hotel, it is actually a comfortable modern hotel built within the shell of an old hotel. Among other things, the air conditioning is effective and quiet. The modern decor is quietly elegant. Though our bathroom could have been bigger, it was quite up-to-date. The hotel gave us a rubber mat for the tub, which was quite slippery. We reserved our room on the hotel's Web site, which offers packages that the hotel says are available only on that site. Our rate included the pleasant buffet breakfast. It defintely pays to get this deal as the breakfast would be quite expensive on its own. As in the past, the hotel's service was efficient and friendly and the location is as good as ever. Of course, there is no shortage of excellent restaurants in this expensive neighborhood and beyond. But when you are trying to recover from the 100 euro \"lunch special\" at Guy Savoy -- worth every centime by the way -- you can eat cheaply within a few minutes of the hotel. With no pretense whatsoever, Cafe Flores on the Rue du Bac and Le Bizuth headed toward Saint Germain des Pres on the Boulevard Saint Germain serve very adequate standard fare at decent prices.

The room was one of the largest I've had in Europe, and the beds were comfortable. Very quiet room, with high ceilings, overlooking an inner courtyard with a garden. The furniture was contemporary, and the room had a very stylish feel. The bathroom was modern, spacious and very clean, with a great water pressure. Nice soft, large bathsheets, too. Thought the kettle and teas near the minibar was a nice touch. Our rate of 330 Euros included breakfast for 3, and I'm glad it did. IThe breakfast costs roughly 25 Euros if purchased separately from the room. It was the nicest hotel buffet I've had in France- similar quality to the best breakfast buffets I've found in Athens and Berlin. Fresh squeezed juices, many choices of pastries, cheeses, cereals, fruit, yogurt, bacon, eggs, etc. They even had champagne, smoked salmon and foie gras as options. Too bad I'm counting my calories. What I found most amusing were the other guests at the buffet. I seriously wondered if they were trying to get their money's worth by hoarding the cheeses and other big ticket buffet items. I cut a 1/2 inch (roughly 1/3 ounce) slice of camembert off the 5 ounce piece that was on the tray, and saw through the corner of my eye, that a 12 year old boy was in my personal space, so close that he brushed my arm. I hadn't even fully removed my slice off the tray when he stuck his fork into the remaining 4.5 ounces of cheese, put it onto his plate and walked away. A few minutes later, Cheese Boy was circling the empty cheese tray like a shark. A little while later, I saw another man with a 4 ounce piece of cheese on his plate. And then I understood why the staff replenishing the cheese tray kept the pieces of cheese on the cheese tray relatively small- to prevent customers from taking 25 euros worth of cheese in a single setting. In my 2 weeks in France, this was the only place I saw a table where each individual had taken 2 pain au chocolats, in addition to their heaping plate of bacon, smoked salmon and egg. Fantastic opportunity to people watch, if I do say so. The hotel has a business centre, as well as 3 computers with internet access. I found it interesting that the keyboards were anglophone style, as opposed to French keyboards. What was too bad, is that there was no policy suggesting that people limit their internet time if other guests are waiting. I usually try to hurry myself up if I see someone waiting. I might be getting crusty now that I'm the ripe old age of 35, but I think the teenagers surfing the net for bikes or updating their facebook should not take priority over people who have to confirm flights. This isn't the hotel's fault- I think it's more of an entitlement issue with some of the guests the hotel seems to attract. I had asked one of the gentleman working at the front desk for a recommendation for a non-touristic bistro, after he was unable to get through to the restaurants I had on my list. I walked to the restaurant he suggested, and was disappointed to see that it was indeed a tourist trap serving French onion soup and club sandwiches, overlooking the Seine on an expensive piece of property. I found something else nearby, that worked out, but I guess I've now learned my lesson- research my restaurants more carefully in advance, make advance reservations and don't ask the front desk for restaurant recommendations. The hotel staff were very courteous, and the place was immaculate. Seemed to be a very popular place with Brits, Americans, Italians, etc. So much so, that I almost forgot I was in Paris when I was inside the hotel.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at K&K Cayre\u201d", "Author": "SussexMark", "ReviewID": "UR18395175", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights and booked direct with the hotel after seeing other positive reviews on this site.

I've known this place for a while. Stayed here in 11.2006, also stayed in the Hotel's branch in Budapest. Was always quite happy with it, nice styling and atmosphere, but I guess all good things must come to an end. First, they don't tell you that being infront of a metro station has its problems. The rooms shake when the trains go by, and they do that all day. I thought it was just my room last time, but being in 2 different rooms in 2 different floors I can safely say: the hotel vibrates. Secondly, don't accept any room in the first floor.I did, and recieved a room which was at lower ground level, very small for more than 200 euro a night, and no light! Thirdly, I took the deal giving a free boat tour on the river. The reception didn't give me anything until I asked for it specifically. Niether did I get the \"special gift\" promised on the web site. Fourth, our room was not cleaned in the second day.Someone was in the room, we could have seen that, but no clean towls,no fixing the bed, nothing. We called reception and told them. In response, they asked what do we \"want\". So we asked for a cleaning lady to come in about an hour an a half,because we are sleeping. She came after 30 minutes,woke us up. in the check out day,we were woken up by the cleaning lady at about 08:30. She wanted to clean the room. the whole scenario was not of a 4 star hotel, but rather a 2 star one. Lastly, I recieved in my last visit a 10% discount, and was told that my data will be kept online (I was there for a week). So when reserving, I asked for my discount, quoting the exact date of stay. No,they said: send us the voucher. I had non, as I was told that it will be fine.Check your record, I suggested. They did, found out I did stay, did get a voucher. However,they insisted they cannot give me the discount without it physically. At this point I remembered I got the business card of the manager. Even that didn't help. To conclude, They were rigid and rude to a returning costumer. They did not display any sort of 4 star standard. Room was very small,with no day light. The hotel vibrates.

We had visited Paris in 2003 and had an unpleasant experience with our hotel; on this trip, however, we were VERY pleasantly surprised...with everything. The location could not be more perfect. Located in high-end St. Germaine-des-Pres (one of the nicest districts in all of Paris we were told) and directly across from a metro station, the hotel is located in the heart of the city in a picturesque, stereotypical \"Parisian\" neighborhood. It is central and convenient to everything (or transportation to wherever you may want to go) but not in the middle of the madness. Again, the metro is right across the street and traveling on it was not nearly as difficult as I had expected; if you've manuevered on a subway before (or if you can read and know your colors, you should do just fine.) Also, it was a short walk (10 min.) to the Seine/Musee D'Orsay, which was a central stop for all of the touring companies. Quaint shops, upscale boutiques, and several convenience stores (tucked away out of sight) make this hotel's location ideal for any type of shopping you want to do. Perfect, PERFECT location! The rooms were lovely--recently renovated and clean with a modern decor. Our room was small but, then again, that's just how they are in Europe. GORGEOUS view from our terrace. Perfect! Also, the hotel staff was charming, friendly, and extremely helpful. They were ever-ready to provide us with information, assistance, and a warm \"hello\" (by name) every time we came or went. (Also, there weren't any language barriers; they gladly spoke English and introduced my mother to a little bit of French.) The breakfast menu was delicious but lacked variety. I'm a vegetarian, so the only thing I was able to eat every morning was bread and fruit. I couldn't possibly eat another croissant right now if I wanted to; eating them morning, noon, and night will do that to ya, though. (It was my choice not to eat the sliced meats, bacon, and eggs, though.) Than again, I gained a few pounds while there (despite the walking) so it must not have been that bad. We didn't have dinner at the hotel but did have dessert there on several occassions, and it was TO DIE FOR (the chocolate cake with ice cream and the apple tart, especially). Great patisserie (Dallyou) is right around the corner. We just couldn't be more pleased with this selection of hotels. Again, perfect. Our stay couldn't have been better, and we will return to the K& K when we come back. This really was the perfect hotel in every way. BTW...We felt completely safe, coming and going at all hours.

You MUST reserve a dinner cruise on the Bateaux Parisiens. It was simply an amazing experience. So amazing that a couple next to us got engaged while on our cruise! 3. Go to the museums (especially the Louvre) when it first opens to avoid the lines. 4. Metro is very easy to use and is a great option to get to different parts of the city.

We pick K & K Cayre for its relatively reasonable price for a 3-4 star hotel because everything is so expensive in Paris. K & K did not disappoint us. The hotel meets our expectation in term of comfort. It is clean, modern and well equipped with daily essentials. Lodging is important for us because we really wanted a comfortable place to relax after every long sight seeing day, not necessary luxurious but comfy enough for a tired day. Room is a little small as expected for Paris. We got an upgrade room and the size is okay for us, enough space for two of us and our baggages. No toothbrush and bathrobe in the room but you could request them at the reception. A little nice thing....there is a shoe polisher close to the elevator. Hotel staff are very friendly and speak fluent English. We were given a room facing the court yard. That's what we requested for its quietness. It did not bother us too much that the rooms facing us are quite close when we open the window. Maybe should ask for a room facing the main street without facing close building but may need to deal with some street noises during the morning. The location is pretty quite in the nite, but we feel very safe to walk around. There is a Shell station with a mini mart next door and a small supermarket just around the block from the hotel for any essentials that you need. We bought our drinking water from Shell which costed us 2 Euros for 6 bottles (1 Litre each); very good deal. Few brasseries around the corner. A short walking distance is one of the best restaurants in Paris; L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. If you have a chance, try this restaurant. You will really enjoy but just a little pricey. Hotel staff helps to make reservation but was fully booked throughout the week. We went there one evening to check it out and we were able to get a table within 10 mins due to some cancellation; lucky us! There is a post office is across the street. A metro station, Rue du Bac, is also just in front of the hotel. We used metro as our main transportation because it is so convenient to get to anywhere. You can get a five days unlimited pass for 27.50 Euro. That pass covers the metro, RER and buses within Paris city limit. You can also take bus route 69 at Rue du Bac (bus stop at the corner of the hotel) to take you to Eiffel Tower. The only down side that I could comment about the hotel was the in-room internet access. It was free but not wireless. You had to ask the front desk for an ethernet cable.

This was our first trip to Paris (although I have traveled extensively across four continents) and we were very pleased with our hotel stay. The hotel is as described and as pictured and we found the many reviews here at tripadivsor to be very accurate. We confirmed our reservation via email ahead of time and requested a non-smoking room and a room with a view if available. We arrived early and our room was ready for us. We stayed on the 7th floor and yes the rooms are pretty small as seems to be the Parisian standard; however, I was expecting it to be shockingly small... rather it was tight but adequate. Our queen size bed was pretty comfortable. I would recommend staying on the 6th floor because the 7th floor had slanting rooflines that cut into the room space. The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean with a contemporary decor. The heated tile floors were a nice touch in the bathroom and I enjoyed a hot bath every night. We used the lobby computers daily to check email, look up Paris information, etc. Our breakfast was included with our room cost and was delicious with a nice variety from which to choose. Generally the service was extremely pleasant in both the breakfast room and front desk. Americans... remember to be polite and formal, never assume anyone speaks English, don't speak so loud that the whole room can hear you, and use some basic French and you will not have any problems!! The hotel is centrally located in a quiet neighborhood right across from a not-so-useful subway line. You pretty much have to transfer once or twice to get most destinations but it is so quick it is hardly an issue. We were pros at the subway be mid-week. It\u2019s a good walk to most locations so you will have to sacrifice fashion for comfort in your footwear ladies. If you want to be able to step out of your hotel and be immediately surrounded by nightlife and cafes and restaurants, you might want to consider staying in the Latin Quarter instead. We felt safe pretty much everywhere we went. Brace yourself for the exorbitant prices. I regret not buying a food/dining book (we only had our general Paris guidebook). We had some really excellent meals at restaurants recommended in our guide and some disappointing experiences when we randomly picked a place. It is quite depressing to spend over $100 on what turns out to be the equivalent of salisbury steak and tater tots so PLAN AHEAD for meals! The French eat dinner very late, like 8:30 pm, so we had a big breakfast at the hotel, a light snack at mid-day, and then a big dinner late. The hotel staff were happy to make reservations for us. The Shell station next door was good for snacks but if you love food absolutely go check out the Bon Marche grocery store just a few blocks away\u2026 it\u2019s a culinary delight. We budgeted about $250 dollars a day for two to cover transportation, entrance fees, meals, a few gifts, and misc. and we even came home with some money. Our most expensive meal (with wine) was about 150 Euros and our cheapest restaurant meal (with wine) was about 75 Euros\u2026 of course street food and cafes are much cheaper and a good option for lunch. Do NOT exchange money at the hotel or at the airport the rates are truly horrible\u2026 there is a money exchange about 10 minutes down St. Germain Blvd on the left with a good rate. One last quick tourist tip, skip the ridiculous lines to go up the Eiffel Tower and instead go to the Montparnasse Tower at night for a breathtaking view of the city and a bottle of wine.

My most negative comments however are reserved for the staff at the front desk.They are not particularly helpful or friendly or indeed knowledgable.I really felt they were not interested in their guests or in enhancing their stay.Due to a spectacularly major screw-up by one of them we were initially left with nowhere to celebrate our daughters birthday dinner.After much upset they managed to secure us a reservation at an alternative place of our choice and ,in mitigation ,left a bottle of champagne in our room --which I felt was a nice gesture-but also that a mistake such as this should not happen in a hotel that calls itself 4*+.So bottom line -would we stay there again? No--partly because the location although \"good\" offers so little but mostly because the staff appear to care so little.Next time we will stay in the Marais where the rooms may be small but the district and its vibe more than makes up for this.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but no bargain\u201d", "Author": "ohioriver", "ReviewID": "UR8030754", "Content": "I stayed here for 6 days with my two daughters in June.

Yes, the room was small, but it was the standard double so we weren't expecting a penthouse. The room was spotless, airy, had high ceilings, a terrace with a view of Montmarte, large comfortable bed, nice bathroom with heated floors and was very quiet even though we faced the street (we were on the 6th floor). The desk staff was extremely helpful and cheery. Three computers in the lobby for free Internet access (other hotels we've stayed in charged for this). As others have mentioned the Shell station convenience story is very handy for bottled water, fresh fruit and snacks. The best part is the true centrality of the hotel. As others have said, directly across the street is the Rue de Bac Metro stop which gives you easy access to pretty much everywhere. Some trips mean switching trains, but the number and letter system is pretty easy to follow once you get a sense of direction. This was our second trip to Paris. The first time we got around fairly well, but this time by the third day we were like natives. Also close by are bus stops. Busses are very easy to learn too. The routes can be a little confusing until, again, you get your bearings. Two blocks away from the hotel you can catch the #69 and it'll take you to Pere LaChaise. Interesting ride that'll help you learn the city. The hotel is also in walking distance to the Louvre, Musee de Orsay, Eiffel Tower, the Seine, Cathedral of Notre Dame...all the cool stuff. Restaurants are plentiful in the area. Some are pricy, others are just your basic bistro. It's best to discover places on your own. Go to Rue de Bourgogne (a few blocks away) and you'll see ten restaurants. We had a great, inexpensive meal at a Vietnames place called Le Lotus Blane. After you've visited Notre Dame stroll over to 30 Rue Saint-Louse en L'ile. Small, cozy, good food, good price. If you don't feel like French food and want something simple like pizza walk out the door, turn to the left, cross the street past the bistro on the corner, turn to your left again and you'll see both an Italian restaurant and the pizza parlor. Very tasty. The area is great for walking. We were out late and felt completely safe. The area is very high end. If you moved to Paris you'd want to live here.

This was at the end of a month long trip around Europe. We enjoyed all of the places we stayed on this trip, with the exception of the K&K. This hotel was a disappointment and (by comparison) was poor value for the money. We booked a standard double room using Orbitz.com paying Euro 245 per night ($331). Our room (#417) was very small, with barely enough room to walk around the bed. This was definately cramped quarters for two persons (probably OK for a single person traveling alone). Out of curiosity, I measured the dimensions of the room and found it to be about 10.8 m2 (116 ft2) including the bathroom and the closet. The furnishings & decor in the room were quite spartan, in keeping with the minimalist style of the hotel. The small bathroom did not appear to have adequate ventilation to remove moist air, and the room itself seemed stuffy unless the window was opened. The comments other travellers have made about the subway noise were definately correct. Even though we were on the 4th floor, we could hear & feel the rumble of subway trains passing under the hotel every few minutes until quite late in the night. The location near the intersection of Blvd St Germain and Blvd Raspail is very convenient, however, the presence of a Shell gasoline station next to the hotel detracts from the ambiance. On the positive side, the hotel is very clean, well maintained and apparently recently deocorated and renovated in a modern minimalist style. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast buffet was also very nice. Our only real serious complaint was the size of the room. The hotel should be more responsible and advise those booking on the internet of the the room size so there are no surprises at check-in. We felt that we had received poor value for our money ... especially since we had stayed at another Paris hotel in the same neighborhood earlier in our trip which was very spacious and comfortable.

(However, I'm a maximizer and my husband thought I was in my 'the grass is always greener' mode.) There is a great brasserie on the corner of St. Germain and Raspail that we stopped at for breakfast and late night desserts (crepes with Grand Marnier) and several places to grab sandwiches and pastries for the day. The staff at the hotel were wonderful and very helpful. We felt the rooms were very spacious (compare to the rooms we stayed in during a trip to Italy - Rome, Florence, Venice). The bathroom was modern and suitable for one at a time. (We're average size people, but our parents are heavier set and older and we felt they would probably have had issues/complaints with the bathroom size). We had a room facing the courtyard, which was fine since we only spent time in our room getting ready in the morning, getting ready to sleep, sleeping and some.... There have been reviews that note the noise/vibrations of the metro can be bothersome. We were on the 3rd floor and neither of us ever noticed it. But, we were so exhausted after our 16 hour days of sight-seeing (and lounging at the cafes people watching), that we slept very well each night.

The location was great, the rooms were clean and modern and the service was excellent. English is no problem for the staff here, and the free internet in the lobby is very handy. The location \u2013 The hotel is located in St. Germain, right across the street from the Rue Du Bac metro station. The district is mostly known for its high end shops and various restaurants. It was a 10 minute walk to the Louvre and other landmarks. Having the metro station across the street was extremely convenient. There are tons of restaurants and shops around the area, but there is no nightlife. For more on late night restaurants and lounges, I think Latin Quarter would be a better pick. I liked coming home from a long day of walking to a nice quiet place. The hotel room \u2013 The room is decorated with extremely modern furniture and clean lines. Think a much higher end of Ikea. It was a decent size for European standards. The bathroom was very nice and modern as well. Marble countertops, glass showers and enough toiletries to last you for a week. My boyfriend and I aren\u2019t too picky with rooms as long as it was clean and pleasant. We had a room on the 6th floor with a floor to ceiling window that opened up into a small balcony. We had a view of the Sacre Ceour, which was gorgeous at night when it was lit up. Ask for a room on the higher floors with views. I emailed the hotel before I went on the trip requesting for non-smoking room with a king size bed and a view. They emailed me back the next day and told me that they would accommodate me. It was nice that they were so responsive. Quite honestly, we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel since we were walking around for most of the day. Restaurants \u2013 There was only one restaurant in the hotel which we never ate at. I was not complaining since there were plenty of other places to choose from around the area and in Paris in general. My favorite place for breakfast was this bakery called Le Croissanterie. They had the most variety and most delicious pastries. It\u2019s baked on premise so it was fresher than anything. The sandwiches are also worth trying. Service \u2013 When we checked in, the guy asked jokingly if we were on our honeymoon. We said no, but when we came back to our room after lunch, there was a bottle of champagne and 2 glasses for us anyway. We thought it was extremely nice of the staff. The room was always cleaned and well stocked every day. We spoke English to everyone in the hotel and was not snubbed or treated unfairly. Feel free to ask the guys at the front desk for restaurant recommendations. My boyfriend had a craving for mussels so they recommended a nearby restaurant that served only mussels. Not only did he tell us about the restaurant, he printed out a map and showed us how to walk there. All in all, I enjoyed my stayed with K+K Cayre immensely. It was a great hotel. Nothing beats the location. You will be thankful that the Metro is literally right across the street after a long day of walking. Tip \u2013 There is a gas station next door to the hotel. Buy water/beverages/snacks there. It will save you tons of money. The Catacombs is a must visit, as well as Versailles.

The complimentary high speed internet was wonderful and we had no problems at all with it. The bathroom was small but functional, though more counter space would have made things easier.

The staff was exceptional...extremely polite and helpful with every request. There is a Shell gas station just up the street, which is nice and convenient for getting snacks and water for in the room. The French bread we got there was better than any bakery French bread here in the states! Needless to say that the French bread from the patisseries was out-of-this-world! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to stay here again. The view definitely made the cost worthwhile. We loved coming back to the room after a long day, having wine, cheese, and bread, and watching \"the show\" of blinking lights on the Eiffel Tower.

We chose the K+K Hotels because Brian had stayed at the Cayre a few years ago and thought it was great. Here are my impressions... We got to the hotel around 4:00 - so no problem getting right into our room. The lobby was very clean and uncluttered...couches to sit on to the right and a little bar with more seating to the left. Just beyond the front desk to the left was the breakfast room which was bright and airy with again, plenty of seating (I'll get back to breakfast later.) Our room... We were on the 2nd floor (204 - non-smoking!!) overlooking one of the side streets with cute little shops (I'll try and find the name.) It wasn't views of the Eiffel Tower, but it was very Parisian and we spent some time out on our balcony people watching. When the balcony doors were closed we were impressed by how quiet it was - it made for good sleeping!! Furnishings were minimal but what you need - bed, nightstands, a table and chair, as well as a desk and chair. There is a flat-panel TV (which we never even turned on) and a mini fridge in the cabinet below. The room is small, but not THAT small. We utilized the closet and the suitcase stand and we were just fine. The room seemed to have been recently updated. We were pleased to find a \"real\" fullish-sized bed (not two pushed together) with very nice (and clean!) linens. The comforter is down and there is a blanket in the closet for those of you who get too warm with down. The pillows are very comfortable as well - not the typical paper thin, rock hard numbers we've all encountered! The room had free wi-fi which we made use of every day - but if you don't bring your laptop, there are two computers (free usage) just off the main lobby by the elevators. Nice touch. The bathroom was small. Very small actually, but again, it's not like you spend that much time in there. The counters are granite, the shower is tile and the granite floor is HEATED! That to me made up for the room being so small!! There was always hot water and the pressure was excellent. There is a hair dryer in the bath and they do provide products - though as I found with the hotel in London, I wasn't crazy about the products and the hair dryer was no match for my thick hair and I had to try it in stages for fear it would blow up! Okay, maybe not blow up, but it got very warm in my hand. I'm sure you ladies will understand... There is also a small fitness room and massage area on the lower level complete with a sauna and showers. If you are interested in getting a massage, you must book in advance as their hours are limited. You can get a massage on off-hours, but you will pay extra for it. We didn't utilize the fitness room, though one morning when we overslept, Brian went down there and showered so we could both get ready at the same time...so that was really convenient to have that option. The front desk staff were polite and helpful. They weren't quite as chatty as the crew in London, but they did they're jobs efficiently and were kind enough to help with directions and suggestions when asked. They did help us make reservations at the Buddha Bar our first evening - which we never thought we would be able to get on such short notice (it was excellent!!!) The location is ideal if you like to walk, take the bus, or prefer the metro..... We walked to the Louvre twice and the Eiffel Tower - so the sites are within comfortable walking range. We also bought a mulit-day metro pass which we utilized to get to Notre Dame (The Rue de Bac station is literally across the street from the hotel.) I must say that their metro isn't quite as easy to navigate say compared to London's. We weren't in any particular hurry so we got on the trains we THOUGHT we were supposed to get on and hoped for the best! Luckily we didn't have any major problems. I suggest if you want to use the metro take your time and study the maps in the station and don't be afraid to ask the metro employees for help - they are all over the place. Okay, back to the hotel... Breakfast was included in our rate (which was around 200 euro) so we did eat at the hotel every morning. We found it to be filling and they did replenish the items right up until 11:00. One morning we overslept and got down there at about 10:55 and the staff didn't seem bothered by it. There are eggs and sausages if you want something warm, or there is the traditional meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, cereals, etc that you typically see on European breakfast buffets. The coffee was strong and the juices seemed fresh squeezed. There is also complimentary champagne (a little to early for us!) There are plenty of great little restaurants close by, as well as the Shell station right down the street...you could grab breakfast or lunch in a flash for little $$. The location is ideal, the neighborhood is charming (i'm sad we didn't have more time to explore the great stores nearby!) and we felt very safe walking even late at night. Oh, and to address the metro rumblings below...I remember reading about it in some reviews before we left, but I never thought about it (or felt it for that matter) until we were having breakfast on our 2nd morning. To me it almost felt like a really big semi was driving down the street in front of the hotel - less the noise. It passed quickly and it really wasn't a big deal. Overall I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and I'm pretty confident that we'll be back someday - hopefully sooner than later!!

Sure enough, we had the three corner rooms on the 4th floor. Our triple rooms had different floor plans but each was spacious. The down blankets were so soft and warm. We loved the in-room coffee/tea service and the heated bathroom floor. The staff was friendly and helpful. They offered great restaurant suggestions and answered questions cheerfully. I requested wake-up calls on most mornings and it worked out well. I wrote the hotel prior to our arrival to request tickets to Disney Paris. When we arrived, the tickets were waiting for us upon check in. I saw the lines for tickets once we arrived at the park and was so thankful that Franck at the reception desk had arranged the tickets for us - this saved us a tremendous amount of time. The breakfast was included in our rate, so that worked nicely. The breakfast room to the left of the lobby is cheery and bright \u2013 such a nice way to start the morning. The coffee was terrific and the hot and cold breakfast selection was quite good. The mini baguettes and the sugar bread were baked fresh daily, eggs and bacon were hot, and the fruit, cheese and pate selection were good.

As far as the comments on the rumbling of the metro, I did feel a mild rumbling as the train passed underground when I was in the breakfast room on the ground floor. However, we had rooms on the 4th floor, so it was not a problem for us. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel for families.

We were able to get a fantastic rate well below the rack rate. Second, this property has the distinction of lacking the ever present odor and stain of cigarettes so common to hotels in France. Whether owing to some policy, great ventilation or the general lack of smokers, the lobby, breakfast room and rooms were refreshingly free of smoke and smokers. Also, there is a nice, small workout/relaxation/sauna room downstairs with direct elevator access that offers complimentary terry cloth robes and slippers.

We were upgraded from an executive room to a suite upon arrival. However, we booked the hotel directly from the hotel's own website, kkhotels.com, and paid 295 euros a night including breakfast and a welcome gift (a box of chocolate). The breakfast is the same everyday during our stay. Quality of the food is fine if you don't mind eating the same thing everyday. If all you want is coffee and a croissant in the morning, the next door Shell station/grocery store has those as well. However, if you want a proper breakfast and you like to eat late, breakfast is served until 11 am! The suite is large by Paris standard. Our room was on the 6th floor facing the courtyard. It is very quite but the walls are thin. You can hear your next door neighbors talking and doing whatever else they are doing...The quality of the bedding is down/feather filled but the bed itself was rather soft. If you have a laptop, each room has free highspeed internet connection. The bathroom is very modern with good water pressure for a nice hot shower. It also has heated floor and a decent blow dryer. The location is ideal, easy access to multiple subway stations on different train lines. It is right in front of the small Rue Du Bac Metro station but within walking distance (10-15 minutes) to St. Germain des-Pres and Sevres Babylone stations.

If you want to go sightseeing, Cityrama Office (it offers all kinds of bus tours) is a 15 to 20 minute walk (5 euros by taxi) away. Overall, we had a pleasant stay but the price we paid was a bit on the expensive side for such a small boutique hotel. It lacks the ''luxury'' part of hotel services, such as a fully equipped gym, a swimming pool, restaurants, and full spa services.

It is close to the Bonne Marche department store at Sevres et Babylone. The Muse d' Orsay is within easy walking distance. Finally the Hotel Matingon (the prime minister's residence) is nearby which means that there is a 24 hour police presence in the neighbourhood. Rooms vary in size. Some are on the small side.

Only after our first night there, having the french doors open and hearing the locals laughing and getting ready for a night on the town...waking up to the baker and chocolatier making their goods...listening to the students coming down the street ...did we realize we had an incredible view. The staff was incredibly helpful with us getting around and recommending excellent restaurants (le petite chaise). The room was a good size and the french doors were beautiful. Then add on the heated marble floors in the bathroom and you felt like you were in heaven. Oh, and who could forget the extremely convenient Shell Station next door where you can buy the most inexpensive milk and soda and other small things there. There is also a supermarket around the back along with a photo shop, bakery, chocolatier, rotisserie (great chicken), and a few wine shops. We actually spent a few days just on the block eating and taking food and wine back to our room! I would absolutely go to this hotel, recommend it to anyone traveling, and also try out the K & K chain just because of this one good experience.

Pros: * The location is even better than I had thought. Many on this site have cited the metro station right in front of the hotel and its proximity to Orsay and Louvre museums; to me St Germain des Pres is a great neighborhood in its own right that's worth exploring. Around Place St-Germain-des-Pres (10 minutes' walk on Bld St Germain) are many nice boutiques where Parisians like to shop; great cafes for people-watching; great restaurants; and a street full of art galleries (Rue de Seine). * The hotel was renovated fairly recently, so the facilities are in great condition: Good water pressure, comfortable bed, powerful hair dryer, Internet jack next to the bed... * The hotel is very clean, and the staff were quite accommodating toward our requests for changing floors, restaurant recommendations, and so on. * The windows have great sound-proofing. Cons: * Noise. Other reviewers are right: the noise of trains passing almost right under the hotel is quite noticeable, especially on the lower floors. In fact, with trains coming into and leaving from the station you can physically feel the vibration when down in the lobby. Thankfully it didn't bother us too much as we would return to our room late and very sleepy and shortly before the trains stop running altogether. Also, one of the rooms we stayed in was right next to an elevator shaft, which was very noisy. Again, however, we were mostly too tired to be bothered. * Room size. It initially didn't bother us--we've seen plenty of hotels all over the world with rooms smaller than these. However, as time went on and dirty laundry and shopping bags began to pile up, it started to feel cramped. So I think you need to be better organized if two people are to stay in a classic double room for more than a couple of days. Travel tips: * If you are going to stay for more than a couple of days in Paris, try to get the Carte Orange metro pass. It's the best and most convenient option for the Paris metro. Bring a passport-sized photo with you--you'll need it on the Carte. The weekly carte is valid from Monday to Sunday, so it'd make sense to get it on or shortly after Monday. Also, there are different zones with different coverages and prices; if you are going to Versaille, for example, you should consider a zone covering Versaille. * You don't need to bring your power adapter: the hotel has plenty to loan out. As mentioned above, the hair dryer is also fairly powerful, so you don't really need to bring your own, either. * Taking public transportation between Charles de Gaulle airport and the hotel is not really a viable option, especially with suitcases--you'd have to make a couple of transfers between trains, and dragging your luggage through the crowded underground labryinth is no fun. * Try to get a musem pass--it saves money AND time as there's usually a shorter queue for pass holders at museums. Why I scored the hotel the way I did: * When in Paris, the most beautiful and happening city in the world, one does not want to stay in the hotel a lot. One just needs a place to clean oneself, rest, and store things. To me, K+K Hotel Cayre serves this purpose reasonably well--it's a hotel of basic comfort. * However, this is not a resort hotel of beauty, culture, inspiration, or luxury. The hotel stay itself won't bring you lots of fond memories, and I wouldn't really describe it as \"lovely\". The hotel is just a building with no real garden, the rooms are pretty small, the amenities are thoughtfully provided but fairly common, and there are noise issues with the train and the elevator. In the end, its great location pushed my score into \"above average\".", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel is Absolutely Fabulous!\u201d", "Author": "M Hagan", "ReviewID": "UR5936154", "Content": "My sister and I just returned from a week at the K+K in Paris and could not have been any happier.

St. Germain des Pres is a quiet, upscale residential neighborhood. Take a short walk down Bd. St. Germain toward the Latin Quarter and dine at the Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots, a bit pricey but good food at both and essential for Sartre followers.

I advise you get the open top bus which stops nearby and allows you to see so much of paris in a short time! and use the METRO it is fun safe and quick! Breakfasts were also very good and bar drinks were well priced too! P.S there is a very nice sunday street market down the road outside the lutecia hotel and the shell garage next door is a good way to purchase bottledwater and quick snacks", "Date": "July 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hudson, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely a great experience!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5446653", "Content": "We just returned yesterday from an eight day trip to London and Paris to celebrate my wife's (significant number) birthday.

When I say decent, I mean a hotel similar to the Holiday Inn Express or Courtyards by Marriott standards in the US. Specifically, clean, well located, AIR CONDITIONED, and roomy. Online websites found me lower priced hotels, only to later learn there was no air conditioning, or said hotel ratings were such that only a 50% or less rating was given when asked if previous guests would recommend said hotel to their friends and family. This was the third hotel we stayed at during our travels this trip, and by far, the best. Sharing the room was my husband, our 19 yr old son, and myself. It was perfect for a number of reasons: the room was very cleaned and spacious, the air conditioner worked perfectly, the facilities downstairs were all we needed, and there were three computers providing free internet access so we could catch up on our emails. The hotel itself is centrally located within blocks of the Seine River, and there is a metro stop right outside the hotel entrance. Once you have seen the main tourist attractions, the neighborhood is an excellent place to explore and the prices much more reasonable. I was concerned about the metro vibrations that I read about on trip advisor, but did not even notice it. We had a first floor room which was suppose to be the worst. The rooms were easily accessed by both centralized elevators and by stairs. The breakfast was very good, but I would not have paid more than 10 euros each if it had not been included in our rate (there's a great bakery across the street). The staff was very friendly and assisted us in many ways. And finally, it was in a residential area with lots of little shops and restaurants.

The good part was that the room was clean with modern appointments and an ingenious design that made the most of what space there was. It was adequate in size by European city standards at least for one. As other reviewers have noted, the shower is hard to use but this is quite common in Europe; some have no enclosure at all. The room was on the \"courtyard,\" really an airshaft, which meant no noise (it's a very noisy city overall), but it also meant it was impossible to tell the weather in the morning without going down to the lobby. The location is good. There are nice cafes and shops in the immediate vicinity, St. Germain, which seems to be an upscale commercial neighborhood within (long) walking distance of the Latin Quarter, Luxembourg Gardens, the Seine and even the Louvre. The facilities are minimal to nonexistent. The business center is just a couple of internet terminals, which share the lobby with a tiny bar. In Paris you're really not expected to spend much time in the hotel. Some staff are helpful and fluent in English; others are neither. The big issue about this place is the cost: almost $300/nite on web special. Adequate as the place is, coming from the US it's just hard to see this as a good value. Then again TA reviews of so much of the competition are uniformly miserable. One alternative that might be worth exploring next time would be to stay in a more residential area less centrally located, as long as it's near a Metro stop. You can get everywhere you care to go very quickly by Metro, and while not particularly pleasant it's quite safe. The city is awesome. Your main goal is to avoid things frequented by tourists like yourself.

We check in, and he tells us \"you will be staying in room 719, and I think you will enjoy the view\". What an understatement. (see picture). Never get a second chance to make a first impression. We met a family friend in Paris, and they stayed in the K&K as well, did not book with us and recieved an equally impressive view, on the other side of the building (Sacre-Coeur / Raspail side)...room #612 - another incredible view (see pic).

The hotel is almost on top of a subway station which makes it very convienently located hotel. The lobby was excellent and if you have a lower floor room, it is worth taking the stairs every day just to get the view going up and down. Very nice. Some down points: The breakfast cost of 23 Euros per person turned me off even before I saw what would have been offered. That is just WAY to expensive. For that price we could have eaten in a very quaint cafe, visited a museum, and gotten a taxi back. The toilets aren't the best at flushing. Lots of water flows, but not a lot of flushing action means you may have to flush a few extra times to dispose of everything. Check out is at noon and the staff wants you out right at noon. If you have not checked out, they start calling immediately. You have to turn in your key upon leaving and pick it up upon entering. A little inconvenient for those who like to come and go as they please.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4689837", "Content": "We booked this hotel having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, and we weren't disappointed.

For a triple, it was very reasonably priced. One thing that does not come through in most of the other reviews, is that this hotel is not a top tier hotel -- not by any stretch a luxury hotel nor a charming left bank retreat. It is immaculately clean, with serviceable modern bathrooms (but no bathroom fan), but the interior looks more like a Comfort Inn than a Parisian hotel. I don't mean to suggest that it is comparable to a Comfort Inn -- it clearly has a few more amenities, including wonderful bed linens -- but no one should go here expecting the Montalembert.

The location of our hotel was great. We could walk to the Seine within 5-6 minutes or we could hop on the metro which had the entrance right outside of our hotel.

The metros are very easy to use. They must be safe since we were taking them at all hours, and there were many single parisian women using the metro by themselves late at night.

But we most enjoyed using the convenience store at the Shell station next door - you have to look for it, it is underground - just turn right when you exit the hotel. They close at 10:00PM, but they run out of the delicious french bread by 8:00pm, so get there early to pick up meats and french bread at a very reasonable price.

We selected this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were very happy that we decided to stay here. We booked a room on the hotel's website, and got the best deal that I've seen: 180 Euros including breakfast! The breakfast was the best that we had on our European trip. (We had also stayed at hotels in Rome and Florence.) There were fresh grapefruit halves, as well as other fresh fruit every morning. The croissants, breads, cheese, smoked salmon and meats were all very tasty. The service was also very professional and courteous. I did not have any problems requesting soft boiled eggs every morning. I would definitely book a hotel rate that includes breakfast, because the regular charge for breakfast is 22 Euros per person, which is a bit much! We had also written to the hotel management to request a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower prior to our arrival, with the understanding that this was a request only. We were not disappointed when we arrived. We were given a top floor room with a large picture window with a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower, the Hotel des Invalides, and city roof tops. We could also see Sacre Coeur when we looked out the window to our right. The only caveat is that the top floor rooms are not non-smoking. Luckily the weather was not too hot, so we were able to air out the room by leaving the window open. The bellman was also extremely helpful, and delivered an air freshener spray. Did I mention the box of chocolates in the room with a welcome note when we arrived? The location of the hotel is very convenient. We loved being able to walk to the St. Germain des Pres area, but not being right in the middle of the touristy scene. With the metro station right in front of the hotel, and a taxi stand on the Rue du Bac, it was very easy to travel to any location. It was also great to have free internet connection. We did not have a computer with us. We used one of the three free internet stations in the lobby and business center. There was never much of a wait, even though the hotel was full. I only have one small complaint about the hotel. The front desk personnel do not really know the restaurants in the area. I would definitely not rely on them for restaurant recommendations. Do your own research before you go, and have the hotel make dinner reservations for you. For example, we ate at La Petite Chaise on the hotel staff's recommendation. The food was okay, not great. In a city with so many great choices, okay is not acceptable, especially if you only have limited time in Paris. One of the restaurants that we wanted to try on this trip was L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. The front desk was able to make a dinner reservation for us. (The restaurant only accepts lunch reservations, and 6:30 PM dinner reservations.) Then we found out that the restaurant is only a two minute walk from the hotel! Definitely go to this restaurant. It is every bit as wonderful as the New York Times review claims. The small tasting plates are more interesting than the regular sized entrees. There is also a 98 Euro tasting menu, but you have to ask for it. Another restaurant we tried is a bistrot on l'Ile-St.-Louis called Mon Vieil Ami. The decor is modern, chic. The food is really delicious. The lunch only plat du jour are usually the best deals. The restaurant has a prix fixe menu of 39 Euros at lunch time.

I selected this hotel based on the numerous favorable reviews and the location. We were not disappointed. We arrived in the immaculate, modern lobby around 10:00 am, but were able to check right in. Matthieu was manning the front desk and was efficient and polite. Our request for a non-smoking room was honored and we were led to room 208, which was an interior view of a small garden courtyard. I was a little concerned about being right next to the service elevator but we never heard a peep from it. Like most rooms in Paris, this too was small, but quite adequate. We had a full closet with plenty of hangers, a small set of drawers in the closet with a small room safe on top of the drawers. The TV was on a stand that doubled as the mini-bar (a dorm style fridge) and a drawer containing a coffee maker and a supply of teas and coffees. The decor was sparse (one small, unique picture). The bed was a double and low to the ground, but comfortable. The overall feel was sort of a danish modern meets Asian style. The bathroom was very modern, with Grohe fixtures. GREAT shower water pressure! The half-door on the tub/shower was a little tricky to keep from splashing water out on the floor, but otherwise it was great. Speaking of the floors, yes, they are heated and look/feel like marble. A nice treat for the feet, to be sure! Ok, as for the noise level we only had two issues. An adjacent building was doing some remodeling and jack-hammer work and you could hear it anywhere in the building, but it was only during the day and didn't start until around 9:00 am, so as long as you weren't trying to sleep during the day, it was no problem. As for the sounds of the metro running underground, we were on the 2nd floor (by American standards, the 3rd floor -- the ground floor is considered floor zero) and you could notice the sound on a regular basis, but it was a low steady rumble, and not bad at all. We sleep with ear plugs when we stay in hotels anyway, and were not bothered by the Metro at all. It's worth it just to have the metro so convenient and close by! Right out the front door! The Post Office is directly across the street as are several bank ATM's. A short walk gets you to a fine selection of cafe's and restaurants, including the oft recommended La Petite Chaise. We celebrated my wife's birthday there, and were very please with the meal and the service. The waiters were attentive, polite, understood our english and halting attempts at French, and never acted condscending. We passed on the breakfast buffet, as it was not included in our room package and they were charging 22 euros per person. We opted for the Cafe St. Germain a few doors down. Yes, the Shell station next door is a great convenience for snacks and drinks. You can buy everything from wine/beer/liquor to TicTacs to Cheese there. Also close by is a great bakery, and the GO20 Supermarche (sort of like a small grocery store) just around the corner has a great selection of VERY reasonably priced wines. We also enjoyed a bike tour to Versailles on Fat Tire Bike tours -- an American owned/operated tour company that also does night tours.

LOved the \"petite chaise\" resatuarant around corner, and the food store at the \"bon Marche\" ( Gucci and unplucked chickens what a trip!!!) and great for gifts. I WOULD recommend this hotel, but only off-season at the reduced rate....and ONLY if you insist on a higher floor. Don't worry about bringing extra euros for French fashion purchases...with the Globalization of fashion ( Gap there...zara Here) there really isn't anything a fashion-savy shopper couldn't get here cheaper and nicer. Boutiques are VERY intimidating ( make shopping on 57th street feel like Target) with a VERY limited selection a \"frowning on browers policy\". save your money for food and wine (which is cheaper than diet coke!!!)
