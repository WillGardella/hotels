No fridge in the room which was one downside as there were some nights I wanted to sit in with some cheese and wine. The location is great for those who want to experience the real Paris without as many tourists of Gypsies. Just walk across the road to the Rue Mouffetard and you can buy the best food and wine up this cliche Parisien street. There is a Bistro in front of the fountain about 2 min walk from the hotel (Cave le Bourgone), it is one of the best. Nice staff, amazing food and not too expensive. Mostly locals in the cafe too. There are a few Laundromats nearby also, Only cost me 6 euro to do about 8 days worth of clothes. There is a Velib station out front too, which I highly reccomend. You can use the bike hire service if you swipe your credit card. It's 150 Euro deposit, 8 euro for 7 nights. You get the bike for free if you use it under 30 minutes and it's 1 euro for every half hour after that. I use to just pack up Croissants and ride down to Notre Dame and walk from there each day. I make it down there in about 10 minutes. Check out their website for more information. I had no issues and would definately come back to the hotel, I booked through their website, no dramas.

It was worth it. the new room had been renovated and was not much larger, but more comfortable. The hotel offers breakfast every morning for 15 Euros, but ours was included in the price of our package booked through europeandestinations.com. The breakfast was awesome - eggs (hard boiled), fresh baguettes, Nutella, meats, cheese, good coffee in large cups. We were usually the last ones to arrive and there was always plenty of food. Super comfy beds and pillows and I'm very fussy about such things. As a bonus, just at the end of the street is the foot of the rue Mouffetard, a terrific street for shopping, dining, sitting at a cafe, and meandering. There is a post office just off rue Mouffetard where I bought a cellphone SIM card for 5 Euros. TIPS: - On the map it looks as if Metro Port Royal would be a good option to reach the hote but it was kind of far. The closer - and more charming walk - was to Censier Dauberton on the #7 line. - Buses: This was the first time in my several trips to Paris that I rode the bus a bit. The #27 bus on the rue Claude Bernard (just at the corner) takes you straight to Luxembourg Gardens, or pass there and head straight to the Pont Neuf. - Wander over to the Jardins des Plantes (15 minute walk-ish) and check out the zoo. Who knew? - The bathroom code for the McDonald's restaurant outside one of the gates at the Jardins is 135. I wasn't able to figure out how the toilettes in le jardin worked. - start the day late. nothing really opens early in Paris so you might as well sleep in. Wandering around Paris requires stamina. - Skip the Louvre. If you must, go on Wed. or Fri. evening when the crowds are smaller. It's truly exhausting to go so pick your artwork in advance. I suggest avoiding the Mona Lisa. You'll see more if you look at the photo online. It is fun to hang out in the courtyard at the Louvre. - Check out the Carnavelet Museum near the Places des Vosges. It's the history of Paris and has wonderful art, 16th century store signs, recreations of the room of Proust's bedroom.

The location was great for accessing good food (Rue Mouffetard) and picnic supplies, the pantheon was only a 15 minute walk as was the Luxembourg Gardens, but other attractions were further away and in hindsight we would have used public transport more because the constant walking was tiring especially when there is so much to see. Across the road is a good pub for having a quiet drink and enjoying a tasty hamburger with frites, the staff there are friendly as well. Access to buses and trains easy, between 3 and 15 minutes walking depending on your chosen destination. We would stay here again, but use the metro and buses to get around, walking to and from attractions made for very long days. We got confused about the breakfast and whether it was included or not, although it is a good and substantial breakfast, at 15 euros per person it is a little expensive and the coffee is not so good.

It provided an excellent night's sleep, located on a very quiet street, and not a peep from any neighbouring rooms, all of which were occupied. Rooms are avergae sized for budget hotels in Paris. The shower took a while to heat up but had good pressure. There was no kettle. The location could be better, as it is right on the SW edge of the 5th. It is about a 15min walk to the river, but there is a Metro stop a few minutes away for further journeys and a few nice cafes etc nearby.

Other friends stayed at the same hotel. Don't think room 205/206 used it's space well. But 312 seemed to work well. Also some rooms had mini fridges some did not. I think most , if not all, of the hotel is non-smoking. No noise complaints. Seemed very quiet. While the area seemed a little further on the edge of St. Germain/the Latin Quarter - it was very close to a quaint street that contained a lot of restaurants and boutiques. Highly recommend the Boulangeries nearby. Easy 5 minute walk to the metro. AC worked very well. Tubs had an unusually high side to step over to get in.

There is an alright bar across the street from the hotel, it's useful for a late drink before bed. Overall, the Rive Gauche is perfectly located and adequately equipped to ensure a great short break in Paris. If you were going to be there for a longer trip maybe a slightly more spacious hotel with a bar and restaurant might be a better option.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ufa", "Title": "\u201cBest choice for its price\u201d", "Author": "dwango", "ReviewID": "UR7842023", "Content": "Excellent location - quiet but close to many interesting places.

It was just a bathtube with no glass or shower garden. Breakfast was a bit complex because they had 6 tables for the all the guest. So we had to wait awhile before we could have breakfast. It was also possible to have breakfast in the room. The guy at the reception said that they planned to have a separate room where they could serve breakfast, because the 6 tables where posted at the reception area.
