Much of our experience was truly wonderful. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We like hotels that have good common areas and this one's was nice--we spent a bit of time in the lounge, although if the music had been more consistent, it would have been far more inviting. A jazzy standard would be followed by something loud and raucous---odd. The bedrooms are comfortable and clean and well-furnished and fitted out; I don't think it's possible to find a room in France that doesn't have gorgeous curtains! What I didn't like: They have scented candles that overpower the common areas and manage to seep into the rooms. The first night, I really thought we were going to have to leave, because my husband is usually sensitive to perfumes. Fortunately, he didn't seem to notice, but honestly, that permeating scent would make me think twice before going back. The rooms either look out over the interior of the building (looking down on a glass roof) or Rue Duphot. We had two rooms, as our daughter was with us, so got to see both types. Rue Duphot, though a bit noisy in the mornings, was preferable, I thought, because the interior-facing rooms also face other rooms, so you pretty much have to keep your drapes closed. We ate in the restaurant our first night there, and the food and service were very good. The appetizers were surprisingly large, and could have made a meal. It was hard to finish everything.

We were a little worried as we had previously stayed at another hotel in Paris repeatedly for Christmas and always loved it but it had simply become too expensive but as a result this place had a lot to live up to. First impressions were excellent. Helpful staff and nice lobby. The room I was in was beautifully decorated and comfortable and although the bathroom was a little small, it had all you need. My only complaint about the room was that the separate room for the toilet was so small the door hits you in the back when you walk in if you aren't careful. The spa was lovely as was the food and the service was friendly and helpful. In fact the were only two issues; first was that you have to spell out exactly what you want from room service including asking for butter to go with bread and sauces (mayo, ketchup, mustard) with burger, fries or sandwiches but really it wasn't the end of the world. The second issue was rather larger. On the last day my sister was dressed extremely casually for travelling and when struggling to get through the front door of the hotel rang the bell for help. She was let in and beaconed over to the desk where they gave her a mop and duster assuming she was a cleaner! She was mortified and they apologised but after 4 days they should have recognised her in such a small hotel or at least not have jumped to conclusions. Very embarrassing!! We all laughed about it but it was kind of awkward.

This review is therefore useful for anyone who is thinking of booking something a bit special for a treat. It is worth noting that I have stayed in various hotels in Paris as it is my favourite city so visit almost once a year so can compare this to less expensive hotels. We looked at various 5 star hotels and this seemed to be the best value for the size of room on offer. We also prefer smaller hotels so this was ideal with just 59 rooms. We stayed in the classic room for 4 nights and it was perfectly comfortable and luxurious. Paris hotel rooms are small and this was definitely the largest room I have stayed in (with the added extra of a bath not just a shower) so you certainly do get what you pay for! The facilities in the hotel were great as the pool and spa offered a chance to relax at the end of the day. Having stayed in smaller, less luxurious for 2/3 nights I have to say that this place was ideal for a longer stay of 4 nights as it was a great place to unwind in at the end of a hectic day. The staff in all parts of the hotel were very polite and professional. We also ate in the restaurant on the first evening of out stay and the food and service were excellent. As it is 5 star (and Paris), all the added extras are expensive: breakfast, bar, minibar etc but you dont have to use these. The location of the hotel was great. I prefer Paris on foot but it was also handy for the Metro being just a few minutes walk from the Madeleine and Concorde stops. The only minor issue for us was that the windows could have blocked out a bit more noise from the street so unless you were in a deep sleep you could easily be disturbed by the dustbin wagon in the morning.

My mother and I shared the king-size bed and it was really like having your own bed. The toiletries were great, the lighting was good and the little nightly chocolates were a decadent treat.

From the minute we arrived at the Burgundy, it became obvious why this hotel is a rising star in the Paris Hotel scene. We were travelling to France for a work conference with another couple - they are well-seasoned 5-star world travellers, and they were also truly delighted with this hotel! It was our first trip overseas without the kids so we decided to splash out and book a junior suite. The usual rack rate is a pricey 1200Euro per night, however, everything in Paris commands a premium price and I think this hotel certainly delivers a quality service that you would pay more for elsewhere. The hotel is newly refurbished and the decor is luxurious and elegant, yet extremely comfortable. The staff are extremely attentive and very welcoming, and clearly take pride in their hotel and want to ensure you have a faultless stay. Our suite had a small entry area with large built-in robe space, minibar & safe, and a separate WC; small sitting area with two comfy chairs & reading lamps, desk & large flatscreen TV; a bedroom with king size bed, flatscreen TV, iphone docking stations; separate bathroom with large comfy bath, separate shower and a toilet. The small touches were lovely - petit-fours on arrival, plush velour slippers, daily complementary bottled water, lit makeup mirror, dimming light switches, aromatherapy toiletries, plush window furnishings with sheer or blockout options, daily weather forecast card in the turndown service. The bed was super comfy (I am a huge fan of the Westin Hotel trademark Heavenly beds, but this topped that!!) - I don't think I have ever slept better in a hotel bed, and I have tried many! The rooms are extremely private and quiet, with complementary and efficient wi-fi service for multiple devices. My only disappointment was that there were no tea & coffee making facilities in the room (which I did expect to find in a suite), however, on talking to colleagues staying in other hotels in Paris & France this appears to be a common finding, and there always seems to be an open cafe on every corner - even the small train station kiosks in Paris make a good coffee! I always look at the hotel floorplan on the fire escape instructions to compare room size, and it appears that the suites are probably only slightly larger than the deluxe rooms, however they do have a small separate sitting area and additional toilet/powder room. For future stays, I would happily consider staying in a room as a less expensive option as I believe their level & style of furnishing is similar, and the extra space in your hotel room is not crucial when you spend all your time exploring this wonderful city! The location of this hotel is fabulous. It sits on a pretty and quiet street between two major boutique shopping strips (rue St Honore & Madeleine) in a lovely upmarket part of Paris. It is a short walk from two underground train station lines (Concorde & Madeleine), and reasonable walking distance (with comfy shoes) to several major tourist sites such as the Louvre, Arc de triomphe & Champs Elysee. We easily walked in our dress shoes for a lunch at the Ritz Hotel. The train provides easy access to the places which are too far to walk to: Eiffel Tower took 5 minutes by train, and the Chateau Versailles (which sits on the outskirts of Paris) was a pleasant 45 minute journey. Although we didn't manage it in our short stay, I noted that it would have been walking distance to the Musee D'Orsay & Opera, and easy train to the Latin Quarter & Notre Dame. We dined in their restaurant Le Baudelaire - definitely worthy of its recently acquired Michelin 1-star rating - lovely food, great dining experience, reasonably priced and excellent service. Unfortunately we never managed to try their pool or day spa due to lack of time, but I hear they too are excellent. In summary, we were absolutely delighted and suitably impressed by this boutique hotel. We are already planning a return visit to Paris and will definitely be staying at the Burgundy again!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cElegant, personal hotel with wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "SunburyTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR118085586", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in a Classic room (304) for three nights.

We wanted a 5 star luxury hotel in a central Paris location without the 5 star price of the Four Seasons, Park Hyatt or Ritz. This newly renovated, small property on a quiet street between Saint Honore and Madeline was a perfect fit for our needs. If you are a looking for a see and be seen place or a large lobby environment to watch people come and go, this isn't the place for you (although the bartender named off several A list stars who recently stayed here to avoid the public scene). However, if you like the idea of new, large rooms tastefully decorated in a classic modern style with quiet but attentive service, then definitely take a serious look. The hotel upgraded us to a deluxe room from a classic room at no charge, which overlooked one of the interior gardens. There were a total of maybe 8 or 10 rooms on our floor, and the hotel is only 6 floors, so expect a great night sleep without much disturbance. A couple of things we liked about the room was the little book nook where we could place our own books, magazines and tourist maps. I know it seems small, but it was very useful. The wardrobe was also large and had plenty of room for all of our clothes and shoes, and we brought a lot for a week. The free bottles of Evian water (replenshed throughout the day) was also a nice touch. The air condition system also worked very well and kept the room to our perfect temperature without any noise. The concierge team was EXCELLENT; one of the best I have ever worked with. They were timely with our many advance emails regarding restaurant reservations and kept up with the reservations throughout our stay and even ordered taxis for us so that we were ready to go at the designated times each evening. Most of the restaurants we picked ourselves using Zagat and TripAdvisor together, so I cannot comment so much on this aspect of their work (my reviews are in Trip Advisor). Finally, and nothing to do with the hotel itself, there is a gourmet grocery with single serve meals, drinks, sundries, and wine! right around the corner on boulevard Madeleine which was a great amenity and was better than any hotel shop could ever be (its called Monop). The hotel's restaurant was reliable for breakfast and overlooked a quiet courtyard; we had the continental breakfast built into our room rate and paid 8 euros more for the small but good quality buffet (the buffet otherwise would be 38 euros a person, which is not worth it). I will try to review the hotel's 1 star restaurant for dinner separately on Trip Advisor (La Baudelaire), which at the time of this review wasn't rated yet. I read a negative comment about the lobby fragrance being overpowering; true, but they burn one of their signature candles throughout the day. I think the idea is good, but agree that if one is sensitive to such smells, you might not like it and I would recommend a redo on the candle scent to something less overpowering. The only real negative/complaint is their bar off the lobby which they have fashioned as the only hotel lobby cognac bar in the City. Nothing about this bar works for this hotel. The design is way too dark and impersonal -- during the day, I don't see myself reading a book and enjoying a glass of wine as one could at the Four Seasons or Hotel de Crillon bars. The bar isn't even a bar that you can sit at. And, at 900 and 1200 euros a glass! for many of the cognacs they display, I am not sure I understand the connection to their guests, most of whom I suspect do not even drink cognac, much less at that price. But, having said that, my wife and I did enjoy a late night cocktail in front of the fireplace (we were the only ones in there), so it at least serves a purpose. One block away is the Hemmingway Bar at the Ritz (use the back entrance) which I would recommend highly over this one. Bottom line: We would definitely stay at Le Burgundy Hotel on our next trip.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cExceptional service and a great nights sleep\u201d", "Author": "DrLawBath", "ReviewID": "UR117808783", "Content": "Lovely hotel.

I had originally been quoted a family rate for 2 rooms, he persisted in arguing with me with a smile on his face. This was not settled until the reservation manager promptly appeared ( I requested his involvement) and honored my quote. This could have been avoided. Thankyou Slyvain Obviously we were paying a hefty amount and I did not want to have to pay one more Euro. We paid over a thousand US dollars a night for the 2 rooms. We were taken to the 2 rooms. There was an over whelming smell in the first room (410) obviously coming through the air conditioning, my daughters stayed in room 409 it seemed to be fine however occasionally they said they smelt that smell again. I refused the second room (410) and after 20 mins we were taken to another room (401), which was great! Now we are home, I am washing my daughters clothes the clothes smell of the candles burning in the hotel foyer even though there was no candles on our floor or in the rooms. So I have to question why there are so many candles burning in the foyer? For our inconvenience of changing rooms we were sent a beautiful plate of fruits and 2 glasses of champagne. This was much appreciated. Concierge was excellant with organizing a rental car and also restaurant help. I do agree that the Parisian way is well and truly present in this hotel, staff smiling however not friendly. There was no warmth, no one seemed happy. We did have a wonderful 4 days in Paris and were very comfortable in this hotel, however i do have my reservations about some of the details of this hotel. The swimming pool is in the basement as part of the spa and was not one where you would choose to relax in after a day of sight seeing, the basement was lit by mood lighting, rather odd actually. The location is excellent and is easy walking distance to most of the wonderful historic sights with the metro station very close. The surrounding restaurants were very expensive for a family of 4 so we really headed to other areas to eat. I did so much research and honestly I think this is truly a difficult city to find that good all round hotel for a reasonable price and I am talking approx $500-$600 a night in the summer. If you find one please let me know. We had come from London, Knightsbridge The Berkeley costing under $1000 for 2 amazing rooms with full breakfast included.

Our three children ranging in age from 9 to 13 stayed in a nearby junior suite with two double beds and a cot (or perhaps they were in one grade higher - I can't remember). Le Burgundy is a beautiful gem of a boutique hotel set in a fabulous location just off Rue St.-Honor\u00e9, and its elegant continuation, the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honor\u00e9, two blocks away from Place de La Concorde, and also within walking distance of the Tuileries Gardens, the Louvre, and the lower end of the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Left Bank. While I \"hear\" the comments of a few other reviewers about its prices, we felt that, for our junior suites, it offered a very good value for its price, given its staff's dedication to customer satisfaction, its ambience, junior suite room sizes, location, and its beautiful, relaxing pool (with water jets and a mini-waterfall spout!) near its spa - our kids couldn't WAIT to go to the pool at the end of each day!! Le Burgundy has all the benefits of a large \"name\" hotel such as the Ritz, Le Crillon, or the George V. coupled with the friendliness and concern of a boutique. Its ever-helpful, gracious, and unpretentious staff constantly impressed us with their dedication to our daily satisfaction - they were wonderfully attentive folks who spared no effort to ensure that our children would enjoy their first trip to Paris immensely. It was also quite nice that every employee, from top to bottom, knew our names from the instant that we arrived; they were always one step ahead of us, whether it was reminding us to take some of the hotel's umbrellas to checking with us about our dinner reservations for that night. From their responding promptly and courteously to our multiple itinerary-related email inquiries before we had even arrived to their providing us with numerous restaurant recommendations and arranging a wonderful guided private tour of Versailles, nothing, and I mean nothing, was ever too much trouble for their concierges, Sebastien and Francois. One would be unlikely to get that kind of continuous, courteous personal attention from the concierges at the other hotels I've mentioned above. As I wrote above, it is ideally located - we were able to walk to most nearby attractions such as the Louvre, Notre Dame, Musee d'Orssay, the Pompidou Centre, Petit Palace, l'Arc de Triomphe, and shopping along the St.-Honor\u00e9/Rue du Faubourg St.-Honor\u00e9 (but we are \"walkers\" - others might feel Notre Dame and the Pompidou are a little too far away to walk). Our rooms and the public areas, too, are tastefully decorated in an attractive and bright Euro/Art Deco-type manner which appealed to my wife for their design excellence and comfort. The rooms and their furnishings were modern, very clean. and well-air-conditioned. The bath and shower were very nice sizes and our beds were also very comfortable, which is especially important to us since I'm 6 feet 1 inch tall and my wife has back problems. We do agree with another reviewer's criticism of the hair dryer outlet's unusually inconvenient location (in one of the hall closets in our room) but .... Paris city electrical code is the code - I guess they don't want people electrocuting themselves in the WC. Speaking of our hall closets - while there are no chest of drawers for our clothes in the junior suites (which was a little surprising), there was sufficient space to stack all of our informal clothes on the shelves above my dress shirts, sports jackets, and my wife's dresses that we hung in our hall closets (plus there were several small pull-out drawers in that same closet area for my socks and our other accessories). Given that we stayed for 8 nights, there was obviously sufficient storage space in those areas. We respectfully disagree, however, with another reviewer's criticism about the hotel's fragrance - while ever-present in all public areas of each floor above reception, it is not present in the private guest rooms nor is it cloying or unpleasant - in fact, we liked it so much that we thought about buying one of the hotel's candles that have the same scent to bring it home as a pleasant reminder of our Paris vacation. I can't even imagine that this hotel would ever be anything less than 100% focused on ensuring that each guest has an ideal stay. We, too, highly recommend it for anyone traveling to Paris. Although my wife and I have been to the \"City of Light\" many times before, we would now never stay anywhere else and look forward to \"coming home\" to le Burgundy on our next trip!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "CAWItravellers", "ReviewID": "UR115003285", "Content": "My Fiance and I stay in many different hotels from small eclectic ones to five star chain and boutique hotels.

Our room inside was very well decorated, modern style and very clean. I asked for a room where my girlfriend could smoke and they offered us a room with a great terrace. The service overall was perfect, from the doormen who remembered our name to the concierge who suggested some great restaurants and bars and made all the necessary reservations. All the members of the staff were at least friendly and eager to please. I didn't use the pool and the spa although they looked great. The only complaint I have is that our TV had a problem on the second day and was not fixed and that the cleaning lady did not clean the ashtrays.

We received a warm welcome on arrival and were shown the hotel's facilities before being escorted to our room - a classic room on the first floor (room 107) which was a beautiful, well appointed room with the bonus of a private outdoor terrace which was a lovely serene area to relax in after a hard day sightseeing. The bathroom had a large shower rather than a bath which was fine for a short stay. The room was immaculate - in fact when we returned after going out for breakfast we found one of the desk staff escorting a painter making good a small mark on the inner door. Nice to see this level of attention to detail. The staff were all very charming and attentive whether on the door, front desk, in the bar or restaurant and nothing seemed too much trouble. The hotel is very well located - close to the Madeleine metro station and l'open bus tour stop (less than 5 mins walk), It is also close to many local cafes and restaurants and plenty of shops including the really high end designer shops. We ate breakfast out of the hotel as I preferred to eat at one of the nearby pavement cafes and watch the world go by. We did eat in the hotel restaurant one evening, it has been awarded its first michelin star - well deserved the food was excellent and my pea soup truly memorable. We also ate at a nearby Flottes - in the first floor restaurant not the ground floor brasserie - not as good as the hotel but lovely none the less and worth a visit.

Le Burgundy was chosen largely based on TA recommendations. The hotel is lovely. We were personally escorted to our Deluxe Room. A large room by european standards with all expected 5 star amenities. In addition to the expected, I appreciated the breath mints and the daily complimentary bottle of water. The toilet is completely seperate from the bath (which I love). Also a seperate shower and tub. PS-there is only one outlet in this room suitable for an electric razor. Bed was as comfortable as our own. Larger than usual TV is a plus. We had a lovely dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant. Food was first class, delicious with excellent presentation. Location proved to be exactly what we wanted, convenient and close to everything including the underground trains and tour bus stop. Downside is the staff member that escorted us to the room explained that the outlet for the blow dryer was located in the CLOSET! Fortunetly, it had a long enough cord, so I unplugged the floor lamp and used the blow dryer in the toilet room. This worked out fine--my husband had the total bathroom to himself while I dried my hair! . Also the view in the Deluxe Room was terrible (maybe the necessary sacrifice for the perfect quiet). We were out of our room before 9am, returning just after 3pm, but our room wasn't clean. We spent ~45 minutes in the bar waiting for housekeeping to finish. Not a big deal, but noteworthy. Lastly, the WiFi signal was too weak to maintain an internet connection (also not a big deal for a romantic get-a-way, but important for business).
