There were about 130 participants at the meeting including clients. We knew going into the weekend that the hotel was sold out the night before the meeting began but at the last minute the hotel determined they did have some rooms for the few of us and the clients who were checking in early. Here is where the tale of two towers begins..... The hotel has 2 \"towers\" as they call it and the majority of the group was checked into the Bay Tower. I got a room in the Marina tower along with 2 others. Usually when a hotel has 2 towers you assume they are in the same building just using separate elevator banks and at opposite ends. However, these are really two completely separate hotel buildings separated by a 5-8 minute walk outside. (Two of my posted pictures show a view from my room and the lounge and the view from my Marina Tower room looking at the Bay Building so you can see the distance.) Note that the hotel does provide free shuttle service. You can see the map of the buildings and layout on the SPG page for the hotel under \"Meetings & Events\" and then \"View Floor Plans & Capacity Charts.\" I asked the front desk staff who checked me in what the difference was between the two towers and she said \"Well the rooms in the Bay tower are generally 30% larger.\" That may be true but some extra space is all you will get and it's not worth the trade off. Because I was a Platinum member after asking \"Well check me into a room YOU would prefer...\" I was given a room in the Marina Tower. As we met for dinner that first night naturally everyone asked how comfortable the rooms were and for the three of us in the main Marina tower (the main hotel building/entrance) the rooms were clean, renovated, and just fine. (Pictures of my Marina Tower room are posted) However, I heard nothing but bad comments the rest of the weekend from any meeting participant that was over in the Bay Tower. Distance was a problem but they commented how the hotel was old and run down, bathrooms were not as clean as they could be. They really had a completely different hotel experience than anyone who stayed in the Marina Tower. It's also not a quick trip to get between towers should you have a short break in your meeting and want to \"run back to your room.\" When booking rooms on the hotel website you do choose which tower you would like a room in so BEWARE. In my opinion, if you are not staying in the Marina Tower, do not stay here or at least be prepared. The unexpected highlight was the Club Level Lounge (Marina Tower)! I have also posted pictures of the lounge. Many people who go to the lounges can tell you that most of the time, it's just a sleeping room on a standard floor at the end of the hall with some sofas and chairs in it - small, cramped, dark and not relaxing at all. Maybe there are some cold drinks but it's really depressing and pretty useless. However, the lounge here could not be more enjoyable. As I arrived at the hotel at 11am (and room not available) I asked to have access to the lounge as a Platinum member. The lounge is the entire top floor of the hotel. It's almost all windows with 2 TVs, lots of workspace and comfortable chairs and sofas, and times where food is provided. It's bright with lots of light and comfortable. Internet is also free in the lounge. It was really relaxing and what a great place to work especially since I couldn't check in until 3:30pm. I didn't mind working with a great view of the Marina and Bay. In regard to hotel location - It's DIRECTLY across the street from the airport. Yes it's a short commute from the airport but you can't walk to ANYTHING around there. Look this hotel up on the map before you book so you aren't disappointed.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, a bit islolated location\u201d", "Author": "InHouseCounsel", "ReviewID": "UR127142283", "Content": "Overall, I experienced a great stay at this hotel during a recent conference. The staff was helpful, by room was clean and comfortable and the food during conference was great. The only negative was the relatively isolated location. I am a big fan of walking, and you really needed to take a cab to get to town (although it is an easy walk from the airport). The hotel itself is clean and up to date. I was given a small suite with a little balcony where I could see downtown and the water through the trees (I was on a low floor). The bed was the usual very comfortable sheraton bed, and the linens were clean and fresh. Lunch at the hotel restaurant was tasty (I had a nice seafood cobb salad), but everything on the menu is $15-$20 for lunch before drinks, tax and tip. There are no other options to dine nearby, other than walking to the airport for fast food. The other hotel facilities were good. The gym contains several bikes, treadmills and ellipticals, as well as weight machines. The pool looked great. Lots of places to sit. There is a very nice club level lounges, with a great view. The lounge included cold breakfast choices each morning (cereal, oatmeal, pastries, fruit and cold cuts). Unlike some other Sheratons I visit, there were no hot choices. There is a free shuttle from the airport, and it is only about a 10 minute walk, so I did not experience parking. It looked like overnight parking was around $20. The property itself consists of several buildings, so the experience might depend on which building you end up in. The main tower houses the restaurant, bar, lounge and a much nicer gym than the other tower. The other tower is not right next door- it is a bit if a hike. There are also some annex buildings where the rooms have exterior corridors and doors. The overall value varied. My conference rate was over twice the auto club rate I paid the final night., so check around for deals.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smyrna, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic property, bad service\u201d", "Author": "manu4t", "ReviewID": "UR127104762", "Content": "First of all, the property is absolutely fantastic. The hotel sits over the Marina, is right near the airport, and is convenient to La Jolla, the bay, and Coronado. The lobby is impressive and the fitness center is great. You can walk to the waterfront in 3 min, and the bar in the hotel is great. The rooms are good, not great, and it is an older Sheraton which has been rebadged. But, you dont lack for anything in the rooms and the balconies looking over the marina are a nice touch. San Diego is a fantastic city and is so underrated as a travel destination. Thus said, the service was extremely dissapointing. The front desk help did not speak great English. The \"green\" program they shove off on you is an excuse to not clean the rooms, etc. and not pay the staff to be there - otherwise they wouldnt hand out towels by the boatloads in the gym and heat the pool year round (much worse for the environment than cleaning the rooms!). We finally asked the front desk to have our room cleaned and.....nothing for 2 days. 4 days total. Not acceptable at all. We also made dinner reservations through the front desk and......that's right, the reservations were not made. It was almost a disaster for some clients we hosted. I would still stay here again but it is definitely not for the service, that will disappoint anyone who thinks paying 279 a night for a hotel will get them good service.

As of April 1, 2011, all Sheratons must have a club lounge that is open on the weekends. They also have a computer/WiFi area in the lobbies known as \u201cLink@Sheraton.\u201d Hotel bathrooms are stocked with \u201cShine\u201d products. SHERATON\u2013SAN DIEGO MARINA This Sheraton opened approximately 40 years ago, and this was my first stay. It is located next to the airport, and it was renovated approximately 6 years ago. The hotel consists of two buildings: the main hotel with a conference center and the Bay Tower, which is 7\u201310 minute walk away. Both buildings have a \u201cLink,\u201d a fitness center, pool access, and restaurants. However, the main building has more and bigger of everything; and the only restaurant in the Bay Tower has limited hours and closed for lunch. The only Sheraton Club Lounge is on the 12th Floor of the Main Building. THE ROOM The rooms and hallways reflect its location on the Marina with lots of blue, pictures of boating, and nautical flags. The standard/deluxe room has a 37\u201d LG LCD flat-screen TV, a coffee maker (Starbucks coffee), bar fridge with sensors (i.e., it\u2019ll charge you if you pick it up), and an iron/ironing board. Most rooms have a balcony/patio, but you may want to ask to make sure. Most rooms also seem to have nice views as it\u2019s on a narrow island and no other tall buildings are close by; views may be of the bay, marina, downtown, or airport. SPG Platinum Members receive free Internet in the room. Otherwise, Internet in your room will cost $15\u201319 for 24-hours. They have a \u201cLink\u201d on the first floor of both buildings, which offers free Internet for all. GYM AND POOL Both buildings have a gym and pool. However, the main building has more pools and is close to many activities that would be fun for children (e.g., an area with Ping Pong tables, and a massive Pirate Ship). The gym is also larger in the main building. SPG SPECIFIC Only the main building has a Club Lounge, which is open all day. The Lounge overlooks the Marina and is very nice and comfortable. There is a computer, a flat screen TV, and a fireplace. The Lounge fridge is stocked with bottled water throughout the day, but no soft drinks or coffee like at other Sheratons. The Lounge has breakfast (Monday\u2013Friday = 6:30\u20139:30AM; Saturday & Sunday = 6:30\u201310:30AM) and evening appetizers (Daily = 5:00\u20138:00PM) with a cash bar (average price for drink = $9.00). I am not sure what the Platinum Amenities are as I wasn\u2019t offered any (I assume I\u2019ll get 500 Starpoints). MY RATING This is a really nice Sheraton. The rooms are comfortable, and the views are amazing. Although it is showing some wear and tear (e.g., the lamp shade in the room was beat up and the carpet by the balcony got wet due to a rainstorm because of bad weatherproofing), it\u2019s still in very good condition. My main reason for giving this hotel 4 vs. 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of the Club Lounge. There should be a mini version of it in the Bay Tower just like there are \u201cmini duplicates\u201d of everything else given the Main Building isn\u2019t convenient to get to. Although you can drive to the Main Building or take a Shuttle, that may not work if you are in a rush and/or just want to get a drink to take to your room. Notwithstanding this limitation, I actually think this is a great Sheraton. There are other nice Starwood Hotels closer to the Convention Center (e.g., The W and The Westin\u2013Gas Lamp District), but unless you need to repeatedly go the Convention Center, then I\u2019d opt for this Sheraton. It\u2019s close enough to the downtown action, but serves as a nice retreat from your busy day. The pools and the views are very relaxing\u2014especially if you are having drinks from your balcony while watching the sunset.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location and great staff!\u201d", "Author": "bklady", "ReviewID": "UR126942521", "Content": "I recently visited for a conference and was enchanted by the beautiful city of San Diego.

The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy.

I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work. After fiddling with it for 5 minutes or so, I asked for a new locker and explained the lock was malfunctioning. The staff person said, \"yes, a work order has been called in...\" I explained she should not have given me that locker then. She didn't seem to care. I was the only person in the spa. So, I have stayed at the Loew's Coronado for the same price and had much better service and rooms. I chose to stay here for a more convenient location. Not worth saving the 10-12 minute drive.

Our children looked forward to their talks with Doug at breakfast. The first day he asked us how smart are kids were and of course like every parent we say they are brilliant. Doug then presented them with a riddle and they answered correctly. He was happy about that. Our kids wrote him a note when we left with a picture of his favorite animal in the zoo an okapi.

The Marina Tower being the \"main\" tower with restaurants, pools, gym, tennis courts, Starbucks and club lounge. The Bay Tower is about a 5 minute walk along the marina and while not a huge deal it would be a little inconvenient if you were wanting to be close to the action of the hotel. The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet. Equally enjoying is the club lounge on the top floors which is a wonderful place to relax and watch the sunrise over breakfast or the sunset over appetizers and drinks. The front desk agents we encountered were very friendly and helpful, even when we asked to check in at 9am.

Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great.

The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment. There are decent pools, but I didn't get to use them. All in all, I would stay again, as long as I am not counting to eat at their restaurants.

We did not hear the airport noise unless we opened our balcony and we faced the airport. The service couldn't have been better. The valet was quick and friendly, the concierge and check-in staff were also super helpful and friendly. We loved that there was a full Starbuck's on site. We went to starbuck's every morning and got coffee and they have these awesome breakfast sandwiches (bacon, egg and cheese, etc). Nice to get a quick cheap meal before heading out for the day. I go running almost every day while I am there. I love running by the water and seeing the beauty of Harbor island. Great area to run! Did not use the fitness center on this trip, but have used it in the past and found it to be quite nice. One pool is heated and even though it was December, we saw people swimming in it. Very nice pool! The room was great! A perfect size for my husband and I, plus our 2 year old and his pack-n-play. Bathroom was nothing special....Not too fond of the stark white tile, but it wasn't horrible. Amenities were nothing luxurious either. Bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. Overall, the room was probably 3-4 star (mostly because of bathroom), but I felt the Hotel and location and views made this more of a true 4 to 4.5 star property.

However, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay at this hotel. I never had an unplesant experience at a hotel ever. It all started the day after I checked in. That morning I had NO hot water. None whatsoever, not even warm or room temperature water, just COLD water. I took a nice cold shower! Then I went to the front desk and I got moved to a new room on the 6th floor. I was staying in the Bay tower. Then the water in the new room was not working either.I was then moved AGAIN to a new room, finally to room 697. Finally I got working hot water. The mechanic said the entire wing of rooms on the 6th floor lost hot water due to the line going into most of the rooms. The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some \"super duper\" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C.

The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you. Even though room service is expensive, they have alternate options for dining close by. There are some restaurants on harbor island that are withing half mile to a mile away.

The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kerrville, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay for MCRD graduation\u201d", "Author": "kimmykiddo", "ReviewID": "UR120621561", "Content": "My son graduated from the Marine Corps on Novemeber the 4th.

It is a large, sprawling hotel (> 1,000 rooms) with a couple of towers and a sprawling \u2018resort\u2019 wing called Lanai . There is also a second tower (350 rooms) which is about a 10 minute walk along the marina from the main hotel. We were put in the \u2018Lanai\u2019, a wing that if you squint your eyes a little you would think is a Mexican Resort Hotel complete with aqua painted pools, palm trees and outdoor type \u2018hall ways\u2019. The main difference from Mexican resorts are the hot tubs associated with each pool and reliable hot water in the rooms. Our room was nice enough, it had been tastefully updated in the last several years so everything, except the bathtub, which hotels seem reluctant to update, was new. The tub was a little worn and corroded around the drain. The marble sink counter was also stained, a problem I have seen in other hotels with marble counter tops. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet except when the folks upstairs were moving around. In the tradition of expense account hotels things like WiFi and internet ($20/day) and parking ($30/day) cost extra not to mention the exorbitant cost of the contents of the mini bar, the restocking fees of the minibar and the fact that you can\u2019t use the minibar fridge for your own stuff. In addition the restaurant/breakfast buffet were expensive for what you got. That said the service was great, check in was fast, there is a shuttle that runs every ten minutes from the airport. If you are just flying in and out to a conference and you are on an expense account it is a great place to be. If you want to see the city, which is definitely worth seeing, then this hotel is definitely a bit out of the way, about a $15- 20 taxi ride. Public transportation in the vicinity of the hotel is negligible. The waterfront tourist attractions are about 3 miles away but there is a nice wide promenade type sidewalk between Harbour Drive, a main thorough fare, and the water if you are up to walking. So it wasn\u2019t a great location for a spouse along for the trip as was our case. The hotel also seems to be a bit of a staging place for folks who are going and coming from cruise ships.

Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 \"experience adjustment\" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example).

You arrive and discover it's a friendly place with great accomodations and you are near the aiport. How convenient. But you are dismayed to learn you are away from the action of lovely San Diego and restricted, for meals, to the hotel's two restaurants -- a pub that is reasonably priced but cacaphonous and crowded and a luxurious but overpriced restaurant. You would like to see the sights of Dan Diego but you dont want to rent a car because your down time is restricted to evenings and periods when you are not in convention sessions. Here's how we dealt with it. 1. We requested the pub menu in the restaurant, so we got less expensive meals in refined surroundings. 2. If you are willing to stroll, you can go to three other resturants at the marina. We recommend the closest one, Island Prime, particularly its less expensive wing, Level C, It has a great view of the skyline and the service is friendly. They have a good wine tasting option and the Mud Pie ice cream is to die for (and big enough for six people). 3. Downtown San Diego is a $15 cab ride away including generous tip. But the best option is the inexpensive one. Take the Sheraton Shuttle to the airport and ask the driver to leave you at the MTS bus stop. The 923 bus goes to downtown San Diego ($2.25 per ride, $1.10 for seniors over 60). Once downtown you are in the Gaslight District and you can connect to other buses, including ones we took to Coronado and Balboa Park. 4. We loved Balboa Park. You can spend a whole day there at the zoo and museums. If you want to stretch your legs there are trails alongside. The whole experience is better than Epcot in our opinion. (For lunch try the Japanese Garden restaurant. Teryaki meat, fish and vegeratian over rice are yummy. $11 each with drinks) 5. The Gaslight District has terrific restaurants.

It is also right on the water, and with a room facing the water, we had a fantastic view of the fireworks that night. It had easy access and was convenient for driving to other areas of San Diego. I especially liked the way the room was set up. The bed FACED the windows instead of being sideways to the windows like in most hotels, so you could sit in bed at night and look at the lights. The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice. If I remember correctly, there was also a sidewalk between the hotel and water that you could walk around the marina on. Depending on when you stay, and if you have AAA or some other discount plan, you can get a reasonable price for this hotel. At other times, the price can be double. We are going on a cruise in December and I was anxious to book this hotel again for our pre-cruise stay. However, there is a convention going on that week and when I first checked it out, the price had skyrocketed. The second time I checked, there were no rooms available. The only reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not within walking distance to restaurants, and the hotel restaurant is pricey, as expected. We did go ahead and eat breakfast at the restaurant which was excellent, but again, it was not a \"breakfast included\" type of hotel and the cost for breakfast was about $15 per person, I think. But as I said, I did love this hotel and would stay there again.

The check-in staff were polite. We were informed on check-in of a $30 a night parking fee (our stay was 4 nights), and when I inquired about how to access in-room internet they told me it was $19 a night for high speed internet. High speed internet was crap, it was less than a quarter of the speed of the internet I got at the Trump in Las Vegas. We were given two vouchers for complimentary breakfast for our stay, for which we were very grateful, though once we were seated in the restaurant and given menus we weren't quite sure what we were allowed to choose from. This was soon cleared up when someone came and took the menus back and said that we could only eat from the buffet. After eating the 'buffet' once, we decided not to use the second voucher. The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print. How does get buggered sound? I'm not going to pay $5 for a small drink and then pay you 20% extra just to restock it. The room itself was reasonable and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit grubby though In all honesty I probably wouldn't have paid attention to this things had the hotel not been charging me extras at every opportunity, I found myself picking on things in the room just because they were being cheap. What sort of hotel doesn't have complementary in room internet these days??? Given that the last day of our USA trip was to be spent at this hotel before we drove to LAX, we decided that with the $30 parking fee and $19 internet per day in our room we'd be better off just finding a cheap room in Anaheim on our last nights stay so we were closer to the airport on the last day.

During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a \"nice\" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as \"second-class\" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer.

The closet is teeny tiny as well. And no free WI-FI - you have to pay an extra $12 bucks per day. At check in the desk clerk wanted to give me two queen size beds with a city view. Hello...my reservation was for a KING size. What do you know, one was available with a marina view. For that price, it darn well better be a marina view. Will I be back?

Lured by the mention of \"billions of dollars in renovations, I expected -- for the money I spent per night, a luxury hotel experience. Let's start with the bathroom - very cramped and the \"soaking tub\" was a small plastic molded tub that only a child could bathe it. The light switches were put in very crooked. There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work. The ballyhooed TV wake up service did not work at all; thank God I set up a back up with my iPad of I would've missed meetings. I stay at different kinds of hotels -- a month before I stayed at a comfort inn near Olympia, WA, and had a MUCH better experience for MUCH less money. if you are looking for a quality experience, do NOT choose this hotel.

The hotel property is quite nice and even though it is right across the street from the airport, the airport noise is not a factor. There is no free parking at this hotel, only valet or self parking and it is fairly steep per day ($22 for self parking when I stayed) which add up quickly. There are in and out privileges however. The hotel lobby is beautiful and check-in was smooth as they have several front desk clerks assisting visitors. The rooms are fairly nice, not upscale (not sure it is quite a 4 star hotel), but were clean and bright and had no funky smell like a lot of hotel rooms. The beds and pillows were wonderful and my friend and I kept wondering how we could buy some of those pillows! I did not appreciate the lack of follow through with the check-in staff. I originally booked 4 days through Priceline about a month before my trip. A few days later, I decided to add another day (which Priceline lets you do at the same bid price through checkin.) When I checked in at the hotel, they could not find my fifth night. The clerk said she would take care of it. Later that evening, I checked with the front desk and she still had not resolved the problem. The next day, still not resolved. By the 4th day, I had been told by numerous front desk clerks that the matter would be taken care of but it never was resolved by the hotel. I had to call Priceline several times and waste a lot of vacation time to resolve it myself. I can say that after check out, the desk clerk did credit some on my parking bill for the hassle, which was appreciated, but I would have preferred that when their desk staff says they will resolve a problem that they actually resolve it. Another minor irritation was housekeeping. Although housekeeping came every day and replaced the towels and made the beds, they did not actually clean the bathroom which I found odd. My friend who was traveling with me for a few days got her feet really dirty one day and when she took a shower, there were dirty footprints all over the tub. The next morning, they did not clean it. I had to clean it myself with a washcloth and shampoo before I could take a shower. The sink got pretty crusty after a few days and the mirror was also spotted and never cleaned. Also, there was one of 3 bathroom lights burned out when I checked in. I just presumed housekeeping hadn't been in that room for a few days and hadn't notice the light burned out and would change it during my stay. Never changed. I found this to be substandard for what claims to be a 4 star property.

The main one is clean, spacious, and staff is friendly, I can't speak for the other one, but just read some of the reviews and you'll get an idea. The tower I stayed in had great facilities, room was large and the best part was the views from the balcony, SPG status gets you the floor second to the top and free internet which is wired not wifi. Lounge is on the top floor and key card is needed, status gets you free breakfast, otherwise it's like $14, pretty basic, all continental mostly, cereal, fruit, muffins etc. no hot food. Getting down to the gaslamp cost exactly $13 from the hotel, it's not that bad, but there isn't really anything around, the Westin is a better choice if you want to stay downtown, it's probably a 5min walk to the gas lamp from there. Overall, I was very satisfied with the stay, facility was great, clean, quiet, and spacious, staff was friendly and attentive and the shuttle comes and goes very often, just remember, your stay depends on which tower you stay in, I believe mine was the marina tower and the iffy one is called the bayview tower.

This is what you'd expect. A large \"resort\" hotel not really within walking distance of anything. If you want to go anywhere, expect a cab ride or other means. So it's not too bad, but just not great. The good. It is in a very nice location, near the water (Mission Bay, which is NOT the ocean), and has great views of things like the naval base, the bay, Coronado Bridge, etc. (more on this in a bit). Great walking trails nearby, nice and quiet, decent hotel accomodations, etc. From that standpoint, it's great. And, it is REALLY close to the airport. Decent pools for the kids, and the usual amenities such as gym, Starbucks, etc. The bad. There's little nearby. You are going to travel anywhere, such as Gaslamp, downtown, La Jolla, Qualcomm, Padres, the beach, Corondado, you name it. Also, WHY MAKE ME PAY FOR INTERNET? When are hotels going to learn this is like making us pay for TV in the old days? It's not a sign of being progressive and hip, it's a sign of being out of touch! What's next, making me pay for local calls (cringe)? And, you are stuck most of the time in this hotel, at their mercy with restaurants. If that's okay with you, that's okay. Our room. Without doing anything (I think) to annoy the check-in staff, we got ABSOLUTELY the worst room in this place - room 5135 (don't agree to take this room!!). We didn't complain - were there on business and spent little time there (so management don't reply that we shouldn't have requested - we shouldn't have been put in such a dumpy room to begin with!!), but this was a crappy room. I happened to visit the room of other meeting attendees, including those without Sheraton Club membership, paid same amount, came in later, etc., and they mostly all had significantly better rooms in terms of views. And trust me, it matters at this hotel. Our room (again, 5135 - avoid it!) looked out on a parking lot and a green wall adjacent to tennis courts, while others looked out on the bay, airport landing jets, city skyline (imagine how all this looks at night?). It sucked. And, it smelled of mold - inspection of the air unit outside showed it all mildewed, etc. Not nice at all. The room interior was decent, not much to comment on from there (except the damn paying for internet). It seems to me that lousy rooms should be given out last, not early on during the day - a pet peeve of mine - why doesn't their computer system have some sort of ranking system and give out rooms in terms of some ranking system? Long story short, thanks Sheraton, and I'll certainly remember this room! I do commend them for deducting $5 / night for not having maid service. Great practice, and I hope it shows on the final bill. I like that. The sports bar on premise is pretty good, and food is okay although pricey and service is spotty (what did you expect given this was a self-contained resort hotel). The restaurant is same, except we found service there to be really poor (we complained, and to her credit, waitress took the blame for shoddy service, although she blamed it on a \"large party of 40\" which was there that night - at a hotel that seems to host large parties all the time, thank god there wasn't a party of 400 or we still might be there - and on a Sunday night with few other patrons. You figure for yourself on that one.). Restaurant food was pretty good, but prices were high for poor service. But what do you expect given a hotel with no competition within walking distance? Summary: Good hotel. Watch where they put you, which room. Enjoy the sports bar in moderation. The hotel restaurant is good but with poor service for us. Would I stay here again?

First, let me tell you why I made this seemingly simple request. I'm planning on proposing to my girlfriend while in San Diego, and, of course, I want everything to go well...everything from the hotel to the restaurants to the proposal itself. I want it to be an experience. So I called up Sheraton reservations and was told that I would need to speak to the front desk reception, as I booked through a third party (Priceline). After being connected to the front desk, I explained that I am proposing to my girlfriend and want to get the best room for this experience. The woman I was speaking with seemed to care less. Don't get me wrong, she did the minimum of what she was asked to do, but she showed no real care. She explained that I was currently booked in the Bay Tower and could only stay on a floor no higher than the 4th. Really? She went on to explain that if I wanted a higher floor I would have to pay $20 extra per night. Ok..if that's what it takes, no problem. I mentioned to her that I had read lots of reviews saying the Bay Tower was not preferable and the main hotel was much better. She admitted that the Bay Tower was kind of far away, but it was quieter and the rooms were bigger. Ok...sounds fine, but I told her that I was concerned because of all of the reviews. So I asked what she would prefer if she were receiving a marriage proposal...which tower/room/view would she prefer. All she said was it is up to me what I want to do and she will make the request. This was less than friendly or personable, and it showed a real lack of caring. At any rate, I agreed to pay the $20 extra per night for a Bay Tower room \"above the 4th floor.\" I made a request for room on the 10th floor with a good view...so let's see if I get it. I hope the concierge is more caring and sincere, as I plan to ask him/her to have champagne waiting for us upon our return to the hotel after I propose. I will stop the review here for now. I really hope I can come back to this review and put 5 stars on this upcoming stay.

The only people that did answer were the valet and they had my car waiting for me proptly every time(good job valet! That was the best service we received while there) I called and asked for two extra blankets, several hours later they never came. After making a follow up call(which AGAIN was not picked up) I went downstairs and requested the two blankets in person. Eventually they sent up ONE blanket.\u00a0 My room was also charged over $50 in minibar charges for items that were never removed from the fridge. Called to have it corrected, was told someone had to come check the fridge before we checked out, but no one ever came, we waited over an hour for a person to come up!! Finally went down and was told by the desk that they already reversed the charges... So why on earth didn't any staff member bother telling me this???

We caught the complimentary shuttle bus provided by the Sheraton to the Marina Tower, we checked -in and was offered a choice of rooms. We took a room over looking the Harbour in the Lanai rooms. They had two queen beds, desk/work area, coffee maker with a good selection of coffees and teas.These rooms had plenty of space for a family of four 3ads 1 teenager. The balcony was great to watch the sunset in the evening and to watch the harbour. The room was immaculate, sparkling clean bathroom. This hotel had a Starbucks on site, there was a outdoor restaurant Shorelines this was amazing the portions were huge. There was the Harbour Edge restaurant which was open from breakfast til late,Martini Tapas bar, then there was the sports bar Quinn's where you could order food til late and a gift shop.Fitness centre, Spa room fee applied to that, the pool areas were excellent two pools/hot tubs. tennis courts, bike rentals, boat rentals.They had kids activities and on Friday and Saturday they had a Dive in Movie which was a good idea you could swim whilst you watched the movie or just relax on a lounger with a drink and a snack. We opted for the Help the Environment this was a good idea you got $5 voucher for everyday you stayed, if you didn't want all your bath towels and sheets changing every day they came in and just made your bed and refilled the mini bar and your complimentary coffee and teas. We used the vouchers towards eating in Shoreline. The location wasn't a problem I had heard and read from others it was out of the way. Yes it's a little out of the way but it is a nice walk along the front towards Downtown (Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village) we took the walk at a leisurely pace and it took just over 1/2hr. We didn't hire a car for our 5day visit and to be honest it's not necessary unless you want to visit the beaches near La Jolla and Oceanside. I would recommend the 2day old town trolley tour this helps with finding out about the area and where you want to spend your time exploring in more depth. We did get a taxi back to the hotel this cost $12 with tip and we also took the MTS public transport this was brilliant we took the hotel shuttle bus back to the airport and boarded the 992 bus to Broadway and we took the no 7 bus to the zoo it took just over 40mins and it was $5 for all day per person you can't get better than that. I think rather than pay $22 per day parking at the hotel and whatever the cost to hire your car using the local transport is good. Ralphs grocery store was good to get a few provisions for the day out at the zoo. This was near Market St in Gaslamp area. The history of the Gaslamp area was fascinating,especially if your into Wyatt Earp etc and around the 1800's, the Old Town was also full of History and really enjoyable to wander round and taste some of the local foods and crafts. The zoo is a must..... start early though, this will enable you to see the animals before it gets too hot and there sleep time.There is so much to do and see in Balboa Park it's worth spending the day there.

Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous.

We were hungry but there was no restaurant in the tower so we walked a few yards to a deli down the marina. Our room had two double beds, nothing special and not very comfortable (in my opinion). The bathroom was small but when we requested extra towels they were delivered immediately. We spent the afternoon in our private cabana at the pool which was fantastic. The only issue I have is in talking with some children in the pool, found out they and their family of at least 12 people, were \"pool crashers.\" Apparently that location is a regular spot for them! Later in the evening, we attended the Dive-in Movie at the pool which was fun. I thought the noise from the airplanes (right across the marina is SD airport) was very loud.

When we went to check in, they told us that we were staying at their sister hotel which was \u00bc of a mile away and require shuttle transportation. I figured we had just gone to the wrong place, and that the conference was being held at the sister hotel that they were sending us to, but I soon found out I was wrong. We spent one night at the sister hotel, and we were horrified at the physical condition of the room. The next day we were moved to the bigger hotel where the conference was being held, and had the displeasure of experiencing their \u201ccustomer service\u201d. We called asking for hangers because we were staying there for 6 nights. They gave us an attitude and then took over an hour to get the hangers to us. The food was overpriced, which is to be expected at a hotel, but if you\u2019re going to charge me double, at least make sure the food is worth it. It was not. My chicken was cold, hard, and dry, and my friend was given a cheeseburger with no bun (and no she\u2019s not on the Atkin\u2019s diet). The Restaurant Serves were rude and one even rolled his eyes when we asked him for napkins. Guests would leave their trays in the hallway after they were done with their food and drinks, and they would be left out there for days; room service did not walk the halls. The two glasses that we took a picture of were there for 4 days!!!! In fact, my husband repeatedly put them in the middle of the hallway so that someone would pick them up, and instead they were moved back up against the wall instead of being taken in to be cleaned. When we dialed 0 for the operator, the phone would ring and ring, but no one bothered to answer it. The charge for parking was ridiculous ($22), as was the internet ($17). As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a commercial boasting that Sheraton spent $6 billion to renovate their hotels across the country, and I guess we\u2019re paying for it. I think if they could charge us for the air we breathed, they would have. I\u2019m really wondering where this money went to. Our experience was unacceptable. We were so shocked that we took a photo log. This is not a cheap motel, but a resort. I was disappointed and disgusted. We paid a lot of money to go to this conference, and spent a few extra days there as a mini vacation. This is definitely not what I had in mind. You can take a look at the pictures, but here are some of the highlights: 1) The wallpaper was stained and falling apart. In one spot, there was blood on the wall. 2) The showerhead was coming off the wall, falling apart, and water was dripping. 3) The bathroom was not clean. 4) The lampshade was stained and had a hair from a previous guest still on it. 5) The electrical outlets were loose, old, broken, and corroded. 6) The AC would turn off all by itself, minutes after we turned it on. There was no way for us to tweak it and let the room cool down to what we were comfortable with. 7) The patio outside was disgusting and had not been cleaned. 8) The telephone did not work. 9) There were cups of coffee, but no coffee maker in the room - cofemaker was very dirty. 10) The baseboards were completely banged up. 11) The sprinklers on the ceiling were rusted, as were the AC vents. 12) The pool area was not cleaned at night, so we could see trash and the towels all over the pool area. 13) There was dust everywhere, especially built up in the vents. 14) The layout of the room was difficult. We\u2019re not dumb people and we work in real estate. We couldn\u2019t figure out where to turn on the lights. The towels were under the sink and completely unreachable.

We had a room in the Marina tower which is the bigger of the two towers we had a room facing the city/Airport which at first I thought might be an issue (noise from Airport) but actually it was not an issue you do hear airport noise whilst sitting on the balcony but when you close the door you don\u2019t hear anything, the walls had good sound insulation which is good because I\u2019m a light sleeper and I did not experience any problems. Food is fairly expensive here we booked a package through Allegiant Air and received breakfast free everyday which was great you had the choose of buffet or menu breakfast it was good, we ate in the bar once food was ok! There are no restaurants close to the hotel so if you don\u2019t eat at the hotel you would have to go downtown which is a 10 minute drive away, if you don\u2019t have a car like us you can take the hotel shuttle to the airport then take the bus to downtown a little inconvenient but it worked. The pool is very nice lots of chairs to lounge around on they do have a pool bar which is convenient the staff do walk around to take orders, I found the food here a little greasy for my liking. The hotel does have lots of conferences here but it did not affect us to much they have a big conference centre so they are really well take care of over their own side of the hotel. The hotel front desk staff we found to be very unfriendly it seemed like they were going out of their way to help us, on the over hand housekeeping went out of their way to help you and were very friendly even though English was clearly their second language.

The hotel seems to be able to handle a large number of guests; there were 1,000 present at the conference and also some little league baseball teams. The lobby, business center, and fitness center never seemed crowded, but the Starbucks had long lines and the pub restaurant was busy, understaffed, and hot. I stayed in the Marina Tower. Check-in service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. I can say the same for the parking valet and concierage. My room was very clean and comfortable.The bed was great, and room service was reliable. Unfortunately I was unable to get a room with much of a view, but the 5th floor was quiet and I was never bothered by noise from the airport or other quests. Also, the conference facilities were great with prompt attention from the tech team. So on the plus side--very nice room, clean and quiet, and overall wonderful service. Now, the cons--as noted by other reviewers--the hotel is isolated. If you want to see San Diego, you will need to rent a car, and if you rent a car, you will have to pay the outrageous (in my view) parking fees--$22 per day for self park, $28 for valet. I would prefer to stay some place where I could walk to restaurants and shopping. Secondly, in-room internet is costly, although wi-fi is free in the lobby. Finally, the food and drinks in the on site restaurants were mediocre and way over priced, and the restaurants and bar always seemed to be understaffed. I spent two nights checking out restaurants in the Gaslight District. I would recommend taking a cab rather than driving, as parking was scarce and very $$$. Also, the evening scene there is not very family friendly.

The hotel is acutally two Sheraton hotels - the Marina Tower and the Bay Tower, which are about a 5 minute walk apart from each other. I was in the Bay Tower...which is a 3 star hotel that's trying really hard to be a 4 star. And it looks like it's trying. The hotel overall is decent - the rooms were lacking in my opinion. Nothing was by any means impressive. I think the Marina tower must be a lot nicer - at least the lobby and amenities make it appear that way. I can't say that I was ever in a Marina tower room, I can only assume that they're nicer than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were loud, I could hear doors slamming and toilets flushing at all hours. I'm a light sleeper so this was especially irritating. The rooms had that moist, Mexico feel to them...always just a little bit damp. That has a lot to do with being right on the marina, but when I first checked in, the AC was completely off. That doesn't help either. Overall, the room was very clean, housekeeping came everyday. Staff was friendly, which always goes a long way in my opinion. Only two elevators, which are slow. I ended up just taking the stairs most of the time. Meeting space is nice, lots of rooms/ballrooms between the two towers. Parking is not free and neither is internet access. If you drive, keep your room key handy in the car. You'll need it to enter AND exit the parking lots. (I chunked it into my purse on multiple occasions and had to dig for it while cars lined up behind me. Sorry cars.) I think parking was $11/day and internet was $12/day. It added up though. Also, when you get there, the first hotel you'll see is the Marina tower. You won't see the Bay Tower. So, valet the car or just leave it running at the valet station - do NOT park - go in and check in. There's a chance you're in the other tower and lugging stuff back and forth is annoying. For the nightly rate, I think it could be nicer. The views are good - either of the marina or the bay. It's definitely in a GREAT location relative to the airport; only a couple of miles away. I'd say good location overall actually, it's within about 5 miles of everything: Fashion Valley, the Gaslamp District, Little Italy, etc. Also, great running trails just outside the hotel...run along the marina, watch the boats, it's pretty key for runners. Room Service food was surprisingly good, however. Recommend the crab cakes. Watch out for the service charges, they caught me off guard.

My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity. The opposite side faces the bay and some might prefer that view. If you are worried about sleeping noise the airport is quiet at night and I slept very well. I made the walk between the two towers several times a day and found that I enjoyed it very much. Had the weather been bad I might not have felt that way. I did rent a car while here and found the hotel close enough to all the attractions. You can self park your car if you want to. The Bay tower is much closer to the car park. There are 2 restaurants off the hotel property which are walkable. The first is The Lighthouse and it is very good (I highly recommend it and you will need a reservation). The second, The Boat House, is closer but I found the food and service to be terrible. This is a very nice hotel which can offer two different experiences at the same time. Just choose the tower which fits your needs and you will be happy.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cWhat a neat experience in a fantastic location.

Reading some reviews from a different website gave me second thoughts, but I did not have to worry, because this hotel was just GREAT! The service at the front desk was great, very friendly and courteous, the valet people were very nice, too. The room was just perfect with a PERFECT VIEW of the city and the bay and the marina. We are SPG members so we got the higher floors, and the view alone was well worth the stay here. the pool, like the other reviews, was also very nice, with a spa. It wasn't busy at all, the showers were conveniently located in the gym, and they provided the towels at the poolside. Our stay here was staggard because we had to travel to another city for the weekend, so when I booked, I booked two different kinds of rooms, the last one was a studio type, which I liked very much, too. Very spacious. Although, the drain of the shower in the studio type was slow...that was the only set back, and we only stayed in it for one night, so I really didn't mind it that much. Parking was indeed steep, at $22/night, but hey, it wasn't that bad finding a spot anyway. You just had to go tot he opposite lot, everyone tends to turn right upon entering the hotel driveway, but really, there's another lot on the left side and we always found a spot to park there.

If I had to give it a review it would be more like 2.5 instead of 3. It wasn't the best I've stayed but at the same time it wasn't the worst. A few of my thoughts: 1) The major perk of staying there is that it is close to the San Diego International Airport. The hotel does offer a free shuttle from the airport however when I called the customer service representative stated that it runs every 20 minutes. It took them longer than that. The hotel that I stayed while in San Diego previously they told me that their shuttle would be there in 10 minutes and that they were leaving so I didn't have to wait that long. 2) When I arrived at 3pm there was a line of 4 people. There was two people assisting other people and about 20 minutes later somebody came to assist. Thankfully, I am a patient person. I was told from a phone call from me that I could add $20 a night for breakfast, internet access and hor d'oeuvres so I paid additional money to get that. 3) I really loved my room. The bathroom was perfect for 1 to 2 people but it would be crowded for 3 or more people. The bed was comfortable. The view of the marina was nice and I did get an upgrade with a balcony. The big screen was nice and there was a lot of room for my clothes (a closet and drawer set). There was a desk and chair. The coffee pot for two cups is a nice touch. I wished there was a refrigerator and microwave. 4) The thing that irritated me is the fact that the hotel DOES NOT have wifi. I was told at checking out that it is something they are working on getting but it's something that they have been working on for 2 years. There is a dial up connection. On Thursday night when I tried to get the dial up set up the cord was frayed so I requested to get a new one. It took three phone calls to get them to bring me up a new one. That is unacceptable customer service. I also called because the hair dryer wasn't working. That also took three phone calls. I didn't get any of this fixed until Friday Night. 5) The breakfast they serve was very basic. Everyday I was there they offered: A) Turkey, Ham, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese. B) Hard boiled eggs C) Muffins, Croissants, White & Whole Wheat Bread, Bagels (There is a toaster) D) Decaf & Regular coffee, Tea, Orange Juice, Grapefruit juice and two others that look suspicious to me. There is sugar and artificial sweeteners. E) The waiters were very personable & helpful. F) The $20 extra I paid for included breakfast and hor d'oeuvres. The snacks was only for between 5 - 8pm. The snacks was basically the same as breakfast except they had small size burritos and cheese quiche. I only went there twice and it was good but it would of been nice to see them spice things up a bit. 6) It was convenient to have the shuttle to get to leave for the airport on Sunday. However, to take a cab to downtown San Diego will cost you about $30 round trip. For Comic Con there was a shuttle to get to the convention center which was free but to get back to the hotel you really need take a cab especially if you are staying out late. It was very easy to catch a cab at the hotel because there is a stand for them and the valet escorts was very quick to get me a cab. 7) The heated pool and hot tub is clean and very comfortable to go swimming in. Overall, it was good but not excellent. I am planning on going to Comic Con next year but next time I will stay in a hotel that is closer to the convention center which means I will have to pay more money but it would be worth it due to the near $200 I spent on getting a cab back to the hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cYou Kidding?

Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel!

I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen!

Great training and service (not)! The public areas need serious upgrading and the bar and restaurant area was uninviting and dead most of the time. The pool was appalling - small with a bar area that was closed when we were there and seriously out of date. We felt like poor relations to the guests in the main tower where lobby, bar and pool areas were far superior. Not sure if the staff also felt miserable to be working in the second rate tower, but their indifference to service and general apathy was very disappointing after the high standards we had experienced through the rest of our trip.

We liked the look of the Sheraton and marina, but were aware that it was some distance from the downtown area, so we had to factor in extra cost for cabs and plan our days' events. The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service.

There are 2 other restaurants that are able half a mile, and a mile away from the hotel. Island Prime and Tom Ham's Lighthouse were both worth walking to. We ended up taking a taxi home because we were too full to walk. We used taxi's to get everywhere because we did not want to worry about trying to use the buses. Taxi's are a bit more expensive than the buses and trolleys, but it saves you tons of time and hassle! The free shuttle to and from the airport was very nice. I loved the view from the hotel. Being right on the ocean and in the marina was beautiful. The paths to walk along the ocean were very nice.

Not exactly sure why they didn't have someone stationed on our floor to let everyone in if they knew there was a problem. Fifteen minutes later someone finally showed up to let us in. Meanwhile, a couple down the hall had no problem getting in their room - so much for the entire floor having problems. We were told it would be fixed. The next day we were getting ready to leave in the morning, trying to catch the city bus on time. I forgot something in the room and ran upstairs to grab it. But the key still didn't work. We spoke to the front desk and the lady there was surprised we were having problems. Obviously didn't get the memo from the other front desk people.

From reading other entries, I realized that I should request the Bay Tower, which I understand the rooms are a little older (although recently renovated) and a little bigger. We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby. In all, we had a good stay at the Sheraton. We really enjoyed the view from our room.

This hotel has been in SD for a while and we were a little apprehensive. We heard about the renovation and it was fantastic!!! First and foremost - the option to decline housekeeping for a $5.00 voucher that can be used at the hotel (yes, Starbucks too) is BRILLIANT! Why can't every hotel do this!!! We always decline housekeeping and tidy our own room, hang towels for reuse, make our own bed, which saves the hotel $$$$ with no incentive, this place gets it! They will give you clean towels by the way, and you still get the $ 5.00 voucher! Another thing, the elevators are ample, large and fast, the elevator lobby on each floor is huge, bright, scenic and impressive, again as compared to gaslamp hotels, which seem to skimp on elevators if you ask me. The only drawback is distance from gaslamp, but this hotel made up for it. When we checked in the kind clerk said we had an economy room booked, but she promptly said she'd put us in a better room on the 6th floor, and we got a king as we had hoped for. The room is very spacious, with a downtown view, balcony, great bed and linens. Small bathroom, but well done - subway tile in shower, tub, lots of spots to hold soap, shampoo, etc., rain shower head, marble vanity with very nice lighting. Flat screen TV, high ceilings, very nice. Super, super quiet, even with airport across the street! The pool set it apart from other gaslamp hotels. It was really awesome. Overlooking the marina, tons of space, lots of lounge chairs, big pool, sunny, cabana bar, really great for downtown SD. The hotel lobby is great, computer kiosks with internet, cozy, modern. Starbucks in lobby is great. Parking at $ 22.00 for self park in lot that is part dirt is ridiculous. If you self park, be sure to bring room key to let yourself out of unattended parking lot!

I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11.

The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name).

However, the desk staff said the room was available, just not cleaned. They would \"call housekeeping to have it prioritized\" and it would be ready within an hour. Later another person at the desk laughed and said that was crazy, Housekeeping doesn't do that. After over 2 hours, they gave me a room that was already cleaned. The biggest negative was the Club Lounge, which we paid extra to have access to. Our card key did not work, so we had to go to the desk to have it fixed (again). At breakfast it was an interstate exit Hampton Inn with at least 12-15 little kids (ages 8 and under). Wow...wiping noses and then pawing through the pastries, eating from the line, taking stacks of things...real disgusting mess.

One negative I'll mention is that our stay was pre-paid as part of an Expedia package, and for the very first time in my life I didn't ask for a copy of the folio when we checked out. I'd taken a $10 container of nuts from the mini bar but was in the room when the lady came to check the mini bar, so felt it was understood what I had used. Usually they record what you've used and give you a receipt but she didn't. Well, you can imagine my surprise when my credit card was billed over $64! Accounting told me that the items in the mini bar are sensored, so if you remove an item (to read the label in my case) you will automatically be charged for it. Apparently the 'sensors' are to stupid to know when you've replaced the item back in its place. Anyway as a 'courtesy' I was credited back for the other 3 items I had been charged for - wow thanks guys. The nuts ended up costing $13 because they also add tax and a 'service charge' so be sure to add 30% to the listed price.

But my biggest beef is the deceitful \"bait & switch\" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the \"property\" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main building\u2014but you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harbor\u2014facing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main \"Marina Tower\"\u2014not the second-rate \"Bay Tower.\" This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good place\u2014but I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor.

Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way! One girl from the Concierge and one guy from the Starbucks were the only people who smiled at us once and that's about all the smiley and happy faces in Sheraton we've got during our several days long stay there!", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cExcellence base for a weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "spggold", "ReviewID": "UR94087338", "Content": "Great Hotel for the money!

He only agreed to do this after I complained about the confusion at check in and the fact that I requested a wake up call but never got one. Overally, I can't complain too much because I got the room for only $79/night (before the extra $20/night for the upgrade). But had I paid more than $100 I would have been mad.

However, Harbor Island location is not central/downtown. And there are no public transportation options to nearby downtown. Also enjoyed staff's mix of professionalism and genuineness. Odd quirks: Trouble getting to Floor #1 due to obscure elevator bank for that purpose and no (little) signage. Floor #1 is for pool, gym, etc - its elevator bank is located far away from main bank of elevators but no signage at main elevator bank to this effect. Rode up + down main elevators for a while (where there is a floor #1 marked on the panel) but it would not stay lit . Needless crazy making when a few clearer signs would help. Though a nice idea in theory, hors d'oeurves offered in Club Level evening reception Tues-Thursday (gratis though bar charges for drinks) were marginal, a polite word for almost inedible.

The location is pretty central. We saved money by just taking cabs as hotel parking is $18/day. For 5 days we spent about $150 on cabs. A one-way cab ride to downtown is about $15 with tip.

There was a huge red stain on the carpet when we walked in. The people in the room next to us were so loud we could just about hear their whole conversation. I called the front desk and requested to be moved. They told us the hotel was sold out. So I decided to take a towel from the bathroom to close the gap under the door that adjoined the rooms. There was a huge black hair on the towel so once again I called and requested to be moved. They told us to come back to the front desk and they would have another room for us. Our second room was on the 3rd floor and we had a lovely view of the parking lot. The room was much smaller than our first. We immediately noticed there was black hair all over the bathroom floor. We had problems with the shower working correctly and had more water coming out the faucet than we did the shower head. It took a good 10 minutes for the shower to drain before the next person could shower. We were unable to find the TV remote, after calling the front desk it took them 30 minutes to bring us a new one at 1:30AM. To top things off a car alarm starting going off at 5AM. Needless to say this was the worst hotel experience. I booked the room through priceline which was the first mistake. They were not helpful in resolving the issues after we returned home and said there was nothing they could do. I've emailed the hotel and no response.

I reported his name and number to the hotel.

It is very near the airport with a quick, free shuttle, and very courteous drivers both to and from the airport. I had to FedEx 2 important packages of conference materials to the hotel in advance. I was initially told that the package room closed at 4:30 PM, and since I was not arriving until late in the evening before the conference, I was worried about not being able to pick up the packages. I called ahead to make sure they would be available and Guest Services and the bellmen had everything waiting when I arrived. The hotel is located away from the main tourist areas and most restaurants, so you need a rental car or taxi (always available) to go most places. I tend to like the locations near the downtown or Convention Center, so there are places to walk to after my meetings. Lots of scenic places for jogging or walking near the water, though. There are 3 different locations for rooms within the same hotel property. The main tower attached to the lobby, the Bay Tower which is reached by a shuttle or a considerable walk, or the Lanai which is somewhat attached to the main hotel, but still a considerable walk. My room was in the Lanai and I was given a complex map to find it. I was offered the services of a bellman to help with my luggage, but had no idea how complicated it would be to find the room Not only that, but when I did find the Lanai, it was raining (unusual for San Diego) and all the rooms opened directly to the outside, the only elevator was miles away, and I trudged up the steps with all my luggage.to the top floor which was completely open to the rain. Every time I had to go to the Starbucks, restaurant, or free internet in the lobby, I was right out in the rain which lasted for 3 days. The room itself was fine, but I have no idea what the Tower rooms were like, very clean with comfortable beds and big desk. The TV had the 3 major networks and a few cable stations (limited). The view of the marina was beautiful. There was a very loud air conditioner in the wall of the room which you could turn either on or off, but not set a temp. so that it would go on or off. When you turn on the bathroom light, a loud fan automatically went on. So, all in all, it was loud. They have a rainfall shower, which some people like, and had a little bit harder setting, but it took forever to rinse out shampoo. Nonetheless, the hotel was very nice. Everyone was extremely courteous, and except for the check-in person who could have assigned a better location, very helpful with any request. I wound up ordering salads or sandwiches to take up to my room for several meals at Quinn's which is the bar and has a great menu. Their marinated skirt steak is delicious. I think the food all comes from a central kitchen, but did not try their main restaurant. The Starbuck's in the lobby is good, opens about 5:30 AM (I think) but closes at about 5:30 PM. The gift shop stays open until 11:00 PM, so no problem there. The Fitness Center is open with a key 24 hours and very well stocked with equipment. There are several beautiful pools and a large hot tub. There are 5 free computers in the lobby with a printer, but a charge to connect in your room.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201clovely hotel;beautiful views\u201d", "Author": "heathers44", "ReviewID": "UR82918593", "Content": "spent 6 nights here in September 2010.

I immediately called the front desk in horror thinking it had gone to the dumpster and perhaps they could retrieve it before the inevitable. The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it \"ain't gonna happen.\" They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday. After my phone calls (that magically go to voicemail) and email, it has been a month and there has been absolutely no response or contact. I am extremely disappointed with this lack of response.

We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win. The shuttles from the hotel drop you to the airport and then you can take the car shuttle from there to the car lot.

I asked the waitress if she could please have a table bussed so that my family could sit down. She said it would be several minutes and if I wanted to wait I could but did not know when it would be done. Since it was my first time in the restaurant and first time in the hotel I asked how I go about to reserve the table (put my name in the front, with her, etc.) and she said to stand by the table until she had the time to clear it off. The table by the way was a complete mess, not so much with the dishes from the previous guest, but with her towels, serving tray, and cleaner. She bussed the table and my family and I sat down. After we sat down a booth became available and my wife asked if I could get it for us since our 2 year old would be easier if he was between the two of us inside a booth. The waitress quickly came over to me and told me that table was reserved for another guest that had been waiting. As I was confused because she had told me that for me and my family to get a table we would have to stand by it, I asked her why she would hold another table for a guest and make me stand by a table. The other guest came to the table that had been told by the waitress that she would hold it and created a very uncomfortable situation for them and I. I went back to my table to let my wife know the bad news and when the waitress went by, I asked for clarification from the waitress. She said that they had been waiting for the table and I said I understood but why did she make me stand by a table while she took their name, she looked at me, looked at my kids, rolled her eyes, flipped her hair, and walked away. I never received clarification, an apology, or even acknowledgment, and she had someone else wait on us in her station area so she would not have to deal with us. It makes me wonder why a young family would receive different treatment as my money, tips, opinions, and access to the internet to voice it are just as good as anyone else\u2019s. It took over an hour to get our food while people who came in after us were getting fed. When asked turned out that they were holding the kids food until my ribs were done, Honestly, with two small children starting to loose it from lack of food common sense says bring it out. The food was overpriced and the kids pizza was cold. The hotel charged us for items out of the mini bar fridge automatically because the left over pizza we put in the fridge blocked the sensor for an item. The line to check out was over an hour to clear up the bill. The view was great and if you did not have kids could be a very romantic place to stay, DO NOT STAY HERE WITH KIDS.

Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, \"This is nice\", or \"This goes above & beyond a normal hotel\", or basically, \"Wow, this is fancy!\" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27\" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a \"business center\" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a \"business center\", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying \"Wow this is fancy\". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience.

I wish we could have had more time to enjoy the hotel. My family which consists of my husband, two teenagers and a 10 yr old had a blast during the week of Comic-Con.

As you can probably guess I felt his absolute vulnerability and terror at that moment in time. The realization that for the first time in 9 yrs he would not have Henry to fall asleep with. I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion. My son learned a valuable lession during those \"Henry-less\" days. #1 He could sleep nightmare free without Henry. #2 Never forget to look in the blankets at a hotel before declaring \"I'm all packed lets go\" and #3 It was sure good to get Henry home.

And it's a HUGE SECRET that I'll share with you here.......Between the two towers and closest building to the Bay Tower, there's a MARINA DELI on the back side of the building that serves wonderful bfst & lunch for extremely reasonable prices. They also have quite a few ammenities should you need drinks, snacks, beer whateover. Too bad we did not find it till the last day we were there but, a fantastic breakfast was had by almost our entire team and priced as it should be.

Liars. It is horrible, run down, CRT TVs and cream whitewashed furniture. The other tower has Flat TVs, lovely showers and you are on the Marina, not overlooking the Airport, which is the Bay Tower view. Add this to the fact that it is $300+ per night, charge $25 per night for self parking your car, $13 per PC for internet per night and this is a $400+ per night stay and honestly, a joke.

The Ramada had a few rooms left but they were smoking rooms. My husband is a smoker so we thought we could handle it. We spent the day at the beach and went to the Ramanda room late evening. That was the most disgusting experience of my life. Not only was the stench overwhelming but we found rodent feces in the bedsheets. At this point we were totally exhaused and headed back to the boat to try and get some sleep. As were were pullling into the harbor we decided to check availability and pricing at your Sheraton. That is when Melissa Hernandez waited on me!! Not only did she find my family a room its was also affordable. Our vacation was saved. We were prepared to come home the next day. We had a great room, beautiful view, and great service. Employees like Melissa will keep your customers coming back.

There was a patio with sliding glass door that faced the tennis courts. The TV was a large flat-screen. The shower had one of those fab shower heads with a million little jets (and great water pressure). Oh, and the bed was super comfy. Housekeeping was great. The bed was made every day, and any towels that were left on the floor were replaced with fresh ones.

The main tower offers movies by the pool at night (Weekends) and has other fun daily pool activities. Bay tower nothing. You feel like a second class citizen and not worthy of the Sheraton name.

Beds and pillows were comfy. On my last night they slipped my statement and it said everything was paid in full and was Charged $288. As my room was pre paid I was not too happy with what I saw. I went to reception and they corrected the problem. Just beware every person ahead of me had a problem with over charging.

We stayed on the Club Level and our room had a wonderful view of downtown San Diego. Most of the staff we encountered was very friendly. The room itself was clean and the beds were awesome. We enjoyed being able to open the balcony door and the view was fantastic. In other reviews people complained about airport noise , we were able to sleep just fine. The only thing that we were concerned about was that pets were allowed in the hotel and my husband is allergic to pets. I did not see on the website that the hotel was pet friendly and if I had known that I would of put a note in the reservation to make sure that we were not in a room that just had a pet in it. The lobby had nice places to sit and relax however we preferred to be outside. The weather was lovely and they were showing a movie in the pool area the night we arrived. The fitness center was a nice feature that had adequate amount of treadmills, stationary bikes and weight equipment. They also have two ping pong tables so that the kids and adults can play. The pool area was very cute and clean when we went the next morning. If you book in the Club Level you are given access to the Club Lounge the next morning which provides you a nice continental breakfast. If you are able to get a good deal on the Club Level it is worth the upgrade. I think it is a great hotel for families who can splurge on a nice weekend get away or vacation. The only negative is the parking, if the hotel is full you might have a hard time finding parking closer to your tower. Not everyone might enjoy the long walk from the parking lot to their building. In addition, the parking is a $22.00 fee and I would hope that the management would improve the parking situation. P.S. Be ware of the Mini Bar in the room, I had already read about and had even requested them to empty it out. However, when I got to the room the Bellman even advised us to becareful with the mini bar. If the sensor is messed with they will charge you for the mini bar.

We got the \"Romance Package\" and stayed in the Marina Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, very clean and had a picture postcard view of Downtown San Diego. We were even impressed that we barely heard the planes taking off and landing at the San Diego Airport which is just about 1/4 mile away. The bed was very comfortable. We slept so well. Also, the newly decorated room was very nice. Probably most important for us was that they welcomed our dog with no added charge and no fuss. Sure they wanted us to be responsible for our little guy, but it was nice that we felt welcome. There was even a very nice restaurant on the island called the \"C-Lounge\" that welcomed him on their patio. The view of the city at night was breathtaking from the restaurant's vantage point. Now back to the Romance Package, it was a great value. The complementary \"breakfast in bed\" EACH DAY was impressive. We ordered off of the menu what we wanted and had deliciously prepared FULL breakfasts delivered to the room both days we stayed there. Then on our anniversary night we got a complementary bottle of champagne and 6 huge chocolate covered strawberries. Finally, they offered us a very late checkout of 4pm, which we gladly used. We enjoyed every minute of time just relaxing on one of the two balconies overlooking the city, sail boats and Navy ships on the bay. The only downsides were that daily self-parking was $22.00 and in-room high speed internet was $11.95 per day (up to $18.95 for super fast internet). NO WIRELESS IN ROOM, BUT FREE WIRELESS IN THE LOBBY. This is pretty steep compared to other properties we've stayed at. But we felt that, given the total value of the package we booked, it was ok.

I wasn't real thrilled at first to be booked into this hotel becuase I had stayed here twice before for conventions. The first one I got a room miles from the main tower right next to the swimming pool pump room. The second time I got a room overlooking the parking lot. I was at a convention then, so it wasn't really a big deal, but this was a nice getaway with my hubby. Thanks to other reviews, I knew to ask for the Marina Tower with a Harbor view. I did not use the automated check in system just so that I could request a room with a view. The check in chick was really friendly and gave us a room on the 9th floor facing west over the harbor and marina. The sunsets were fantastic and hubby and I even ordered room service one night just so we could enjoy the view. The room was decorated in a red, white and blue nautical theme. It was very tasteful. We had breakfast one day in the restaurant. It was really nice and we had a nice window table by the marina. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very efficient. The price was less expensive than I thought it would be. There was a rude dude at the table next to us watching sports on his laptop and talking on his cel phone. We asked him nicely to turn down his computer or use an earpice. He continued to talk on his cell phone. I can't believe these kind of people, but it isn't really a reflection on the hotel. All of the hotel staff seemed exceptionally nice. We even observed some staff trying to help out the UK guests in accomodating them with additional nights and telling them what parks and other places were offering free or reduced admissions for them because of the volcano and ash that caused them to have to stay longer. All in all, I wish I could relive my weekend again in exactly the same way (minus the rude dude at breakfast). The only thing I didn't like was having to pay for parking. I was prepared for it as my reservation clearly stated the price of parking. $22/day isn't bad if it's a covered parking garage, but for a parking lot it's kind of steep, especially when we had to park way out in the dirt/gravel.

I was disappointed however, after reading the hotels website, at the room we ended up with. We got what I like the refer to as the 'Priceline Shaft'. This is when you typically end up in a room that is of lesser quality than a regular room in the hotel, simply because you booked on Priceline. Some hotels can't do this because all rooms are basically identical. The Sheraton Marina, on the other hand, quite easily put us in this category. To be honest, there was nothing really wrong with the room itself. I was more put off by the location. The website advertised how almost all the rooms had a view of the skyline or the marina. Ours had a view of the backside of a tennis court. Not only that, but we were in some random satellite building that wasn't really connected well to the hotel. I also was severely unimpressed about the fact that our room had exterior corridors, very motel-like. There was no security for my door and anyone could have wandered up the driveway and knocked on our door. It was really bizarre to see this type of building in a Sheraton - I was certainly not expecting it. Once I accepted the motel atmosphere, the room was fine. It was fairly standard with most Sheratons, but decorated in a nautical theme. We had two beds, a desk, and a bathroom. It was not an overly large room, but not small by any means. The bathroom was a bit tiny and the lack of ventilation in it, something I find common in the US, was a little suffocating. Outside the room, the hotel had a full service Starbucks that we enjoyed although I think the prices were mildly higher than normal. There was also a restaurant and a lounge that we did not sample. I didn't see a fitness center, though I'm sure one exists. We walked by the pool a couple of times to get to the main hotel - it seemed nice. Never busy due to the cooler climate. Rooms contain internet for a fee, or you can go to the lobby for free wireless. There is also the Sheraton Link in the lobby, which provides free computers with internet for registered guests. At other hotels this area has been packed with people however I rarely saw anybody using them at this hotel. Location wise you are not really around much, but it is still a nice location. The airport is basically next door, so it is convienient if you are using it in conjunction with an airline. The marina is behind the hotel, if for some reason you are headed in that direction. My favorite part was that is was located on Harbor Island (not an island - attached to land). This provided a long Bay-front walking path with fantastic views. A drive downtown was 5 minutes. Overall this hotel was satisfactory to stay at. I wasn't happy with being in the two level outside building, and there were a few expensive add-ons ($22 parking etc.) that irritated me during my stay.

The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a \"spa\" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you. Either way, it's in beautiful San Diego, and that's all that matters!!!!!

I called the desk to request that the bed be re-made, and a housekeeper arrived a while later--with a new sheet. When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English.

To get to our room we had to walk by the hot tub which, though large, was packed with teenagers every night. We didn't care to use it but if you do this may be important. My biggest concern was that upon my return home I discovered missing clothes from my luggage. Clothes that were packed in my suitcase the day before checkout but prior to the last room cleaning. I did not think to look through my luggage again on checkout day. The hotel couldn't do anything for me when contacted by phone and they did not respond to an email. I understand locking up your valuables when you travel but if a traveler has to worry about their clothes a hotel has a serious problem with its staff. Also, there is a $22/day parking fee. They do tell you this up front but in case you weren't paying attention to the details. All in all, no matter how clean the rooms are or how nice the view is (and that is not guaranteed) the stress of wondering when the kids are going to quiet down is just not worth it.

We said okay and had the other room moved to Bay tower. The front desk said they upgraded us to a higher floor for the view, but the real reason was probably because the hotel was empty. Bay tower is nice, big rooms no prblems. Liked that they had free internet access and provded printers so print out boarding passes, Pool is just average, but since hotel empty it was like having a pool to yourself. I never made it to the Marina tower so I can't compare. But I do want to emphasize that this is not a 4 star hotel. Not sure who is rating it as such. Rooms need to be spotless and there is some wear and tear and dust in the corners. Bathroom needs to be bigger for a 4 star with more water pressure. The room is bigger than the average size room, but no newspaper every morning (automatically delivered) and no turn down service at night. So the most this hotel could be is a 3.5 star hotel. I paid $80 a night through Priceline so great price for a very decent room.

For us, using Skype and talking to family on the webcam is quite pointless downstairs in front of everyone!

We called upon the concierges service both nights of our stay, recommendations for Pizza to be delivered, and Mexcian food out the other night. Pizza recommended was Ogi's- simple good pizza, with very efficient staff and very prompt delivery. Mexican Food Restaurant recommended was Miguel's Cocina, on Shelter Island Dr- we all enjoyed our meal, around $10 a plate, and a killer Jalapeno Cheese Dip.... needless to say the concierges desk did a great job. The pool was very nice; although there were some great \"fire pit\" seating areas along the walkway that looked like a great place to sit and watch the sun go down...they were always full... a very popular spot. :o) The only complaint that we did have is the following: Our room was on the 3rd floor, and there were two elevators, of which only ONE WAS OPERATIONAL THE ENTIRE STAY. We waited OVER 20 MINUTES to get on the elevator, when we were trying to check out the morning of our departure. (We had entirely too many bags to be lugging down the stairs.) We'd overheard a conversation during our stay, from a fellow guest of the hotel, that they'd been there since Tuesday and only ONE elevator had been operational during their stay as well...that was a total of 5 days, of which we were aware of. We did advise the front desk staff, and a \"Manager\" on duty of the elevator issue- they said they'd look into it....(short for that's nice, go away...) I'm grateful that all the guests in our group were able-bodied, and could handle taking the stairs the other two days of our stay...

Not only were we not within walking distance of anything but we had no public transportation options other than a taxi at $25-30 round trip to the Gaslamp. As an added pleasure the hotel charges a $22 to self park. A great example of going broke saving money.

I was concerned the flight noise would be a problem but it really wasn't. I will say though that the toilets flush with such force they could wake the dead! Upon checkin we attempted to get the Marina Tower as it is clearly the better tower in terms of things to do within the hotel but the Front Desk Clerk would have none of that. To her defense, they were full with a teacher's convention but she could have handled our request in a better manner. The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options. We told him we were not going to park in the hotel and would move the car somewhere else after checkin.

We arrived on a 12pm flight and I was worried we'd be waiting around until 3 or 4 to check-in. I had called ahead a couple days and spoke with Melissa. She informed me we could use the pool and enjoy the hotel while we waited if our room was not ready. We were allowed to change in the Spa area and let our kids swim a while. I rented a large blow-up alligator for an hour ($7) that was their highlight. . .we only had it an hour before I received a call on my cell phone that our room was ready (it was shortly after 1pm!) I was very happy for the early check-in and even more happy to find we'd been upgraded to a two-story townhouse room in the Lanai building. The pool rental place let us return the gator and said we could return later to use up the remain hour I had paid for. There were a few downsides. After swimming a bit we arrived to our room barefoot and found the floor was quite damp. I can only imagine it had recently been shampooed. The doors to the outside had about a 2\" gap between the bottom and the floor, plenty of room for bugs and such to crawl in but we were lucky and had none. Then there were two balconies. . the wood in dire need of staining and new chairs (current ones were old and dirty). Other then that we enjoyed having the downstairs for out two six yr olds on the pull out couch with their own tv, and my husband and I upstairs in a comfortable king with our own tv. There were two bathrooms, one with a shower/bath, also a coffee maker up and downstairs, and a small fridge and sink. This came in handy when we purchased some grocery items & beverages from Papanani's Deli, located between the Marina and Bay Towers. I highly recommend stopping at the deil. . the hotel charges $6 per bottle of beer and at the deli you can purchase a six-pack for $9, along with tasty sandwiches, cereal, and many other items at a fair price. The kids LOVED the Marina tower pool and the entire family enjoyed the Club Lounge on the Penthouse floor. The lounge was beautifully decorated and a decent variety of snacks in the evening and helpful lounge attendant (wish I had gotten his name - very nice). The breakfast also served in the Lounge the next morning was nicely stocked and plenty of room/quiet while we enjoyed the start to our day.

Mine faced the marina and airport but I still appreciated the fresh air and sunlight. Loved the pool with the best aspect being that some of the lounge areas are semi-covered in case you do not want a lot of sun. I was able to comfortably nap by the pool without fear of burning myself. It is only a mile or so from the airport but I was not bothered by any noise even though my room faced the airport. If you are a light sleeper, it may be an issue for you. Try asking for a room facing the harbor. This location is not ideal for tourist activity. It is about a $15-20 cab ride to the Gas Lamp District if that gives you an idea. The staff were very friendly and eager to please. They were readily available with dining or entertainment options.

However, we were very let down by the staff. We checked in late, after earlier ringing them to say that we would be late. Our booking had been made over the internet and on our arrival at San Diego train station we took a taxi to the address on our internet booking reference. This took us to the main hotel close to the Marina. We were ignored by the staff when we rang the bell for service, even though we could hear them saying that they could see that people were at the desk (this is around 1am). We then got told off by the women who greeted us telling is that our booking was for the \"Bay tower\" hotel not the marina side and that we should have gone to the other hotel. We explained that we had come to the address that we had been provided by the internet booking agency, and she said \"well they wouldn't know what room we have put you in\" (not very helpful). She did check us in and give us what she said was a great room on the 11th floor of the bay tower. We ended up having to walk to the bay tower (about 6mins around the Marina - not a big deal but rather inconvenient at that time in the morning). Our room was great it had an excellent view of the Marina and provided everything it said it would. The only thing was that it didnt appear to have used recently and we can only assume hadnt been cleaned (dusted and the like) because of that. The drinking glasses were dirty and the above the shower had some mould. (These were both rectified the next day before we had a chance to talk to the staff about them.) We had further disappointing experiences with the staff when we tried to print out our tickets for a tour that we were to do that day, their printer wouldnt work, at the business centre. We asked if it was possible to get the front desk to print the tickets and were told that as we could have booked the tickets through them they wouldn't print them out because we didnt use them to get the tickets. But were were told that they would happily provide us with tickets themselves, if we paid for them again. We also used the pool while we were there - this was great - however once there were know towels left by the pool, so we asked for some and were told that \"its not my job, try the gym\" after wandering around to get to the gym there were no full size towel provided there only hand towels.

It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina. If you are staying for leisure, I recommend paying the extra for a marina view. I think it's worth it. During stay 3, we were given a club room, but ironically I enjoyed the deluxe rooms better. We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any \"pardon our mess signs\" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast. Overall, I've been pretty happy with Sheraton hotels. I recommend getting room service and ordering their seafood melt sandwhich. mmmm.

The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there.

The night before checking out I go to the front desk to get my total....are you ready for this? $656.00 in long distance charges!!! Work ain't paying for this one.

We stayed in the 'bay' tower, which is a bit of a hike from the main hotel [You may want to ask which building you are in prior to arriving]. The room was 'ok', a bit worn ... slightly noisy when the neighbors got loud. The view was wonderful, but make sure you get the bay side, not the marina side. We arrived real late (due the the flight) around midnite - major disappointment was that there is no room service between midnite and 6am, so we had to scrounge the fast food places a few miles away for dinner. There is a small restaurant and bar in the building, but they did not seem to be open late either. We did try room service prior to leaving - the waiter was extremely nice, the food was average. Staff was nice, but sometimes the 'operator' would take 2 minutes or so to answer, even during the daytime. Could be due to the fact that they were having a large number of weddings there for that weekend, which may have absorbed all of the staff time. Maybe the main, vs. the 'bay' hotel property has less issues. Although they have one free computer in the lobby for internet (it worked about 90% of the time), it was a drag to have to pay $11-$12 per day for internet access in the room. Seemed that there were a number of 'per day charges' (parking, etc. - which they seemed to waive for us as we are Sheraton club members - bet we did pay about $10/hr 'late check out' charge [it was our choice to stay later, due to a late flight back and they were very up front about the cost]). Although the hotel is right across the road from the airport, we did not notice a lot of airplane noise, which was very surprising.

As such, I booked the Bay Tower to be a little removed from the large conference chaos. The main building is probably a nicer hotel and with more restaurants and facilites, but the Bay Tower served us well. First, room 1188 was VERY spacious, with two queen-sized beds, good closet space and drawers, in-room safe, iron/ironing board, in-room coffee maker, and other amenties typical of a business class hotel. All rooms seem to come with a balcony -- absolutely delightful with morning coffee or a cocktail in the evening. The housekeeping was generally spotless. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and courteous throughout, and there is a concierge desk. This room overlooks the marina (which was lovely) and airport (which we find interesting, and were not at all bothered by any airport noise.) Odd-numbered rooms look over the bay and downtown in the distance. There is a complimentary internet access terminal in the lobby, and (I think) free wireless internet access in the public rooms. While the larger main hotel has larger pools and more restaurants, this place was a nice respite. The Bay Tower pool is large enough to paddle around in, and the facilities were quite nice with chaises and garden plantings. There is also a hot tub. Since it was on the far side of the hotel complex, it seemed less crowded than the main hotel pools (although the pool by the lanai rooms is also less crowded.) It is a reasonably short walk to the main hotel when you want more options for bars and restaurants. There is also an outdoor casual cafe operated by the marina along this walkway for coffee, sandwiches and casual breakfast and meals. You can book various harbor tours, fishing boats, bicycles, etc. in this area, although not part of the hotel operations. The location of the hotel is what you make of it. It is near the airport, with a complimentary shuttle. The hotel is not on the beach, but you can get to many beaches by car. With a car, it is also reasonably convenient to the zoo, Fashion Valley shopping center, etc, with easy access to Hwy 5. Compared to staying downtown, it was reasonably easy to zip around, unless you wanted to be right in the Gaslight Quarter or Old Town, but these areas are still very do-able from this hotel. The hotel provides excellent driving directions to many attractions and interesting areas. Harbor Island is not that large, but provides a nice venue for walks, bike rides, harbor viewing, etc. If you want to be on the beach, the historic Hotel Del Coronado is a lovely place (been there, done that,) but it is often overrun with tourists just walking through. The beach is very nice, and there is much to like about this charming hotel and area (including the hotel shops,) but the Sheraton may be more convenient if you want to get around to the zoo, Sea World, aquarium in La Jolla, hiking in Torrey Pines, etc. You can still go to the beach in Coronado (Imperial) without staying at the hotel. Frankly, if the beach was a priority, going up the coast to La Jolla or Del Mar might also be an option. But if you want a convenient location for general running around, the Sheraton is pretty good. There were some downsides that we could easily overlook. The tub had been re-done, but the covering was peeling. This Bay Tower hotel has very little in the way of a bar or restaurant (it was open at lunch, but often looked closed;) and generally less impressive than the main building. But again, when a large conference is swarming, you might want to be in this somewhat-removed location. The mini-bar has one of those annoying electronic systems. This meant that when we took a bottle of wine out to see what kind it was, we were charged (but the front desk very quickly reversed the charge when we pointed out the problem.) Finally, I still find it annoying when a hotel of this calibre charges for in-room internet access. There is a parking charge of $20 a day for self-park, $26 for valet, but it is reasonably convenient, and there are few hotels around that don't charge for parking in such prime areas. The hotel itself does not have much around it for dining, i.e. very little option to walk to other than hotel dining. However, with a car, much is possible, and/or a quick cab ride away. 'Strongly recommend that you try Miguel's for Mexican in the nearby Shelter Harbor area. You might be the only tourist in the place -- very full of locals. Not far from this restaurant, there is also a Von's and TRader Joe's to supply your excursions. Ask for directions. So: I'd be happy to stay here if a conference booked into this hotel again, or if I was generally touring the area. I can also see it as reasonably convenient for families who wanted to do a lot of touring in the area, assuming the room rate was acceptable. But if I really needed to be on the beach or have a greater number of cafes and shops to visit by walking to them, I'd go elsewhere.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "centralNJ", "Title": "\u201cCareful\u201d", "Author": "shess10", "ReviewID": "UR19010039", "Content": "Booked a 3 night downtown 4 star hotel via Hotwire at the Sheraton.

Many walls had stains and a lot of the furniture was pretty scarred. This was stuff you had to look for, but it was apparent they had made no attempt to cover most of this. I had trouble with my bathroom door not closing tightly. Pretty basic room, modern decor with a comfortable enough bed. I'd recommend not going here, and if you are doing a conference, try to find another place.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbetter than the previous reviews\u201d", "Author": "Astoria1239", "ReviewID": "UR17672435", "Content": "Arrived June 27 and stayed until July 3rd.

Information desk was very helpful and gave us directions to anywhere we were heading. Bartenders nice inside the main hotel. A few minor things for improvements. Walls were a little thin and could hear kids in the next room only one day. One elevator kept breaking down. Bathtubs with mildew around the stopper that needed just a good scrubbing. Club level has one computer for all business people to share. Unfortunately the days I was there, children were always on it making it impossible to check e-mail during my breaks from the convention. 4 computers down in the lobby for everyone else to share and they always were being used. They did give a 30 minute limit. Pool area was clean and perfect temperature. Plenty of chairs so that you did not have to fight for space. Workout room attendant was very nice and the room was clean. Machines seemed in good working order. Beautiful walking paths across the street. The pool does rent rafts for kids and adults and that is a definite plus. Beautiful views front and back of the hotel. Fireplaces outside to sit around in the evening and talk to other guest. Wait staff around pool was slow and bartender for the outdoors could have been a little friendlier. Check out was very smooth and fast. I would definitely stay here again.

The grounds are gorgeous, with flowering trees, palms, fountains. The valet staff, bell man, front desk staff were all very gracious and accommodating. The lobby looks like a palace and there are big pumps of delicious scented lotion in the lobby and huge candles that make the place smell gorgeous during the day - then they light them at night. There's a Starbucks right in the lobby. There is a place to log onto the Internet or connect your laptop for 45 minutes for free, and the computer speed when there were only a few people on-line was lightning quick. It felt very luxurious sitting there checking my e-mail with my Starbucks! Beautiful lanai out back, with rocking chairs, deck chairs, Adirondack chairs to look out over the marina , places to eat your lunch outdoors - plus fire pits at night. The pool is WONDERFUL and there's a jacuzzi pool too. Our room was on the 9th floor with a panoramic view towards the marina and the sunset . King-sized bed and pillows were very comfortable. I've read complaints about airplane noise, but once we slid the balcony door closed, we heard no airplane noise at all and slept like babies. Nice big tub. Very clean room. I loved the mandarin & mint shampoo and lotion! I would warn against opening the mini-bar; of course we knew the snacks were expensive, but didn't realize everything's computerized and motion-sensitive, so when our teenager jokingly picked up the mini-bottles of booze, the charges went right onto our bill. Although - the front desk staff removed the charges with a smile when we explained. You also are warned not to put any personal items into the fridge - again the motion dectectors will know you did it, and there's a $25 charge. Checkout was at 12:00, but our flight was not til 5:00pm, so we asked if we could stay a little longer. We were granted a 1:00pm checkout, plus after that, you can leave all your luggage and even your purse with the bellman, and go use the pool for as long as you like, without needing a room key. We took the dry cleaning bags for our wet suits to put in our suitcases later. There is a spa/fitness room where they'll give you all the swim towels you want and give you a place to change back into your dry clothes - and I have to mention: the \"restroom\" in the spa was amazing. Scented candles, and cupboards full of lotions, hair products, razors, deodorant, robes and slippers, the works! - for guests. There is also a steam room and of course a shower area and lockers. What a great way to wait for our flight! When you are poolside, there's a litlte cabana that rents big, fun floaties for $7/hr, and sells sunscreen, waterproof cameras, etc. . There is a fresh-water cooler for free, plus there are staff who walk around very courteously asking if you want to order drinks and/or lunch, which you can enjoy right there in the sun. A little cheaper place to eat: Just a 2-minute walk to the left side of the marina is a little sandwich/burger shop right on the dock that sells sundries and some groceries, probably for boaters who need to restock. They have great ice cream and are very polite and friendly. Places to sit inside and outside. This hotel could not have been more heavenly. We got a great deal on [--] (around $125 for the one night, one king-sized bed plus a roll-away bed for $15 for our son).

My wife booked it as it was lots cheaper than whatever else she found. I'm not sure what it cost, but will keep that factored in for the review. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which is a good walk from the Marina Tower. The rooms were not too small (I heard they are bigger than in the Marina Tower), but not what you would call large, either. There was a very comfortable king bed, tv, table, sofa, dresser in the room. Ironing board, coffee maker (single serve packets - they had 3 each day for us), and in-room safe were the amenities. There was a small balcony that you could sit on. In our case, we had a beautiful view of the airport to enjoy. You coul definitely hear them taking off every few minutes if the door was open. If the balcony door was closed, it was very hard to hear the planes. Room service pricing was reasonable, food was average. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Bay Tower has a small gift shop, medium sized restaurant (seemed to be dinner only), and conference rooms. The lobby was not welcoming, and if you didn't order room serrvice, then you are a hungry person. You can hike over to the Marina Tower, which definitiely has a nicer lobby. On the way to the Marina Tower, you will pass a small coffee shop with sandwiches and muffins (if you need a quick bite and dont want to hike all the way to the other tower). The Marina Tower lobby has a restaurant, sports bar, gift shop, wireless area and lounge. This lobby is decently appointed (much better than the bay tower). You can rent boats and seadoos just outside the marina tower. Overall, this is a decent hotel if you are looking for a relaxing trip, and the room is just to sleep or hang out in. I would recommend the marina tower for the lobby and its facilities over the bay tower, although i hear the rooms are smaller in the marina tower. We drove from L.A., and that airport frontage road is a real bear to navigate through to the hotel from the freeway. Getting out from the hotel to downtown San Diego was a real time killer. On the other hand, getting to Sea World or the harbor was pretty easy. If you are going for a value-based weekend, then this hotel might be okay with you.

Before arriving, none of us had a clue that the two hotels are entirely separate, and a good distance away. (Walkable but not fun in high heels for the conference events.) Although directly across from the airport, I never had an issue hearing planes inside my room. The Marina Tower building is the very large building you'll see on the hotel website. The lobby was very nice, receptionists very helpful. The rooms on this side varied - I saw one room on the lanai side which was kind of hidden at the very end of the hotel, and set up like a motel with the doors all facing an inner, outdoor courtyard. That room smelled very strongly of smoke (this is a non-smoking hotel room) and was dark and a bit run down looking. My own room was on the 10th floor, view was just OK - alot of the views are of the neighboring Coast Guard area or the airport, not exactly the beautiful marina and harbor you might be expecting. The room was clean, furniture a bit warn. The rooms over at the Bay Tower are larger (30% according to the front desk clerk) but the views aren't necessarily better. These rooms seemed newer and cleaner, with a Tommy Hillfiger type of atmostphere - lots of red and blue in the rooms. To anyone planning a large conference - don't dare let them stick your conference in that giant \"Pavilion\" room - it's a tent. A giant tent. With no bathrooms. And you'll hear every single plane and Coast Guard helicopter, every couple of minutes. People in the back of the tent could hear nothing at all. Add to that the wind blowing the whole thing the entire time, it literally sounded as though people were banging pots and pans outside the tent while speakers attempted to finish their speeches.

Again, the view is great and the gym is excellent and their staff is so pleasant (you should move them to the front desk!!). Now the real reason for the negative review... FIRST, the parking here is horrible! There is one lot that is closest to the hotel which seemed to be closed for the whole 2 weeks! There are a couple of cars parked there and there is no construction. So you have to park out in a dirt lot and walk through a dimly lit parking lot to get to the hotel. It's worse that there was a huge conference going on, so you have even less parking! Half the lot is used by valet parking and is NEVER full!

SECOND, I had the same problem as one of the previous guests with the smoke smell. I came back to my room one night and there was a VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke in my room. I opened the balcony thinking maybe it was there, but it wasn't from outside. I called down and security came up and said that it was probably someone walking by a vent smoking and it came into my room. Isn't the hotel non-smoking??? And it didn't go away and they told me that if I could see a guest smoking that I can report it...so should I have gone knocking on all the doors hoping to catch someone in the act?? It never got better, so they moved me to another room....exactly what I wanted to do...pack up my things at 10pm and change rooms! THIRD, the rooms are very tired. For such an expensive room, you expect better than 2-star hotel quality. The sink backed up constantly and even worse when you could hear another room running water it would come up in our sink! FOURTH, there was a big party going on one Friday night down in the parking lot tent...no problem, but if I close my windows I shouldn't feel the whole room shaking on the 12th floor! I called down to see when it would stop and they said midnight! I went down to ask if they could maybe turn the bass down...no chance, but there were 2 employees at the desk. As I walked off, one said to the other in a short tone, \"What did she want? She's already called down once about that.\" Wouldn't you think that after a long week of work that you should be able to sleep before midnight? I think this will definitely be my last stay at this hotel. I am a Starwood fan, but this one does NOT fit the standards of even their lower star hotels! I am going to have to switch to another brand when staying in San Diego from now one so that I don't have to write another one of these reviews!", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, CA", "Title": "\u201cCaveat emptor (let the buyer beware)\u201d", "Author": "RPLLtravel", "ReviewID": "UR14993239", "Content": "I travel several times a year to medical conferences. My husband and I selected this property because we wanted to take our dog along and I wanted it to be in proximity to the hotel that was hosting the conference. This place was bad enough that we might have to leave the dog at home next time! First, the buildings are tired and decrepit. There was a crack in the sink, the light fixture in the bathroom took two or three minutes to warm up enough to provide light, and one of the bedside lamps required a phone call to maintenance on our first night there. Some of the staff were nice enough, but several were downright surly. When my husband went back to the front desk to find out why we were only given a AAA discount for one night of our stay and why we had been charged twice for one movie, the desk clerk tried to rescind the discount for the one night we had received it! We did have a nice, albeit expensive meal seated out on the patio behind the lobby. However, none of the staff could figure out how to light the propane heaters during our meal so I had to go into the gift shop and buy a jacket for each of us for dinner. There is a charge for the internet in your room and for parking. Corporate America's mantra these days seems to be to hook you with the promise of cheap prices and then burn you once you commit. In Corporate America's mind, the old bait and switch still works. Charging $20/day for a guest to park at your hotel is an outrage. What did they think? That we wouldn't be bringing a car? Tell us the real price of staying at your hotel and charge us that price and then we'll leave satisfied. However, tell us one price, load on the extra charges and we're not likely to return. It must be something about the Starwood properties...I haven't had a very good experience with any of them. I should have stuck with my initial plan of staying at the Omni downtown.

Second my husband was speaking at a conference there at the hotel. I should of know at that time this will be an interesting stay. It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They don\u2019t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the \"new\" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hord\u2019oeuvres and breakfast. That was really nice of them but we had dinner and breakfast at the conference provided for us. I don\u2019t think this was fair but what else you are going to do except let everyone else know that it may look clean but know this hotel has a problem with cockroaches and let others make the decision to stay here.

A few points: - Someone else's dry-cleaning was put into my room. - There were divots on the toilet seat & shower and the faucets were installed backwards - Stains on the bathrooms walls & splashes on the coffeemaker - The curved shower rod made the bathroom door unable to open all the way, so you'd sit on the toilet with the door between your knees - Deep creases in the bedspread. The bed was so poorly made, it was almost as bad as if I had made it! - The iron was so worn that you could not tell the setting The good parts were the Starbucks and Tazo tea that were provided (intermittently). Beware the long line at Starbucks in the morning, especially if there is a conference in the hotel. The free shuttle from the airport was another nice feature. It really was a peculiar stay: far away from San Diego proper, odd room, extraordinarily loud lobby with a strong perfume scent.

As others have pointed out, this hotel is very isolated. It would definitely not be my first choice if I were in San Diego on vacation. The cab ride into town is about $12 each way. That adds a hefty price to the cost of a meal. We took the cab on the first night but then explored Harbor Island on foot the second day. There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other.

The advantage to being so close to the airport is also a major disadvantage with the noise factor. And as mentioned by other reviewers, the low flying frequent helicopters in the area were quite disturbing, especially if you tried to walk outside to enjoy the marina. I stayed in the east tower and was given a room on the first floor with a parking lot view! I was foolish not to ask for a better room, thinking that it wouldn't matter since I would be in meetings the majority of my time. Little did I know that the hotel would be the site of several wedding receptions that went late into the night. Imagine trying to sleep with the sound of loud celebrants outside my window, car fobs continually chirping as people returned to their cars, and car alarms going off without end! The room was well worn and partially for that reason didn't seem quite clean. I did appreciate the coffee maker in the room, but since it only brews one cup at a time, I can only imagine the negotiations that must go on between couples for the first cup! This hotel also boasts their huge internet center in the lobby. They have about 8 to 10 computers, but that is not helpful when all but 2 of them have \"Out of Order\" signs on them. I desperately wanted to print my airplane boarding pass since I had an early flight, but the 2 working computers were being monopolized by people that felt no sense of courtesy. Yes, there is a Starbucks inside the hotel. No, they will not honor any Starbucks gift cards that you may have. I did not dine in any of the restaurants, but the meals prepared for the the conference were wonderful. My room didn't have any hotel information books or maps so I have no idea how many restaurants were available or what they offered. I did consider room service one evening, but when I couldn't locate any menus, I gave up and bought a pastry from Starbucks. I was concerned because my return flight left at 6:30AM. I inquired and was told the Hotel Airport Shuttle would start running at 5:00AM, stopping at the other tower before heading to the airport. This concerned me because I am accustomed to flying out of Atlanta and you really need to allow time to get through long waits at security. I arrived to check out at 4:40AM. Although my room was covered, I always like to be sure that nothing has been put on my credit card. There was a gentleman checking out ahead of me and he was having huge issues. He went back and forth with the receptionist. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a Hotel Airport Shuttle pull up, load 2 passengers and take off! I looked at my watch and it was 4:50AM! The gentleman behind me looked at me and we both screamed in unison! Another shuttle arrived shortly after 5:00AM, and I climbed on not a minute too soon! All of us thought that since every seat was full that we would go straight to the airport and not stop at the other tower. WRONG!!! Can you believe that we had to try and load more passengers (who had to stand) and their luggage on an already filled to the max shuttle?? By this time I was so nervous that I was going to miss my flight, especially since we had to stop and unload passengers at each terminal. Mine was last. I really prefer to write good, positive reviews, but I appreciate the people that share their unpleasant experiences also. Maybe this will help someone make a better plan.

Frankly I'm amazed at how high it rates on TripAdvisor. Either the staff is being paid to write trumped up reviews or the folks who visit this hotel just don't get out much. For reference, I was in the East (main) tower. On the positive, the restaurant and bar side of the house did a superb job. The food was great and the wine list was even better. That's where the positive comments end. First, the location. For someone visiting San Diego, you either want to be downtown where the action is, or far enough out that you can get free parking and drive to the local attractions. The Sheraton has neither. It's not walking distance to ANYTHING. Someone in the elevator who did have a car commented that the valet charge was $29/day. Further on location, forget having a quite night's sleep here. To the north is Lindberg Field. To the Southwest is North Island, a major US Navy air station. To the Southeast is the main Coast Guard station. Between the civil, military, and coastguard planes and helecopters there's almost no time of the day when there isn't a loud drone or roar occuring with great frequency. My room was small and old. The fixtures in the bathroom were at least 30 years old and one of the tiles in the floor was completely detatched - I could have dug it out with a pocket knife. Bathroom fan - forget it. The sliding door to my balcony fit so poorly that wind blew freely into the room. The noise from the aformentioned aircraft combined with the drone of the air condition units that my room overlooked made sleep an impossibility. One of the few redeeming features might have been the Starbucks. I went in one morning and ordered a Syrup Cream - a fairly standard menu item. The people working there didn't have a clue what I was talking about. When I pointed out that it was a standard Starbucks menu item, they pointed at their menu board and managed to get out enough broken english to tell me that they only knew how to make what was on that board - nothing else. As for process and procedure - the hotel was pittiful. Hotel guide book (binder) in my room was so incomplete it was all but useless. It gave menus for the main restaurant, but not the other two. There was no map of the complex so for the third restaurant that was in the west tower, I didn't even know what it was or where it was. It mentioned the pool, but didn't give the hours. When I pointed these items out to the concierge (two of them on two different locations), I was given the same stupid response - \"Perhaps they did it that way because they want you to come down and interact with us!\".", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "State College PA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel.

First off, this property is ooooold compared to other major hotels in the San Diego area, the rooms in the marina tower are tiny and the while the front desk tries their best to trick you into staying at the Bay Towers (about 1/2 mile away) where the rooms are supposed to be 30% bigger, those rooms are even OLDER (if you can believe it). It's like stepping into a run down 1980's movie set. And while the rooms are bigger, the furniture size didn't increase and the room is poorly laid out so that you have big blank spaces of wall and carpet where there really should have been something else. First floors in the Bay Towers where I got shunted too (after expressing obtaining a reservation for the Marina Towers) faced the parking lot so any crazy person could just cross from the parking lot into your room if you left the balconey door open. Surprisingly enough someone in the conference said that the hotel cleaning staff or room service had come in, unlocked the balconey door and not fully closed the front door - how scary is that??!!! Front desk was rude too - when I pointed out that I had PAID for a reservation for the Marina Towers she said - sorry they had given up my room and there was no choice. I wasn't late or anything for check in. I was shocked! Parking at the Marina Towers is a bit nuts if there is a conference in town, they are doing some sort of construction on the parking lot (what I'm not sure - since i never saw anyone actually doing anything) but it's basically a dusty dirt lot with very NARROW parking spaces. There is not enough parking in the self lot (again if conference in town which usually there is), so you see lots of cars just circling around stalking people. Also it's not a very close walk from the self parking lot to the Marina towers. The parking at Bay Towers is a lot better - but then you're away from all the action. There is no gift shop yet at the bay towers (they're building it) and I didn't remember seeing any business center either - remember everything is really headquartered at Marina Towers. The good news at both towers. 1) Noise - while you're pretty much right next to the airport the noise inside your room is pretty much not there 2) Parking - it's $20 but for in and out privileges so that's not too bad for hotel parking.

Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, \"all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee.\" We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads \"For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically.\" However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A \"Smart Office\" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet.

In general, we were very pleased with the hotel. From the outside, it looked very nice. It was very close to the airport, so that was convenient as well. We did frequently see and hear planes going overhead every few minutes. It didn't bother us at all, but others might be more sensitive to that. The plane noise never disturbed us during the night either. The hotel room was nice. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The rug seemed a little bit worn, but that wasn't a big deal. We had a balcony over looking the pool area. In the evening, they often had hot cider in the lobby. I thought that was a nice touch. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the computer availability. It was great that they offered free internet use, however, they only had about 6 computers for hundreds of guests. Most of the time they weren't even all in service. That was frustrating! Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was clean, conveniently located, and affordable.

The continental breakfast that is one of the \"Club Level\" perks was great - no complaints and pretty much a real breakfast. We paid $105 per night on Priceline for the hotel. If you are staying in San Diego for an extended period of time/vacation, I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel, just because of the location. You can't really walk to anything, and if you are running around the city, cab fare would probably add up.

I was here for a conference at the hotel, so didn't have to worry about traveling away from the hotel. On the positive, the shuttle from the airport to the hotel went fine. It was only when I got to the hotel.... First, the guy who checked me in didn't ask what kind of room I needed and I ended up in a room with 2 small beds rather than 1 king. That's the least bothersome aspect of my experience, but still slightly annoying considering everything else. When I got to my room (which was in a great location overlooking the pool and marina) I searched high and low to find the information binder so I knew how late the restaurants and pool were open. I finally called the front desk to ask for one, and the one I got had whole sections missing! They must not pay attention to these things.... I also asked for my desk chair to be replaced because the chair was so gross I didn't want to sit on it. The seat and back were full of stains and other grime, and there was grime on the armrests. Gross. The housekeeping lady gave me a little hassle about the request, but ultimately got me a new chair, which was slightly less gross than the first one. I did find out how late the pool and hot tube were open, by the way. The hot tub was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the nasty smell of cigerette butts all over the ground around the tub took much away from the experience. The shower also wasn't great. The shower head was old and difficult to change the stream. The string that goes across the shower to hang wet clothes was completely missing. My final complaint: who hangs mirrors (or other glass) over the bed in an earthquake zone?????? I've only been living in an earthquake zone (San Francisco) for less than 2 years, but even I know better! Bottom line: The hotel is decent, and at first glance the room is nice. And the room was quiet, which is definitely important. However, I think what makes a nice hotel (especially for business travel) is paying attention to the details. This hotel does not pay attention to the details, and the overall experience of staying here reflects that.

It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller \"lanai\" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night.

It's almost like these travelers were staying at a different hotel... My husband and I took our two kids (12 & 14) for a 6 night stay at the beginning of July. We love San Diego, and this was our 4th stay at The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. My 14 year old son chose to return here for his Middle school graduation gift as he & his sister always have a great time. I had actually contacted the hotel in response to the general---We looking forward to seeing you--- email that you receive after booking on the Hotel website. I addressed the email to Robert Cartwright, the Hotel's General Manager telling him that we would be returning and the reason for our visit, and to request a Marina/pool view room. I had booked a Club Level room in the East Tower as we truly enjoy the Club Lounge and the great views that it offers. I actually prefer the rooms over in the West Tower as they are larger, have a bigger balcony and I like their nautical theme, but there is no Club Level in the West Tower. After sending the email with my room request, I received a l reply from Mr. Cartwright.I was truly impressed by this very personal touch, but that was just the beginning! I checked in at the Starwood Preferred Guest check- in area, while my family waited outside with the car. I was told that we had a 2 rooms reserved for six nights, and I said there must be some mistake as I had actually only reserved one room. As it turns out, Mr. Cartwright really took great care of us. He gave us 2 adjoining rooms on the 9th floor, and while the 9th floor is not on the Club Level as I had reserved, the rooms are basically the same and we still had access to the Club Lounge. My kids were over the moon that they got there own room! It truly made our stay so much more comfortable to have that extra space for the week. We were also given complimentary valet parking for the duration of our stay! Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, of course after this special treatment I am going to give the hotel a great review, but if you knew me you would know that would not alter my judgment in anyway. It wasn\u2019t just the way that Mr. Cartwright made us all feel that made this such a great trip, but also many other members of the staff, from the front desk, to the wait staff, the concierge desk, the valet parking staff and bell hops, the gym staff, the bartenders, even the housekeeping and maintenance personnel. Every single hotel employee that we encountered were happy, friendly and truly accommodating people. And in my opinion, it is the people that are employed by a hotel that truly make a difference between a wonderful hotel stay and a so-so experience. You can be in the most luxurious hotel suite, in the most incredible location, but if the service and hospitality are not 5 star you are not going to be happy! We never had a bad meal at the hotel. The kids loved room service and food from Shoreline. the poolside restaurant. My husband and I liked Tapatini, and we all liked the Sunday brunch at Harbor\u2019s Edge. Some meals we charged to the room and some we paid cash for so the hotel bill didn\u2019t feel quite so bad at the end of our stay. But like the MasterCard commercials say \u201cQuality time with your family, Priceless!\u201d We took some great walks along the harbor in the morning, but my favorite part of the day was sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine just gazing at the sunset over the marina. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone just based on the staff alone. We will definitely be returning to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina on our next trip to San Diego. p.s. Another wonderful thing about this and many other hotels in the Starwood hotel group is that they welcome small dogs; but please if you are going to bring along your pet, only do so if you can trust your pet to be well behaved, that it won\u2019t make a \u201cmess\u201d in the room, won\u2019t bark at all hours and you as the dog\u2019s caretaker take full responsibility for cleaning up after their walks.

Particularly a guy named Steve working at the Shoreline resteraunt. That guy had the whole place smiling and laughing. The Harbor Inn Resteraunt breakfasts were some of the best Ive had in awhile. Quinns was excellent. The best martinis and the food was great. The room was perfect maid service perfect. The ladies at the Concierge Desk were the most polite people I think Ive ever met! They were such a great help! Overall, my girlfriend and I could not believe the outstanding service that we were experiencing for 6 DAYS IN A ROW. Everyone of the employees was so nice from the gyms guy giving me towels to the wait staff at Harbor Inn to the front desk. Even the security officers asked us if we were alright and needed anything.

This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes.

Still decent, but not nearly as nice. The room was spacious and comfortable, decorated in a nautical theme, which was fitting, but the bathroom was tiny, the towels coarse, and the pillows old and lumpy (glad we brought our own).

On both nights I was awakened by the blinking light, so I call only for them to say they were sorry. It was annoying to say the least and if you are going to keep calling, at least get it right and remove the charges for the internet (that we reserved in the first room) but were unable to use in the second room without me having to continually remind you. I feel the service feature of the call was poorly handled and was really more of a procedural annoyance than a measure to ensure my true satisfaction.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "The World", "Title": "\u201cFour stars?

I read the reviews before going (tagging along for a cheap vacation to San Diego) so I had my expectations set low on what appeared to be a place that gouges for everything. I wasn't disappointed. We rented a car for 2 days so we could get around for 2 days on our own. If you stay at this hotel, you either need a car or get taxis if you want to get away from the hotel. We valeted the car for literally 1 hour when we checked in. Then we went back out for dinner and then self-parked the car overnight. When we got the hotel bill at the end, they of course were charging us $24/night for the entire stay (i.e. valet price for 4 nights). My husband on checkout told them we only had a rental car for 2 days and valeted the car for an hour and self-parked overnight. The 'resolution' to this apparently was to charge us ONLY for 2 nights of self parking. It was my husband's company paying the bill so I stayed out of it, but if my money was paying for this, I would have argued more at the front desk. That was the only mistake on the bill we had. The room we got on checkin had double sized beds and we requested king size bed and had to pay an extra $50/night for that. That bumped us up to the Club level room and gave us a city view which was nice. We got free contential breakfast and evening horderves and free internet for that $50 as well. The breakfast was nice (but they normally charge $12/head for it which again was nuts when no hot food was included). The horderves was also normally charged $12/head and again, was not worth the price. It was nice, but we got there one night during the last 45 minutes of it and hardley anything was left and they didn't refill anything. I rented a bike one day (which was $7/hour) and it was nice (a way to get some exercise and away from the hotel). The pool was outside and kind of chilly to go into so didn't get to try it out. I would never stay here if I was paying with my own money. They overcharge for everything and its obvious they know most people staying here don't care cause an expense account is probably paying the bill.

I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer. I guess in this situation the old adage, \"you get what you pay for\" holds true.

As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an \"upgraded\" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened! Yuck! I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel.

I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room.

The hotel is located on Harbour Island and comprised of 2 towers: the East Tower being the larger and original tower; the West Tower being the smaller but newer tower. After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars. Check in - I arrived at 11am on an early flight in and was expecting to have to stow my luggage in storage until the standard check-in time of 3pm. They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar.

We rented a sailboat out of the Harbor very near the Sheraton. The plan was to go to dinner after sailing and spend a nice evening at the Sheraton. A friend of mine had worked there for years when it was called the Sheraton Grande. I attended her wedding there years ago and it was lovely. Apparently they hotel forgot to upgrade. We only spent one night, but believe me that was enough. It was difficult to book only one night, Saturday night. So when I got a rate of $259.00, I took it. The hotel is an older style and must be at least 45 years old. The ceilings are not very high and the lobby is modest for a Sheraton. Approaching the front entrance, loud pop music was playing. Almost like the hotel was going for a Las Vegas feeling. Our room was modest and it appeared all the rooms had a nautical theme, which was fine. The room had a magnificint view of The San Diego Bay. The trouble started when we found our room and noticed we were located closed to the elevator. The hotel being so old, every time the elevator went up or down, we heard it. When the elevator stopped on our floor, a bell rung. That was't a problem until we wanted to get some sleep. We went to bed about 11:30 p.m. but did not sleep. Apparently there were three or four funtions at the hotel. From around 12:00 until 2:15 a.m. the functions ended and throngs of people got in the elevator and went back to their rooms. When they stopped on our floor, the bell would ding and drunk loud guests would proceed to exit the elevator and yell and sing right at our door. I woke up at least ten times. At 2:00 am, we almost packed our bags and went home, since we live locally. The Hotel is so old, you can hear when anyone in the area flushed their toilet. The toilet sounded like an airplane toilet, does the job great but you'll know the habits of everyone in rooms around you. If you can avoid the hotel do it.

They take your bags to your room, you have no say in this. We were there four nights for the conference and the only complaints I can come up with are the food prices are outrageous for breakfast. If you are preparred to spend $20 for three little kids to have a bagel and share a juice, then no worries. Room service for kids for dinner is EXCELLENT. They have $5 - $6 choices ranging from burgers, quesadillas to chicken nuggets. It was great. The pool and landscaping is so beautiful. You will enjoy your surroundings. My only other complaint is the odd behavior of some staff. MANY times we had knockings on our door, only to have an employee quickly open our door (before time even allowed us to get to the door) and they would pop their head in to see if anyone was there. (Not good if you're in the shower) Always with a weird excuse too. One person was holding bottled water, seeing if we needed replenished. (at $4 a bottle, no thanks) And doesn't housekeeping note these things when they come through???? Another employee came in with a clipboard. When I asked what he wanted, he stated \"never mind\" and left. Another woman entered with two towels draped over her arm. (Again, doesn't housekeeping do this?) We were beginning to put it together that they knew there was a hotel full of conference attending folks who wouldn't be in their rooms and the employyees were going around swiping things.

The staff was cold, corporate and unhelpful (except for the bell boys... they were pleasant). We'll never come back to Sheraton/Starwood brand hotel again after this experience.

We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger \"main\" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The \"main\" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids.

A definite mixed bag. First, keep in mind that this property is really 2 different hotels about a quarter mile apart.

The west wing (which the bellboy said used to be a Westin) is undergoing extensive renovation, or was when we were there. This was a problem for just about everybody -- guests, workers and hotel staff. At one point only one elevator was working, and much of the property was off-limits. To their credit, the hotel staff seemed to keep a positive and sympathetic attitude. Some guests seemed pretty put out. We actually didn't have a problem and since we were paying a discounted priceline rate, some of the irritants were easy to overlook. In fact, once the renovations are complete, this may be a better spot than the larger east wing. We loved our room with a great view of the bay and downtown San Diego. Cruise ships, yachts, fishing boats, kayakers...they all swept right by our balcony. Lots of joggers and walkers on the path by the bay too. The room was freshly remodeled... brand new, really...but not especially luxurious. Odd things were missing too -- like a lamp by the seating area (you couldn't read there at night) and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Pretty slim for a 4-star property. More like a 3-star.

Also, the hotel is not located near any trolley line or public transportation which is an ideal way to get around downtown San Diego.

My family of four just completed a 10 day California coast vacation which ended with two nights in the West Tower, 7/28 and 7/29. We loved it. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the marina and the airport. Terrific view. Personally, I love to watch the planes take off. But, since there was very little airplane activity between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., we were able to sleep with the balcony door open and let the cool, fresh San Diego air into the room. The noise was not a problem. We did not use the West Tower pool, but the kids loved the pool at the East Tower with its volley ball net and basketball hoop. Yes, it's a 5 minute walk from one tower to the next, but it's along a beautiful marina. What's not to like about that? A lot of reviewers have complained about the parking situation. Well, our room key did not work in the parking lot the first night, but the attendant was very helpful and let us out without a problem. I got another key from the front desk the next morning and it worked fine. I saw it as a very minor inconvenience. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. With all of the great restaurants in San Diego, why would you want to? Take the short drive to Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter, or Old Town. We did have breakfast at the deli along the marina one morning and it was fine.

I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina.
