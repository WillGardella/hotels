At this price, there are much better options in Paris, especially considering how small and basic the rooms are. 2) Internet: that is the biggest joke.... Wifi has never worked properly in this hotel. There has not been a single time I was there when wifi has worked properly. The argument is always the same (all with a smile, at least): we have tried, we have changed ISP...we will reinitialise the router...But the result is that wifi is totally unreliable - it works for 2 minutes, then nothing for the next 20 minutes (mornings seem to be a bit better). So if you are on a business trip, forget about this hotel 3) Breakfast: the breakfast is supposed to be until 11 am on Sunday. However during my last stay, at 10:30 am there was no table available. The receptionist (in a friendly way, admittedly) quickly fixed that, but then I realized that... there was almost no food left. At the price of 12 Euro....

On arrival I discovered my request was ignored and I was given room 101 on the first floor next to the fire exit. On the 5th day of my stay I went for a light breakfast at about 7.30am and returned to my room at 8.15am for further rest. At about 8.15am to my surprise I heard noise pertaining to the nature of banging pipes, scraping of walls, drilling and men talking. This noise emanated from the fire exit next to my room. The following morning the noise occurred again. The noise was such that I started to feel distress and decided to see the manager Benoit [-], Director General and the front of desk staff (Alex) who seemed to collude with each other. First Alex looked unbothered about what I saying, then he claimed not to be aware of works being carried out, and then he refused to come and listen because he claimed the hotel was fully booked and he couldn\u2019t leave the reception area. I returned to the reception area a second time and spoke to Alex because the persistent noise wouldn\u2019t allow me to relax or sleep. This time he told me the banging I could hear was from the central heating. I was so distressed by this time that I took my complaint to the Manager (Benoit [-], Directeur General) who appeared to be very arrogant. He told me the noise I heard was coming from another hotel, and then he admitted there was noise coming from the Hotel but it did not start until 9.15 am. The manager was not present when the noise was occurring on the 5th and 6th day. I never received an apology. I had to insist for the manager to come to my room and witness the noise, only then was I moved to another room. When I asked the manager for the owner\u2019s details he told me no he deals with all the complaints. This was my second and will be the last time I stay at le 20 Prieure Hotel.

I've had a second home in Nimes for 18 years, so I'm used to banks, hospitals and shops ignoring complaints and failing to respond to criticism. The customer in France is only king when expressing appreciation.
