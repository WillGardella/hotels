At first I had a room that I didn't know it was a triple. I was on my own and that space was probably just enough for me! Furniture and bathroom very modern, a big shower. It all depends on the kind of trip you're doing. I won't suggest it for sure to people coming from the opposite side of the world, with big heavy luggage as there's not even space where to put them. It could be fine for a couple staying for a few days only, for a weekend, expecting not be able to walk around the room!!! Kitchenette is fine for 2 people, to have something light, to have breakfast. The triple studio has got a full double bed+a single bed pushed together. The double studio has a bed which is slightly smaller than a double. It's about 74 inches long so be ready to have your feet out at night. Drafts of air passing through the window but you can low the curtain and usually rooms are warm enough even if heating doesn't seem to work properly. In the first studio the heating control panel displayed EE, that, written just below it, meant there was an error. Same thing for the second studio, but the one in the bathroom was not working in this case. BUT, as I already wrote the room was always warm enough. A lot of soap and towels provided such as glasses and dishes etc... Fast Wifi also provided even if when it was out of order and I just went to ask the secretary if she knew it was having problems she didn't even look at me saying that nobody complained about it..... Same thing when the lift was temporary stuck on floor 1 as I have been waiting for a while, she just told me that probably somebody was getting off on that floor. She didn't care at all. If you have problems try to talk with the man that is at reception, much worthed!!!! Good good location, just a few steps from 3 lines of tube and from beautiful Hyde Park. Last problem could be that the fire system works in all building, in each single room. So each time some smoke reaches it in any way, you'll have to wake up and run downstairs and nothing happens....I think fire system is very useful but this way I had to run 3 times, twice at half past midnight and once at 9 in the morning. Annoying if you're sleeping.

Everynight we would have to turn on the water, wait for 5 minutes before any water would come out and for it to warm up. As for the bed, it's a really really cheap bed and very uncomfortable. First two nights, I couldn't fall asleep because of that. Also another weird thing is that the hotel room does not even have a phone. Which hotel in the 21st century does not have a telephone???

First of all, they double booked us. We had left a 2 bedroom apartment to move over to 39 suites to stay in a different part of London for the 2nd week of our stay. We booked the 1 bedroom apartment at 39 suites 2 days before we left through late rooms and I left my mobile number in the comments field for them to please call me if there were any problems. I heard nothing. So, we turned up with our copious amount of luggage in a taxi and my husband spent a good hot and sweaty 5-10 mins unpacking it onto the porch at number 39. I went into reception- which is situated at number 43 next door holding the baby and trying to contain the 3 year old. The taxi left. I was then informed that it was a computer mistake, they didn\u2019t know why and it wasn\u2019t their fault and there was nothing they could do. Blank \u201cwe don\u2019t give a cr*p\u201d looks. They also used the language barrier (they were all Polish or something similar) as an excuse for not helping. I was nearly in tears as we were a family with 2 young children in the middle of London a long way from home (Australia) and she was basically telling me \u201csorry you have to go elsewhere\u201d. I think as I looked so upset (and also mentioned \u201ctrip advisor\u201d) they decided they could get us a room that was big enough for us after all... a suite. However it was too small to fit the cot and the luggage in as well as the double and single beds. So no good! So then they said we could have (reluctantly) a room in their \u201cnew apartments\u201d on Inverness terrace (number 43), which were \u201cmuch nicer and bigger\u201d and you can walk there. Yeah right. We had so much luggage after travelling the UK for 6 weeks (this was our last few days before flying out of Heathrow when we checked out)... and the children to carry and even though it was the next street, we still had to pay a fortune to cab it over there and ask the cab driver to help us again to unload. Luckily a cab pulled up outside to drop some other poor visitor off and I asked him to move us over. I must say that there was no offer of financial help with the taxi or a refund at any time during our stay for their mistake and all the things that happened next.... In fact our credit card was CHARGED (with no consent from us) an extra 55 pounds for checking out at 2pm instead of 12pm on the day we left, as we were madly trying to pack to go to Heathrow and had the kids to look after and just weren\u2019t organised. We didn\u2019t want to stay there until 2pm (we had hoped to get out and do something else in London )\u2013 so it wasn\u2019t done on purpose \u2013 but they insisted on charging us as there was someone checking in. I doubt that very much as the room they had put us into wasn\u2019t even ready for visitors to stay in! So on that last day, I was in tears from the stress as they kept ringing about how late we were and to hurry up (both children were unhappy and crying) and on the last call they said they were going to charge us for taking so long to leave. All this after we didn\u2019t get into the room until half a day late on that first day - due to them! We didn\u2019t bother to complain, just tried to forget the stress and stay out a lot (that was why we were there after all). The new room was just as small but brand new. So new in fact that the bathroom tiles weren\u2019t finished and none of the appliances fitted. The promised WIFI wasn\u2019t being installed until a later date and we had workmen checking the electrics etc. We had pots and pans but alas, no cooktop! We had a small fridge and a kettle, but no microwave or washer (we had paid for all these things originally as we had a baby and bottles to organise) PLUS a breakfast every day that wasn\u2019t available at this new address! When we were refused extra pillows \u2013 I had taken two pillows from the empty guest room next door as my request had been ignored and we only had one each...then they had been taken back by the cleaner - it was the final straw and I rang and tried to complain. However it turned into a messy shouting match as I had to ring there on my mobile phone as the room phone wasn\u2019t yet connected to reception \u2013 and so I asked them to please call me back. They were VERY rude about it and when they called back I tried to explain nicely why I had asked them to call back (mobile charges/phone in room not connected etc) but the receptionist just didn\u2019t (wouldn\u2019t) get it and it turned into a horrible \u201cwe don\u2019t understand, are you complaining about the phone???\u201d idiotic conversation. I finally got somebody else on the line and tried to explain I just wanted some pillows (!!!) and when she said NO, this is not something we provide, I really did lose it... I said how we were easy going Aussies and didn\u2019t normally like to complain, but this was the final straw after everything they had put us through and how we had just wasted a day at a Laundrette and an Internet Cafe as these services were not provided after we had paid for them, but the new person was just as rude and ignorant and told me to email her manager and tried to give me the email address! I ended up shouting at her in frustration, \u201cbut we have no internet here!!!\u201d .... again she kept using the language barrier as an excuse to be rude \u2013 and I hung up the phone in tears again. On the day of check out I tried to explain that we needed more time but was told we couldn\u2019t have it. I asked what we could do with our luggage until we had to leave for Heathrow and she said nothing. So it became very very stressful. Finally my husband rang back and she was very nice and said Ogh yes your wife asked me earlier and I didn;t understand. You can leave your luggage here at number 43. So she had thought about how rude she was to me , but my husband couldn\u2019t face trying to get it all around to the next street, or paying for a cab to take it only to get it later, so we ended up taking a chance and leaving it at the bottom of the stairs. There was no elevator (as we were told there would be when accepting the room). I can honestly say the second half of our stay in London was ruined by their rude attitude and lack of care for our situation. There was much more that happened but I am upset even just writing this and think I have written enough to give you an idea... At one time I actually said \u201cyou are so rude I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d... they just honestly did not care. If you wonder why we didn\u2019t move... it was because there was no way they would give us a refund as their attitude was that we had got it cheap already through late rooms and so we should just put up with it all and be grateful.... we had actually extended our flights and paid for that to stay 5 days longer in London and so just decided to put up and shut up \u2013 just as they wanted us to... But I seriously believe I almost have post traumatic stress from these people, so please, save yourself the heartache and stay away!", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe best thing about this apartment was the location.\u201d", "Author": "BigBird65", "ReviewID": "UR34252920", "Content": "I knew I was doomed from the start when I got to Queensborough Terrace, checked in at No. 43 and they didn't have my reservation. I had booked the 39 Suites through a third party site, central-london-apartments.com. They had phoned me the day before I was supposed to be there to tell me that the credit card had declined when 39 Suites had tried to authorise a night's stay prior to my arrival. I must admit I gone a little crazy with it that week (it being my birthday, the reason for this weekend away) so I wasn't suprised. I gave central-london-apartments another set of credit card details which went through fine, and they sent me an amended reservation. That was Thursday 25th. As I say, I got there on the Friday 26th and reception couldn't find my reservation. It turned out that when they received the same amended reservation with the new card details they had cancelled it instead. After much to-ing and fro-ing, them calling central-london-apartments.com then telling me that they were fully-booked and that there was nothing they could do, they finally find my amended reservation, with the word \"cancelled\" through it that one of their staff had done. They realised it was their mistake and miraculously found me a studio, what I had originally booked. I was given room S15 on the third floor, just behind the lift. The rooms aren't very big and it really is only suitable for one person, two is a squeeze. I don't know if it was just my room or what, but where to start. The closet/wardrobe was a tall thin unit, with a mirrored front which was cracked and broken. It was unsuitable to put your suitcase in. There were no shelves and it contained maybe two hangers. It did have a safe inside which was handy. The bed, although fine mattress-wise, had no mattress protection cover on it that you get at most hotels, just one thin flat sheet that kept on coming loose as I slept. So you can imagine all the bed bugs inside the mattress. All the faucets were loose from their fittings. The shower faucet, the sink faucet and even the little kitchen sink faucet. The blind at the window was broken so I couldn't raise or lower it if I wanted. Luckily it was a hot weekend so I didn't mind having the blind down to keep cool. You can tell the apartments were hastily made and put together with cheap labour and fittings. There were also dark water stains above the door and along the exterior wall. Not brilliant. Even one of the spotlights in the ceiling was coming loose. And don't laugh, but the toilet was too high off the floor. It's one of those more contemporary built-in toilets, not a traditional one with a cistern, so it was built too high into the wall. I was actually perched on tippy-toes when sitting down, if you know what I mean. And I'm 5ft 10ins so that's saying something. The location was fantastic. Around the corner from Hyde Park with the nearest tubes being Queensway (Central line) and Bayswater (Circle and District line). Queensway was very handy for going shopping at Westfield Shopping Mall, Bayswater was handy for the Museum of Natural History and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Lots of shops, restaurants, bureau de changes nearby. The little Tesco's directly across the Bayswater tube was very handy. I didn't let the state of the apartment deter me though. A bit of shopping, a bit of culture, plus music (Glastonbury) on the telly and I had a fantastic weekend on my own. All in all, I loved the location, not too impressed with the apartment. I'd stay in the area again if I want another weekend away from home, but I won't stay at 39 Suites.

On this particular occassion, I had a trip planned for 1 week, so it was important I found self catering apartments that were well equipped, and well located, and as it goes without saying, in a good location. I looked long and hard, as the choice is varied, but it seems very difficult to find decent self catering apartments in London which arn't grossly over priced or proclaimed as being seriously filthy. After much searching, I found the 39 Suites in Baywater London, on [---]. It is a newly refurbished building and the pictures were extremely inticing, as was the price! I paid 499.00 GBP for a Double Studio for myself and my partner for 7 nights. Check in was after 2pm, and unfortunately I missed my flight over and we didn't get to London until 12pm that night, but we were informed that the apartments had a 24 hour reception which was extremely useful. You pick up your keys from Hotel 43 which is located just 2 doors down from the 39 suites. The apartments are both 2 and 4 minutes walk from both Queensway and Bayswater tube stations respectively, an extremely important factor in my opinion, its always a let down to find accommodation that claims it is near public transport when in fact it is 10 minutes walk away! I was impressed with the location. There is also both a Tesco Metro and Whiteley's Shopping Centre located 5 minutes walk away, handy for food shopping! We were met by a helpful man at the reception who brought us to the building. The building has been refurbished to a high standard and has a lift. We were in room S18. Initial impressions, however, were that the room was small.....very very small. The kitchen area was build into the wall, however, saying that it was perfectly functional, fridge, microwave, hob, presses, cutlery, kettle, freezer....everything you could possibly need. No toaster however?! The room was decorated beautifully and has a great sense of newness about it, very Ikea. It was very tasteful shades of white, cream brown. The room was spotlessly clean upon arrival and well made. It was a little warm though, and during the night my partner and I often food it extremely warm, even in the middle of winter! There is air conditioning however, so this isn't a problem. The bathroom was lovely, decorated with tiles and had subtle blue lighting which gave it a cosy boudior feel. The shower was big and there was a nice heated towel rail with fluffly towels. The rooms were cleaned to perfection daily, and new towels were supplied. There was a safe in the room also, unfortunately I looked my valuables in the first night, however the lady cleaning the rooms luckily had the keys the next morning so she was able to respond promptly. All in all we had a lovely stay at 39 Suites, and it ticks all the boxes - great location, great value, and great service. You'll certainly be impressed. One thing I feel that needs to be improved was the lack of adequate facilities for luggage storage after you check out! We enquired at the reception and were informed there was a 'cupboard' near the lift we could leave our luggage, which essentially transcended into the cleaning lady locking our bags into her cleaning cupboard until she finished for the day at 6pm! Apart from this minor mishap, I throughly reccommend 39 Suites to anyone looking for an inexpensive, comfortable stay in London!", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "39 Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1216965-Reviews-39_Suites-London_England.html", "Price": "$125 - $1,58", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">43 Queensborough Terrace</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3SY</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514244", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d5/0a/d50abb66cf69dda17e95ed324e0a0eec1large.jpg"}}
