I use Trip Advisor regularly but this is the first review I have ever penned. We are a couple in our mid- thirties, almost late-thirties, and this is our kind of place. The rooms are beautiful, think restoration hardware catalog, the service is excellent and the hotel is perfectly located, two minute walk to the best restaurants you could imgaine. Being from the east coast the time change is tough. The resturant on property only serves breakfast beginning at 7:30, we are up earlier. I will spill some secrets-they will pack you a picnic lunch, drive you to dinner and have bikes and iPads at your disposal. We booked a regular room and we were either extremely lucky, or every room as a excellent outside space that we have used regularly. If it is your first trio to Napa, pack layers, at least in Spring and Fall. The property is excellently maintained and trust me I am a critic. (Also the bathroom is gorgeous and has a whirlpool). If you don't love this place and feel perfectly comfortable you are a snob. As a side note we got at peak in a room at the high-end competition down the street - it is lovely but a hotel for your mother, not you.

It was sad to leave this place as it is very luxurious and hard to drag yourself back to reality. Gives us more reason to return. Sure the walls are thin and you can sometimes hear the neighbours. But we were lucky enough to only notice it a couple times as the next room was unoccupied for the majority of our stay. I would recommend a second floor room to remove any potential noise from the upstairs neighbours. And the so-called \"trailer park\" people complain about is really a non-issue. Didnt really notice it at all and probably wouldnt have if I had not read some reviews here. A great stay ! I recommend heading down during the off season.

The Hotel Yountville is an exception. Located a 5 minute walk (if one walks slowly) from the center of the village, the hotel is so fully renovated as to be brand new. Though pretending to be in the spirit of Tuscany, the lobby is no more than a contemporary decorator's cliche with a not very creative Restoration Hardware theme. It is large, spacious and comfortable, and if we hadn't been confused by the incomprehensible reference to Tuscany, we wouldn't have known for the worse. On the way to the rooms, organized into seven separate buildings, you pass by a very California-style sitting area organized around a rectangular fountain with a large gas fireplace (wood would have been so much nicer). The rooms are very large, well decorated, with gas fireplaces, excellent bathrooms and very large closets. Ours had a peaked ceiling and beams and nice light. One drawback to some rooms -- the parking area is very large as it serves all of the separated buildings, and some rooms can't avoid a parking lot view. The small swimming pool is a perfect comfortable temperature, bordered by a nice jacuzzi and another large gas-driven fire pit and a very large, diffused seating area. The highway is very close by but we rarely heard noise; other hotels in the area haven't done well with that but the Yountville did. We were a bit off season but can imagine a bit less desirable stay in full season if families and noisy kids decide to stay around the pool; but we didn't have that problem and found the hotel to be a restful, spacious and very comfortable place.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Michigan", "Title": "\u201cDid Not Want To Leave!\u201d", "Author": "NorthBayTraveler62", "ReviewID": "UR126973945", "Content": "I LOVED our stay at this property!

Interfacing with the hotel was easy and efficient before our visit. When we arrived our room was not ready but we were immediately soothed by the comfortable and cozy lobby, sipping on complementary Harney & Sons Paris Bergamot tea and Equator coffee with good music. The room itself was inviting and stylish - very California, very modern, with a perfect color palate and lighting, Yountville itself was a great place to stay in wine country with the highest per-capita Michelin starred restaurants at a stone's throw from the hotel. When we visited, the Taste of Yountville festival allowed us to sample many of the town's fine restaurants. We left at the end of the weekend renewed and reinvigorated - exactly what we wanted. Top 10 reasons to go to Hotel Yountville (in no particular order): 1. Fantastic staff. Smiles everywhere. Personal service. Thanks especially to the bartender Corey and the staff at the restaurant. 2. Comfortable bed. A great night's sleep with curtain panels that unfold on all sides of the bed for that dreamy feeling. 3. In room fireplace. Settling down with a glowing fireplace in the background was the perfect end to the day. 4. Hopper Creek Kitchen: One of the highlights of each day was our morning trek to the hotel restaurant. One of the best breakfasts we have had. Farm fresh eggs. Brioche toast with home made jam. Blueberry hotcakes with California pistachios. Freshly squeezed orange juice. Mmmmm. 5. Pool and hot tub: Heavenly and never crowded. 6. Setting: Mountains in the background. Creek running through hotel property. Beautifully landscaped. 7. Turndown service. Locally sourced Kollar chocolates left on the pillow (which we also sampled at the festival) was a special touch, as was the artfully lit evening candle in the bathroom. 8. Complementary lobby Harney & Sons tea, Equator coffee and spa water. 9. Ceiling fans. Together with the curtains around the bed led to a dreamy feeling. 10. Hotel bikes. Free to use for guests.

This lovely hotel is an easy walk to downtown Yountville and close to the restaurant we ate at, REDD....YUM!!! Two words...butterscotch pudding! The hotel amenities were luxurious, the staff very personal and helpful. The bartenders (sorry can't remember their names...guy in the day and a lady at night, night of the Oscars) were so friendly and helpful with suggestions. We were celebrating my birthday and, upon arrival, there was a knock on our door with a complimentary bottle of Pinot, a delicious plate of bite size chocolate goodies and a hand written birthday card!!! How lovely is that? We had so much fun sitting by the fire sharing the wine and chocolates, very nice touch! Thanks Hotel Yountville!!! The only minor downsides were that the patio was not very private, could have use more ivy or bamboo as a privacy cover. The insulation between the rooms was not great...could hear our neighbors talking. Minor glitch with payment, my BFF had reserved the rooms on her CC and when we got there my guy put his card down as payment for our room. She ended up getting charged for both and he got charged zero. Check in the mail to her though, so I'm over it.

The last time we stayed there the hotel was worn and in need of updating. We are happy to say the hotel underwent an extensive renovation and reopened last year as Hotel Yountville. Service - For starters, when we arrived at the hotel on a busy holiday weekend, we found out that our reservation had been cancelled in error. After a little bit of research, they found the issue and were able to for our reservation. Thank you Melody!!! This could have been, and I am sure at many hotels would have been, a very bad situation. Also on the service side, Melody asked us about our plans. We have been to the valley several times and always seek out new wineries. While not wine geeks, we are serious about or wine and consider these visits shopping trips to locate wines and wineries we we cannot get at home. While we had a few wine tastings planned, Melody made some recommendations based on what we told her we were looking for. She made some calls and was able to schedule us in to some great wineries on short notice. Rooms - We had a king room on the lower floor. The room had a gas fire place, separate seating area, and large bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower. The room was very clean with service twice per day. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the seating area with love seat and chair was nice for relaxing after a day of tasting. The balcony had two chairs overlooking a creek. Some reviewers have complained about the trailer park behind the hotel. If you re on the upper floor with a balcony, I could understand that as you would be overlooking the park. Of course if you look over that you see the mountains. Yountville is growing and some day the park will be replaced by large homes or a hotel, in that case the trailer park may not be bad as you still get the mountain views. The downside of the lower floor is that there is a walking trail that goes by the patios. There are shrubs between and I did not think that was a big deal. My only complaints would be 1) I wish there was a double vanity in the bathroom instead of the single. the bathroom is large enough and the renovation is recent, not sure why only a single, 2) The A/C unit is a single unit blowing right on the bed. I hate these units as it always seems to be too hot or cold, and the unit blowed on you in bed. Again, as a new renovation, these should have central air, or, at a minimum, not have the a/c near the bed, 3) the walls and ceilings are not very soundproof. Common in many places, but again, should have been addressed in the renovation. Facilities - There is a very nice pool area with a hot tub. We did not use it but it looked very nice and comfortable. There is also a spa which we did not use so cannot comment on. There is a small resent that is only open for breakfast. The food and service was great. I only wish it was open later in the day for sandwiches, salads, pizza, etc. After a day of tasting, that would have been nice. Overall, I use the term great value because it is when compared to other places in Yountville. It may not have a famous restaurant, spa, or tennis courts, but that is fine with me. I prefer it like this. The location is excellent as you can walk to some of the best restaurants in the valley. additionally, several tasting rooms have opened in Yountville so you can walk to tastings if you want. While there are a few things I would like different, I still rate as excellent and will definitely stay here again.

We arrived, after a long flight, and upon arrival, the hotel was lovely looking, lobby, etc. We were escorted to our room - which was a lower level room. The room itself was nice, however the outdoor space patio was about 20 feet from a trailer park with rusted tin roofs, and a dog walking trail that did not belong to the hotel in which people walked by each morning and allowed their dogs to relieve themselves practically on our patio. It was gross. No privacy was the least of our worries. We had to keep the blinds completely drawn the entire time because of the view and all the people and dogs walking by at all times of day - so it was like being in a dungeon. We told them on day one we wanted to move, and the folks at the front desk were nothing short of rude - they had nothing available, and said they may be able to move us the next day (we were there 4 nights) - after the 3rd day, when they had not even contacted us - we called them and they said, oh yes - we can move you upstairs, it was our last night at this point, and it was a much nicer point of view, but unfortunately too little too late. They never mentioned our anniversary which somewhat burned me - when you go to a Ritz or Four Seasons for a special occasion, they greet you with a message and usually have at least a little handwritten card in your room upon check in. These people were cold. AS for the price - nearly $550 a night - they have a nerve - with a view of the trailer park!!!

The hotel was recently renovated and I'm sure a great deal of money was invested. The furniture and finishes are very upscale. But, the room design is absolutely the most dysfunctional we have ever seen. Our closet was small and the clothes bar placed so low that we hung most of our clothes on the four poster bed and the thermostat. Handles were never installed on the two drawers of the only dresser in the room. To use it, we had to kneel on the floor and squeeze our hands under the bottom drawer and push it open from the back. I don't think that's how its done at the Ritz Carlton. It was easier to leave our clothes folded on the sofa and chairs. The bathroom door is on rollers and lacks a latch or lock, and it rolls open as soon as its closed. The staff, while friendly, seem detached and forgetful. We asked for hangers twice but received none. We asked about having handles installed on the dresser, but none were. At the end of our stay, I showed the desk manager how we had been living; dresses and suits hanging from the bed rails, shirts and shorts folded on the sofa; bedroom slippers holding doors closed and drawers open.

The crushed glass fire element by the whirlpool was very inviting at dusk or right after dinner. The hotel's Hopper Creek restaurant was delicious for breakfast. The brioche French toast and strawberries with Saba were incredible. We had such a lovely time, that we are recommending the hotel to all of our friends who love the Napa Valley. And it is definitely the only place we will stay. We are already planning to come back in a few months for the crush!

We stayed in a Deluxe room (the hotel's standard room) and as per other reviews these are some of the best decorated rooms we have ever stayed in. However, on our first visit we were in the upstairs middle room of block 3 (room 306 or 307?) and you could hear every word, cough, sneeze etc from the rooms on either side. Unacceptable in a hotel like this - and very surprising - it was almost to the point where you felt sound was being amplified into the room - very strange. We didn't have neighbours for the 2nd and 3rd nights so the problem went away. Surprised this is not mentioned more on this site. We stayed mid week and the hotel was quite quiet, and staff were not particularly welcoming. Pool service was also poor and generally it made for quite a strange experience as the property itself is outstanding and unlike most lives up to the images on the website. They also don't have a licence for the bar in the lobby (although that wasn't mentioned to us) but are serving drinks at the pool. Not sure of timescales but the licence is applied for so it is only a matter of time. On the second visit we were in a different room - upstairs corner room in block 9 - fantastic room - including a balcony - oversized bathroom - without doubt the best room of our trip (which included the Wynn, Beverly Wilshire etc). We arrived at midday on Sunday, were checked in immediately, the hotel was busy, reception staff more on their game and there was an excellent and very hard working guy at the pool - 'Tom' - who provided outstanding service. If this had been our only experience of the hotel we would have had no criticisms and were very glad we returned for one more night. Pool area is beautiful - excellent, very comfortable double loungers (with individually adjustable mattresses) and when Tom is working, great service. Also good at night when the fire pit is on for a dip in the jacuzzi. Overall a great property, superbly remodelled with excellent attention to detail and top quality fixtures and fittings - just a few tweeks mainly to the staff (and sound proofing) would make it perfect. Yountville itself is a great little town - we ate in Mustards (ok but on the night we were there very hard to understand the hype - food very average), Bouchon (terrible service, staff couldn't cope, poor food - much better options available all around) and the Farmstead Restaurant at Long Meadow Ranch which was excellent.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cAstonishing Transformation of an Old Favorite\u201d", "Author": "Pelhamgirl", "ReviewID": "UR115912707", "Content": "Yountville is a little treasure of a town near Napa which contains some of the best restaurants and hotels in America.

The restaurant selection is amazing and includes some of the top restaurants in California and the Country (French Laundry, Bouchon, Bottega, etc). The town is also very cute, colorful and green. Just what we want when in wine country. The Yountville Inn is right in the middle of it all, a few steps from everything in town and some of the best wineries in the valley. We stayed in an upgraded room (I believe the Deluxe) and comparing it to the pictures posted on this site, I believe we got one of the best rooms. The upgrade was definitely worth the extra money: corner unit on the second floor, extremely spacious, with king size bed, high wood-beam vaulted ceilings, very nice wide gas fireplace, and very nice spacious bathroom. I don't think we had a patio, but it was a chilly time in November and I might have ignored it. The King bed was huge and very comfortable. The fireplace was very nice and cozy. I moved the bench in front of it so I could lay by the fire and warm up on a cold and wet day. The bathroom was also very nice, super clean, and roomy.

The location was great- walking distance to great restaurants like Ad Hoc and Hurley's. The reception was nice, the grounds were pretty and we were able to check in early.

The room came had a set of wine glasses and bottle opener, and Starbucks for the coffeemaker. The king sized bed was comfortable and there was a small sitting area with a couch. We were very impressed on the quality of the accomodations for the price ($179) and even discussed returning in the summer. We loved that there were no neighbors above us, just one room to the side. Great! Peace and quiet right? Wrong! We were awoken at 7:30am on Sunday morning by the people in the next room. At first, I thought they were right outside our door, maybe packing the car to leave, but soon I realized that the voices we heard were from the next room over. We could make out every word they said- every word! There seemed to be 3 adults staying in the room, up early, chatting away with the TV on. And then the baby started crying. And wouldn't stop. Who brings an infant to the wine country?? The noise didn't stop until 10am when they checked out. They sounded like they were in the room with us. They even responded to me when they heard me complaining about how loud they were- they said they \"didn't care\"! I was too exhausted and frustrated to bother calling the front desk to complain- not that there was much to be done. I've travelled extensively from hostels to Hiltons and everything in between and these were the thinnest walls I've ever experienced. That's why I rated the hotel highly (it looked great) but also said I wouldn't recommend it (the noise). The early wake up ruined our trip completely which is a shame because the hotel is lovely.

The rooms are very spacious and clean and well equipped with wine glasses and complimentary bottled water. A couple of minor points that I think could be rectified considering the cost of the Inn. 1) Water in the rooms is still heated by small electric tanks, these take a while to reheat after a shower/bath so make sure you allow time to allow the tank to refill if there is more than one of you getting ready for a day/night out. 2) The hotel offers wireless internet access throughout, but there is no pc with internet access for guests to use, this proved a bit of a pain as we wanted to check in for our onward flight online but were unable to do so. It doesn't cost much to buy a laptop for guest use and with the prices they charge, I think it they should make the provision.

Not quite what we had in mind. The room itself was very large but the furnishings were basic and there was no artwork on the wall at all - fine if we had been paying less money but nothing great.

We were informed that not only was there no safe in the room, there was no safe in the entire hotel. This was huge disadvantage for us as we had flown in from overseas and had passports which we could not risk leaving in a room overlooking the parking lot. The inn also advertised a \"lovely buffet breakfast.\" The first morning, we went over to the main building with visions of omelets in our mind only to find bagels, coffee, juice and yogurt - nothing hot. While the food was adequate (the baked goods were very good), this was not a buffet - it could accurately be called a \"lovely continental breakfast.\" That morning as we were leaving our room we saw housekeeping and said our room would be available for the next few hours for cleaning but after that we would all be in the room getting ready for the wedding - they said they would take care of it. When we returned to our room at almost 3 pm, the room had not been touched. When we called the front desk, they were unapologetic and said that housekeeping had until 4 pm to clean - when we explained that we would be showering until 4 pm and had asked housekeeping to please clean earlier, they were unapologetic and borderline rude - it was almost as if they felt they had nothing to do with housekeeping.

This made privacy nonexistent, but our view was great. Plus, our room was close to the front desk and the lovely Bouchon pastry continental breakfast served each morning. Our accessible room was very large and extremely spacious. We had plenty of room for everything. The room features a nice king bed (be sure to request extra pillows; we thought the pillows were woefully inadequate and way too soft) flanked with nightstands and lamps, a separate seating chair and sofa, a small bistro table with 2 chairs, and a large chest with a huge plasma t.v. Our room had a lovely corner gas fireplace decorated with rustic lava rock. The accessible bathroom was well laid out, yet only had one sink. The accessible shower had no tub, but it was still very nice (with lovely slate surrounds). The in-room amenities (soap, shampoo, etc.) was adequate but far from luxurious. We had an in-room coffee maker with Starbucks coffee and hot chocolate, an ice bucket, two wine glasses and a corkscrew. A small in-room refrigerator stocks sodas for $3 each. The room has lots of windows, yet only one window has blackout curtains. The other windows have pretty white shutters. These shutters look great, but they do a terrible job keeping the room dark. Light sleepers might have trouble with this as the sun really does come through the slats and brightens the room very early in the morning. The grounds are lovely, very lush and green. Meandering sidewalks and modern sculptures abound. The rooms are set up to look like cottages, though they are all attached. It was easy and free to park. The room was spotlessly clean. The only major complaint I have is that when the water came out of our shower and bathroom faucet, it was SCALDING hot. You had to barely turn on the water or it would seriously burn you. Be careful if you stay here! The water was just way too hot! Also, I found the towels to be a bit thin, and the furnishings / bedding could use some updating. The heated saltwater pool is open 'til midnight and was really refreshing. The location can't be beat; you are within walking distance to many gourmet restaurants (including Bistro Jeanty and Thomas Keller's Bouchon and Ad-Hoc) and a 5 minute drive to a long list of terrific wineries. A convenience market and a Wells Fargo bank are also within one block's walking distance. This was a nice hotel and could really be a premier, upscale property with a bit of renovation.

Excellent restaurants in walking distance ( Redd was YUMMY), many vineyards within 5 minute drive and the hotel also sponsors tastings in the lobby on certain evenings. The service was also extremely helpful. The only downfall is that they do not have a business center, but if you have a laptop they allow you access to their wireless internet. My husband and I found the public library in St. Helena (next town up the road) and were able to use the internet there for free. No big deal, I was on vacation so I think it may have been a good thing to not have immediate computer access. As far as Vineyards - recommend Buehler Family, Cakebread's wine and food pairing as well as Frog's Leap. All were excellent and extremely informative and did not feel too commercialized if you know what I mean!", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cWonderful spot\u201d", "Author": "luxuryhound", "ReviewID": "UR7338734", "Content": "The Yountville Inn is great!

Our friends and, effectively speaking, our guides, had been here many, many times. They like the Yountville Inn for its comfortable accommodations and convenient location. I agree. While it is not the Four Seasons, it is a very comfortable property, clean, easy to utilize, with a nice, if not modest, breakfast presentation. I am a runner and this property makes walks and or runs extremely convenient based on its location. Great streets to run on inclunding the road that wraps around the Yountville Hills, about a 6.5 mile run to Highway 29 and back. I was told that they are adding a wine Bar to the lobby which would be great. This is probably 12 months out from what I was told. I have not tried other accommodations in Yountville, but I would go back. If it helps, we typically seek out Four Seasons type accommodations and we were satisfied with this property despite its simplicity. Cannot help but make one comment on the restaurants. We ate at four different restaurants: Mustards, Bistro Jeanty, Tra Vigne, and the Culinary Institute in St. Helena. My favorite, by far, was Bistro Jeanty. Excellent food, great service. And, it is about two blocks from from the Yountville Inn. Finally, if you want to have a great tour of a winery, try to get a tour of Pride. Extremely informative. Also, Kuleto is wonderful, but not easy to get to. One drawback on the Yountville Inn was that in the pool area, you could hear the cars going by both on Washington Street and on 29.", "Date": "September 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cSoundproofing and decorating need work\u201d", "Author": "PoppyQuince", "ReviewID": "UR5816586", "Content": "We checked in to this property hoping for a relaxing stay in the wine country and were upgraded at check-in.

The furnishings were dark wood with dark green and burgundy colors in the carpet and upholstery, and the gas fireplace was set in a wall of stones next to the hulking armoire. This might have felt good on a ski slope in the dead of winter, but was only depressing in the Napa Valley in early September. The problem that was really annoying however became evident later, when we heard clearly the conversation of our immediate neighbors. They were speaking at normal conversational level and we heard it all. I'm glad they weren't having a fight! And they did go to sleep at a reasonable hour. This room cost $308 including tax.

The inn does not have turn down service, if you need extra towels for the morning and etc. make sure to call in advance. They do not have maids/cleaning staff during the evening so if you do need more towels make sure to ask the morning cleaning lady or else you have to go to the Front desk to ask for more towels in the evening.

Fireplace, double sinks, good water pressure in shower and etc. However the rooms are a bit dark, b/c limited windows but its great for what it is. The breakfast is good for what it is.

I had stayed there last year in July with my partner and another friend and had very much enjoyed our stay. This year's stay was as enjoyable. We stayed for 2 nights from Wednesday through Friday, so we got a good rate (by Napa standards) of $225 per night for each room. (In comparison, the Vintage Inn was offering smaller rooms for $400 per night.) My room was very spacious, with a king bed, a living area, and a sizeable bathroom. I also had a sizeable balcony area, but since my room overlooked the parking lot it was a bit of a waste. Still, my friends had the same room overlooking a nice garden area, so we would often sit out there on their balcony in the evenings before and after dinner with a nice bottle of wine and just hang out. It was quite hot again during our stay, and I am one of those people who always likes it very cold, and again my room temperature was pretty good with the unit's air conditioning. I've had better, but then again I've also had MUCH worse, so I was pretty pleased. I asked if they could bring a fan to help me keep cool and they quickly brough a HUGE fan for that purpose. I was comfortable for my entire stay despite the fact that temperatures ran well over 100 degrees during the day and even at night it was around 75-80 degrees. The complimentary continental breakfast wasn't my favorite, since they ran out of bagels and muffins that I most liked, but it was more than adequate. There was fresh juice and very good coffee (or so my friends tell me as I don't drink coffee), and the hard boiled eggs are a favorite of mine, so I had plenty to tide me over. Of course, the Inn is very well situated with great restaurants like Bistro Jeanty and Bouchon (and the French Laundry, of course, which I still think is fabulous but way overpriced) just a 10-15 miniute walk from the hotel. Very convenient. I very much enjoyed my stay for my second visit and expect that I will make the Yountville Inn my staple place to stay in Napa Valley when I visit with frends. I have stayed at Auberge du Soleil when I am there with only my partner, but then our budget is bigger than most of our friends'. Still, I very much enjoy my Yountville Inn stays and am surprised that it is not more highly ranked here.

He even sent me an email with suggested spas, wineries, restaurants and the like. Very nice touch. Moreover, he offered to make my dinner and spa/tasting appointments for me. Very nice touch.

I enjoyed eating breakfast in the morning sun lit room reading a complementary copy of the San Francisco Chronicle. The hotel is nestled right in Downtown Yountville so spas, restaurants, shops, etc. are just a short walk. Very cozy. That being said, our bed was very uncomfortable, it was as if we were sleeping on a sheet of plywood. Very hard. I did not sleep well at all. My main issue with this hotel, however, was the price. At $375 a night, I felt it was too expensive. There is no room service, and no restaurant on site. Moreover, there is no spa or even a gym attached, (so we walked one block to Villagio for spa treatments). Given that this is 'just a hotel' I think $375 ($420 after room tax) was far too expensive for what we got. We stayed at the Lodge at Sonoma last year, in their highest end \"Cottage\" which was like a small condo with exquisite decorations, large room, comfy bed (even equipped with a memory foam topper - WOW!) and private veranda. The Lodge, with nicer rooms, attached spa (fantastic by the way!), restaurant on site (Carneros), and bar service out to the pool (Excellent!!) was a better value and actually cost less than $375/night (but you sacrifice the downtown locale). While the Yountville Inn was a decent experience we will not return at that price. I would expect to pay about 189-200/night but no more, and the bed has to be more comfortable.
