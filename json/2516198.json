My wife had enough hot water when it was turned fully to hot, but for me, the hot water ran out. I called the desk, but they could not repair it immediately and we had to leave for a dinner reservation. When we got back, along with the smoke smell, there was a free bottle of wine, but this did not compensate to having to wash with a washcloth at the sink.

I was able to get a package deal that included a fireplace king room, a complimentary bottle of wine, and \"complimentary wine tasting passes\" for about $160/room. I think this is because we went in winter. My first impression of the Lodge was a bit ho-hum from the outside. It is right off highway 29 (but we learned that the rooms have great soundproofing and we certainly didn't notice cars, it is a very small highway). When we walked into the lobby to check in, I was impressed with the warmth of the lobby and sitting room. A fire was roaring in the fireplace, and there is always coffee and tea set out for guests. My only disappointment with the check-in process was that the \"complimentary wine tasting passes\" were actually all 2-for-1 wine tasting passes so we would have to pay $10-$15/winery for each couple's tasting. This is not quite what was advertised and my only real complaint with the entire stay. The rooms were lovely, very clean, modern, and tasteful. They include a duraflame log in each fireplace and a nice coffee/tea set-up in the room. Toiletries are very nice too, great smelling! The robes and slippers are a nice touch. The pool and jacuzzi are lovely, sort of Tuscan style with nice towels provided. I imagine that lounging at the poolside would be wonderful on a warm day. The only critique I would offer is that, the second day, I got up at 9 to go for a swim. Even though this was within the hours of operation for the pool, when I got down there, the pool was being cleaned and equipment was just left hanging out in the pool. The person maintaining the pool came back and noticed me swimming around the equipment and very nicely offered to come back later. It just seemed like imperfect planning on the hotel's part. Again, a very small complaint. We very much enjoyed the complimentary champagne brunch--nice food and good quality sparkling wine, coffees, juices. Very tasty and a nice touch to offer it free of charge. The Lodge is very close to the restaurants, wine bars, and shops of Yountville, just a 5-10 minute walk to most. It is also a short drive to lots of great wineries! I recommend Goosecross Cellars as a lovely winery to visit in the local area.

It is also within walking distance of the main part of town. This makes it helpful when you are wine tasting...no driving! The champagne brunch is also great! Many choices on the menu. The down side - While I have heard many great things about the staff at the lodge, I can only state that the folks at the front desk were not entirely welcoming. They were efficient with getting our room but was not familiar with the events going on in the valley (January is Restaurant month in Napa and they didn't know anything about it). My partner and I felt that they were a bit cold to us. This was reinforced when I called down to the front desk for a question and they were short and to the point. The facility is OK but nothing worth the \"four stars\" that others have given. The rooms have been remodeled but it felt like a motel that was fixed up to attract the Napa tourists.

The pool is also fantastic - with either beverage service (limited options) or bring it yourself. Something we wish we knew ahead of time is to bring your own wine - they even provide you an ice bucket to keep the white cold (that's what we did our second afternoon/early evening).

As complimentary hotel buffet breakfasts go, theirs was pretty good with sparkling wine, fruit, cheese, eggs, waffles, and sausage gravy (though when there are no biscuits, why bother?). Large groups with kids made it difficult to get a table at breakfast and impossible to use the waffle iron. If you can book in the off season, the rates are fair, but I'm not sure the rate would have been worthwhile during peak times.

We booked three nights, at rack rate (430$ plus each night for each room). Pros: nice location in Yountville. Close to restaurants. Excellent concierge, helped make two great dinner reservations. Very friendly desk. Cons: As other commentators have said, the hotel is really a motel. A good description would be a La Quinta on steroids: similar feel and style, slightly more upscale furnishings. We had three problems: 1) Route 29, right outside the window. This is the main highway through Napa, and 18 wheelers run up and down all night. Not very relaxing 2) It was impossible to mask the road noise using the air conditioner. Regardless of the fan settings, the fan clicks on and off all night (if it doesn't sense movement, I think). 3) We got placed in a room (#48) with a thinly insulated connecting door, next to a bridal party on the night before the wedding. We were awoken several times during the night by screaming women, and then again at 6am as the bride got ready for the big day. The final insult was the cancellation policy: We were called back home a day early so that my wife could perform an emergency surgery. The hotel claims that there is a 7 day cancellation policy, and refused to credit the third night for our room. They offered to resell it, but said that there were 14 unsold rooms that needed to be sold first. So no refund of the third night. My point: if there were 14 unsold rooms, our leaving early obviously didn't deprive anyone of a room. I spend a LOT of time in hotels, and all in all, I don't think that we've ever paid $2400 ($400 for each rom, times two rooms times three nights...) and received such poor value or lack of concern/ respect from management. Not refunding a third unused night in a fairly empty hotel was the final insult.

From start to finish, the lodge staff helped make our stay enjoyable. With ease, they directed us to unique wineries, spas and fine dining. We would not have made it to the Hess Collection of contemporary art, to the awesome views from Artesa, to Michael Chiorello's Ristorante Bottega, or to Bouchon without their encouragement.

They were paying attention, and my guess is that an immediate adjustment was made. The spa, of course, was toasty.

As a background - I am a very well traveled person and ALL my vacations are ALWAYS planned using Tripadvisor reviews. This one seems to have been the only disappointment that I can remember of. Cons: - Do not be deceived by the pictures of vineyard outside your room balcony. We booked based on that and the \"valley view\" turned out to be the view of a hill in a distance beyond the pool and yard area. More like a pool view room. I really have to wonder the genuineness of the pictures posted by people. From the map I was given by front desk, the vineyard view rooms must be maybe less than a dozen in this decently large property. Again - don't get deceived by the pics. - Also, upon checking in, I was not given any overview of the amenities and/or the activities at the lodge. I had to actually ask if there was anything I should know of. - When checking in on Wednesday I was informed of wine tasting at the lodge every Thursday & Friday. I was checking out Friday morning so we came back from our trip to Napa on Thursday so that we can enjoy the wine tasting. Guess what - wine tasting was suddenly moved to Friday!! That's unbelievably crap service from a lodge that charges over 365 bucks a night! - The moment I entered the room I got a nauseating smell that was explained by the really old carpeting in the room. Bring some spray with you. Had to ask my wife to spray some perfume to get over the smell. - No elevators if you are carrying lots of luggage like we are due to our 2 week long trip with a kid - For the money - I think there might be better options like Hotel Yountville, etc. I only came to know about it from the tourism book in the room. Definitely not worth the money we paid. We got gorgeous hotels (again from tripadvisor) in San Diego, Santa Monica & Monterey for way less than this (this is our 4th destination in California trip) Pros: - the breakfast was pretty good and I think they have done a good job with the buffet. - The bathroom is totally updated. I really looks good. However, it doesn't seem very well planned. The towels are quite a distance away from the shower and above the toilet. - The furniture in the room is good quality. The bed skirt doesn't go well with the bed as it seems bit older.

Since the hotel is significantly less expensive than most of the other options in Yountville, I had been a bit concerned about whether we would be happy here, but I very pleased. The Lodge is an excellent value for this area, and a very pleasant place to stay. The room was large and attractive, the bathroom was extremely nice (comparable to, and indeed better than, many high-end hotels), and the robes were spa-quality. (The room itself was much nicer than our room at the Westin in Napa last summer.) The pool area was quite inviting, too, with comfortable, well-padded lounge chairs, umbrellas, and beverage service. It is obvious from the grounds and the little extra touches that the owners have taken great pains to make the Lodge a nice place to stay. We had a ground-floor, deluxe king room with a view of a vineyard about 15 feet away, and while there was a road behind the vineyard, this still made for a nice view.

It\u2019s within walking distance to many shops and restaurants and sits by the highway that\u2019s the main artery through the valley to the most popular wineries. We booked the lowest category room, the Parkview Terrace Queens. The room was nicely furnished and very clean. The view was disappointing, though. A view of the parking lot, a road beyond that, and then further beyond was a gravel area with picnic tables. Considering the beauty of the surrounding areas, this did not measure up. The free wireless internet was great and was accessible throughout the resort, even at the pool. The breakfasts were great as well. Served 8am \u2013 10am, there was a nice assortment of hot and cold choices. Coffee and cookies were available in the lobby in the afternoons, which was great when a snack was needed. The staff was always very polite and friendly. They were helpful in suggesting dining and sightseeing options. We did have a couple of issues, though. We had paid for 3 nights in advance months earlier. After the first night, we returned to our room in the afternoon and our key was not working. When we went to the front desk, they said our reservation was only for one night and we were supposed to have checked out that morning. Thank goodness I had printed our confirmation and brought it with me. After showing that, they made the corrections and gave us new keys. Also, we spent one afternoon at the pool. We had just stretched out and relaxed in the loungers, then 10 minutes later the landscapers showed up with mowers, weedeaters, and leafblowers. The pool area had been empty all day. Why would they wait until after guests showed up to do that work? It was a very small area, so having all of that noise was very frustrating. They finished after about an hour, but hard to relax after that. The grounds and landscaping were beautiful and well maintained. I will say though, that it\u2019s just not the serene and tranquil setting that their website and brochures would lead you to believe. The hotel is surrounded on 3 sides with busy roads. The vineyards that are shown in the brochures are on the back side of the hotel and only visible from the breakfast room and about a dozen of the highest category rooms.

Still I could not shake the feeling of being in an upscale version of Motel 8. We stayed in a King Room on the first floor with view to the vineyards. Like others have pointed out, the ground floor rooms do not overlook the vineyard, but but look into it. This is actually rather nice. More of a problem is that the vineyard is adjacent to the four lane highway connecting Napa and St. Helena. While sitting outside, there is constant traffic noise including from 18-wheelers speeding past. We still spent time on the terrace because being in the middle of a vineyard is quite unique, but those seeking peace and quiet will be disappointed. The pool area is very nice and peaceful. We spent several afternoons there sipping wine and relaxing. The staff are very friendly and unobtrusive and do not mind at all if you bring your own wine to the pool. There is also a petanque/bocce court and an evening seating area with an open gas fire. Yountville attractions (i.e. the restaurants) are within walking distance, which is a major plus.

We got back and were checked in to a room with a view of the winery and a great fireplace.

It was cold and rainy while we were there and every time we left the room, we would come back to find the bathroom cold as someone had opened the window in the shower. I'm guessing the staff knew about the smell and that is why they kept opening our window? I put my suitcase on the right side of the room lining the wall. A few times I went to pick up an item of closing that was falling out of the suitcase and they felt damp. I didn't think anything about it until the 3rd time it happened the morning we left and i realized the entire side of the room was wet all along the carpet. I have a feeling this is why it smelled.

We went to the workout room next and watched as about 20 hotel guests did the same thing we did- went to the wrong room and they never put up a sign telling anyone that breakfast had moved.

The weather was in the low 70's so we didn't try the pool but many people did use the hot tub. Even more special is the fire pit, shown on their web site, where people congregated each evening to stay warm but enjoy the cool, crisp air. Very relaxing after a long day of tasting wines at the various wineries. The hotel is really convenient if you want to walk out to dinner each night. We ate at Bouchon the first night and had a wonderful dinner. It is supposedly owned by the same owners as French Laundry but at a fraction of the price. Excellent meal. The second night, we ate at Tra Vigne, in St Helena -- also excellent. The pasta is delicious and the restarant is beautiful.

At that time there were no discounts available and so we paid the full rack rate of $345 (plus taxes) per night. Although not exactly cheap, we wanted to stay in Yountville for the restaurants and so we paid a premium for the location; plus the fact that the property gets good reviews on TA swayed our decision to stay there. The rooms were quite large, the bed was comfortable and the bathrooms were nice; and we also had a nice view of the neighbouring vineyard from our small balcony. We enjoyed spending a few hours recovering from a hard days wine tasting next to the pool, soaking up the late afternoon sunshine. However we were always conscious of the roads next to the property, as it's just off Highway 29, and our room was at the end of the property right next to Washington St. Not that we were really bothered by the road noise, but we were aware of it, especially in the morning; or when we were sitting out on the balcony. The property is a converted motel, and so keeps a number of motel features and ambience such as being able to park outside the rooms. We actually found this fairly convenient, but I can imagine that this would not be to everyones tastes, as the property does seem a bit soulless, and lacks any real charm compared to other Napa Valley options. The champagne breakfast was an average breakfast buffet. Although it has to be said that we were either driving, or we had plans to visit wineries so we didn't feel like starting the day with champagne and so didn't try that. We also didn't book any spa treatments. We really didn't see that many staff during our stay, and so we didn't have much interaction with the staff other than check-in/out, and also because the in-room free wi-fi wasn't working (and never got fixed). The staff were perfectly professional, but not exactly warm and friendly, and certainly didn't put in any effort to introduce themselves or make our stay special in any way. We didn't receive any of the little touches mentioned in other reviews: No wine tasting passes, recommendations, offer of help with reservations, wine tasting, bottle of wine, nothing. When we took a stroll into town for our dinner reservations at Redd, we walked past The Vintage Inn and Villagio, and after a quick look around we decided that if we ever came back to Yountville that we'd try one of those properties instead. Overall we felt that for the prices charged the hotel could have done a lot more, and that they only justify their rates due to their Yountville location (there are better located options in town). But we didn't see fit to complain, or even write a negative review on TA, because we loved the Napa Valley so much, we didn't feel that an overpriced, ordinary hotel, which we didn't ever intend to spend a lot of time at had spoiled our trip. Had this review ended here, we'd be giving the Napa Valley Lodge 3/5 and possibly not writing much of a review. but we enjoyed our first trip to the Napa Valley so much we have arranged to go back this year. We also wanted to go back to Yountville to try some of the other great restaurants in September at crush time. We originally looked to make a booking in March at either The Vintage Inn, or Villagio, but their websites showed no availability for the dates we wanted. So after further investigation the only place in town showing availability was the Napa Valley Lodge. As the only available option I reluctantly went ahead and booked it. Again this time there were no discounted rates available, but I wasn't exactly surprised by that as it was peak season, and everywhere else was already full. However I kept checking back from time to time, and in July I discovered that not only were most Yountville hotels now showing availability for the dates we wanted, many of them, including the Napa Valley Lodge, were now offering discounted rates for those dates. I contacted the NVL and asked them to change our reservation for the discounted rate, so that I wouldn't need to cancel and rebook. Their reservations department flat out denied that the discounted rate was available, and told me I was mistaken. So I contacted them again, and this time I proved that the rate was available by providing them a series of screenshots from their own website. They then reluctantly backed down and amended my reservation to the lower rate. Also as this time we are visiting in September, we have been advised that popular restaurants and wineries book up well in advance and so it's advisable to make advanced reservations. So I made contact with the concierge at NVL to ask their assistance and advice in making some reservations for some wineries and restaurants. As we live in the UK, the time difference and international call rates means it's a lot easier for us to communicate with the West Coast by email; the concierge at NVL was incredibly slow, not really helpful and had to be chased to do anything (despite being exceptionally quick to respond to our initial email). I should point out that we don't want an overly planned itinerary and weren't asking for a lot of difficult reservations (such as the French Laundry, or tiny out of the way wineries) we were requesting one restaurant reservation, and 2 or 3 tasting reservations for well known wineries yet it would take weeks for them to respond. This time we are also staying at a few other Napa Valley locations, and so I had made contact with their concierge departments for similar purposes. They all eclipsed the NVL, were helpful and didn't need to be reminded or chased; despite the fact that in some cases the properties charge significantly lower rates. In the end I got fed up with the lack of customer service shown by the staff at the Napa Valley Lodge, and despite the fact that it cost a cancellation fee to do so (why exactly?? When the cancellation was more than a month before the check-in date), I cancelled the reservation and made a booking elsewhere in Yountville. I get the impression that the staff at the Napa Valley Lodge don't really enjoy their jobs, and that hospitality certainly does not come naturally to them. It seems to me that customers are seen as an opportunity to make money, and they are treated as such. As a place to sleep; a base for the great restaurants in town, and to be centrally located for the wineries it's OK (Get a discounted rate, never pay full price as it's just not worth it). But as a luxury hotel, justifying the rates it charges, and offering guests an unforgettable wine country experience it fails miserably.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LaJolla", "Title": "\u201cSo Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "lmdicke", "ReviewID": "UR38207475", "Content": "This was such a nice 2 days of relaxation.

We had about 36 hours to spend in the Napa Valley, and he'd need to work for 3 of them. We reserved a room at the Napa Valley Lodge, last minute, through Travelzoo. At $179, it included wine tasting passes and breakfast. It ended up being a worthwhile package. The package stated, during the reservation process, that we had a choice of 2Q or 1 K bed. I requested K, and when we received the confirmation, it showed 2 Q. The night before arrival, I called the hotel to check on the possibility of a K, and found out that the Travelzoo package mis-stated the options for the package price. The receptionist was VERY kind and moved us into a King fireplace room at no extra charge, as one was available. She also noted my request for no feathers in the bedding. We arrived much earlier than check-in time, and hoped to just get our tasting coupons so that we could enjoy our only day in the valley. The receptionist was happy to put us in a different room than we were originally booked in, since it was already made up. This gave us the chance to use the wi-fi and map out our wine tastings. After that we headed out for the day and enjoyed tasting at 4 wineries. The coupons we used (3) saved us about $45 in tasting fees (the coupons were buy-one-get-one). Napa has become VERY expensive if you want to taste good wine, and you must buy 2 bottles in or order for ONE tasting fee to be waved. I find this disheartening. Upon returning to the hotel, I realized that the bedding we had was probably not feather-free. I checked in at the front desk, and they had already realized the problem, but were waiting for us to return to fix it. The head housekeeper and manager came in and changed out our bedding very quickly and politely. They also delivered our included bottle of wine,and the front desk made our reservation for dinner. We relaxed on our patio, watching the sun sink in the sky over the vineyards. The grounds at the hotel are lush and beautiful. The noise from the highway was unremarkable. We were sitting outside during rush-hour time, and barely noticed the cars. Weekends could be different, I suppose. Later, we had dinner at the Rutherford Grill, and enjoyed one of the bottles of wine we had purchased (they never charge corkage!). The food was fabulous. We enjoyed a fire in our room that evening, and the next morning, breakfast was very nice. It's continental, but had a wide assortment of choices. The power went out in the entire valley that morning, but we managed to have a nice breakfast anyway... the room was well-lit with natural light. We were very sorry to have to leave, and regretted not having time to enjoy the pool or the beautiful firepit. We'll have to return again to do that.

The biggest compliment we can pay to the hotel is that we came her to taste wine but we ended up buying a few bottles right off the bat and then lollygagging around the hotel for the majority of our stay. The hotel was nice enough to take two wine drinkers out of the wine tasting game, woith no regrets. The negatives, which are minor in comparison: on the first day here, we tried the shower multiple times, and we got lukewarm water at best. In fairness to the hotel, we ttried showering after 10am so the early shower crew had already had done their damage on the hot waer supply. Later on, the hot water returned. The water pressure is low, but that could be due to conservation efforts so not a big deal. The second issue related to breakfast the first day. Again, we came during the second hour of breakfast but the offerings at that time were paltry at best. The second day was much better so perhaps this was a unique situation.

It took several calls to finally book what we wanted including a balloon flight, a winery tour and massage treatments. We were told that the details of the winery tour and massage treatments would be set up when we got to the hotel. We gave them our credit card and thought we were all set. Our big surprise came when we arrived at the hotel and were told that they had no record of us. I checked my email right from the hotel lobby and only then realized that they had never sent me a confirmation. The front desk staff essentially accused us of lying about having a reservation. They also said that the winery tour and massages should have been set up in advance, which shows that their phone staff is really poorly trained. Anyway, the front desk staff did make us arrangements to stay at another hotel for the first night since they were booked and did set up the winery tour for the next day. We also found out that you can get a $179 per night rate on TravelZoo.com. The person helping us told us it would be better to separate out our packages and pay the TravelZoo rate plus the separate costs of the services. (This actually turned out to cost us more, but not by much). Some rooms in the hotel do actually look out onto a vineyard and our room was one of those. Unfortunately, the bed was uncomfortable and so we asked to be moved to another room the second night, which cost us the view.

It took about an hour and a half to get their from the San Fran airport.

However, I point out that a holiday with enough occupancy such that we could not get an early checkin (housekeeping was unable to get a room cleaned between 12 and 3 PM) warrants more staff. When we arrived at 11 am, there was one person at the desk, who handled room service calls, reservation calls, us, and other guests.

Later that afternoon, when we came back at 3 in hopes of a room, there was a different person at the desk, who was unaware of our arrival or that we'd asked for early checkin. The day we left, same juggling of things by the sole person on duty. I note this just in case a reader is expecting a Ventana (Big Sur) type pamepering by staff. Not assured. On the other hand, the deluxe fireplace room was excellent, clean, modern. I'd trade off warm fuzzies from staff for this level of comfort and cleanliness. My caveat is that they really MEAN IT when they say you cannot use the heat/fan when the fireplace is burning. As a result, the room was unleated and chilly until the fake log had burned out. If we come again, I'd skip the fireplace in wintertime, for that reason. We were in a room with a lovely view of vinyards (see pictures).

Fairmont Miramar, 2. Inn of the Spanish Garden, 3. Intercontinental - The Clement) - all booked on the strength of fellow TA traveller reviews. Keep up the good work folks. Of the 5, I was least impressed with the Napa Valley Lodge, despite it's number 1 rating for Yountville. Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly acceptable (clean, great staff, good breakfast buffett included, nice pool), but it was not impressive. First of all location wise, it's right off the highway. Although the rooms are VERY soundproof, this is not what I would call a great location. There are no nice views of anything from the rooms - but you don't really come here for the views do you. The staff was wonderful, very accomodating and solicitous. For some reason they thought it was our anniversary (?), and gave us a gift of a nice bottle of red wine. The room was really nothing special, except for the bathroom which was quite elegent and spacious. The main room felt a bit like a upscale motel, although the beds were extremely comfortable. I would expect a little higher end furnishings in the main area when I'm paying $350 a night. The pool area was very nice though, and the breakfast buffet quite acceptable. Note that all the tables are seating for about 8, so you are forced to share a table with other guests for breakfast. Not a bad thing - unless your very antisocial and really just want to keep to yourself. A couple of smaller tables would not hurt. You do have the option of putting your goodies on paper plates and noshing by the pool. Not a bad way to start the morning at all. Papers are also available as you walk in. Overall I would stay here again if I had no other choice, it was quite acceptable, but seemed overpriced compared to what we got at the Inn of the Spanish Garden - which would be a good equivalent type \"small\" hotel. There seemed to be other hotels closer to downtown that certainly looked nicer from the outside, but I do not know what they cost or looked like inside. I would check them out for sure next time I visit Napa. Note that even Frommers (highly rated Canadian travel book series, which I normally rely on besides TA) also rated Napa Valley Lodg highly, and noted it was a \"find\". Given the price of the other hotels Frommers has rated in Napa, no wonder - they other places start at $500 a night and go up! Perhaps what they mean is the Lodge is a find at this price. Can't disagree with that. FINAL NOTE: We did go to the Solage Calistoga for dinner only (wonderful meal), and while it was indeed very pricey (starts at $525 and goes up), I almost regret not spending the extra $200 a night for a truly memorable experience for two nights. What we saw of the main restaurent area, pool and general grounds was quite amazing. Beautiful to say the least. TA was right on about the restaurents in the area. See my review of Redd (great).

We had a room with a fireplace, which I would highly recommend. The room itself was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom area was also very nice and the shower was wonderful - plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The only negative about the hotel was that there was a draft from the front door - and because it wasn't well-sealed, you could hear all the noise from the parking lot out front - people talking, etc. It was likely made worse due to some noisy people in the room next door. That said, you could not hear the noise in the bedroom area, so it was totally workable. A few people also commented on the fact that the hotel is near the busy main road, but this wasn't really an issue because you couldn't hear the traffic noise in the room. Additionally, many of the hotels in these areas are right off the main road, so it's hard to avoid unleass you go to one of the more expensive resorts. There are many good restaurants in this area as well - Mustard's Grill and Hurley's were two of our favorites. And the best part of our trip was a recommendation by the hotel front desk to check out the Kuleto Vineyard - it is off the beaten path, but well worth the visit - great people, beautiful grounds, perfect wine!

The architecture of the hotel is glorified motel. You have to walk outside thru the car park to get from the lobby to your room Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was large with generic business feel to the furnishings. We had one of the standard rooms with 2 queen size beds. Bedding was only adequate no dream bed here. Very nice high end products in the otherwise dreary bathroom. Breakfast was a continental buffet. Those who travel on business would recognise the selection bagels, croissants and few sad Danish. Not what you expect in the gourmet capital of California. The breakfast room is clearly used as a meeting room. It is dark and uncomfortable. Somehow sharing a large round table with 2 kids and their parents was not what we had in mind when we heard about the Champagne breakfast included in the room rate.. When you can eat by the pool I am sure it seems better The pool and spa were nice. As other reviewers have pointed out it is a great location for visiting the wine country but so are all the other lodgings in Yountville. Overall if you came here on a conference or got a great rate you would be satisfied but it lacks charm and ambience for a special event.

It is, however, one of the most wonderfully reconditioned motels it has ever been my pleasure to stay in, bar none. The rooms are beautifully appointed, large, and plush.

The complimenary breakfast was fine. Not opulent, but let's face it: Who wants to eat a big breakfast when lunch in Napa and Sonoma is a culinary adventure, every single day?
