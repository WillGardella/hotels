{"Reviews": [{"Content": "For Budge-Conscious Only I wanted cheap, cheap, cheap near Union Square for one night. I paid $59, and I think this was still a low-end price in a neighborhood of hostels, run-down hotels, homeless, junkies and metal security gates on every door. The area is one of the most disgusting I have ever seen in any city. What is going on in San Francisco that this can't be cleaned up?  The good news for budget-minded travelers is that the hotel androoms aren't bad, and it is within walking distance to Market Street and the fancy hotels and department stores in Union Square. The tiny room looked refreshed with decent, clean linens on a king bed, a polished granite counter on the vanity and the same granite siding in the shower. They provide a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo. Security seems good, with double locks on the door. I also was rewarded with a perfect view of a whale mural a la Wyland from my wndow.But my advice is - if you can afford better, go for it..", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR507953270", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mikeLA"}, {"Content": "Hell hole This motel was absolutely disgusting. We arrived on a Sunday and so the parking was tight, very few spots left, most were on the right on the footpath, so anyone walking past could scratch your car. The room just gave off a bad vibe as soon as you opened the door.The carpet had obviously been cleaned recently because it was still wet when we got to our room and it smelt horrible. The bathroom was tiny, the window looked out onto an alley behind the hotel (no fence) and also no flywire to stop anyone getting in throught it. There was also a sharps container in the bathroom. The beds had horrible plastic coverings underneath the sheets, which made a loud crackling noise anytime you moved. The beds also dipped in the middle so my partner and I ended up pretty much sleeping on top of each other in the middle of the bed. We were on a very tight budget and at $80 a night, this was the cheapest motel that we could find. I have stayed in much nicer cleaner hotels for a lot ocheaper than that. Spend the extra money and get a decent place, even if yo have a tight budget.

This place is a dump! I read that it was remodeled...well if they went for a dirty, dated look, they accomplished it! There is no A/C, and it was a warm day when I check in. Windows do not have screens and it smelled aweful. My room was a small triangle broom closet with a nasty bed, nasty furniture, burn marks everywhere, probably from the crack addicts that seem to be there. I didn't stay, I checked out and moved to another hotel. I would not reccommend anyone staying there.
