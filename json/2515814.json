Marriott didn't get to be as big as it is by being shoddy. You know what to expect. A clean, well appointed room and consistent service. That's what you get here. We travel with pets, so any location that allows dogs is already high on our list. This location is owned and operated by the mother ship, Marriott International, so pets are allowed as long as you sign a waiver and pay a $100 fee. There is no need to be squeamish about the room, you know it's clean, so take off your shoes, walk around and your socks stay clean. The pool chemicals are balanced and water is clear. The staff is friendly, the parking lot is well lit, security is visible but unobtrusive and you feel safe. This location has been remodeled so the amenities are fresh. The people mover station is right across the street. Yes, the experience can be a little vanilla by Las Vegas standards, but it's a nice getaway from all the glitzy plastic that Vegas is known for. This location is very close to the strip, with many great \"off the strip\" places to dine in the immediate vicinity. Efficiency that can rival a German railroad can have it's ups and downs. When we arrived we were told that check-in was at 4 p.m. and absolutely no rooms would be available before that time. Trying to find entertainment for family and dogs while the room is being readied proved harder than expected. When I inquired if the desk clerk could take my cell number and call me if a room opened earlier, Chris told me they had a lot of experience doing this, and absolutely no room would be open before the 4 p.m. I'm not sure how several hundred rooms all come clean at precisely the appointed hour. On the flip side, we were extended the courtesy of a late check out.

It has a shelf above, where you could stash work papers and laptop if you need the table for eating a meal. There is also a complete kitchen and fireplace.

I was happy to find this Residence Inn very close to the Strip (very close!), yet much quieter and no hassle of parking (lots of free parking here).

I loved the room. She also provided me with a ton of information on Las Vegas, including where to go for free parking, etc. (a lot of the casinos want you to come in and offer free parking garages - don't ever pay to park in Vegas!). I appreciated all the information. The grounds are magnificent. You can see by my photographs the manicured grounds. There's a common garden area with benches, and a barbeque grill. There's also a fabulous pool and there was a hot tub right outside my room. The hotel is very big, with several buildings. It is more like an apartment complex than a hotel. The rooms are fully equipped with everything - including fast Internet (it's not wi-fi). I had 2 TVs, a living room, full kitchen, and the 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. It was very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable - standard excellent Marriott quality. After a night on the Strip, I was glad I picked a hotel away from it. It's noisy and crowded on the Strip and I don't particularly care for all those very high-rise hotels. My choice could not have been more perfect. The breakfast in the morning is the icing on the cake. It was a delicious full breakfast bar in a sunny, large room over by the pool area - couldn't be better. Also, not that I cared, but this hotel is located right next to the convention center. It is also only a few steps away from a little metro-rail public transportation thing - if you choose not to drive around the Strip. As great as this hotel was, the best thing about it was the staff. All fantastic! I reallly enjoyed my stay here. Oh, and the perfect Las Vegas weather didn't hurt! And the price - very reasonable for Vegas. No complaints there. p.s.

She also gave me an honest rate -- rather than take advantage of a tired guest. The large suite/room contained a full kitchen and a comfortable couch sitting area. Everything was immaculate! As we were walking back to the desk for paperwork, she urged me to take advantage of the complimentary dinner -- which was about to shut down for the night.

Turn right at Audrie St. Now you are behind Planet Hollywood casino (formerly Aladdin) where there is FREE parking! It's actually their mall parking lot. Very convenient mid-strip parking.

I was in town for the SHRM Annual Human Resources Conference and for some SHRM Academy Classes as well as some post conference golf. The SHRM Conference which attracted over 22,000 attendees was across the street (six lanes, busy at times) in the LV Convention Center and Hilton next door to LVCC. When there is not much traffic - early morning and some evenings, you can just walk across the street otherwise you have to go the lights. Which can be a bit unpleasant during a hot, hot day. The weather was quite hot (102-106) I took Greyline Shuttle Bus from the airport to the Residence Inn. It cost about $7.00. The ResidenceInn is away from the Strip on Paradise road and across from the L.V. Convention Center. Which makes it convenient for those attending the convention but it is far from the Strip. I walked to the strip from the Residence Inn but it was during the morning and in the evening. It is a long walk, 15 minutes plus and it is much tougher when it is hot. I also walked to Riviera Hotel one evening for a show. The Monorail is a better way to get to the strip and I purchased online a 10 ride ticket. The Monorail goes from the Sahara to the MGM Grand and makes around 7 stops on the East side of the Strip. Getting to the Monorail from the Hotels can be a bit tricky. On Convention Center Road and Las Vegas Blvd., there is a Walgreens, where I picked up beverages, snacks and some medicine, because I caught a minor cold during my stay. It is a long walk when carrying bags in the heat. Next door to Residence Inn is a Courtyard and you can use the Courtyard Gym because this property does not have Gym. Down the street is the Rennisance Hotel. My SHRM Academy classes were at Venetian and there were shuttle buses from the convention center to the Venetian compliments of Kronos. I choose this Residence Inn because of the proximity to the Convention Center, the Monorail and because there was a refridgerator in the room (which comes in handy when the weather is hot). Using my AAA card, I booked some advanced reservations online and I paid several during rates during my stay between $129.00 and $169.00. I checked in Friday, around 12:00 noon, and the friendly front desk person from Wisconsin was able to check me into a \"quiet\" room upstairs near the back of the property. The room was a bit old but clean. Featured a queen size bed and sofa bed. This Residence Inn offers a better than average breakfast in the morning (alternates between bacon, sausage, corn beef hash, pancakes, andeggs, potatoes, donuts, pastries, breads, make your own waffles, fruits and beverages), as well light snack (Meatloaf, mash potatoes, salad and Chicken Cesar Salad and cookies and beer) around dinner time from Monday thru Thursday. For complimentary meals they both were fine. Complimentary Web access in the Gatehouse as well as Wall Street Journal and local newspaper. This Residence Inn is a bit older and reminds me of the Cal Expo Residence Inn in Sacramento. My bed was of average comfort and the room was cleaned each day by Maria. The A.C. worked well but was a bit noisy and behind my wall must have been a loft room because I could hear some creaking at times during the night. Also there were some young Volleyball competitors in the units nearby and sometimes they stayed up late and you could hear them chatting outside. My front door required a particular pull the handle as you insert the card key to open. I reported this and a problem bedside light to \"Sang,\" at the front desk. Nothing was done about it so I mentioned the light to another Marriott employee and it was fixed when returned from my conference. So service is not a priority at this property. There is small sport court and small pool at this property. Plenty of parking spots and you need your room key to open a gate into the parking lot. Driving in and out of this property is not real smooth because you can only go South on Paradise Road when driving out of this property. If I could get a really good rate, I might stay at this property again but I would also consider the Renissance Hotel as well as Residence Inn in the Hughes Center, though the Monorail is not accessible from the R.I. in the Hughes Center. Service at this property was less than the Beverly Hills R.I. and Manhattan R.I. If you looking for a property close to the convention center and close to the Monorail with a kitchen facility then this property might be your place.

There was a regular queen bed in one room and a murphy style bed in the other. I slept on the murphy bed and found it surprisingly comfortable. The pool was warm - not huge, but nice with lots of clean towels (the pool towels were softer than the room towels). The hot tub was great - loved the jets for our tired feet. A full breakfast is included with the room rate - eggs, toast, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, muffins, etc etc etc. The front desk staff was not great - this was the only bad thing about it. They forgot our wakeup call one morning and the alarm clock did not work. They were slow to check us in, and did not tell us we had a package waiting for us. There was a coin laundry - $1 for washer or dryer. The cab ride to the airport was just over $10, not including tip - which is better than the airporter if you have more than one person (airporter is $6 and the driver took us to 2 other Marriotts before the correct one - even though we clearly told him which Marriott it was and we were the only ones on the bus). The monorail is a great way to get to the strip - it takes you to many of the major hotels & casinos. There was room to park our 12 foot trailer and our jeep right close to our room. We had an upper story (they call it a penthouse) room and had to carry our bags up 2 flights of stairs - no elevator.
