Upon arriving at the hotel Isabelle, the owner, greeted us with the news that the travel agent I had booked with hadn't paid for our room even though I had paid them. She allowed me to use the hotel phone to call England to try and rectify the issue and was extremely pleasant throughout the process. While waiting for the travel agent to call us back she gave us some drinks and snacks on the house. After a couple of hours the problem had been resolved and because of the trouble she upgraded us to a more superior room at no extra cost. Our room was fantastic, so to was breakfast and any other contact we had with the hotel staff over the course of our stay. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Paris. It is in a very nice area, got all the essential amenities close by, nice restaurants and bars. I will certainly be staying here again if / when I visit Paris again.

I initially chose the location for its proximity to Eurostar at Gare du Nord, just a short 10 minute stroll away. The Metro (Cadet) is 5 minutes away so all of Paris is really on the doorstep. We did plenty of walking though and could be at the Opera and shops on Bvd Hausmann in no time. A gentle morning stroll also found us in Montmartre with lovely views across Paris. The hotel say they do room service but we never used this owing to the wide variety of local eating options. The breakfast costs extra but is a good feed of croissants, rolls, fruits, juice, cheese, etc. The staff were friendly and seemed appreciative of my stabs at French although they speak English just fine. The free wifi had me tearing my hair out at times though with connections continually dropping in our room. The room was on the ground floor and was big enough for our purposes. It was clean and the bed comfortable. A mini bar is available and so is French TV. The wet room shower was excellent - a real pleasure. I've stayed in so many hotels where the shower is a disappointment of dribbling water, sometimes hot and sometimes cold but this was up there with the best. The Hotel de la Tour d'Auvergne helped make our first trip to Paris a most enjoyable experience. I certainly recommend it.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Truro, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDelightful Paris boutique hotel with 5 Star service!\u201d", "Author": "Duchysue", "ReviewID": "UR124465758", "Content": "Having booked a bargain break with Railbookers via Eurostar to Gare du Nord, we did wonder what sort of hotel we would get at this bargain price but we were delighted! Hotel de la Tour d'Auvergne is a really super hotel, on a quiet street, friendly and helpful staff - even with our limited French! Great room, well furnished and warm but not too hot and the window opened, which is a bonus! Fabulous and generous Continental breakfast, juice, fruit, yogurt plus mini pastries, lovely butter and jams, wonderful coffee (avoid tea unless you take your own teabags!!) - kept us going til mid afternoon, which saved the cost of one meal each day and given that Paris is pretty expensive anyway, this was another plus! Beds were very comfortable and the shower powerful and efficient - shower room/toilet not huge but it is not a priority on a budget break!! Local facilities were wonderful, great cafes and small, typically French food shops - enjoy it all and worry about the weight when you get back!!! Walking distance of the beautiful Sacre Coeur and fantastic views across Paris - as well as into L'Opera and the main sights. Indeed a perfect place to stay!

Found it on Tripadvisor. We chose this hotel as the RER from Charles De Gaule arrives at Gare de Nord and there is a 6 min walking distance from the station. Line #7 runs just below so from the hotel you can access the centre in a short amount of time. The hotel interior design is modern and the stylish, as the hotel room. The breakfast is not a buffet, you are being served a plate of cheese, yoghurt, pancake and some bread. Together with croissants, jam, juice and coffee. I rather have it like this instead of a large buffet. So I can only recommend the breakfast. The staff is friendly and helpful and you are able to store your luggage on leaving day.

I definitely will stay here again when I am next in town. Hotel - good position.Quite road, beautiful decor both inside and out. Thoughtfully decorated. Position about 10 mins from Gare du Nord, 5 mins to the nearest metro - cadet/Poissonere. That is the pink line which goes straight to La fayette (city centre) and also de Louvre thus no need to change. Free safe and secure baggage storage after you check out. Sacre coure is only 10 mins walk from the hotel. Room - what can I say? Quiet, romantic, beautiful decor, LCD tv with option for English language if you can work out the system (we did!), decent enough toiletries but I have always preferred my own. Bathrrom + shower so that is handy. There's hairdryer. The closet is small but enough for the two of us (we stayed for 4 nights). Lift is very small but that is no suprise from Paris old building. We loved it. And fantastic mattress - so so comfortable! And it was winter - room was not too hot and perfect warmth. Breakfast - lasts us till 2 pm and we have around 9 am. Croissonts, crepes, yoghurt, option for hot chocolate, tea, fresh coffee - beautifully presented. Staff - marvellous! Isabelle is lovely, always smiling, helpful and definitely been very good when I contacted her via email. We had no trouble at all and would like to say thank you to their attentive service! I don't think there's much of a downside to this place - nearby there's lots of eatery places, pharmacy, boulangere etc. It is NOT the centre of Paris but with the metro you are only 10 mins ride away from metro. We walked from hotel to the Seine and that took us about 35 to 50 mins or so. Overall highly recommended! Oh the wi-fi is crap but who cares.. I was in Paris.. and I rather spend time looking round then fumbling about on the wi-fi telling half the world how crap the connection is .", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5 Star treatment\u201d", "Author": "290Flossie71", "ReviewID": "UR121544516", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at this hotel.

We booked it through hotwire and got a good rate. The hotel isn't in the city center and is a short walk from the metro, but it worked out pretty well. The lady who runs it isn't the friendliest lady in town and doesn't seem to really like Americans, but she keeps the hotel clean and efficient. And at the end of the day, that's all we cared about. We stayed in room 51 which was on the fifth floor. It had two twin beds and was a good size room for french standards and the bathroom was pretty nice. The hotel is kept clean and is quiet. The hotel has a grocery store just around the corner from it which is very convenient for out of towners who want to buy some water, soda, or snacks. The Gard De Nord tran station is very close by too. It's about five blocks away. In fact we took a cab from the train station when we arrived, but we actually walked with our luggage to it when we left. The closet metro stop is the Cadet stop which is about four blocks from the hotel. That stop works well because it's on the line that runs downtown to the Louve and the main city centre. This was my first trip to Paris, so the hotel worked well and was a good rate, but I will probably not stay there again because it's too far from the parts of town I like which is the left bank or the Champs. No major complaints though and if you stay here it will probably work well for the right price. We paid $125 a night through hotwire. Also, the hostess was very nice to let us bring our bags to the hotel prior to our check-in time and also let us leave them for the day once we checked out, because our flight didn't leave until that evening. All and all - it's a good place.

The hotel is in a great location, just south of the Montmartre district and only 10 mins walk for the Gare de Nord rail station. The welcome was warm and efficient and we were shown to our room. It's quite a stylish hotel and our room had the front of a Fiat 500 on the wall with working lights which looked cool. Due to being a ground floor room, it was quite dark and so lighting had to be used all the time. Due to being a boutique type hotel I was quite surprised by the lack of toiletries in the bathroom. This stay was a bit of a treat, but the only complementary items were two mini bars of soap and a shower cap. Now, you get these items at an Etap or Formula 1 hotel and I guess I expected something a little better as the cost saving can't be that great. The shower itself was excellent though. The only other complaint I would have is that the downstairs rooms are next to the breakfast area and despite the inclusion of a small hallway the noise can be quite loud from this area. It did mean that we were awoken at 6am by the sound of cups and plates being arranged for breakfast. I suppose we could have asked for a room change, but we were settled by the point we found out, so a pillow over the head worked instead! Maybe it would be a better idea to lay the table for breakfast the night before? If I hadn't had these complaints I would have given it a rating of 4 as the location and helpfulness of the staff was excellent.

Unfortunately we were unable to access the bar or facilities as they were being decorated, and no tea and coffee facilities were available in the room, so we kept pestering the reception staff for refreshments who did not hesitate to provide on request, at any hour. we would definitely return and enjoyed our 3 day christmas stay", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cthey aren't very friendly to American travelers\u201d", "Author": "sportsprgirl", "ReviewID": "UR81085478", "Content": "My family and I were on a multi country vacation with Paris being our last stop.

The manager Isabella did not speak good english so it came out very harsh. She told us \"One of you MUST leave rigt now\" We were quite taken aback. It was fashion week so there was no other hotels in the city. She said it wasnt her problem and we needed to leave now. Not only were we asked to leave but were told that since we didnt give a 24 hour notice we would be charged for the two rooms that we could not check in to. It was quite a scene. Long story short, the management staff is horrible, the rooms are super tiny and if you stay on the 5th floor you have to walk up one flight of stairs as the elevator only goes as high as the 4th floor.

We were in a room on the 5 floor so we had to drag our bags up one flight of stairs that was no more than 2 feet wide. We were also traveling with a family that was travelling with one adult and two children. The travel agent that booked the room apparently made a default reservation for two people. The hotel refused to allow them to check into their room which was a two twin bed room because they did not list the third person. They were not allowed to check into the hotel. The receptionist, Isabelle, told them, \"One of your children must go!\" Unbelievable! Isabelle was so indignant and made several insults about Americans. Also, the area is shady. I cannot warn you enough, DO NOT STAY HERE! As a disclaimer, this is the only negative review, I have ever written on tripadvisor.

We booked through Hotwire and were very happy with the location. We were able to walk to all attractions in Paris from here, with Montmartre and the Opera being the closest. There is fairly convenient access to the Metro from the hotel as well as to Gare du Nord. The hotel front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. They always greeted us with a smile and assisted us in booking train travel to other parts of France. The room was a decent size for the 3 of us (2 adults, 1 infant) and the bathroom appeared to be newly renovated. The furnishings in the room were a little worn and the floor could have been cleaner. Overall, the state of the room was not bad. What made our stay frustrating is that my wife was missing several articles of clothing after our stay. We searched the room intensively thinking the missing clothes were under the bed or in a corner somewhere but they were not. We did not remove any clothing from the room during our stay and could even verify that we had these items of clothing in our digital photos (we literally wracked our brains thinking we were wrong). We brought the matter up to the staff and they appeared surprised and concerned, but nothing was done about the matter. We had a little bit of correspondence with the hotel since leaving Paris but nothing has been done. It is a small matter, but could have been much worse had it been passports, money, cameras, etc. that had been taken from the room. Because of this, I do not recommend the hotel.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cWould go again!

Also, we decided it would be a good idea to save a little on the hotel to be able to spend more on good restaraunts, souvenirs, entertainment, etc. It was a good decision. For $130 per night in July, it's a great choice. Location: not the best, but not the worst either. It's about 15 minutes walk from the Opera house and about 15 minutes walk to Sacre Coeur on Monmartre. The hotel is located on a quiet, safe street, but if you move about several blocks towards Monmartre you would reach a neighborhood with many sex shops and strip joints, which is, while being very picturesque, is probably not the safest place in Paris to walk at night. Rooms: very small, which is typical for Paris, but have stylish new furniture, and very cute and very French overall. The bed was small (and not soft) and the window was facing the street, so we woke up several times because of the street noice. Service: It was good. Some people were more knowledgable and pro-active than others, but overall, everyone was friendly and helpful. Breakfast: typical French. Everyone gets 2 croissants (regular and chocolate), 1 bread roll, 1 crepe, cheese, fruit cup, sour cream, jam, butter, coffee or tea. Other things to know: nearest Metro station is Cadet, which is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Nearest parking garage is also about 5 minutes walk and would cost you 24 euros per 24 hours. You can also park on the street, but it's also paid, and there's often no spots available, and given how people in Paris drive and park, you don't want to risk a rented car. A cab drive from Monmartre to the hotel cost us 9 euros. So after you hang out there near Sacre Coeur, have drinks, and take off at 2am, I wouldn't recommend walking down, but rather taking a cab.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel, neat and tidy and just where you want it.\u201d", "Author": "RogerAckroyd", "ReviewID": "UR28345970", "Content": "Second visit to this great little hotel.

The lift is very small and will take just one person. Going up to the third or fourth floor can be a bit of a puff on foot so ask for lower floor accommodation if you don't like lifts (like me) or find stairs a bit of a task. Rooms are clean and tidy and shower bath is small but adequate. Staff very friendly and helpful (and speak English).

With Montmartre only 5 min away u can enjoy the endless amount of caf\u00e8s and restaurant and of course Sacre Cour -bring a bottle of wine and sit down on the stairs leading to Sacre Cour - people watching is great fun! Area around the hotel is great, lots of small shops and restaurants, caf\u00e8s. In this area u experience the real french atmosphere, I would never have stayed in the area around Champs Elysees, its way too busy and too many tourists. And overpriced! You pay almost double for a cafe creme there. Living close to Montmartre is in my opinion the best choice. And for those who think french are arrogant, think again! The french are very polite and helpful and they do speak english! Tho they do really appreciate if u know some french words, like pardon, s'il vous plait, bon jour, bon soir, merci.
