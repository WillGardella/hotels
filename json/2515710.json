Faced with room charges well north of $300 apiece, we cast our net wider and recalled seeing a Crowne Plaza in Mission Valley near another popular meeting site. We got three rooms for about a third of the downtown cost, with a continental breakfast thrown in, plus, on weekdays, free drinks, in the Priority Club lounge. (We didn't take advantage of these because we usually stayed downtown until late.) The property is rather senior but well maintained, with a Hawaiian theme that is relatively tastefully executed. The bar has a happy hour in the evenings M-F and a curious 10 pm to midnight one seven days a week, and serves good sushi (the salmon sashimi, which I tried, was very good, and generously supplied). The free breakfast is adequate, with an unusually good selection of fruit. On two mornings the straight coffee ran out, leaving us with only a rather icky flavored coffee; this would be easy to avoid. We used the restaurant once and found the food to be average, with no healthy choices available, as is all too common. The rooms were large and nicely furnished, with a nice view over the courtyard and pool. Free Internet is available via a pass code supplied at check-in, which makes me wonder whether it is always free. I did not use it, depending on my rooted Android's hotspot instead. We stayed on the eighth floor, which we were amused to see was a \"quiet zone\" where a sign informed us that tour groups and circus animals were not allowed. Nice touch, and appreciated. Downtown is very easy to get to. Simply take the 8 west then the 5 south to Front street. With light traffic it takes about ten minutes. All told, a pleasant, drama-free stay.

All in all, we got very good value from this property. Decent restaurant service, adequate housekeeping, and staff who were eager to please. Rooms were adequately furnished although they could use an upgrade. One of the interesting features which guests may find either great or annoying are the hotel's \"green\" efforts at saving on electricity in the bathrooms. Our bathroom had motion activated lights which were set to stay on for a specified length of time. The annoying part comes in when a guest needs the lights to stay on for a longer period (lights going off while one is in the shower); the other annoying part could be when a guest has to go in the middle of the night and the bathroom lights go on whether you want them to or not. My suggestion would be to provide something that would allow guests to \"override\" the standard settings. Something else that we did not find too pleasant were the daily charges for internet use. I guess we're spoiled by free wi-fi offered by many hotels and we were not too willing to pay the $9.95 per day charged by the Crowne Plaza, but we did anyway because we wanted the connectivity. The hotel service for our group reception was outstanding. We had a good size room and they provided whatever we needed for our event. The appetizer and dessert buffet provided good variety and excellent quality.

The hotel is conveniently located to most points of interest in San Diego, there are a lot of places to eat and shop nearby as well. Old Town is fairly close. My stay at the hotel for the most part was pleasant and uneventful. The hotel appears to be somewhat older and in need of a makeover. It was clean, I just didn't care for the decor in the rooms. The hotel has a nice outdoor pool but when I stayed there the water was not heated. The outdoor jacuzzi/spa nearby was nice and big and the jets worked without any problems. Although the gym had just about any cardio piece of equipment you would expect to find in a gym, including free weights, it just seemed sort of dull and tired and not a place where you would enjoy staying for a while to break a sweat. There were a few occasions where I noticed that the meals from room service have been left by the room door for staff to pick up and some of the plates remained in front of the room for an entire day which leads me to believe that the staffing may be a little low. The store/gift shop seemingly had no set hours of operation and for the most part it was hit or miss on when you could go in to grab a snack or whatever. The breakfast if you were an \"Aloha member\" was complimentary and it was quite decent with everything you would imagine for breakfast available. The rooms as I mentioned need an update although the TV's are flat screen which was nice as was the balcony which you access through a large sliding door. The bathrooms were okay but don't expect to be able to stand under the shower head in the tub unless you are 4 feet tall as the shower head is mounted low on the wall and that is mostly due to the \"drop ceiling\" over the bathtub. The front desk staff was courteous and my room was made up each of the three days I was there.

It was far too warm for working out and no a/c control was in sight to adjust it, so I propped it open with a towel to let the cool air in from outside (it was in the 50's the weekend we were there). I just do not understand the concept of $12 parking at a suburban hotel with tons of space. Note to management: Just increase the rate and include it. You basically need a car to get to this property and to go anywhere once you are there. This annoyance has spread from downtown properties where parking is a problem and the fees can be justified to the 'burbs nation wide. The wedding by the way was great, but that had little to do with the hotel. This Crowne Plaza was not of the overall high standard we have experienced at other properties of this chain.

No bedroom slippers - but I guess this is standard of most American hotels. Bring your own towel if you're fussy about \"yellowing\" towels (but they were clean and I didn't contract any skin conditions from them). The worst: 1) STOLEN PHONE Left my phone charging on the table and when I got back one hour after check-out, I found housekeeping in the room. My phone (along with charger and convertible plug) was gone. Not really sure what else to think except that they stole it, especially since there is no CCTV to the room for verification on who entered and exited with it. No one else had access to the room but the hotel since it was locked when we checked out. Hotel staff were helpful enough to help me to search the room and staff but it was likely they put it somewhere else already (remember to always keep your data roaming ON or else the Find your iPhone program won't work). Still waiting on a call from the hotel insurance company - let's see if they really follow through on this since it's the least they can do. Nothing yet and it's been a week. I don't expect my phone to be around one week later, but in the space of ONE HOUR and with the housekeeper in the room, the blatant dishonesty was appalling. 2) BAD SECURITY The lack of CCTV in the corridor was kind of worrying - if something happened to us in the room or if we found our items stolen we'd never be able to tell who it was. 3) BAD INTERNET SERVICE Wired internet was EXTREMELY SLOW. Do not expect any connectivity at this hotel. Wireless only located by the pool and at the lobby which is miles away and impractical if you're staying in Block E. I will never stay here again. There is nothing worse than dishonest staff which really reflects on the hotel's reputation.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angelos", "Title": "\u201cNICE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "michaelhopper3", "ReviewID": "UR116035794", "Content": "Not a bad place to stay.

Knowing that hotel circle is just a few minutes from Sea World, the location suited us just fine. We have an affinity for the Holiday Inn Express group, etc but it was so last minute that the ones closer in town were booked We have never stayed at a Crowne Plaza before, and the pictures of the property looked great - so we decided to give it a try. The pictures don't lie - it really IS a beautiful property. Our room was in one of the best locations. The room faced south looking down at the pool area, while the front door of our room led to an outdoor hallway looking down at the gorgeous atrium area. The walkout balcony was large and had a table and chair set. So those are the pros. The cons: -When booking the room I looked on the website and saw there was a microwave and mini fridge, However, when we got to our room, there was NO such appliance. As we had intended to keep our cooler contents in the fridge, and perhaps make breakfast in the morning, this was not good. We try to make these weekend trips on a budget and eating out every meal is not an option. Apparently, upon review of the website later, only *some* rooms have these appurtenances. -Room was musty, and smelled of smoke from years past (not recent) Then again, we're from the desert, and humidity generally smells musty to us! :) -Bathroom, while clean, definitely needed some work. Tile / gyp board was lifting up from past water stains, etc. Grout was very old. Rust stains in tub, etc. The things you usually see in older hotels that haven't been completely gutted in last twenty years. So, it's an OK hotel. If you need a fridge, ask for one - not all rooms apparently have them. The beautiful grounds and wonderful pool almost made up for the so-so guest room. Almost. Just don't pay more than you would for a midlevel hotel. One note: The parking. I saw several complaints in the previous reviews concerning the small size of the parking lot & spaces. They're not that small. They're normal for a larger compacted urban area. If you're trying to get a huge Escalade in one, then maybe you'll have trouble.

Please keep in mind if you are going to stay here that this property is a privately held hotel that used to be a Red Lion Hotel and shows it's age.

I am also a priority club member and asked John at the front desk for a later courtesy check out - due to a late flight out and at first he said \"no\" because he said that the hotel was sold out and they needed us out to clean the room on time. Now all I asked for was maybe till 2 o' clock and after some thought he extended it to 1 o'clock. I later found out that some other person wanted to get a room for that night and had no problem buying a room! So I asked John why he told me he was sold out when he was clearly not, he then proceeded to tell me that they were 97% sold out! All I was asking for was a small courtesy.... By the way he also stated that if I was not out of the room by 1pm that I would be charged for a 1/2 day... nice. I think the owners of this hotel have to remember that hotel industry in this area is very competitive and some flexibility would go a long way. If you are in this area choose another hotel there is a brand new Marriott Courtyard Inn just down the street I'm sorry that I did not book with them I will next time though!

But it is some way to the centre of San Diego, so not the place to be if you want to spend most of your time exploring the city. Close to I8 freeway. To downtown by car is 10 mins. (Cab $15). Bus (No88) then Trolley is $2.25 per person. (About 30 mins.) However the hotel has four shuttle buses which will take you to the Old Town transit station, Fashion Valley shopping mall, zoo and golf club etc. (free) This is a good service but just as well, as there are no shops or other facilities in the hotel circle. Arrival Large covered entry area for cars with porters at the ready for bags. Also large entry foyer. Check-in was fast and no problems. Very helpful staff. We did not use porters as it was smooth rolling all the way to the room. The public areas are decorated in Hawiian style with lush tropical gardens in the atrium and around the pool area. The room Our room was on the top floor (8). The balcony has panoramic views which takes in a green hillside, the freeway, the river and Sea World in the distance. The Good The room itself is quite large with a separate entry area and plush decoration with four large antique prints and a large flower print on the walls. Furniture everywhere including the two QS beds, a monster centre piece housing the TV, fridge, microwave, safe, hanging space and three large drawers. In addition to this we had a mid-sized office desk and a dressing table, both with chairs, a small dining table and two more chairs and drinks table on the balcony. Oh, and I didn't mention the large bedside table and yet another (built-in) robe. Some self-catering facilities, consisting of the fridge, microwave, coffee maker and the small dining table. (You can buy milk, juice etc from the small coffee shop in the mornings.) The beds are very firm but OK, and come with no less than seven pillows each. Internet access via cable, and there is a clock radio with CD player and a coffee maker. The A/C is very effective. An iron and board are also included. Room service. Free newspaper (delivered if requested). Noise at night is very low; just occasional plumbing sounds and corridor shouters. The bathroom is OK size for one person at a time. Lots of towels. Bath and shower, wide bench top and a few extra facilties. Good hot and cold water pressure. Small heater in the ceiling. The Bad No mini-bar. Lighting is OK but no bed-side control. No direct reading or ceiling lights and no light over the dining table or on the balcony. While the TV has a good range of channels and pay-to-view services, it's all in NTSC analog, not digital, so it's a bit fuzzy. Internet is $10 per 24 hours. (No WiFi.) There's only one folding rack for bags. The bathroom has virtually no towel rails, no clothes hooks and no safety grab-rail for the bath/shower. As usual in American hotels, there is no floor drain in the bathroom. (I guess that's the hotel's problem should an accidental flooding occur.) Don't forget, room service menu prices are just the start: add 18% service, 9% tax, $2 delivery then the tip. General faciities. Attractive restaurants and lounge/bar areas. Tiny gift shop.

Sure they get you back by charging $12 for car parking and $10 for the internet but its worth it. The hotel itself is fine. Its laid out round the pool and and another courtyard and is 'motel' type with open corridors to the courtyards. The pool looked a bit small for the size of hotel and the separate spa is inconvenient - but its minor. Overall its not quite up to the normal very high standard of the Crowne Plaza brand but its fine and, at the rate, a real steal. The internet worked well. The small gym is adequate with 2 x-trainers, two joggers and two bikes with a small weight machine. Its clean and the kit is in good condition. The hotel is slightly isolated so its eating on-site or driving. Nothing in walking distance as far as I can tell. The on-site sushi restaurant was fine if a bit pricey and my pasta dish in the main restaurant was surprisingly good. There is a good value coffee and bagels outlet in the morning for those who don't want the full buffet breakfast. To address some of the criticisms in the other reviewers. I personally didn't have the 'battlefield' noise experience of others but it certainly got noticeably noisier over the weekend (with slammed doors and kids running in the corridor) as it filled up - despite being in the quieter rear of the hotel.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt the rooms were well-decorated - our room had framed floral prints on the walls - the bed was new and the linens were expensive. The carpet had a brown and gold checkered pattern and was new-ish and clean - and, yes, we checked to make CERTAIN the floors/carpets were clean after reading the other reviews. Even more important, the bathrooms were clean as well. There was no mildew in the bath/shower and the shower curtain hangs on a convex rod that keeps it from touching you during a shower. Fine. The vanity and floors were of the same matching tile - heavy, modern stuff. The vanity had two sinks - always a plus for my partner and me - it makes getting out in the mornings much more efficient. The free shower soaps and shampoos were of high quality and the towels were plush enough. The room (Room 1337 BTW) seemed to be recently renovated or was simply well-maintained. Not at all unpleasant. All of the above goes in the \"plus\" category. However, in the \"minus\" category: The hotel tries for a faux tropical feel (read: Hawaiian tat) but it is a very sad attempt at a theme that simply does not work. It is filled with poorly done (very perfunctory) water features - tacky, tacky, tacky - and the odd, sad, faded, captive coi that seemed to call out, \"Save me, kind sir, for God's sake end my misery.\" Ugh! One of the elevators was out. Really? On a holiday weekend? The real negative stuff started when we found that the hotel is built on large eight-story high horseshoe shaped courtyard. Not good! Every door that closed - no I got that wrong - EVERY DOOR THAT WAS SLAMMED SHUT and slammed shut EVERY TIME the doors were closed reverberated in our room like a cannon being fired. It was astounding the amount of noise that was generated and the number of booms we heard from these slamming doors - there were hundreds of them! HUNDREDS! Especially on Sunday morning! Yes, many other reviewers mention this fact - but take my word for this - I have NEVER experienced such a cacophony - I kept shouting, \"Incoming! and \"Take Cover!\" Wow! We went to San Diego because we have a season subscription at LaJolla Playhouse. We go to get away from the noise and pace of Los Angeles - not to attempt to relax in the middle of a reenactment of the Civil War. When we went out on the balcony and saw the state of the facilities and were not pleased at all. We were on the third floor overlooking the swimming pool. On either side of our balcony was the top of some sort of supporting structure or perhaps storage units. No matter, they are covered with ugly broken wooden lattices - they must have been new at some point - perhaps back in the early 1990s - now they are broken and junky and should be scrapped. There is trash and TOWELS that have been dropped from the floors above collected in these lattices and it is simply a mess. Ugh - again! It appears that the Management at the Crowne Plaza does only what is required and does not choose to go that little extra distance or put in that little extra effort to make a guest's stay NICE. Isn't NICE the goal? Well it oughta be! It doesn't have to be perfect - just NICE! Now on to the worst aspect of the place. The smoking! We cannot abide smoky hotel rooms and will move to another hotel instead of staying in a room that has been infused with cigarette smoke. One reason we chose the Crowne Plaza was that the entire wing we were in was SUPPOSED to be non-smoking. THAT IS A LAUGH! When we entered the room, I remarked that the place smelled like a hotel room - fresh linen - recently cleaned - you know, like a non-smoking hotel room usually smells - no smoke at all. So far so good. We WERE a bit put off by the \"survival kit\" that was on the bed when we entered though. Other reviewers have mentioned this \"kit\" but I will reiterate - it contains three very tell-tale objects. Ear-plugs - oh no! - a sleep mask to cover your eyes - say it ain't so! - and finally a tiny spray bottle of lilac linen freshener - huh? Well, I suppose that the first two items are self-explanatory - too much noise (see the report from the front-lines above) and too much light - although I did not find there was too much light in the room - and there was a drape clip attached to the drape pull that made keeping the light out a snap. (Perhaps this is for people whose closet lights will not go off - as mentioned in other reviews.) But as for the third item (the spray) it was not until late at night that we finally got it. Right in the kisser! Yes, our wing was non-smoking - the floors above us and below were non-smoking - but somebody, somewhere was smoking in that hotel - SEVERAL SOMBODIES IN FACT! Our room filled with noxious cigarette smoke at regular intervals ALL NIGHT LONG and it worsened in the morning when all those smokers somewhere in the Crowne Plaza (AND MY PARTNER AND I) - EVEN THOUGH WE *DON'T* SMOKE!!! - partook of that first cigarette of the day! Jeez! We needed gas masks (to maintain up the battlefield motif of this review.) Why claim non-smoking rooms at all when it is obvious that the air-conditioning or ventilation system is so poorly engineered that is simply sucks all the smoke from other parts of the hotel into your room anyway! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and another reason we will NEVER stay at the Crowne Plaza again. And let me assure you that tiny bottle of lilac linen spray is not sufficient to combat the onslaught of smoke. If only that were possible! A few other ideas in response to some of the other reviewers comments. The lights in our lighted closets DID do out when the doors were closed, so we did not have to contend with that. And I agree with some of the other reviewers - the safes are laughably small. About a foot wide and perhaps two inches deep. \"Really? Really? Then you try to get your valuables in there!\" And I don't travel with many valuables. Ludicrous! I found the staff friendly enough - unlike some of the other reviewers. The parking costs $12.00 for a 24-hour period and had in/out privileges. Pretty standard. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not draw and the room stayed steamy all morning - why?, why? Why ask why? Towels are provided at pool side. Very good. And there is a separate area for sun-bathers away from the pool itself. VERY GOOD! But I felt the pool was under-chlorinated (dangerous) and it was filled with dead insects - it needed to be skimmed. We got out when someone in the pool suggested it was filled with salt water. It was simply under-chlorinated so it did not seem like most other \"public\" pools that one experiences! Ugh - a third time! Skip this place if you are able. We got a deal on Hotwire that I feel was not worth it in hindsight. There are so many choices in Mission Valley as well as LaJolla and San Diego and environs - surely there are better hotels that the Crowne Plaza!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cTerrible experience\u201d", "Author": "MarthaEssex", "ReviewID": "UR19411527", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel from the 8th August until 13th August with another couple whilst we travelled along the west coast. The other hotels that we stayed in were beautiful and we assumed that because of the cost of this hotel and the good name it would be to. The reception area of the hotel was pleasant enough but as we began to walk to our room the hotel deteriorated and began to feel more like a motel. We were place on the ground floor overllooking the car park. Our balcony consisted of a dead cockroach and two minature smashed vodka bottles from a room above. When we firsted entered our room it was so dark that our eyes had to adjust. There are only lamps in the room and they seem to slightly brighten up after about 5 minutes, leaving the room quite dull and gloomy. The room is in need of refurbishment and the bathroom felt dirty. One day I dropped an earring and went down on the floor to look for it not a pleasant experience. The good thing about the room was the large comfortable bed. The wafer thin walls mean that you can hear the people in the next room word for word. One night our friends rang reception at three o'clock in the morning to complain about the gathering of people in the next room having a mini party. Reception said that they had alot of complaints about noise and that they would send security but they never did. After the third phone call they as good as said that they don't deal with noise issues as they are due to thin walls and not people being excessively loud. My husband and his friend used to play a game count to 10 before a door slams. No wonder they provide ear plugs and a sleep kit. The safety deposit box in the room is a joke. It is mounted in the side of the wardrobe and is about 2 1/2\" in depth. Infact our friends in the next room called us to look at it because it was so ridiculous, you had to try and pile items on top of each other and slam the door quickly before they fell out. The wardrobe in both our friends room and ours had an interior light working inside, unfortunatly the door in both wardrobes would not close properly at night so the light stayed on. Our friends had wedged a piece of paper in the door everyday when they went out and decided not to hang any clothes in that wardribe as it only contained the safe. Yet everyday when we arrived back at the room the door had been opened and the light was on. Who was looking at the safe? During my stay my perfume bottle managed to go down by a quarter even though only used to squirts of it a night. My husband and I were celebrating our first wedding anniversary during our holiday and I had taken my favourite expensive silk dress to wear on our anniversary . When we left this hotel and were packing I could not find the dress hanging in the wardrobe. My husband assumed that he had already packed it. When we arrived at the next hotel it was not in the suitcase. We spent $46 on phone calls trying to resolve the matter and were told that we would be contacted at our new hotel with their findings. We advised the Sheraton that we were expecting a phone call and were told that they had a messageing service but no message was left and they told us that they had not recieved a phone call from the Crowne Plaza. We are now back in England spending a small fortune on phone calls trying to resolve this matter and a new problem. We booked our holiday through expedia and paid in advance, on our return we found that without our knowledge the hotel charged us for our stay again. After two days of phone calls noone will talk to us about the matter so we are leaving the credit card company to deal with it.

Across the hall there is a great cocktail bar with a Sushi area. The bar also sells collectible ceramic Tiki mugs with their cocktails. (Order the \"Miehana\" cocktail which is \"Anaheim\" spelled backwards.) The gym is adequate and there is also a laundromat and massage spa onsite. The only minor complaint I had was the lack of a small fridge and microwave in the room. Besides the hotel's restaurant, there are no restaurants/fast food places within walking distance. As food is always a large expense while vacationing, it's nice to have a way of storing inexpensive food stuffs in your room. For the price of the room, a microwave/fridge would have been nice. Notwithstanding, I would definitely stay here again. I'll give this hotel an A- TIP: The hotel's room service is rather expensive. Instead, go downstairs to the Islands Restaurant and order carry-out. You'll save almost 50% on your bill.

They also accommodated our request to have three rooms right next to each other, which was nice (though my partner and I had a room just across the way from his two sisters\u2019 rooms instead of next door, but this was just perfectly fine). There were some nice fish tanks in the lobby along with a restaurant/bar, though we never went there. We were all on the ground floor, so we had nice little patios and grassy areas for the kids to run around on. The landscaping was pretty, with nicely kept plant life and some water features in the atrium that our front doors opened out to. Upon our return at the end of the day, the beds were always made, the towels replaced and the toiletries refreshed. The TV was large enough and it caught a variety of channels (not all of them, mind you), the desk was large (although we didn\u2019t really use it) and the blackout drapes were a nice touch (they did cause a surprise late awakening on our first night, but of course this was our fault). The king size bed was wonderfully comfortable with plenty of pillows and the linens were crisp and clean (no strange stains here whatsoever \u2013 believe me, I looked). The bathroom was spotless and smelled quite fresh everyday - a MUST for someone like me with such a sensitive sense of smell (particularly when dealing with OFFENSIVE smells). The guest use ice machine in the hall was important for us since we had so many kids that constantly wanted cold drinks, though none of our rooms had a refrigerator; the hotel should consider adding one as an amenity, if they haven\u2019t already (at least a small one would be nice). My partner and the husbands spent a lazy afternoon at the pool near the end of our stay. The water was cool and refreshing and it was quite large, but not all that deep. The neighboring hot tub was also nice. There was a control right at the water\u2019s edge where you could adjust the settings. Towels were conveniently provided on a nearby cart. They were actually quite large and fluffy compared to the bath towels, so we ended up taking some to our rooms (though I\u2019m not sure if this was truly allowed or not). There was a fitness center just above the hot tub, but we never found time to use it. The location is actually really great and we chose the Crown Plaza mainly for that reason. We could drive to Sea World (which was a blast), San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. I personally would recommend the Zoo over the Wild Animal Park, but I suppose it\u2019s a matter of preferences (if you don\u2019t mind walking, the Zoo is a HUGE place to explore with terrific exhibits and so many wonderful animals \u2013 I truly recommend it). Parking at the hotel was about $10 a day (I think \u2013 I didn\u2019t drive the vans) and there was a lot of it on the property. All in all, our stay at the Crown Plaza was a good experience and was a great home base for the first part of our Californian adventure.

My first impression was one of excitement at the lush Hawaiian-style landscaping, including fountains and palms and even Koi ponds, the hotel's main saving grace. I congratulated myself again on using Tripadvisor to pick another winner! I really appreciated the courtesy of an early check-in which was graciously allowed. My room was ample in size, with two queen beds. The lack of refrigerator was my first disappointment. On the other hand, the presence of an in-room safe was another plus. The view from my balcony of a pretty courtyard and sparkling pool was another tick in the plus column. Then again, my room had an unsettling, persistent mildly foul smell--like rotting cabbage. I suspect gasses coming from the plumbing, though my carpet was not exactly new, either, matching the worn, but functional armoire. Who knows? I could detect efforts made toward modernization, such as granite counters in the bathroom, but then again the well-aged bathroom door was either warped from humidity, or painted one too many times, and it had a sticking problem necessitating use of some force to close or open it. That one detail made a big impression on me--of disappointment. The wall separating the toilet from the shower had been patched, and the baseboard tile capping the end of it clung for dear life--with a nice tuft of someone's hairs caught in the cracked grout. Oh, well, only for one night, I rationalized. I did a number of loads of laundry in the well-appoined laundry room next to the spa. I could not work out in the exercise room due to the overwhelming vapors coming from the rubber floor tiles, however. I was quite surprised, and not in a good way, that internet service at this not-inexpensive older hotel was fee-based! You could PAY to use one of the hotel's computers.... Every other (much newer and more modern) hotel I stayed in on this trip had FREE internet access. I did notice many airline personnel leaving the hotel, so I suspect one or more airlines has a contract here--seemingly a plus. The parking lot did not feel safe to me--the rear lot was closely bordered by an area of vegetation. I parked next to the attendant's kiosk instead and walked a little farther to my room. There is no restriction on access to the hotel interior--no locked corridors, and I did wonder about the presence of one unshirted man who visited the laundry room bathroom. Breakfast was not included in my stay. I think with some improvements this hotel could be fabulous, as the layout is quite nice. It's obvious that attempts are being made. I did like the beds--queens instead of doubles, with nice comforters. I found the Koi ponds and fountains and retro-style tiki decor very, very charming and fun for the kids, and this was a big, big plus for me. I hated the cheap floor tiles used all over the outdoor areas of the hotels, however--perhaps someone would do well to contract the services of an architect or landscape designer to preserve the unique charm of this hotel rather than make clumsy attempts to modernize it--just my bias. On the other hand, my children really liked the hotel a lot. On balance, I'm glad I had a night here, but I don't think, without a substantial discount or lack of other choices, I'll be back.

Check in was okay, staff was very friendly, polite and helpful. Knowing it was right next to the I-8 I requested a \"quiet\" room. We were given a room next to the atrium area on the first floor. There are huge tropical trees and plants, several seating areas and a waterfall. The sound of the waterfall was very pleasant but not overwhelming. The decor in the room was lovely and it was very clean. The carpet looked a little tired, but not bad. We had a very nice patio area, more spacious than other hotels I've stayed at. My one complaint would be that there was a family staying in the room next door with 2 or 3 kids who were very noisy and constantly slamming the door. This was surprising to me since I asked for a quiet area but fortunately we were out most of the evening and it was quiet when we returned. We didn't even use the sleep cd or earplugs and had no trouble sleeping. The bed was quite comfortable. We had dinner and breakfast in The Islands restaurant. Dinner was very good, nice sized portions and reasonably priced. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which was good, but not great. I think a regular breakfast would have been the better choice. The wait staff in the restaurant were attentive, friendly and helpful. No complaints whatsoever. This hotel has a conference center so keep this in mind if you book a room here. The pool area seemed to be very busy as it was being used as a staging area for a group. Also the parking lot is a pain, not worth the $10/day charge, and it was hard to find parking close to our room. I have a feeling other people are allowed to use the parking lot because I'm pretty sure the hotel wasn't full. Also, the number of our room was very close to the number for the front desk, so within one hour of checking in we had 3 phone calls for the front desk. I spoke to the person at the front desk and asked them to put a \"do not disturb\" on our phone and she seemed surprised we were getting these calls but was very gracious and apologetic.

Hanalei). I stayed for one night as part of a weekend getaway and attended their annual summer luau. I was staying alone but meeting my sister, who lives in San Diego, at the hotel. We attended the luau together and we both used the room, although only I slept in it. Check in was polite, friendly, and welcoming. Just what I needed after a day of sightseeing. I e-mailed the hotel management before my stay with my room requests to make sure there were no problems upon check in. The front desk clerk, who was very professional, informed me with a smile that my room had been specifically selected and held aside for me by the hotel manager. I appreciated the extra service extended to a repeat visitor such as myself and, since I was traveling alone, it was a relief to feel well looked after. I suggest that anyone with a special room request put in the little extra effort to e-mail or call management before your stay. The nicest views are below the fourth floor in the atrium building with a view of the pool. My room was simply wonderful. The location of the room fit what I requested just perfectly. I stayed in the atrium on the third floor with a pool view. When I walked out the door I could see koi ponds in the garden area below. When sitting on the bed I had a pretty view of palm trees. The main attraction of the nicely furnished room was the bed. It was beautifully made up, with more pillows than I have ever seen on a hotel bed. Upon entering the room I found on the bed a pretty little gift bag, something that each guest receives, with a small bottle of lavender and earplugs to help me sleep, also a \u201cSleep Advantage CD\u201d, with soft music that was so perfect for winding down before bed. I even got to keep my Sleep CD at the end of my stay. One of the tables near the bed has a CD player/alarm clock. Before going to bed I took a bath and listened to my Sleep CD. It was so relaxing that I almost felt like I was in a spa! The perfect bathroom accessory to go along with the Crowne Plaza\u2019s \u201csleep system\u201d would be a bath pillow. The tub is a little short and a bath pillow would be nice to rest your head on. I always take a couple of candles with me when I travel and this room was the perfect setting for relaxing with my candles. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. I didn\u2019t want to get out of it! In the morning I listened to a CD of Hawaiian music that I had brought with me. It complemented the tropical feeling of the hotel and I just loved having a CD player in my hotel room to play my music. Nice upgrades were made to the guestrooms and bathrooms when this hotel changed from the Red Lion brand to a Crowne Plaza hotel a few months ago. Besides the new beds, the carpets are brand new. The bathroom countertop has a pretty brown marbleized look. New light accents add a touch of class. There is also a swing out make up mirror with a magnifying side and, of course, a hairdryer. The only thing I would have changed in my room is the location of the writing desk, but I can\u2019t see where else it would have gone. It\u2019s close to the bathroom, which is near the entry door. That means the desk chair, which is beautiful and comfy, is kind of in the way as you are entering the room. It didn\u2019t bother me at all, though. I didn\u2019t need it and simply moved the chair to the other side of the room and grouped it with another chair where it seemed to fit just fine. There was no published time for when the hotel restaurant, The Islands, stops serving breakfast so I called down to ask. Turns out that I was calling five minutes prior to the end of breakfast (11 a.m.). The restaurant host told me since there was only one in my party he would allow me to order breakfast if I got there right away. I thought that was awesome guest relations and I appreciated it so much. Breakfast was very good. Service was fast and courteous. The Islands restaurant was recently remodeled and I was a little leery about seeing the changes because I loved it the way it was in the past. My opinion is this remodel is a big improvement, although it was somewhat more romantic before when it was dark and cozy. The restaurant now is open and inviting. It has a great view overlooking the pool and palms. To get the same view in the past, guests needed to sit on the patio where seating is limited. Now the patio is adjunct to the restaurant and the large windows actually open up to let in air flow. A little breeze and you truly feel as though you are in the islands. Sitting just about anywhere near the windows will give you a view of a pretty little waterfall. Each table has a small clipping of a Hawaiian flower and the wood used for the tables is just beautiful. My dinner at the hotel was the pre-paid ($59) summer luau, an annual event usually occurring in August or July that takes place on the lawn of the hotel. The food was totally awesome, very tasty and inventive, and the servers were personable and helpful. The Polynesian revue and pre-diner music is professional and authentic. I especially recommend a stay at the Crowne Plaza San Diego during the annual summer luau. The parking lot is not as bad as another review has made it sound. I usually park just a little further out because most guests are always going to want the prime spots in the middle of the lot. When I return, the same space or one nearby is open. I have never had occasion to come upon workmen or transients in this secured lot, whether parking on the west side or east side. The Crowne Plaza is centrally located by freeway to many places in San Diego. Additionally, there is complimentary shuttle that will take you to Sea World and Old Town. On my trip I visited downtown San Diego, Coronado Island, and Balboa Park. The Crowne Plaza San Diego (Hanalei) will remain my favorite hotel in San Diego.

While my room was clean, comfortable (mostly), and quiet, the nightly struggle to find ANY legitimate place to park\u2014within a reasonable, safe distance from my room (far east end of the complex),\u2014cast a pall over the entire experience. At this point, it is only fair to note that management did\u2014largely--attempt to alleviate my difficulty, and they did admit that they are aware of the parking issues. During my stay those issues included employee vehicles occupying guest spaces, construction materials taking up spaces, large vehicles (e.g., SUVs) taking two spaces, and (according to some staff members) multiple vehicles per room. The hotel charges ten dollars per day for parking. I believe that, when a hotel charges for parking, there is an implied agreement that the proprietor will take reasonable steps to ensure that a sufficient number of suitable, safe spaces will be available per accommodation unit. Otherwise, a daily fee is nothing more than a charge to \u201chunt.\u201d Further, when one is traveling\u2014for whatever reason\u2014the last thing anyone wants to worry about is returning to an accommodation by some \u201cmagic\u201d hour in order to safely and legally stow a vehicle. Someone also needs to deal with the fellow (homeless?) who sleeps in the northeast corner of the parking lot, adjacent to a field. One \u201cquick fix\u201d that easily could be instituted is for the hotel to require complete vehicle information upon check in. Despite a form that includes space for a license plate number, the only information gathered (from me, at least) was make and color (I had a white, fleet rental car!). Armed with license plate numbers, management could contact owners of vehicles occupying multiple spaces and require that they be reparked properly. Further, I have recently stayed in a property (in another state) that limits each room to a single vehicle by activating (ONLY) one room keycard to work in the parking lot access gate. Even if a guest handed the card to a second driver, the electronic system would record that action and management could take appropriate action to ensure that other guests with vehicles were not disenfranchised. Management also could have insisted that renovation contractors store materials away from the parking lot. One night manager who assisted me started to tell me that using the lot was \u201cmore convenient\u201d for the contractors. I responded that contractor convenience should not supersede that of a paying guest. Two other issues arose during my stay. The first concerned the air conditioning unit, which\u2014 during my first hour in the room\u2014was obviously laboring and not cooling/dehumidifying. The staff attended to the unit immediately and I had no further issue with room temperature. The second matter was far more serious: upon returning to my room on the final night, I approached the door, keycard in hand, and realized immediately that, while the door was shut, it was not latched/locked. After ascertaining that no one was in the room (I had a nearly clear view from the door), I entered and called the desk. They ran an electronic trace to determine the person(s) to last access the room. Not surprisingly, it was housekeeping staff. None of my property was disturbed: any valuables were either with me or in the small in-room safe. As a woman who often travels alone, I am acutely aware of situations that pose potential negative safety consequences. In this case, the combination of an unsecured room and the nightly parking issue, left me with a strong sense of \u201cno confidence\u201d for this hotel\u2014as it is currently.

The Crowne Plaza (Hanalai) is a physically pretty hotel\u2014lush plantings in courtyards, etc., and nicely decorated public spaces. It is not, however, my first choice for San Diego accommodation: My preferred sites were booked by the time I made plans for this trip (dates predicated upon a professional meeting).

The hotel may have changed names and corporate ownership, but the management is still the same. Anyway, the hotel's a bit older so some of the repairs and upgrades they're doing (wiring for high-speed internet, etc.) look a little like quickie patchwork jobs. Not much else they can do when nearly the entire complex is built with cinder blocks. The room (18**) was fairly modest but comfortable. The beds felt new enough, so everyone slept soundly, even with a little freeway noise from I-8 (which is right across the street). The tub had damage that was patched up. The air conditioning/heating unit was a little disappointing. It was always either too warm and muggy or too cold. It didn't maintain a constant environment, even though it's connected to a thermostat within the room. Housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 the first morning, which was a little irritating, but forgiveable. The staff couldn't have known that we had checked in only eight hours earlier. Every other day they waited a while before coming around, and it didn't require a complaint. Everyone at the hotel was kind and accomodating in every situation, and made me and my family feel appreciated. The kids (and I) loved the spacious pool and hot tub. The pool was well-heated and the hot tub never felt overly crowded even with a dozen people hanging out. The location of this hotel (Hotel Circle) is convenient to nearly everything San Diego has to offer. It's not on the beach, but the coast is only minutes away. Like shopping or fine dining? Try Fashion Valley mall right around the corner. Or there's Mission Valley mall a few miles further down the road. Golfing is a mere pitching wedge away from the hotel. Sea World, the San Diego Zoo, Petco Park, and Old Town (to name a few) are all less than fifteen minutes away... when traffic is cooperating. By the way, the entire time I was there traffic was as good as could be hoped for, even during \"rush hour\". For the right price I'd certainly stay here again. You could probably find a better deal (quality for the price) if you looked hard enough, but don't overlook the Crowne Plaza Mission Valley (Hanalei). It caters pretty heavily to government/military travelers, and they have their fair share of \"regulars\" who return to the hotel time and time again when they're in town as a result of the level of service and hospitality provided. Oh, and if you want a room with a mini-refrigerator and microwave oven (as I did) in a standard room, ask for a room on the 6th, 7th, or 8th floors.

It sits off a major highway which allows easy access to all attractions. We had vehicles to get around town (they charge for parking as most hotels in town did), but I believe that public transportation is available in the area, if that is the way you must travel-not for me.

I'm sure these rooms all have only 1 bed and NO room for a rollaway or a portable crib, no desk to work at. You would need to upgrade to a bigger room. But it was pretty quiet and unless I needed the space, I wouldn't pay to upgrade. The only odd thing was that they had tile flooring on the walkway outside the rooms, so everything that rolled by had a \"cla-clink, cla-clink\" sound as it went by. Didn't hear it during the night, though. They are not really close to the mall or the trolley station, but for a tip they will take you to the mall (where there is a trolley stop), about 1 mile away. It is close enough to walk, but not a great walking route, lacking safe space to walk in some areas. The trolley goes to many locations in San Diego.

The TV was fine, with a big selection of channels. I had a refrigerator and microwave, the two queen beds were comfortable, and there were additional indoor and outdoor seating areas with comfortable chairs and tables. I had the Sunday brunch and it was excellent -- with crab legs, eggs benedict and a big selection of desserts. The restaurant service was very friendly. Room service was prompt and friendly, and the Reuben sandwich I ordered tasted fine. The front desk was a little impersonal, but this is a big hotel so I expected that. The parking lot had narrow parking spaces, but not to the point of being a problem. I did hear some elevator noise and noise from other rooms -- but I have yet to stay in a hotel that was any quieter on the west coast (construction people apparently don't believe in sound insulation out here.) The pool and hot tub were big and clean. One glassed in elevator didn't work, but there was another elevator nearby that did (I was on the seventh floor). Some people consider the tropical/cinderblock exterior tacky. I consider all tropical decor tacky, so I didn't care. You could spend a lot more money and get less in most areas of coastal California.

Initially when you drive up it looks pretty nice but the rooms are really basic as is everything beyond the lobby & restaurant area. Our room was tiny, clean, and older looking. Since the weather wasn't nice enough to really enjoy the pool & we forgot that it was spring break & all the teens would be hogging the hot tub at all hours, we ended up staying in our room most of the time.
