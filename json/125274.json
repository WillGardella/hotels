One small block away from the 6 train which can get you almost anywhere with transferring stations really close by. The beauty of this neighbourhood is that it's not really a touristy spot, you get this local city feel. However, when you walk 4 small city blocks up, you're near all the big shopping stores near Heral Square. Korea Town is also just 2 to 3 block away! You get the best of both worlds. Hotel Lola itself has a nice modern lobby, dark with sexy colors. You always want your staff to be friendly, Lola does well! Lola is also very clean. I had a standard room with a queen bed. I don't know about the other rooms, but as other reviewers say, the room is quite small so better put that in your expectation. My girlfriend and I walked in, there's about 5 to 7 feet of hallway before you hit the bed. The bed has about 2 to 3 feet on every side of it and that completes the room. The bathroom can pretty much only be used by 1 person. Talk about utilizing New York real estate! But for the price and value of the area, this can all be enjoyable. I don't know if they offered breakfast, because we were always on the go, becasue of the cool spots and eateries around here. If you want more space, you're probably better off in another hotel.

I have been trying out various hotels because I need to be in town for business a few days a month. Hotel Lola filled the bill in terms of location for my needs.The location near the 28th street subway and being mid way between my uptown clients and downtown friends is perfect. And near Grand Central - equally perfect. No room service doesn't bother me since I spend time with friends and eat out while I'm in the city. And there is a 24/7 deli on the corner of Park and 29th street, and you can get coffee and breakfast in the lobby restaurant starting at 7am -- and the lobby bar serves up a nice nightcap. And no bellman didn't bother me since I only have a overnight bag. What I didn't like were the elevators that needs to be wiped down and the 'do not disturb' sign had a pair of handcuffs and a heart and says that 'I'm tied up right now'. It's cute but the humor isn't for everyone and I felt it cheapened my business stay and the hotel quite frankly. I'm no prude but it's cheap humor and made me feel like I was in a hotel that some paid for by the hour. But hey, maybe I'm not the audience they are after and others love it. For my nickle It was a bad attempt at being 'edgy'. I was prepared to pay for their internet service however I was not prepared for the sign-in process not to recognize my name and room number. I also wasn't prepared for hanging on the phone for their tech guy who wasn't there. I lost patience for this problem being this is 2012 and free internet is everywhere - I got dressed and got to the office I work out of instead of what I wanted to do which was work from the room until check out. The room was okay - pretty much true to the pictures. The bed was fantastic with tons of pillows and I slept like a baby which I rarely do when I'm not home. The lobby is overly dark as are the rooms. Lighting is not Hotel Lola's strength. Check in process was easy and the people at the desk are very nice. Would I stay again? Yes.

The hotel lobby is very trendy and has a nice bar (caveat- cocktails are $15/each). We were treated very kindly and very warmly by all staff, including the front desk, the bartender, the concierge, and the maid service. For those who care, the hotel does not have room service or a door man waiting to greet people. Starbucks, drugstores, small grocery stores, and many cafes are all within 1 or 2 blocks of the hotel.

The man at the front desk told me that \"obviously the internet reception would be better in the lobby\" and to call their technical support team. I sat on the phone for 20 minutes with technical support, through router re-boots, etc, and it turns out that there just wasn't a strong enough signal in my room or in the lobby.

We were impressed with the newly refurbished, clean bathroom and the huge TV and complimentary IPod docking station. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was lovely, the food was hot and there was a lot of choice. I would definitely recommend the \"Bread & butter\" deli on the corner of the entrance on 29th street, we ate there every other morning. We could not fault this hotel at all, we have been home one day and already booked in to go next year.

A final one, why do so many hotels not have coat hooks on a wall, when you come in all you want to do is hang up your coat, not even any for towels in the bathroom. There were, however, many positives. A great location with different subway stations nearby, easy to walk to Penn station for our train to Washington & to visit friends in New Jersey.

I did not pay the currently listed price of about $200 per night tor s single room at the Hotel Lola. I responded to an online offer for about $100 per night. I could have stayed at another hotel in the area with a shared restroom and free Wi-Fi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I was drawn in by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition (I booked it when it was still Hotel 3030) and hotels were not cheap over the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day weekend. I was in town for one purpose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c theater \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more specifically \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see Carrie the Musical! Commendations: It was a very comfortable room. It was smallish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes... but big enough for me and my one piece of luggage (carry on!). I got a room on the third floor facing the back of the hotel... nothing spectacular but a large bathroom with an of so comfy and soft bed. The space/electric heather warmed the room just fine overnight (it was near freezing for my long holiday weekend stay). There were drawers galore to stash my stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I like to put my things away and feel more lived in... even for a few days. There close included an ironing board (did not use it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and where would I have put it... maybe it was bed sized) and iron. I did not expect that. The N/R subway line are just a few blocks (3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 min. walk) away at 28th street allowing me quick access to Times Square and the theater I came to see. There were not a plethora of eateries in the vicinity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mostly knock off perfume shops, a few corner delis, and a bar/ bistro across the street. Tips and words for the management: The idea of a desk or chair that really couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice thought and makes real the promise of a desk and workstation. But there was no way I could have pulled the chair out and sat in it and worked at the desk. The char was up against the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c curse of the small room. Okay management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is 2012. Who travels with less than 3 or 4 devices that have to be charged at night? I did make this trip without my lap top but I did need to charge my IPhone (good thing there was an I-compatible clock radio that would charge it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if I were not an IPhone owner I would have needed another plug that was not available). One plug was available on the desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was taken by my Kindle Fire (I did not pay the $14.00 per day internet fee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I instead camped out in McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Starbucks for my heavy internet stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both are near the subway entrance). Suggestion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c power strip or how about a multi-plug adaptor in one of the drawers? I am thinking this has to be an anomaly. Warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this get a little yucky. I came back after my first day away and after the room had been cleaned to find razor stubble still in the sink (which by the way is tiny and too close to the wall to put your face over and spit into or wash). It had not been cleaned. And the toilet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had dried urine and a few hairs (yes mine from you know where) on the rim. And... hey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a guy who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always aim correctly at night and the floor still had evidence of my nocturnal miss. I photographed them (attached) and the next day notified the management. Returned the second day after the room had been cleaned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sink was clean but the toilet was unchanged. Really? Even after I told you the toilet, sink, and bathroom floor had not been cleaned? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve emailed management and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll update with my reply. Overall: Good stay.

I got to the hotel early and they made an effort to accomodate me before check-in. The staff is great. The lobby is \"cool\" and the bar looks nice though I didn't use the bar or the restaurant. I went to my room to crash and when I entered I was a bit shocked. I know hotels can be small in NYC but this was smaller than a dorm room. They call it a \"single\". It's a \"bed\" which is built into some drawers and then a bathroom with a closet. I passed out on the bed and realized being 6 ft tall -- my feet hung off the bed. I went to the front desk and the young lady promptly upgraded my room so I could spend the next five days with my feet ON the bed. I got a nice, small room with a queen bed and it was on the 9th floor. The water pressure is pretty good in the shower. The maids were prompt and thorough. The one complaint - when you sit on the toilet - your knees pretty much almost hit the wall. Its funny because you have to move the garbage can around in the bathroom just to use the bathroom because it's always in the way. The large tv was great. There was an iron and board. The heart worked well. Some floors, like 10 where the ice machine was located, ALWAYS smelled like smokers paradise. Not sure if people were allowed to smoke but I guess that doesn't stop people.

There are a few drawbacks that prevent me from giving it 5 stars, though. First, there is no coffee maker in the room. Surprisingly, there is no coffee in the lobby either. So to get a cup of stimulating liquid, one needs to go outside to one of the many coffee shops around. Second, the airconditioning units in the rooms are located in a recessed area in the ceiling. That serves a very good purpose if the room needs to be cooled down, but to raise the temperature in a cold winter day, it takes a long time, especially if you are sitting at the very small desk to work on your laptop and expect your feet to be warm.

We had a starbucks just down the street, and the hotel was located close to the subway, and with walking distance to some of the main tourist attractions. Only negative thing is the price for wireless- WAY TOO EXPENSIVE- We bought wireless one day and the connection was so SLOW- it was useless.. You are better off going to starbucks and use their internet. Don't pay for it at the hotel!! Overall impression: Will def. come back again.

THE HOTEL Before we left I was reading reviews from people complaining about th smallest details I did wonder if I would notice such things that they mention such as ->\"The lobby is too dark\" -Its a boutique hotel what do you expect? ->\"The shower leaks\" - if thats the only thing you can complain about dont bother complaining - thres a shower mat - use it! -> \"The rooms are small\"- I mean come on, really!? The Hotel is located in midtown manhattan - and for the record theyre bigger than some NYC Appartments! We stayed for 6 nights for my husbands 30th birthday.There was a lovley little note on arrival and some cute little cakes. The room was completley adequate, beautifully decorated. The bed is soooo comfy the TV must have been 50\" with all satalite channels. The shower was fine, the drainage was fine, everything was good. The Hotel has a gym in the basement and a business centre which is great for printing airline boarding passes etc NEARBY HOTEL LOLA The official hotel entrance is 29/e29th but you can also access the hotel via the old \"Hotel 30 30\" entrance on 30/e30th street. The Hotel is situated perfectly for the subway, you can walk to times square in 20 mins casually via lexington or park av. There is a lovley little irish pub/restaurant opposite the hotel on 30th street called th crooked knife - great atmosphere, full of local new yorkers on a fri and sat, great food and great prices. There is also a great family run patisserie if you walk to the left from exiting on 29th street that you can buy hot food if your too tired to eat out. They have salads, pizza, chinese menu's - you name it theyve got it (this was a godsend as after a hard days shopping you sometimes dont feel like getting dressed up!) You have macdonalds across the road on Park Avenue and a great diner called Moonstruck on east 31st/Lexington - Proper american food - pancakes/maple syrup etc GETTING AROUND Cabs - Crazy drivers! From the hotel it will cost around $6-$8 to get to times square - not very expensive t all - but dont forget to tip them properly otherwise theyre likely to run you over! - No joke! For 3 days you can buy the bus hopper tour (from madame taussards in times square) i would highly recomment it - it basically 3 days free travel around the city, we jumped on and off where we needed to go with shopping bags/food etc and as a bonus heard all about the city from the tour guides. They run uptown, downtown and midtown every day. In with the price you also get a selection of tours for free, we did the statue of liberty and the Empire state and also got a 90min cruise around manhatten island - Amazing value for money! Subway - is quite confusing but then again I get confused on the London underground which my husband tells me is dead easy! SHOPPING Everywhere you turn theres a shop of some kind. Main shopping areas are 5th Avenue and Lexington but we found pier 17 wich is lower manhattan at the south sea port. Youll get som great bargains down there on A&F, uggs , Victorias secret etc - would highly recommend. And the bus hopper stops right outside! ALL IN ALL The Hotel is fantastic, bar prices a little steep, but hey your on holiday right?

Quick as a flash they got her a little box of chocolates which I thought was a lovely touch. The room itself was quite small but as we were only sleeping there we decided against upgrading. Bathroom very compact with only a shower - albeit a very large one and mirrors are the non steamy kind which is very useful. Our room faced other buildings and was quite adequate. Air con/heating very efficient and nice comfortable beds. We did not eat there or use the bar area as we spent all our time out and about. The hotel is within a minute walk to both uptown and downtown 6 line - fantastic! Also dotted about the hotel are some really good cafe/delis. No charge for leaving bags after check out.

The location was really fantastic - very central and lively - many restaurants around and close to shopping district.

The staff is very nice and helpful. Most notably the concierge was quite helpful. As for style, the hotel itself is modern and chic and the rooms are the same. Also for those who are very picky, there were a few minor faults: the window did not lock...which to me is a small security issue as we were on the 12th floor which is the only floor whose window has a ledge. Also, the shower doors don't keep water in. So we had to keep towels on the floor to soak up the excess water. They also had an iHome in the room but it didn't have working batteries. You know, if there is going to be an amenity, it should at least be ready for use. All minor things which did not interrupt our stay at all! Admittedly the room was smaller than we expected. The bathroom was VERY small. The sink, toilet, and shower were squeezed into one tiny space. In the end, the room was manageable, and as I said, it was clean and the location was excellent. In comparison to price, we paid $228 per night (not including internet at $14 a night) which included a discount with AAA card and their holiday rates.

The entire lobby was a construction site, the hotel was clearly being rennovated, we were not informed of this prior to our arrival, however, I appreciate that things like this are necessary, it also shows the hotel is doing well financially if it can afford an upgrade of this scale.

The room we were given was of a very high standard, if a bit small, on the Wednesday (2 days after our arrival, we were staying for 7 nights) we returned from our wedding ceremony to a soaking wet carpet patch as the Air Conditioning was dripping, we were offered another room (exact same standard), I politely hinted that two hours ago my wife and I had just got married and that this was a bit of an inconvenience and could potentially spoil the moment. The hotel manager escorted us to another room, two doors away, which was three times the size, apologised for the trouble, and gave us a small wedding cake as a gift. My wife and I were more than satisfied with how we were treated and felt that the hotel had completely redeemed themselves. The rest of our stay was fantastic, the extra room made a massive difference to our comfort, I would definitely return to the Hotel Thirty Thirty, I'm not a materialistic person in any way and can appreciate that things go wrong, it's how the problem is managed and rectified that means the most to me, in this case, it was handled very well.

The night manager that evening was in a very long (over 30 minutes as I never saw the end of it) and obviously unpleasant transaction with someone at the front desk and I was unable to get him to help that night either.

Luckily based on reading other's reviews, I knew that the hotel had changed its name to the Lola Hotel. FYI, you can also access the hotel off of 29th street as well. The hotel is a beautiful modern boutique hotel conveniently located near the Empire State Building. It's in easy walking distance to shopping (Macy's, Lord & Taylor), Times Square, Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, and Union Square (all about 10-15 minutes walking). The staff here are nice and friendly, from the front desk to the very helpful bellmen. Check-in went smoothly, but some issues came up after arriving into my room on the 5th floor. The room itself was modern and beautiful with a large flat screen tv, great linen, and down comforter. The hotel is itself is completely nonsmoking. However, I later found out that through no fault of the hotel's, there were some permanent residents there that may be smokers and thus the smell of smoke permeating my room on the 5th floor. I was only there for one night and was going to put up with it, but the customer service staff said that they would have housekeeping spray the room and put in an air purifier machine to help, or that if I could wait for another room to be cleaned I could switch rooms. I told them if they could do the first option, I would stay in the room that I had. I thought both options were great - I've had other hotels tell me that there's nothing they can do... Unfortunately, there were some cleanliness issues in the bathroom, which I later discovered. So I called up the front desk again wondering if it would be possible to switch rooms. They said they were happy to do so with the caveat of a wait which I was totally fine with. When I go downstairs to leave my luggage and check back in with the front desk, to my vast surprise, I was upgraded to a much larger room on the 12th floor. The manager/front desk rep(?) was so kind and even gave me a little sweet treat to boot for the inconvenience. I totally was not expecting this at all. The upgraded room was very spacious, modern and beautiful. Most importantly not a hint of smoke and very clean. While the initial start-up was a bit rocky, the hotel and staff more than made up for this with its customer service and friendliness.

We had 3 \"complaints\" about the room: 1) Nowhere to hang longer coats (a requiement in December!) 2) Nowhere for toiletries - everything was squeezed into the back of the sink and kept falling off (NB management there is space for a small shelf to the left of the sink which could do the job 3) The shower curtain (clearly there for the potential customer requirements) meant that however we showered water leaked onto the floor. Cleaning staff supplied extra towels so we were not bothered but it was a niggle and should be looked at for a more permanent solution Howeve having said all that - whilst these comments stopped us from giving 5 stars - everything else (recently refurbished) from the fabulous bed, quiet air con, big flat screen TV was top quality. Finally a word of warning for anyone looking to eat near the hotel. We ended up at the back of the Hotel (E 29th Street) where we found a nice looking Italian - cant remember the name - but avoid it like the plague!

I travel for 3 weeks all over the US at least three times a year from overseas. I arrived at your hotel as the last leg, found steps that made it really hard to get my heavy two pieced of 3 week luggage up stairs, with no bellman in sight. I waited 15 minutes in the rain, and proceeded to drag them myself. After waiting in line over a half an hour to check in, I asked a concierge if you had laundry facilities in the hotel ( washing machine and dryer) When she told me that you did not ( and that was OK) I asked where the closest Laundromat was. She took 10 minutes to look it up, and told me an address miles away. Imagine my surprise later in the day when I took a walk and found a Laundromat 2 DOORS AWAY FROM THE HOTEL! I did not have adequate wireless access, and I need it to work- I checked this at booking. After about 2 hours on the phone with support I was told to move rooms. So at 11:00 pm after hours on the phone with your internet people and front desk, a very long day of meetings, with an equally long day ahead, I had to pack up my international luggage and move ( a porter had turned up to give me a key, but I was not packed up yet, and there was no room in my room for him to wait around, so I had to drag everything myself- I am a fairly small woman with 3 weeks worth of luggage: personal effects and business materials). When I got to the new room , which was definitely worse than the original, I found that the wireless access was no better there, so I waited another hour for someone to bring me a cable connection. So, at about 12:00 midnight I began to do the work I needed to prepare for the next day's meetings. In the new room, the towels were stored on top of the toilet ( there was not towel rail), and the shower door could not open more than half way without bumping into the toilet- good thing that I am fairly slim, or I would not have managed to get in or out! Finally, and WORST OF ALL on the last day, since my flight was out of JFK at midnight, and it was pouring rain, I decided to stay/pay for another half day, to get some rest and pack in the afternoon before my final meeting and an 11 hour international flight. I found a cockroach in my room, waited half an hour for 4 members of staff to crowd into the room moving the furniture looking for the bug, which they did not find. I then emptied all my suitcases looking to see if the cockroach had got in there. I did not find it. An hour later as I was getting my suitcases repacked, I found a cockroach ( the same one? a friend?) killed it with my boot, and called maintenance to come take the carcass away- that took another half hour. By then, needless to say, I got no rest, and found it preferable to go out in the rain to staying in the room with the cockroaches.

At least the new hotel name won't be Twenty Nine Twenty Nine!! It will be Hotel Lola, or something like that (not sure why). I don't know when new management took over, but the renovations in this rather old hotel building, I think, have been quite successful. The entrance hall to the lobby, and the lobby itself, have a clean, \"industrial\" look to them, with a dark tone and interesting interior decorating touches. I liked it. The hallway on the floor where my room was also was redone in this style, with an interesting rug. The room, too. I think it took a bit of time to come up with the decorating scheme and the care in executing it should be acknowledged and complimented, considering the modest cost of accommodation. (The hotel isn't in the Times Squire area, but a short taxi ride - or, better yet, - a stroll, can get you there in about 20 minutes, I think.) I particularly liked the manual chain-driven unique shade that lets light into the room while maintaining privacy, and the inner window shade that really did keep the room dark when it was light outside. What I didn't like was the paucity of lights. A wall switch at the entrance door allows you to turn on the ceiling hall light. Too bad there isn't a ceiling light in the room itself. You have table lamp options. Once you turn them on, you have to go back to the door to turn off the hall ceiling light. I'd suggest trying to see if lighting could be added to the room ceiling, with power coming from the source that provides electricity to the TV opposite the bed. A nice-appearing conduit going up the wall to the ceiling center wouldn't be an eyesore, and would benefit guests. Maybe it could be operated by a \"remote\", as is the TV? Another thing - the \"armoire\" - an attractive metal industral-type unit, is practical, witha built-in safe, place to hang clothes above and some self-closing drawers below. Though I found it useful, it's location made it hard to access (a niche in the wall). I think it could be turned 90 degrees and might be more accessible that way. Also, the room itself is quite small and there is no place to put valises. A small storage unit for this, maybe two levels, could be placed in the corner of the room where the window wall and TV wall meet. There is room for this, I think. It would be a great advantage to guests who have to take care not to stumble over their open valises.

Needless to say, hotels were at a premium. After searching high and low for anything under $400 a night, I stumbled across Hotel Thirty Thirty. It was far more affordable than anything else available, and was in a fantastic location, so I quickly booked a package that included free wifi. We arrived to find the entrance closed due to construction, so we had to haul our luggage around the block to the opposite side (usually that wouldn't be a big deal, but pregnancy has made everything more tiring.) On the 29th street side, there is nothing identifying the hotel as Thirty Thirty, only Lola (I'm still a big confused as to which name they're going with, received info with one or the other throughout our stay.) We arrived and checked in and were surprised to find out just how small the rooms were. Overall, it really was fine, especially considering how little time we spent in the room, but it was surprising at first glance. We had just enough room to stash our bags and still have room to move around the bed. I suspect a great number of NYC hotel rooms are even tinier, and based on size, I'd have no qualms about staying here again. The room is cute. Decently decorated while not making the room look even smaller. Bright and fresh. What was less acceptable was the fact that the bathroom clearly hadn't been cleaned before our arrival. The toilet wasn't flushed, there was quite a slew of curly gray hairs, a wet soap outline on the sink, other spots. Gross. And the location is truly great. We walked all over Manhattan from our hotel. Fabulous. We did hop on the subway multiple times, but never directly from or to our hotel, so I'm honestly not sure how close it is, though it really can't be all that far away. It had been explained to us that we had to agree to charges and sign in to use the free wifi, but that the charges would be wiped from our account upon check out, as it was included in our package. Unfortunately, our room was utterly devoid of even the faintest wifi signal. We mentioned it the morning after checking in and the hotel did offer to move us to another room, but at that point we were all settled in and I didn't relish the thought of having to pack everything up, so, we sucked it up and did without our free wifi (they did offer us a complimentary breakfast in the attached restaurant one day to make up for it. It was far from the best dining experience of our lives, but I don't remember the name of the restaurant, so I shant be reviewing that.) We were also there during the time change. We arrived in our room the night before to find a reminder to change the time on our own time keeping items, and noting that housekeeping would change the clock in our room. No one every bothered to change the time in the clock in our room. We managed to get along just fine, but I find the lack of followthrough irritating.

The building work commented elsewhere seemed to be completed when we arrived but the lobby was closed off during our visit. This meant that for the last two days we had to enter and exit via 29th Street. This wasn't an issue for us but might have been for new arrivals as the entrance is not marked witht the hotels name but mysteriously is named Lola! We had breakfast and lunch at Bread & Butter deli on corner of 29th and Park. The choice here was excellent and good value, the reviews I have found of this place do not do it justice.

The rooms were modern and more spacious than we were expecting, and the location and price very good for NYC, but the level of service from the staff was appalling. We will find a hotel which has staff which display more courteous and helpful attitudes. An example: Upon check out on the 16th we asked to keep our luggage at the hotel as our flight was not until 6pm. We were told to speak to the bellman for this. We asked to do this and he said 'how many bags?', we said '4' and he said 'what, all these bags?' as if this was unreasonable. The bellman, a middle aged Indian man, then asked us how we were getting to the airport and we said a taxi. He then laughed in our face and proceeded to lecture us about how expensive it will be and that we should book his service at a fixed price of 90 dollars. This was a Sunday so we expected no traffic and we were going off an estimate that a taxi would cost roughly $65 from our guide book, which turned out to be accurate. This man then proceeded to rudely try and harangue us into using his service after my saying we are not interested several times. He then muttered under his breath about us as he took our bags into the holding room. It felt like we were being harassed by an unlicensed taxi service provider at an airport, certainly not what we would expect upon checking out of a Manhattan Hotel. This man was obviously only interested in booking a car for us so he could earn a commission rather than actually doing his job. Upon collecting our bags the man then removed them from the room an placed them directly outside the holding room and watched us move the bags down the stairs on our own, not offering to help despite seeing us struggle. He then hovered next to us while we were getting organized, and when I said 'thank you', he then asked for ' a fee for the service. I do tip generously for these kinds of things, but this man deserved nothing and his attitude is the worst i have ever encountered from any hotel staff in any country. He moved our bags a total of 5 meters, in and out of the room. We tipped him $2 simply so he would leave us alone. I would also like to point out that there was no bellman in sight upon our arrival at the hotel, or if there was a bellman, they made themselves scarce and did not help us with our baggage.

Second stay: My favorite booking site offered slightly higher price this time (still well below 200 dollars a night), but having the previous experience, I did not hesitate. While the room had the same furniture, it was very small (it was difficult to walk to the bathroom - so little space between the bed and the wall), there was no coffee maker, and of course only 1 flat screen TV. There was no indication of room differences during the booking process, so I tend to think I was simply lucky the first time and got a room in a different category. A chance to get lucky for anybody :-) PS: There was a big and messy reconstruction ongoing at the reception area during my stay.

I probably spent a dozen hours looking for the right hotel room. I was treating my mother to a little vacay after she retired from 30+ years of nursing. I didn't have big budget and needed a room with two beds. That's a challenge in Manhattan. I found the 30 30 on Expedia and then made my booking from their website. Very easy to navigate and great cancellation terms. Two days before leaving for New York, I noticed the price had fallen from $179 to $139. I cancelled my original reservation and rebooked at the lower rate. What a deal! The entrance is nothing special and the lobby is sufficient. They are still in the middle of the building overhaul. I expect this was an apartment building, turned condo, turned hotel. Our double twin was not available, but they upgraded us to a King Suite. Small consolation. The room (423) was directly across from the elevator. Didn't bother us much. LOCATION: So that hotel is a great location for some and not so much for others. I can't stand Ties Square or busy tourist sections of midtown. This hotel is in Murray Hill, on the lower east side of \"Midtown\". It is quiet(er) and has a more authentic neighbourhood feel. The 33rd and 28th street subway stations on the 4,5,6 line are within two minutes walk. The Starbucks (always a big selling point for this country boy) is around the corner at 29th and Park. BATHROOM: Very clean, nice toiletries, good light, hair-dryer. Dislikes; no bathtub and plastic cups for drinking glasses. ROOM: Modern and spacious (at least ours was). Nice bed linens and very comfortable pillow top king mattress. New paint and carpeting. Some \"IKEA-like\" furniture. Great blinds for half shade and full shade - nice to sleep in with. Mounted flat screen television. Not sure what kind of channel selection it got, we never turned it on. Ironing board and iron in the closet. Laundry service apparently available. No minibar or refrigerator. Not much of a view, but who cares, you don't go to New York to look our the hotel room window. RESTAURANT: some semblance of a Greek, Spanish, French, Italian (Mediterranean I suppose) thing in the lobby. Had potential, but Gordon Ramsay would throw a fit at the decor, confused menu and service. I think some rooms included breakfast there. INTERNET: Available for fee throughout the building. Better yet, go have a martini in the restaurant and ask the bar tender for the \"ZANA\" wifi key. Will I return? YES.

I chose Hotel Thirty Thirty because it fulfilled this criteria but also the price for the room was just within my budget and the positive reviews I read on Trip Advisor suggested this would be a wise choice. Sadly, it wasn't the experience I had hoped for - having stayed in New York before, I was expecting a certain standard (and such, had paid for it too) but the hotel did not reach that standard. On a basic level, a hotel in New York needs to be in a good location, have a comfortable bed, a good shower and perhaps a TV if you are travelling alone (it is nice to have some background noise!) Whilst I was never going to be spending my whole trip in my room, it was important the room was comfortable and suited my needs so that I could get on with enjoying the city. I was staying in a Classic Single room and was surprised at how compact it was. A simple L shaped room meant there was barely enough room to move from bed to door without carefully negotiating the suitcase which had to be put near the door each time I was in the room to allow me to move about. Having stayed in NYC before, I knew the rooms were small but this room was very small and though I asked to be moved to a bigger room a few times, staff told me there was no chance of this happening but did offer to move me to another Classic Single which I saw and realised my current room was in better shape. Perhaps what annoyed me the most was the manner in which staff told me and the fact that I was staying five nights, a little empathy would not have gone amiss. Anyway, here are the positives about the hotel: - Location - Comfortable Bed - Good shower - Good TV in room - Ipod dock - Iron/Hairdryer Essentially, this is all one needs from a room but unfortunately, the negatives overrode these benefits: - Cleanliness - I thought the standard of cleaning was below par - my room was only deep cleaned once in my stay, the rest of the time, given a cursory wipe and new towels plonked on the toilet. I also complained about ants as a bread roll was thrown behind a sideboard by the previous tenant to which the receptionist tsk tsked in agreement but failed to get it dealt with and it stayed for the duration of my stay (though the ants did lessen) Air conditioning - Was very awkward to operate and at one stage was switched off by a cleaner/visitor to my room which meant I had to figure out how to operate it. It was also changed to heat mode which in the baking heat of June led to a very uncomfortable night and it was only in the morning that i realised that the setting had been changed to heat rather than cool (and i hadn't altered it in anyway before this point). - Wi Fi - I think it is very cheeky to charge $13 a day for Wi Fi seeing as some hotels give it for free. I understand from a business point of view that the hotel needs to charge but did feel that if if one is staying longer than three nights (which I was), this should be offered at a reduced rate or made complimentary. Plus, those computers in the lobby that charge 25 cents a minute and demand a $2 minimum will quickly eat up your money! - Staff- I found the staff were polite and perfunctory but not willing to help out further. Not only the bread roll incident but when I was asking to change my room, the receptionists both shook their heads and said no, without offering any reason (ie the hotel is full or I need to pay more), it was just not possible. Another occasion, I asked for the quickest route to an address I needed to get to and the member of staff told me he didn't know (fair enough) but made no further effort to help me find the answer. Information - Simple things like how much phone calls cost, how to work the air conditioning etc had to be asked. A simple information pack/binder in each room would have helped a great deal and meant I would be able to find out information more easily without asking staff. Also, there was a notepad with a single sheet in my room which i used and this was not replaced which was rather annoying as I needed a pen and paper when using the phone and constantly had to keep my own to hand. Honestly speaking, Hotel Thirty Thirty is not a bad hotel but I didn't feel like a valued guest nor did I feel that hotel was value for money. I would only recommend this hotel for a one night stay or if you get a room for a very good price (ie something you would pay for hostel). If you have a little bit more to spend or can stretch your budget, I would hold out for a deal with a boutique hotel or a chain which at least will have the most basic of creature comforts as standard. A real shame as this hotel has character (there are actually residents who live in the hotel) and a shabby chic which is quite endearing. Also, though I didn't mind the renovation, I would have probably gotten annoyed if it had been nearer to my room. Maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't feel i got value for money. Still, it didn't affect my trip too greatly but it didn't add to it either and for that, I am giving it average!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "Steph22183", "ReviewID": "UR114644335", "Content": "Service sucked.

Everything in our room was brand new - the walls, the carpet, the tile, the bed clothes, the furniture, etc. - and designed quite tastefully & modern. My only complaints all deal with temperature. We couldn't find anything in our room that let us control the A.C. Were we able to control the A.C we probably would have kept the room about 5-10 degree's cooler. Also, it took the hot water int he bathroom to heat up. We learned this quickly so got in the habit of turning the water on about 5 minutes before we actually intended to get int the shower.

Another note, we booked a standard queen and it was the smallest room we have ever been in. While the hotel is currently being refurbished, these rooms are very tiny. This room would be suitable for a single traveler, but not a couple. Thankfully, it was only for two days. The location of the hotel was very convenient, though. The evening desk staff was surly.

I made my reservations on January 11, 2011 for a stay 5/20/11 thru 5/24/11. Due to travel changes, my son, who has never been to NYC was arriving several hours ahead of me, so I called the hotel before I left, to confirm my reservations for a double twin room, and that they would let my son check in without presenting a credit card, as they had all my info and would wait until I arrived to present the card, they reassured me that \"everything is in order.\" NOT!!!! He got there and had to present his Visa debit card, which tied up his personal checking account funds, and instead of two twin beds, we were given a really bad room with a queen bed. When I got there and tried to straighten things out, they wouldn't let me remove my son's card as the guarantee card, and they could not change our accommodations....I booked this trip more than 4 months ago and can't understand how we couldn't get the accommodations I reserved....for our inconvenience, they agreed to not charge us for the first nite if we stayed with them for the duration and keep checking daily for new accommodations....which never happened....and they were kind enough to give us a fold out cot that was unbearable to sleep on (it was half the size of a twin bed) we ended up putting the mattress on the floor, which was very gross. But wait, it gets better....when we checked out and I went to pay the bill....guess what....nobody made notes on the account, and even though I had a signed itinerary by the supervisor the front desk person would not credit me for that first nite....said I had to call back at 0830 to speak with the supervisor....which I did and he never returned my calls....needless to say, I got very irate. I just spent 4 nites in a room without any ventilation, mold on the bathroom walls, a view of a brick wall, and carpet I wouldn't walk on without shoes, but had to throw a mattress on to sleep....and she couldn't honor the credit? I kept showing it to her....she kept asking me to describe the man who signed it....my reply was that I had seen thousands of people over the last few days, shouldn't you be able to recognize your supervisor's signature? She then proceeded to tell me how difficult I was making her life.....HUH??? Her's??? I am still waiting to hear from the supervisor....wonder if he will ever call? I travel A LOT....domestically, and internationally....this was by far the worst experience of all....even with the low expectations I had when I booked the room.

The room itself was lovely and had just been renovated - the bathroom was huge! However a design flaw meant that you had to put a towel on the floor right by the shower otherwise it would flood the bathroom. The screen is not long enough. The bed were very comfy and the room itself was small but large enough to move around it and drop off shopping. The in-room safe was very handy, and meant we could lock away valuables without worrying. Plenty of lovely soft towels in the bathroom, however we did run out of toilet roll twice as the roll was never replaced, we had to go down to reception to ask for some. The only major downside was that the room right next to us was being renovated - resulting in being woken up by the contactors around approximately 8.00am - 8.30 am each day (apart from Saturday when they were not there). We did not feel the need to complain as we were up and about by then anyway, but if we had wanted a lazy day this would have been very annoying as they were loud. There was plastic sheeting covering the floor and lots of plaster everywhere, so we tried to avoid walking round the room in our shoes.

The bathroom was very stylish but the shower stall does not close all the way and water gets all over the bathroom when you take a shower. It was nice to finally have a room with a desk and a chair. Previously the televisions were tiny but the new room had a huge flat screen. No coffeemaker, though. I am not sure if they decided not to have them anymore, or if this was an omission of some sort.

The room they put us in (supposedly an upgrade) was nice enough but within two minutes of unpacking we could hear very loud drilling from the room above. This continued for a while and we went downstairs to complain. The woman on reception did not seem at all surprised (given the previous reviews this is obviously an onging issue which the hotel forgets to mention!). She said there were no other rooms available until the next day. No apology just a rude response. This was a very special holiday for us and my boyfriend had requested by email that a bottle of champaigne be in our room on our arrival as a surprise for me. Despite this being confirmed via emial there was no champaige. When I asked about this, again there was no apology and a different woman on reception even questioned if we had made the request in the first place. Basically calling us liars as we could not remember the person who had confirmed the request. This however is the email my boyfriend received to confirm that his request for a bottle of champaigne was received. \"Hello, Your reservation is confirmed for arrival 22nd March and departure 27th March for a Superior Queen Room.

It was a real shame as it was something my boyfriend had planned as a surprise. Although they really didn't care about that!

We ate a lovely breakfast at the Pershing Square, situated on Park Ave opposite Grand Central Station, its under the bridge and is tradional inside, only a 5 min easy stroll from the hotel. We had a large healthy breakfast for $14 and this kept us going for a good part of the day. From there it was easy to jump on the metro and head either south or noth. A must is an evening trip to the revolving restaurant / bar at the top of The Marriot Hotel in Times Square, It opens around 5:30pm and takes around an hour to complete its circuit. Lovely to sip a cocktail and watch the world go by. We visited the Theatre's themselves for our tickets and ended up with a real bargain, and less commisions to pay to the touts. The Crooked Knife across the road was a great way to finish off a busy day - margarita's at $4 you couldnt go wrong! AND not far to stroll home. The Staten Island ferry is free and frequently crosses, from there you can get a view of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty, but it does not land at either SOL or Ellis Island, but well worth the trip if you are short on time or the queues are long for the other ferry.

But this is the kind of property I seek out when traveling alone or with my family -- good location, fair price, not too fancy. And that's what you get at the Thirty Thirty. It's solid. Was very happy to see the 6 train is only 1 block East -- that made getting around so convenient! Straight up to 86th St. stop for the Met, woot! Lobby is cavernous and chic. Check-in was smooth and unremarkable. Room was predictably small and bare-bones, but it met my needs. I really don't see why they won't spend an extra few bucks per room to add some art over the bed or get a nicer window-covering ... I had an dingy, old-school vinyl shade that refused to roll back up after I pulled it down for privacy. Ah well, street view was nothing to write home about. Tiled bathroom was clean, towels were soft (not scratchy, yay!) water was nice and hot with good pressure. Who gives a rip if the sink is outside the bathroom? Not me. And yes, I could hear street noise, so I picked up some earplugs at a nearby drusgtore. BRING YOUR OWN if you think you'll want or need them -- earplugs are $$$$ in NYC! Couldn't find any for less than $6; would cost $2 at home. Grrr. Thrilled to see Cosi one block away on the East Side of Park Ave. For the uninitiated, Cosi is a great little chain joint that makes fantastic sandwiches, salads, soups, pizzas and breakfast stuff. I miss Cosi so much, so when I come to NYC or Philly, I eat there as much as possible. And it's cheap too! Breakfast including coffee for about $6 and lunch would top out at $15 (my yummy soup/salad combo was $11). The only issue I had was that the front desk/concierge refused to print my boarding pass, which IMO is a bit ridiculous. Their 'business center' with computers and printers charges a per-minute fee -- how much you wanna bet Web access would be slow as molasses? I was in a bind amid the blizzard paranoia and desperately trying to make my flight on time, and it irked me that printing boarding passes isn't considered common courtesy these days. It takes only a few minutes. But I guess with a cheapie hotel, it's to be expected.

It seemed clean, spacious enough (we're former New Yorkers-- the bathroom was huge!), and the fixtures were more updated than the picture on the website would indicate. However, when we came back for the evening, the room reeked of smoke. We definitely would have asked to move if we were staying more than one day, and I believe they would have accommodated us. I'm not sure if they have non-smoking floors or just non-smoking rooms -- clearly, someone nearby was smoking-- but I can't seem to recall any signs indicating that our room was non-smoking. I know the hotel can't necessarily be blamed for other guests' behavior, but perhaps some more stringent policies (signs or bigger signs in rooms/floors) would be helpful in enforcing this. The other deal-breaker for me was that the bed was, as the cliche goes, hard as a rock. I tossed and turned all night. (I'm in my early twenties and really not a picky person with regard to firmness, but this was just not comfortable).

We got a 7 day pass for the underground and local buses from the subway just around the corner on 28th street.We payed $30 each for this but was well worth every penny as we used the underground every day to see all sights we wanted to,very quick and easy to use to get around the city. Eating out at night is the only difficuly i would say,if your not sure where to eat,restaurants are few and fairly far between, although one night we went next door to the hotel where there is a restaurante, you get 15% off every main meal if you are a guest at Thirt Thirty,this is great for the first night to sit and get your barings.Lovely food and friendly staff. We did most of all the sightseeing we wanted to in our 5 day stay here along with the tour around central park.Originally we wanted a traditional carriage ride but instead had a park ride from one of the guys who rides on a bike and takes you around the park,this was cheaper and gave you an hour with a tour of where all the celebrities live which is far more interesting.The horse and carriage ride is $75 and is only 15 mins long!this was an eye opener when we found out.

The window had just a white pull down blind-no type of valance or anything, only two pictures one behind each bed, the longest wall in the room had no pictures, bathroom small and dim.

Cons: Booking snafu caused \"broom closet upgrade\"; usurious rates for internet access; dour restaurant staff The last thing I look forward to when checking into a NYC hotel after a 5-hour flight (coming from the West Coast) is a hassle with my room. Unfortunately, that's what happened when my room was given away, and I was reassigned to a lower-category room (note to everyone: avoid getting room 608--literally a largish mop closet!). Thankfully, a very understanding and ready to please Alya (I hope I got her name right) worked to make things right by changing my room the next day to the proper category (still a smallish room, and I'd had larger MidTown hotel rooms, but hey...this is Manhattan-whatever). She also smoothed things over with some complimentary breakfast vouchers for the restaurant next door. As for the breakfast. The connected restaurant is called Zana. The breakfast was good (meat/eggs/juice and/or beverage, or a more continental style option), but the deadpan, emotionless waitress who's face droops when she sees a voucher in your hand was a bummer, despite her nearly $2.00 \"service fee\". :( I don't know whether the hotel owns the restaurant, or they just partner--they are connected via the hallway in the front entrance. The room I was moved to was an updated, but obviously older room in an older Midtown Manhattan building. The room was clean, orderly, and uncluttered. The environmental controls worked sufficiently, and I used them to cool the room (we had high 60s/low 70s most of the days, and at night (high 40s made the heat welcome). Three elevators speed you to your floor of choice, which was nice. The location is conveniently located between Park Avenue South and Madison Avenue. One to two blocks east or west gets you to subway and bus service, and taxis were readily available, with decent restaurants in close proximity. Within 5-7 short blocks north and south, an enjoyable walk with shops and Madison Park can be had--I suggest you do that at least once (going to the Shake Shack is in itself worth the walk!). I enjoyed a nice sub-10 minute walk to my client in a relatively safe, clean neighborhood with lots of tourist \"eye candy\" (Empire State Building, Flatiron District, New York Life building, etc). Professional and pleasant bell, desk, and door staff, and all with great attitudes salvaged this business trip experience for me.

The guest services associate/greeter (Vickie) made us feel so welcome while we waited for our room. She must have spoke with us for about 20 minutes just to get to know us. It was very nice. She wwas so friendly. We were 3 hours early to check-in, and the agent at the desk did made every attempt to get us in and off to our first NYC attraction. We were in our room 2 hours before she said we could be because she quickly radioed the housekeeping department to alert them we had arrived. It was a great example of customer service. Also helping us was the concierge (Judy), she took all the time we needed to help us get going in the right direction. Another huge plus was the attention given to my wife by the sales director (Kerry) When I mentioned it was her birthday, and her first time to NYC, she upgraded our room to a larger room with a king bed. This was done even though they were at a very high occupancy, and probably could have made more money by selling it to someone else. When we were leaving the hotel on departure day, and asked if we needed a cab to the airport, the bellman ran out the front door and all the way down the street to the corner, which had to have been over 100 yards away, to hail a cab quickly for us. It was something to see. Last be not least, our room attendant, which I wish I had her name, was without question the most appreciaitve person I have ever met in the service industry. Upon our departure, she came up to us to personally thank us for staying with them and allowing for her to take care of us.

There are great restos around the neighbourhood - and would highly recommend - Wine on 30 - it is a small but fabulous local wine bar - where I had one of the best nights in NYC - the guests were great to chat with and the owner was an awesome host. For my future trips to NYC - I will definitely return to the hotel - as it is in a great location, staff are excellent - but not so much the conceriege who really was not helpful in providing information to Penn Station.

I had 2 bookings, one by myself for 5 nights where my stay was very average and then another booking in a different room with a friend which was good. My first room, although it was a non-smoking room, smelt strongly of smoke. The room next to mine had someone smoking in it 24/7. I had to go to the pharmacy and buy deodourisers. Also the tiles in my shower were mouldy and I had to wear thongs/flip flops in there which was dissappointing. The bathroom was also tiny and the wash basin wasn't in the bathroom but in the bedroom which I didn't like. The room was however clean and not at all noisy. I did ask to change rooms on the second night but as it was summer the hotel was booked and they didn't have a room available for me. The second room that I stayed in with a friend was clean, had nice shower tiles where I didn't need to wear thongs/flip flops and it had a huge bathroom, it even had a bath! Also no signs of smoke. If I had stayed in the second room the whole time I would have thought this was a great hotel and recommended it but maybe not worth the risk. Apart from the room, the hotel front desk staff were very nice and friendly, always willing to help/offer suggestions of places to go. Also, the woman at the concierge desk was extremely thorough when booking my shuttle which I really appreciated.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waldorf, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "klocco1", "ReviewID": "UR71463506", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel around 3:30pm on Friday, July 16. The hotel was on 30th Street, between Madison & Park Avenue. I mainly stayed at this hotel because they are 1) pet friendly, and 2) Four blocks from Madison Square Park (which had a doggy park area). Nice hotel, the walk to the park was easy, the hotel itself was impersonal, but the check in was fast, we did not have to wait. We were given Room 408, which was very big in my opinion, and the bathroom was HUGE!!! We faced 30th Street and at night, I only woke up once hearing sirens, but it wasn't on 30th street, it was most likely Madison or Park. 30th Street was quiet in the evenings. The hotel had an exit out of the back onto 29th street and a short walk 4 blocks down to Madison Park with the dogs every morning, noon and night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was very nice! The park itself was very nice and the doggy area was stocked with water and plastic bags for you know what! New Yorkers pick up after their animals! What I liked about the hotel: 1) Pet Friendly! Not fees, however, they do have a 2 animal maximum, but my dogs were very small, so they allowed all 4 and I truly appreciated that! 2) Large Room (# 408 was anyway) 3) Nice beds, comfy, (pillows were really fluffy) 4) Walk in closet 5) Huge bathroom with window and shelving. 4) Valet parking -- $30 for passenger cars, $35 for SUVs (relatively cheap in NYC) 5) Close to 28th Street Subway (Green line # 6 train) What I did not like: 1) Elevators (very small and cramped, very warm) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I have to say I never waited for an elevator 2) Lobby was impersonal, huge, but impersonal 3) No business center that I saw, computers you had to pay for Overall, nice hotel, good check in, good check out.

Though not what I thought would be the best feature of the hotel, the air conditioning was ACES! Each day the outdoor temp was over 100F and our room faced west. After full days of being a tourist, the room was ice cold when we walked in. That in itself was worth the money. The room is small and although I had read that in other reviews (and had decided that I could live with it) it was noticable that a chair would have been more relaxing to watch a little TV instead of trying to prop up on the bed. Also, eating a sandwich on the bed while trying not to make a mess would also have been avoided if there was room for a small table. They lose a little credit for a dirty shower. On the first evening that we were there, my wife and I both showered and the label fell off the conditioner bottle and landed on the floor. That label was still in the same spot on the floor after maid service that day. I didn't think much of it at the time, but later wondered what other obvious dirt had been left by the maids. Don't let me comments about the small room or one missed label on the shower floor mislead you. If you can get this hotel room for $140 or less per night, you can't go wrong. It is two blocks from the #6 subway and four blocks from the N, Q and R lines. There is a Starbucks on the corner and little restaurants within a block or two in any direction.

The service is good, but seems a bit understaffed and is always busy. But they DO try to accomodate your requests, so I'm okay with that. The room is clean, but absolutely no thought or effort went into making it look nice. None whatsoever. The room is also VERY tight (standard), and you can't even open up your suitcase without completely blocking the entrance. No place to store clothes, nothing. Everything is absolutely minimal.

WTF is that all about. Don't know if that is the fault of Expedia or the hotel, but if you're paying out of your pocket, be aware. In regards to the quality of the hotel, I think the following states it best: As I was going down the elevator, I met one of the people working at the hotel (cleaning or maintenance staff). The person asked me how I was enjoying the hotel, and I said everything has been good so far. As the person got off the elevator, the person joked, \"yeah but it could be better, right?\". Heck, even they know it's not a top notch hotel (or anything close). Again, for the right price, it is good for what it is, but don't expect too much.

After one day, I called again to ask if they could already solve it - the answer was very unfriendly, \"no, I had no time to do it until now\"... totally unacceptable! I filled out a servey of the hotel online back home and received at least an E-Mail of the hotel manager, appologizing for the circumstances. Value... is I have to admit unbeatable. The rates are fair - you get more, than you pay. Rooms... were kind disappointing this time. We stayed at Thirty Thirty last year in April and had booked a Standard Room. This time, we booked a Superior Room as we found a great offer on the homepage of the hotel. Unfortunately, the Superior Room was very tiny, it was dark and moreover, the first time I've flushed the toilet there was a huge pluggig - not very Superior Room if you ask me. Last year we booked a Standard Room we even had a kitchenette in it! So the relation of the room categories is not very comprehensible. Sleep Quality... was good - the beds were very comfortable and we slept very well. In summation, the hotel is good value and best location ever, rooms & service are average.

First, our welcome reception was not good. The students had pre arranged the hotel with the organizers from the school's administration office at (SCAD). When we arrived at our assigned room, it had one double bed for 2 students. We call front desk and they continued to question if we were sure there is one bed. We went down stairs and the front desk manager went up to check (guess they did not believe us). The next day my daughter and roommate were moved to a different room at her request. What really disappointed me with this supposedly \"safe\" hotel is that on Friday morning, my daughter came out the bathroom; with her roommate sleeping, to find 2 gentlemen in their room that was assigned by front desk. What a careless mistake. My daughter informed Front desk immediately. I have come to the conclusion that front desk did not follow the correct procedures in moving their registration to the new room. Since wish, the General Manager and I have had a discussion, and he reassured me he would call my daughter and offer her and her roommate dinner. He did not called, but my daughter called him to decline the dinner and have free internet for the duration of her stay instead. This was granted. Since which, I emailed the general Manager about how poorly this situation was handled by his front desk manager Katya and himself. Another disappointment was the professors were not informed; like I was made to understand by the General Manager, my daughter informed them. The General Manager promised to follow up with me and to date June 14 Th 2010, I have not heard from him or anyone from the Hotel. I am disgusted and feel that the school needs to revise the Hotel they use for there off campus program, for the safety of their students. This could have been an unfortunate experience, but thank God it was uneventful.My daughter was shaken up .Nevertheless; the girls seem to have decided to continue the program ,this is their last week and my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last stay there ever.

Paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2000 for a 10 night stay and feel the hotel is way over priced for what it has to offer. Will not be staying again and would not recommend it. Paid extra for a superior room as having looked at pictures of standard rooms and previous reviews on TA I wanted to be able to have some space in the room. Good points: clean room, location of hotel, helpful concierge. Bad points: booked a 2 bed room for me and my elderly mother. At check in I was advised only 1 bed room available but another 2 bed room may become available. In the 10 nights we were there we had to sleep in the same bed. Reception never contacted us to move us to a 2 bed room. At check in asked TWICE about breakfast (which was included in our rate) and was told just walk into breakfast room but I knew there was something about vouchers from a previous post on TA and the following morning en route to breakfast room asked again and was advised we needed vouchers!! How the vouchers worked was not explained to us, the breakfast staff had to explain it to us. There is no information in the room to tell you anything about the hotels facilities, any hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in, in any country and other cities throughout America have an information booklet in the room. I only found out there was an ice machine on my floor as I could hear it from my room every time someone used it. No pay per view movies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was 1 or 2 nights we returned to the room relatively early and would have liked to watch a movie but this is not available at this hotel! Loads of news and weather channels are! Even though there were 2 windows in our room and 4 lamps the room was very dark and the lighting even in day light was very poor. Breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when breakfast is included in the rate you have to choose between 3 types of breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwithin the box\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The service was a joke. After the second morning of breakfast we would have not continued eating there but we had paid for it so we had to eat there. The staff kept getting the order wrong most mornings, eggs wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cooked the way you asked for them, ice when you asked for no ice, tea wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be given etc. Breakfast every morning was a frustrating experience. Every morning the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcservice tax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bill would be placed on the table in a black wallet, one morning we left the money on the table before they produced the black wallet.

The expense of all of those extra days on my own dime can add up pretty quickly, so I am always on the hunt for an inexpensive hotel so that I can spend more of my hard-earned money on great food and shows and such. This was my first visit to Thirty Thirty Hotel. I was really impressed from the moment I walked into the beautiful lobby. A couple of other reviewers felt it was dark, but the vibe I got was more \"swanky modern\". Every time I passed a hotel employee in a hallway or the lobby, they always greeted me and had a smile on their face. Not something you expect from a hotel that is relatively inexpensive. As one normally expects in a town like NYC (or Chicago), the room itself was small, but more than enough room for me and my partner. The bathroom was of average size, but there was a bathtub, which you don't often find in a lot of NYC hotels. Although they did not provide a luggage rack, I simply used the ironing board as a perch for my suitcase inside the closet, which was very large by most standards. The TV was rather small, but when you are in a fab city like NYC, you probably shouldn't be watching too much TV! I tend to sleep in rather late and sometimes do not leave my room until 2pm. Often this means that housekeeping has to skip my room (which does not bother me). I was surprised (and very pleased) that on the two days I did not leave my room until late afternoon, my room had been cleaned while I was out. One of my favorite things about this hotel is the location. You are less than 4 blocks from two different subway lines, which take you just about everywhere you might want to go, mostly without a single transfer to a different train. The only downside is that internet in the room is wires and is $15 a day. If they added free wireless, that would be perfect.

We accepted this and went upstairs to our clean and tidy room. The location of the 3030 is great, close to everything you will want to look at in Midtown and handily near Penn Station. The second day we went down to the lobby to get our room swapped to the one we booked. We were told to go get our things from our other room, bring everything down to the lobby, check out - and then they would re-check us in again to the new room - and we could take our things back up to the new room. We were only there one night and were more interested in seeing New York than mucking about with the hotel, so decided to just tough it out with the two single beds instead of wasting our time going up and back again and again. Thirty Thirty was a good hotel, I would recommend it to people as apart from our room issue there were no other problems.

Ours was at the side and looked out onto a brick wall and windows of the next building, but this didn't really matter as we weren't in the rooms much due to sightseeing, shopping etc! Our room wasn't very spacious but was adequate and the only storage was a small cupboard for hanging clothes plus 2 drawers. The bathroom though was huge with bath/shower, WC, sink and shelves. Our daughters' room was more spacious but with a tiny en-suite, though they didn't mind. However they had hardly anywhere to put clothes - only a small cupboard with hanging rail. They therefore lived out of their suitcases, but it wasn't a huge problem as we were only there 4 nights. This was our first visit to the States and we had heard about the friendliness of the visitor service sector. However, our check-in was not particularly friendly - we received rather abrupt service from one of the lady receptionists. Other than that, the Reception staff were generally happy to help and answer questions, give advice etc. I would be happy to stay at the Thirty Thirty again as there isn't anything really negative to say about the hotel. The beds were comfy and the showers lovely and powerful. The only downside was the lack of clothes storage in the twin room - it would have been nice for the girls to have even a small drawer unit in which to put a few things.

The room although shabby didnt appear very dirty so I just told myself we only need to sleep and shower in the rooms we will be out most of the day. Got up at 8, flushed the toilet and stood at the sink cleaning my teeth, it suddenly dawned on me my feet were wet-Iooked down and realised in horror that the toilet was overflowing at an alarming rate, I phoned down to reception and waited whilst chucking every towel and bed linen I could find down to try and soak some of the flood. I then phoned reception again as no.one had arrived, they finally stopped the flood which at that time was heading to the corridor, and covered under my bed and under half the other bed in the room. I then realised it had gone into the clothes cupboard and soaked everything on the floor-this wouldnt have been so bad if the water wasnt BROWN and every towel and linen I had thrown down had gone brown too. The guy came to soak up the water and begin the clean up process, another member of staff then says oh rm 17 flooded 3 days ago. I was so upset at the start of my nyc adventure I went down to reception and asked pls cd I get a new room, I got no apology and a sour faced receptionist who told me they were full and to try later!! I appreciate they may have been full but an apology would have been a gd start. Without wanting to spend a day of the 4 we had moving hotels I went back to the room asked the guy cleaning to give me 30 minutes, I packed my dry stuff up and stored in my friends room. I took all my disgusting stained clothes to the cleaners opposite the hotel(a fraction of hotel prices by the way) and we went off to begin our hol. When I got back to the hotel I was then given another room- it had a bath plus shower, double bed and plenty of drawers etc for storage-and I felt much better :) My friend remained on floor 6 where someone died the next day and he heard them outside his room talking about putting down talc for the smell(I can only assume this was a live in resident as the maid would have found a holiday maker before the smell). I began to think floor 6 was one to avoid ha ha.

We had 2 single beds but there was plenty of space to store luggage and unpack clothes. The bathroom was very clean, and there were stacks of clean towels and shower/shampoo/soap that were replaced each day. We left a $3 tip each day for the maid which is very reasonable for such good standards of housekeeping. There was also an LCD tv in the room with a good selection of news channels. Onto the location, which is why we picked this hotel. This hotel is just perfect for location. 4 minutes walk from the subway on 28th street (the hotel has an entrance on 30th and 29th street [front/back] which makes things so much easier) and there is a 24 hour Duane Reade pharmacy and McDonalds at 28th Street too.

You can walk to TImes Square and Rockefeller Centre in about 20 minutes but the subway was so much quicker.

The superior rooms are clean and big and equipped with all the basic amenities you would need, including free hi-speed internet connection on LAN. In sum, Thirty Thirty is sheer value for money and centrally located - near the crossing of Park Avenue and Madison Avenue - and so at a walking distance from the best restaurants and food joints - Italian, Indian, Chinese... not to speak of the attached diner that offers free breakfast to hotel guests and open till 11 pm for dinner. I would rate it higher than other high-end as well as low-end hotels like the Radisson or La Quinta in and around the same area. I stayed here for 10 days or more and would love to go back.

The sink was not in the bathroom, so when you are done using the toilet, you have to walk out to the room and if you forget to bring a towel with you, you have to walk back to the bathroom. The set up reminded me of a hospital room. Besides that, the housekeeping staff did not clean up the room until 5pm. We left for the day at 11am and thought that when we returned at 5, the room would certainly be ready for us to use. We were greeted by the maid who was embarrased and told us to go downstairs and report our complaint. When we finally got in our room, we wanted to find a restaurant on the net only to find out that we would be charged $14.99 a day to use their cable connection.

I just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights & was very skeptical of the star rating (3-star hotel), but NYC can be so expensive, I ran with a 3-star. I traveled with a friend, so we had 2 beds in a room. Here is what you need to know: 1.) Rooms are small 2.) the A/C unit is built into the window (no issue there) but when its on, it sounds like a 747 (if noise is an issue, sleep with it off) 3.) only place to put the TV is up about 9 ft from the floor, so when you're lying on your bed, you're looking up. 4.) the beds were small- dont know? Queens? They felt like singles. I kept thinking I was going to fall out- I'm used to Cal Kings. 5.) I'm mentioning this because I tend to check online the day before I leave (I hate checking in at the airport)- main gripe was the cost to print out a boarding pass- it took 30 seconds, ending up costing me $6 since the printer ran out of paper, so it would cost you $3, which its only $3, but that is just plain dumb (give us the convenience!!!) Now- was the hotel quiet? Yes. Never once heard anyone, nor did anyone wake me up. The hotel staff was amazingly polite and courteous and even helped me with finding locations I wanted to go. Cleaniness of the hotel was top notch- maid service extremely well. The bathroom is enormous. The location was perfect- close to everything- really probably the best location and right in the middle of it. A stone's throw from good bars and excellent restuarant. So location is probably one of the best in Manhattan. Would I stay there again? Definitely. I got a great deal on Priceline and it was a steal compared to the $400+ rooms I was seeing.

The room had a smell to it like animals or something. The TV was real old and the A/C worked but was loud. Basically the room was just old.

McCamey, and I am so excited about writing about 30-30 Hotel. Obviously my stay with the Hotel was perfect. My wife and I enjoyed some of the superior treatment we've ever received. First, management was fantastic, really enjoyable men/women to talk to and share any needs or fears you have at being in NY for the first time. I cannot describe how helpful management was, and not to leave out all the other employees who were super nice, for the sake of a better word. Let me say, I had my fears about being in Ny for the first time, but after several hours at 30-30, I felt like I was home, actually, safer. The staff gave me a room with a tub and shower as I was having some surgery and needed to soak in warm water for 30 minutes each day of our 8 day stay. The bathrooms were very nice, and the beds comfortable, quite and comfortable. To my surprise there was a safe in the closet where I was able to keep my money, and some medication for after the surgery. Little safes I could put my things in and install the combination that my wife and I were the only ones who knew it. That one feature was worth staying at 30-30, but there was more. Elevators, and several eating places across the street, in 30-30 was a nice restaurant. However, since my wife and I would be there 8 days, we needed a place for quick less expensive meals, and we found that place 1/2 block from Hotel Thirty Thirty's front door. A nice deli run by Italian family that made delicious lunches for less then $10. for both of us. Now in NY, where cigarettes cost over $10./ pack, those were inexpensive and delicious means. The problem I had was my wife kept asking me to finish her mean as it was too much for her to finish. All my life I've been told you have to be careful in NY, for it's a dangerous place. Let me say this last thing. I went down to smoke at 1:30am., 3:30am. and again at about 5am. as the surgery kept me awake with a bit of pain. I found I enjoyed standing at the door of the Hotel so much I was going down just to see the people walk by. I felt so safe that my wife and I walked from 30-30 to the doctor's office, from 30th. to 69th., leaving at dark and walking feeling as safe as if I were back in Arkansas. However, transportation is no problem at 30-30, for a taxi arrives at the door with no less then 2 or 3 minutes all day and night. There are buses, or the subway nearby. I loved the location of 30-30 Hotel. Now, this I want to say, for before we left we read some of the peoples comments who say they had stayed at 30-30 in the past, and they had some negative points in them. I was kinda worried, but let me assure you, I'm 65, I'm particular and very honest, I'm not saying anything here that is not true. I found nothing, nada,, nothing negative to say about my stay at Thirty Thirty Hotel. Even the gym for guest of 30-30 treated us special. I could not work out, but my wife did, and I was treated like royalty while I waited for her. You are right in the middle of everything, we walked to at least 10 places that tourist would want to see, and remember, I had a double surgery and was still able to walk to see the sites with no problems. The price was surprisingly inexpensive for a Hotel of that quality. Oh, I told you I felt safe and I did, but even though the whole area appears safe, there was always a member of management, or an employee at the door as well as a doorman. We decided they stayed there just to make sure their guest would have no problems, directions, ect. I told management I was coming back to NY as soon as possible, for I enjoyed it so much. Chinatown, the harbor, Statue of Liberty and we just happened to be at 'Ground Zero' for a Sept. 6, special service and memorial for those lost on 9/11. It was a special moment for both of us. If you are a country person as I am, and have never been to NY, experience it. It will be well worth your time. Make your stay at Thirty Thirty Hotel too, you'll be glad you did.

Yes, the porter came up about 5mins later with his dustpan and brush asking \"Where is it\" We explained it appeared it had gone out via under the door. He did not seem in the least bit surprised there were mice running around! He then left. I assume he thought we had captured this vermin and were holding onto for him. We were disappointed as no one bothered to contact us to apologise for what had happened. We checked out the following day but left our luggage in storage, how silly of us. After we collected our luggage, we were shocked to find mice had now bitten through one of our bags and had tried to nibble at the cover of a plastic container containing chocolates within the bag.

My wife and I stayed here at the end of August 2009 on the last leg of our honeymoon. The hotel was a real disappointment. The reception area looks the part but the staff were not particularly friendly or forthcoming. The corridor to our room smelt awful, a musty cross between stale air and hair removing cream! We realised that the standard room was obviously going to be small but by New York standards this was tiny. We just about had enough room to fit our suitcases at the foot of the bed and squeeze around. The sink (which I will return to) was actually located next to the bed - although some may say this in an en-suite! The bathroom was okay consisting of a toilet and shower, it could have done with some decorating as the grouting between tiles looked worn and contained black bits. On our first night my wife tried to use the sink but to find that the water would not go down the plug hole. Using my best plunging skills I managed to use the plug to empty some of the water, however upon doing this we were greeted to a surge of black soap scum, muck and hair rising from the plug hole which was frankly disgusting. This mess took an eternity to sink down where it came from! How the previous occupants of the room or cleaner did not notice this is incredible. To give the hotel credit the following morning the reception immediately got the handyman to fix the problem. The location of the hotel was great. Being on 30th Street meant it was two blocks away from the subway and very close to 5th Ave, Madison Ave and the Empire State Building. On our checkout the concierge tried to arrange for us to use their transport to LaGuardia Airport costing $45 dollars and insisted a cab would be as expensive - there not. Our yellow taxi cost us $25 - so beware!

It took some wrangling but after showing them our printout of our reservation they put us in an upgrade king room, telling us that was for one night and we'd have to move the next day. Next day arrived and different front desk help told us to keep the king at no extra charge. Typical amenities, a few toiletries, hair dryer, iron and safe. We seemed to be in the minority of English speaking guests. Most were Eastern European including Russian, Czech Republic, German etc. Loved the laughter and congeniality present in the lobby and in the two working elevators.

A good piece of advice for anyone going to New York & wanting to see the sights is to book everything before you go saves you so much time not queing, also you can get a city pass which is definatly worth buying is a book of tickets for Empire State Building, Guggenhiem Museum, MOMA, Statue of Liberty or Circle Line Cruise, The American Museum of Natural Histroy & The Met Museum. If you go to the natural History Museum i would deffinatly recomend the Hayden Planetarium it was amazing. Its also worth buying a Metro card for your stay you can then hop on & off as you please great value for money. Before we went i booked a photo tour with marc Samuels were he takes you all around New york or any place you want to go for 2 hours & takes photos of you so you get pictures of both/all people together the pics are fantastic & worth every penny, if anyones intersested his e-mail is (-----------) website is www.phototrektours.com we also booked tickets for a Yankees game which was a brilliant experience we got our tickets for that from allstar tickets e-mail: (------) Mike Fassio delt with ours.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "france", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "theodoraFrance", "ReviewID": "UR37065621", "Content": "Our room was quite large, perhaps it was because we had a family room.

This is the land of $300 a night, tiny, tiny mousetrap hotel rooms that try to make up for what happens behind your door by having an opulent lobby. It's not opulent, but I like the lobby at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. It is contemporary and functional. And, like the hotel itself, it has everything I need at a price I can afford. Get one of the King rooms if you are traveling with your spouse and what you will have is a home away from home getaway spot with a really comfy bed, high-end bedding, lots of light when you want it (and total dark when you want it) a nice seating area and desk and a really cool bathroom. Love the baths here. Marble and glass showers with fantastic shower heads. Nice soaps and great lotion, too. High--end products at a budget price. So relaxing at the end of a hard day of being a NYC tourist. It's not the Ritz. But its not supposed to be. The Thirty Thirty is in a neighborhood with lots of delis and family owned restaurants and little cafes and standard issue Starbucks nearby. It is really close to the sights, like the NY Public Library and the Empire State Building. And it is right on a subway line that takes you anywhere you want to go. There are also some highend restaurants close by on Park and they make for a perfect special night out for you and someone you love. But at the end of the day, you'll enjoy coming \"home.\" The staff is not at all intrusive but there is always someone around who will say \"hello\" or offer help if you need something. There's a great little restaurant right downstairs that serves everything from a cheap and filling breakfast to late night eats and a night cap. There's no free internet service. But you can pay for it in your room or go down to the communal pay stations in the lobby. I have stayed here three times now; once with my daughter when she was a teen and interviewing with colleges, once alone on business, and most recently with my husband when we attended a convention. I always have a complaint about something. But honestly, I cannot say anything bad about this place.

He wanted to make sure that we enjoyed our stay and was determined to give us a nice relaxing night's sleep.

The only aspect of the room that was not up to date were the old CRT style tvs and the lack of an MP3 device plug in on the clock/radio. However, please remember that this is a 3 star hotel, which I would say is the best appointed/styled 3 star I have ever stayed in. Furthermore, you cannot beat the location in Midtown Manhattan! The \"Little Curry\" Indian district is just blocks away, as is the Empire State Building, not to mention countless other places to see. There are plenty of food/bar locations within a block, and the bar/restaurant in the hotel looked very nice, but we did not try it as they stopped serving food at 11pm. Overall, we were very pleased with our experience and would definitely stay there again given the chance. The fact that an employee actually paid attention to our story of being stuck at the airport all day and decided to act on it by giving us an upgrade stands out as reason alone to stay here again.

Also from Park Avenue South you can see the MetLife building and Grand Central Station. On the recommendation of reviewers on here, we visted the Crooked Knife restaurant and bar. So glad we did, as it is an amazing place. Really homely atmosphere, very cosy and the food is amazing. The staff were very helpful and the service prompt.

The hotel website gave the impression of being a 3*+ boutique hotel and I took the pictures and blurb at face value. I wasn't expecting the world but I thought I had landed a great bargain and somewhere we would look forward to returning at the end of our long days exploring New York. Unfortunately, we were in for a real disappointment. The lobby and service are fine. Nothing special, just OK. The area where the hotel is situated isn't too bad although it's not that great. It's a five minute walk from the Empire State Building although the approach from Fifth Avenue is rather ropey with run down shops with graffiti. All acceptable up to this point. The real horror story was our room on the third floor. The walls were scuffed and dirty, the twin beds (two singles) were adequate, the carpet looked dirty and the air conditioning unit was extremely noisy. The porter who brought our luggage up to the room hurriedly pulled down the (dirty) blinds in the bedroom and bathroom to mask the hideous outlook from the windows. The lighting consisted of a neon light in the corner of the room and a table light. This made the small room look and feel dingy. There were no tea or coffee making facilities (is this not standard everywhere in this day and age?) and internet access was not free. The (tiny) wardrobe was not a full size and there were only four coat hangers. The only plus was the bathroom which was an adequate and was clean. Certainly not a hint of luxury or a 'wow' factor. Nor was it a relaxing haven at the end of our days. That's what you really want on holiday, isn't it? And we didn't want to pay the earth - we shouldn't have to to get the basics. Other contributors have suggested what great value Thirty Thirty is. I beg to differ. Value is when you receive fantastic service or a wonderful experience at a really good price. The price here is not exorbitant, but it is expensive compared to the overall service and quality of the hotel. You are left with a feeling of dissatisfaction when the overall level of service is poor and you are paying for it. And you don't always want to complain when you are on holiday. Although I do hope this review is a warning to others who are tempted to stay at the Thirty Thirty. I left with a sense that I had been let down and what should have been a special week for my mother was spoiled by the standard of the hotel. Someone suggested the Thirty Thirty is effectively good quality student accommodation and it certainly has the feel of student digs. I would recommend paying a little more and paying for the basic services expected in a hotel - tea and coffee, cleanliness, space - rather than suffer here. It's the little things that can let down a holiday - in this day and age internet access should be free in hotels. There should be tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. The adjoining restaurant was hopeless for breakfast but there are plenty of other options so that didn't really bother us. The Crooked Knife restaurant opposite was worthy of mention as being a good bolt hole for the evenings when we wanted something quick - first night and pre-theatre. I had e-mailed the hotel several weeks before our holiday to say that I was bringing my mother for a special birthday treat and to confirm we would have a twin room with two beds. I did not receive a reply which I guess should have been a sign that all was not well with this hotel. I would definitely not return to the Thirty Thirty and I could not recommend the hotel to anyone, other than perhaps back packers or students who are looking for a base from which to explore New York City. It is on a par with a good hostel rather than anything approaching 3* even city standards.

I spent the first 4 nights in a Standard Room (I was in town for a conference) and the next four nights in Superior Room (once my partner joined me). Appearance: The hotel is not rundown, but it is worn looking. It needs cosmetic attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c new paint, the carpets need to be professionally cleaned, etc. Also, some of the renovations were not well done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, the seams of the baseboards don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though these things are going to make or break your stay, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a small thing you notice when you realize how much choice there is for hotels in NYC and you wonder if you made the right one. The bathrooms in both rooms looked to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd renovated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c within the last 5 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it looked like there was mould on the floor of the second one. The rooms look okay, but they are completely lacking in character. I wonder who the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decorator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no art on the walls (maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing!) and my first room, because it was small, felt very institutional. Size: The Standard Room I was in was pretty tiny. No sink in the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was beside the bed. The tv was hung on the wall, so the only way you could watch it was by lying in bed. It was an outward facing room on the 10th floor, so there was constant night traffic sounds. By comparison, my Superior Room was inward facing on the 12th floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c terrible view, but very quiet as it cut out the traffic noise. I felt very confined in the first room, even for as little time as I was spending there. The Superior Room was twice the size of the Standard Room, so you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like you were suffocating. [And because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where else to put it, the lock on the bathroom door in my first room was faulty and I actually got locked in it for about 5 minutes one night following my shower. I was able to work on the lock and jiggle it free, but I had terrible visions of having to scream for help in my towel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I stopped shutting the door after that!] Cleanliness: Well, I was most thankful not to see any bugs after some of the reviews I had read. The beds were made and towel were restocked, and, happily, the carpet was vacuumed, but other things were missed. The coffee maker in the room, for example, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned. We drank coffee before leaving and my partner left his coffee cup on the bedside table with about a quarter inch of coffee in the bottom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was still there when we came back at 11 that night. If this is outside the scope of their cleaning, fine, but most hotels are usually more thorough when they clean the room. Also, I found that the cleaning varied by floor and by night, so it seems to depend on who is working. The 10th floor was cleaner than the 12th in terms of the housekeeping. But, the 10th floor also smelled like cigarette smoke. Staff: The people at the front desk weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unfriendly, but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly friendly either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although this varied among the person working. They answered questions, but with a couple of them it felt like an inconvenience when you were asking them. By comparison, I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco last year and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. When there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much choice for places to stay, something like customer service can really make a difference. The manager was unhelpful/ unfriendly when we asked him a question. BUT, I was able to check in early on the Saturday I arrived, so that was really nice. Location: Pretty good location. Right near the subway (Park) and there are 3 deli/groceries nearby, which are open late or all night. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking back from Time Square late, stick to Madison or Park and 34th, some of the other little streets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t well lit. That said, at no time did I feel uncomfortable or unsafe walking alone. We ate one breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It was a little pricey in comparison to nearby places, but the food and service were good. Price: In a way, if price is an issue for you too, it all comes down to this. We got fantastic deals. I paid $104 per night for the Standard Room and we paid $118 per night for the Superior Room. If I had paid anything more than that, I would have been really upset with the hotel. Our rooms were booked in December. The website prices for the same rooms are currently more than double what we paid and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine paying that much for what we got. But, maybe they save the really nice rooms for people who pay more! Would I return? Probably not unless I got the same deal and then only in the Superior Room as the Standard Room was way too small.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "GSUgal", "ReviewID": "UR25282408", "Content": "Our room was updated, very clean, and the location was good.

I later was browsing through trip adviser, reading some reviews to check out what people thought. Although the good were good, the bad seemed very bad, this left me feeling pretty worried. When the taxi pulled up to the hotel I thought what is all the fuss about, Maybe the awning over the front door was a little tatty, but apart from that I could see the Zana restaurant looked nice and the souvenir would be the perfect place to pick up some camera batteries. The crocked knife across the road I saw immediately, it really is across the road and is great for a quick beer, as is Rosie O'\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 on 46th street.

His shuttle car was very comfortable and got us to our hotel in 45 minutes. HOTEL First impressions of the hotel are poor. Looks quiet run down from the outside, but so are most old buildings in New York. The reception is very nice, very clean and spacious. A porter took our luggage off us straight away and waited with us until we checked in. Check in went smoothly. We were ask to produce our credit cards as a holding fee for any extra charges, which is normal in any hotel. However we didnt have credit cards and were asked to give 50 dollars instead per room which was refunded at the end of our stay. The porter kindly brought our bags to the two rooms we had booked for the 4 nights with a tip of 5 dollars. ROOMS Myself and my girlfriend were given a small but comfortable double room (404), with a front facing street view. The bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was very clean with a good shower. This room was perfect for the both of us. Towels were provided every day and room was cleaned everyday if need. We left the do not disturb sign on the door one of the days while we were out in the city and room wasn't cleaned. Our fault nobody else's. My parents and brother had a triple family room on the 11th floor (1138) This room was excellent. Sofa bed as you entered the room with a dressing table and tv, all in a separate living area. Bedroom was opposite with a plasma tv on the wall and a cd player beside the bed. Bed was a super king bed, huge!!! Bathroom was really nice and modern, standard of a 5* hotel. Breakfast in the hotel is terrible. Service was very poor. Plenty of little diners on maddison avenue to eat instead of here. We ate out every night in different restaurants, plenty to choose from. The closer to time square the more expensive it is to eat. Across the road from hotel is the crooked knife bar and restaurant. This was nice but there is nicer out there in the city. Was great for a quiet drink (pint miller 3 dollars)!!!!!! If you want to see all of manhattan make sure to do the hop-on hop- off bus. It will take you around the city up town and down town, were you can jump off at any stop. Buses pass by every ten minutes for you to jump back on. Stops at empire state, time square, china town, greenwich village, soho, ground zero, central park and many more. On our return to the airport we made the mistake of booking a car and driver from the porter and were charged 110 dollars. We all wanted to travel together in one car.

The room was small but nicely appointed, modern and CLEAN. The bead was very comfortable and the linens were quite luxurious for a 2 star hotel. There supposedly was internet in the rooms, however ours did not work, and even a call to the service provider never resolved the issue. This was my biggest negative of the hotel. The only other complaint is that in our particular room, the head of the bed was directly in front of the door, which made the hallway noise a bit loud in the mornings. Not all bad\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 got us up and out of bed (talking 8-9 am here). Put a towel down the last night and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear a thing. The temperature was very comfortable, your could easily open the windows if needed and there was a heater in the room. Of note, I feel that the website very accurately depicts the hotel. Service: We found it to be friendly. Check in/out went smoothly. They even recommended some good restaurants to us. The maid service did a good job cleaning everyday. Had to ask for more towels once\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 did have to wait almost 20 minutes for them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so average service. Overall, considering the price we paid and the price of other similar hotels, I feel that Hotel 30 30 is an excellent bargain. It is a nice hotel with an excellent location. It is clean and safe. I recommend it for anyone in the sub $250/night range (at least in mid dec). Biggest negative was that the internet did not work in our room.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cWhat a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "ClaraBLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR22775970", "Content": "We were visiting NY for my husband's 50th birthday and the recent reviews of this hotel gave me hope that I had nothing to worry about. The reality was different. We were in a tiny room at the back of the hotel which I'm sure was only meant to be for single occupancy. There was hardly room to move around and the bathroom consisted of a shower and toilet with the washbasin in the bedroom. The bathroom also reeked of stale tobacco smoke (obviously used by previous occupants to avoid the smoke detectors in the bedroom). There was no rack to put baggage or chair for clothing - we had to use the tiny available floorspace.The housekeeping was poor, insufficient towels, bathroom supplies etc. For 2 days the water in the washbasin ran brown, leaving a sediment in the basin. I understand that work was being undertaken in the area surrounding the hotel but the water in the shower was unaffected! We had to buy bottled water for brushing teeth. The staff were very indifferent about everything we mentioned and said there was nothing they could do. We did not experience any of the helpful, friendly staff mentioned by others except for the very helpful porter. We were just glad to be out so much and not have to spend any time in the room as it did not lend itself to relaxing after such active days. The only plus side, the bed was comfy.

The staff could not have been more helpful, especially when we had checked out and were waiting to come home and my phone battery dies, I asked the reception staff if they would mind charging my phone, not a problem. Ok, so some staff are not English/American, however how many hotels have you been to in the UK that have a full team of local staff? The restaurant attached to the hotel, Zana's is ideal for breakfast, however I would definately suggest the Crooked Knife across the road for an evening meal or even a pre/after night out drink. Ideally located for the subway, 3 blocks up around the corner, 5 minute walk if that. Macy's, Empire State Building and much much more all within walking distance.

The room was so tiny. It had two twin beds in and there was hardly any room for both of our suitcases. The bathroom was also very small and the wardrobe was barely big enough to fit a couple of coats and tops in. We basically lived out of our suitcases as it was easier that way. There was a TV in the room too which had quite a few channels on if you wanted to watch tv, but no drink making facilities. The room was a little tired, but we were not there to see the room but the city!! The hotel is in a good location, right in the middle of Manhatten. It is only two blocks away from the Empire State Building and the main street to walk to all the shops and sights. I thought that the hotel location was great as we got to see everything in 4 days that we had intended on seeing as it was so central. The staff in the hotel were lovely, which is not so typical of New Yorkers and they changed the bedding and towels daily. There is a little restaurant to the left hand side of the hotel and they do great cocktails! The breakfasts are amazing too and great to set the day off before a day of sight seeing of the city!! The photos on the website do not typically reflect what the hotel looks like exactly. It is quite trendy, but just a litlle tired thats all. Tips - Go up the Empire State Building in the day and up the Rockafella at night. This way you get to see a better view of the Statue of Liberty in the day and then see the Empire State all lit up at night. The lift in the rockafella is made from coompletely glass and the light show on the way up is fantastic! We went in November when the Christmas decorations were up, ice skating in Central Park and at the bottom of the Rockafella is a must. Also a ride round Central Park on a horse and carridge. They are expensive but you have to do it. The Staton Island ferry is FREE. We did not know this and the lady in the information kiosk was very rude when I asked where we needed to go and pay. This is worth doing just to see the Statue of Liberty up close. Ground Zero is very errie but its nice to go and pay your respects to all the people who lost their lives there. The photos and storey all hung up are so sad. The Sex and the City Tour of the city was also very good for all fans out there and we also did a movie and tv tour of the city too. Think they only cost us about \u00c2\u00a320 per person which is nothing for a couple of hours out of your day. The main bar in grand central station on the top right of the main staircase do really good cocktails too and very strong!! hehe The revolving bar at the top of the Marriott in Times Square is great too, on the drinks mat there is a map of all the sights you can see out of the windows. The drinks are pretty expensive in here but worth the view. We got a table reservation at The Rainbow Rooms to in the Rockafella centre. The food was out of this world, although very pricey, but hey you only live once!! Alll in all the short city break was amazing, we got to see everything we wanted and this had part to do with the hotels location.

The obvious smell of homecooking from the room next door, the location in the end of a narrow and dark corridor combined with the view of a dump of a backyard made me ask for another room. Without even trying not to show her annoyance at my outrageous request, I was given a room where the closet was about twice the size of the room. The foldable (!) door to the small, old bathroom was impossible to close or open, so I had to go sideways in and out of it. The small bed had a bedspread full of stains. I should have asked for yet another room, but the receptionist was incredibly hostile, and I was exhausted. So - whatever you do, don't ever stay at this hotel.

In the morning, I went to the front desk, complaining of the smaller bed, the manager was still not in and was now told, \" A double bed in the rest of the States is considered a \"Queen\" size bed in New York City.\" Honest, that was what was said and there were two front desk people there. I explained the headboard in the room was of queen size and the mattress much smaller, argued a bit, demanded either a \"Queen\" size bed which was what we were paying for or a room with twin beds. No Queen could be found or a twin...we were actually sent to check a couple of rooms and they were still doubles. Finally, I asked if a king size bed was in the hotel and if any were available.

What it did have was an ideal location, very clean rooms, friendly knowledgeable staff, reasonable rooms/washroom. We stayed in Room 1038, with a king size bed and a washroom which was made entirely in slate. Very nice touch on the slate! The room itself was a fair size for a New York hotel, it had two TV's, one in the common area where the door was located with a desk, then another in the bedroom itself. The chairs and sofa in the room was a bit iffy but who really sits or sleeps on those for a long time?! The bed itself was very comfortable and the bedding was very clean. The maid replaced the towels everyday and was very tidy. They provide soap/shampoo/lotion however we just choose to use the ones we brought. The washroom also has a hairdryer so don't bother bringing one. What the room did not have was an in-room safe - which wasn't the biggest deal for us at least. The view for the room was probably the only negative thing about the room but it never bothered us cause we were never in the room for long except to sleep.

We had a small 'longe area' with sofa, TV and table as you came into the room, then the bed area with a small wardrobe and another TV!However, not all rooms are the same layout - check them first and some bathrooms are much smaller than others even though you're paying the same price. Also, not all rooms have built in safes although there is a safe facility at the front desk. Friends also stayed at the hotel, 2 children and 2 double beds, with 'lounge area'. The first room didn't have a sofa in so difficult to watch TV - not saying that's what you want to do in NYC but sometimes a bit of down time is required especially if you have kids. Anyway the hotel staff were quick to help out and moved them to another room, which they were happy with. This isn't meant to be a negative review I'm just saying if you're not happy with the room say something and I'm sure you'll be assisted anyway they can. The standard rooms are rather small so I would pay a bit extra for a bigger bed and room. There are no views from the room except onto the main street below or into a type a of quandrangle at the back. But no-one was looking into your room either! There are various 'older' ladies staying in the place but I don't think they're homeless. But they add character to the hotel and are in no way offensive.

I am going to be very truthful about his hotel, so you 'really' know what to expect, i hope it will help you in making your own informed choice. So here goes.......... On arrival we were met by the doorman who straight away took our suitcases and placed them on a trolley, i went to reception, hubby went to the information desk where all the trips were displayed nicely. On first impressions, i thought it was begining to need re-decorating, and the furniture was a bit tatty, but not to extreme. Everywhere in reception was clean and tidy. We checked into room 902 on the 9th floor, the corridors and carpets were clean, and everywhere seemed very quiet. On entering the room it was freezing, but the windows were shut! I thought my god no heating yikes, but the doorman brought our cases up, gave him a couple of dollers, and bless him, he put the heating on full blast. It temperature control on the wall, so you can turn it up or down as you wish, it got to hot some nights. So heres the description of the room. We had one window looking out onto offices, and over looking the Empire state building. We had a huge double bed/or queen, plus two chest of drawers and table lamps. We had an old Tv which was useless, many channels, but typical USA rubbish on it and useless adverts, the trouble was the ariel, it just didnt work. We had a double wardrobe next to the bed in which it slided across, also another closet with an ironing board and hanging space, plenty of room for storage and shopping, i went with one case and came back with three!!!! The window was a good size has white roller blinds, it can be open, but not very far as you are so high up. It had also a smoke detctor. Nice white ceilings, light beige wallpaper, wine coloured carpet which was dry and clean. In the bathroom it was tiled, it had a sink and a toilet which worked, and a excellent shower and screen, no bath, all tiled to a good standard. The bed had a clean mattress as we checked and clean pillows, maid service was EVERY DAY, so clean bedding and fresh flannels and towels. We actually had a bulb that went in the little hallway, we never mentioned it, but noticed that it was renewed the next day, so very good service. The staff were not Amercian, but they were attentive, and gave us directions when required. They always remembered us, and greeted us at the door and very helpful. It got abit confusing with the west and east getting around, but if you use the Empire state building as a guide, you will be fine. Macy's is brilliant for shopping, pick your 11% discount card up from reception, dnky jeans for \u00c2\u00a320! Central park is about half an hours walk, worth going on a horse drawn carriage, we found the ROCK (rockerfellas centre) better then the empire state, cheaper and you can go to the top and get 360% views and no perspex, so i can recommend that. To see Mamia mia on broadway is a must, and the Liberty helicopter ride is a fantastic experience you will not forget. The only downside to the trip is the New yorkers themselves, i found them very rude, no pleases and thank yous except the older generation. Food shops especially the delis are very good. We ate at Tads near the corner of Macys and 'Andrews', they had good food and very good prices. We experienced minus 7 degrees in the day, had freezing cold weather, sun, wind and best of all the snow. My experience of the thirty thirty hotel and the shopping was absolutely fabulous. May i add that normally i am a 4-5 star person, not a snob, but do like the comforts of a up market hotel, but please believe me when i say we had a truely wonderful stay at this hotel and would return. It was clean and tidy, no frills, basic yes, but had what you needed. You will need to bring your onw kettle if you want a drink, although saying this there is a deli across the small road open 24 hours, so we often picked up a coffee on route. Straightners will work in the rooms but bring an adapter, they do have hair dryers. I also would like to mention about the homeless people that live there, they are not exactly homeless but pay a small amount, they are not rude, dirty, but are very chatty and walk around with slippers on. We spoke to them, and they were very curtious. They do have dogs in the building, but that said, they do in other hotels and in the shops! So it is the norm. I hope you have a great time, and i hope i have mentioned some helpful advice to help you make your decision.

Our first visit to New York and a belated honeymoon. We absolutely loved New York and will return as soon as we can but just not to this hotel. The main reception area is lovely and can be a bit misleading when it comes to prejudging the rest of the hotel. The reception staff were not at all friendly. We arrived late after a long wait in the airport and there was not so much as a greeting. The hotel room was awful. The picture we saw on the internet had obviously been taken with a very wide angled lens as there was barely enough room to walk along the bottom of the bed between the wall. We kind of thought Ok we are here to see asmuch of New York as possible and not spend time in the hotel room but even so. The room had no view except the brick wall of the next door building. therefore it was dark, very dark. We had to have the light on and the blind drawn during the day as there were workmen working outside. The bathroom had seen better days and the tiles were filthy. We had no towels left for us on two of our days there except a hand towel which we shared after our shower! There was an awful smell in the corridor and in our room. A damp mouldy smell. Our sheets had holes in and the blankets did not smell fresh. So to sum up we would not reccoment it but don't be put off New York was brilliant. Everyone else we came across was friendly especially the taxi drivers. The people we met were so proud of where they lived and quite rightly so. It was spotless and we felt so safe.

It's hot and it stinks!!\u201d", "Author": "dorchcouple", "ReviewID": "UR13009034", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty for six nights in January. Upon arrival, we gave our reservation number to the guy on reception (I believe the manager) who after looking at his computer appeared a bit flustered. He sent a colleague up to room 1029, who confirmed it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when he returned to the lobby. When we got to the room, our first impressions were good. We had booked a standard room but the bed appeared to be kingsize and the room and bathroom were both of a very reasonable size, although the bathroom in particular needed a good clean and/or redecoration. However, there was a strong smell of air freshener and the room was very hot (reaching over 80F during our stay compared to the 20/30F cold outside). During the week we asked three times for the heating to be reduced (the hotel information states each room has guest controlled air conditioning but there was no control at all in our room). After the third attempt we were given a fan, which was noisy and pretty ineffective. So we left the windows open but as our windows faced another tall building there was no breeze coming in at all. The room was also inadequately lit making it feel even dingier. On our first full day we returned to our room late afternoon to be confronted with THE MOST DISGUSTING SMELL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheesey/ vomity, I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe it. We had no idea where it was coming from but it filled the whole room. We opened the windows and brewed some coffee and the smell gradually faded. Then a couple of days later, again late afternoon/early evening I was having a shower when the smell started to fill the bathroom. Luckily I had nearly finished as it made me heave and I could stay in there no longer. The smell was worse in the corner by the toilet, we think it was coming in through a vent in the ceiling. The room next to us was occupied by a woman, who every time we came into or left our room, was sat at a computer with the TV on and her door propped open. There was a bag of clothes/towels outside the door and the bed was covered in more clothes. We assume she was living there, as other reviews on here have mentioned. Our theory about the smell is that she was possibly cooking something in there at the same time every day and that the smell was coming through from her room into our bathroom next door. The smell was apparent in the room at some point each day either when we returned to the hotel or before we went out again for dinner. One evening, it was later than usual and when we went out to eat I had totally lost my appetite as all I could think about was the smell and it made me feel ill. Looking back at our arrival, we now think the staff member was sent up to check for the smell rather than whether it was clean and it explains the overuse of the air freshener. We think we were probably given the room because of some error in their booking system. On the plus side the hotel was well located for the Empire State Building and Macey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and close to the 28th and 33rd Street subway stations. The porter Mohamed was very helpful and friendly and the rest of the staff, although not overly chatty, were polite enough. The bed was made every day and towels replaced. Also we used the hotel car service back to the airport which at $70 including tolls was cheaper than the taxi we had got into the city. Unfortunately the Thirty Thirty Hotel slightly spoilt our trip to New York. By the end of the week I was dreading going back there because of the smell. If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had another room we could have had a totally different experience but we can only go by what happened to us and we would certainly not recommend the Thirty Thirty Hotel to anyone.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNo thrills but no problems Great for price!\u201d", "Author": "traveller5678072", "ReviewID": "UR12996849", "Content": "Stayed for New Years.

Ill try to be as honest and fair as I can from a British point of view... Location - I guess it depends what you are looking for. We were there for shopping, the location is ok for Macys, 6th Ave etc. But too far for heading to Times Square of an evening. We walked it and it was a good 25-30 min walk each way. Also the area where it was located didnot feel the safest when walking back late at night, very dark with a lot of strange people loitering around. As we were 3 young women we wouldnt stay there again as safety is one thing I will not compromise on. There was very little in the way of restaurants, nightlife etc close by. Hotel itself - the rooms really are tiny. True that you dont go to NYC to sit in your room and to be fair we only really slept there but still, a little more room would have been nice, we kept crashing into each other and into things. There was nowhere for us to unpack or put our clothes or shopping. No mirrors anywhere(!!!) apart from a tiny one in the bathroom. No cups or glasses if you wanted a glass of water and not enough towels, we repeatedly had to call front desk for more. When we complained, we were told that we needed to make a list each morning of what we wanted and hand that to the maid?! Which annoyed me as these are basics things you expect in a hotel. Only one plug socket which made charging things/using hair appliances hard. The room was never cleaned properly and on our last day we started to notice a lot of flies. My final and main warning would be for people to beware of the concierge guy there. He will try to trick you and fleece you as much as he can - for example he told us that to book a taxi back to JFK airport would cost $100! Luckily I have been to NY many times and know that is costs around $50 at the most, but I have no doubt that others will have fallen for this. We got the impression he was scamming to pocket some of the money on taxis/attractions himself. If you want to book anything talk to the guys at reception, they booked us a cab for $50 in the end and when he found out the concierge got pretty intimidating over it all. I think in all reality this is a 2* hotel. Not dire but certainly not what the brochure leads you to believe. Think average, basic and cramped and you ll be on the right track.

We arrived at the Thirty Thirty at 9pm on a Friday night after travelling around America for 3 weeks staying at various priced hotels so thought I had an idea of what to expect. The first impression was the bell man who let the door go in my face whilst we struggled with our cases, then the arrogance of the front desk clerk, who was neither welcoming nor pleasant. We asked for an ashtray to go with our smoking room (naive to think one would already be there?!) at 10pm and again at 11.30 - this still hadn't arrived the next morning. When we questioned why we had a kitchen in our room (practically next to one of the beds) we were advised this was a mistake and we should have been allocated a room without - we packed our cases and were allocated a different room when we returned from our day out - this was possibly the smallest room in the world. If you sneezed on the toilet you risked fracturing your skull on the sink. The Hairdryer didn't work, nor did the electrics - the sockets of which were hanging out the wall. Not wanting to make a fuss we left it and just stayed there the night thinking we would put up with it. Then in the middle of the night the toilet started flushing itself every 3 minutes and the air conditioning started revving like a motorbike. We were then allocated our third room where the bathroom was bigger but there was no natural light as our room backed onto a courtyard with the adjacant building. The sockets were still hanging off the walls and we couldn't get the shower to work but luckily we had a bath. We gave up in the end and just stayed in the room for the last 2 nights. I've never complained about a hotel room in my life and definitely always chose an easier life than to moan about things but I would warn anyone about booking this hotel. The location is good but it's seriously outweighed by the numerous bad points. There are plently of other hotels in the surrounding streets at similar prices so opt for them. The hotel lobby is very deceptive as it is quite impressive but all that changes when you enter whichever room you are unlucky enough to be allocated.

The staff was helpful the couple of times I asked for anything.

The pillows were wrinkled, like someone had been there and left, just pulling up the covers. Nothing was tucked in. I pulled back the sheets---thinking this might just be the way housekeeping does things at Thirty-Thirty--low and behold the sheets were not clean, clearly had been slept in and there were a couple hairs in the bed, which I looked for knowing this would be the tell tale sign (I travel a lot). Ok, fine, gross. I went downstairs, got a new key, went to the next room. When I arrived at the second room a bad sign--the carpet in front of the door to the room had something on it, looked like sheetrock dust or dried bread, but darker. The door in the narrow hallway next to the room was blocked partially by a walker--what a senior would use (clearly a senior was in the next room which was also so small their walker didn't fit?). I opened the door and saw the comforter on the floor and the ironing board out and bathroom lights on. Another dirty room. I went back to the lobby and told the same person at the front desk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe contacted housekeeping via walkie talkie.

There was a massive TV in the room with plenty of channels which came in handy while we were getting ready to go out etc. Our bathroom was huge with a basin, toilet, bath and shower. It was all clean and tidy. We ate breakfast downstairs in Zana's restaraunt so we could then go back upstairs and get ready for the days activities. The food is nice, I wouldn't say it's expensive compared to eating in a similar place at home in England (it was $12 for a cooked breakfast) but if you're on that much of a budget you can just order toast! The best bit about the breakfasts (according to my mum) is the waiter who's sole job it is to go around refilling people's cups of tea and coffee (because she's a tea addict and it tasted like \"normal\" tea) her record number of refills one breakfast was 7! Anyway, on the whole we found the Thirty Thirty to be clean and reasonabley priced. The housekeeping staff were friendly and seem to take pride in their efforts and it really showed. (We saw the corridor carpets being hoovered everyday by the way) I would however be inclined to agree that there are long term ressidents in the hotel having bumped into a few elderly ladies in the lifts on various days who did not look up to much travelling but this did not negatively impact upon our stay. This was by no means the most glamorous hotel I've ever stayed in, however we got what we paid for and were happy to compromise somewhere to sleep with more spending money!

We arrived to the hotel a while before the actual check in time and our room was ready, the lobby was exactly like the ThirtyThirty website shows. The receptionist was very prompt - no complaints! We stayed on the 10th floor, the lifts were quick and clean, the corridor was fine, carpets a little dirty, but who spends time in a corridor? The room was a Superior room and exactly as shown on the website. We had a lovely big queen bed, with sparkling white Egyptian cotton bedding - the bed was SO comfortable, two large bedside cabinets, a desk area and a walk in wardrobe containing a safe. There was a large TV in the room and also a CD player. The bathroom was slate and had sink, toilet, bath and shower - all of which sparkling clean. The room was more than large enough for us two and ALL of my shopping bags and luggage, and believe me there was a hell of a lot! The AirCon was a little noisy but we were able to sleep with it off so not a problem, when we needed the AirCon on, we were awake, so the noise didn't bother us at all. The toilet did overflow once but the janitor was there within 2 minutes of my call to reception and cleaned up the mess promptly and efficiently. Once we requested more towels and within 10 minutes we were provided with an abundance of fresh, clean, white towels. The room was cleaned every day of our stay, the bedding changed and we met the maids in the corridor a couple of times, they were lovely. I particularly liked the location, it's on 30th and Madison, just near to the Empire State, it's far enough out of Times Sq to get a real feel for NY and you get to see so many New Yorkers going about the daily lives, there a couple of fantastic delis around too, well worth a visit! I would however recommend that you don't eat in Zanas restaurant in the hotel, it's weird, it's over-priced and the food wasn't up to much! This hotel is a 3* hotel and is recommended by tour operators for the budget conscious traveller - if you expect a higher star rating, then pay for it! In my opinion ThirtyThirty lives up to this and the service that we received and experienced was first class, it really was. If you just want a clean, comfortable, modern base for your NYC trip, then ThirtyThirty is perfect for that. The website portrays an accurate picture of the hotel.

The bellman was very courteous - he graciously helped us with our bags and even checked our room, to ensure everything was in order before he left. We stayed on the 12th floor, on the front side of the hotel, and had a great view of the Empire State Building. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, and are basic - the beds, though, are comparable to Westin's Heavenly Beds. I was delighted to see the crisp white sheets, duvet covers - I slept so well during my stay. The white cotton towels are very nice, and the bathroom was, unexpectely, well ventilated. We did come across some of the original residents of the former Women's residence - they were all very courteous and well-kept. The cleaning staff which we encountered were very pleasant, and did fulfill our written request for more conditioner, when we left a note on the bathroom counter. The young lady at the front desk was very helpful in reserving a car for our trip to JFK. For $60 (inclusive of tip and tolls), it was one of the best deals in town. If you get hungry in the late evening, you must try the street food vendor at the corner of 5th and 30th. He serves the best chicken skewers I've ever had - for $2.50/skewer, it was a steal! He usually sets up his cart around 6pm - and in the late evening, there is always a line up of hungry taxi drivers. Location is the best!

The reception could do with being a bit more professional and responsive, but you are getting what you paid for, i can't imagine they are being paid that much to give the service to us. We did also spot on our last day what would seem to be homeless ladies sitting in reception arguing over popeye chicken, and that a few of the doors on our floor were different and looked more like a front door rather than a hotel door. The best thing is the location which you could not fault a few blocks and streets over from the Empire State Building, Macy's and a few more streets up Times Square. The other great thing is the little bar below which I think serves the best cosmopolitans in the city, and believe me i tried a few on our trip.

What a bad experience. We would not recommend it at all to any one especially any family who needs a little bit more than the strict strict minimum. We were not looking for luxury but only a bit of comfort away from home. I am a 3-4 star hotel (4-5 when traveling south) budget traveller and like to search a lot before I book to get the most out of my money and was reluctant to try this one but was confused by the different opinions. Now I wonder if the great ones were posted by the hotel. That's the reason why I feel that I have to share our experience, a real one. CONS: First the strong air freshener made us uncomfortable as you walk in the hotel and is all over the place. It took us a day to get used of it. We were in room 219 with yes lots of the old ladies of the building who live on that floor. We don't mind about this matter since they don't bother us at all except that I think the hotel neglect this floor cause there are permanent residents and except when we were in the lobby and one of them scared my kids. Bad view, hard mattresses, urine smell, a small TV, oene tiny standing closet, only one tiny garbage bin on the washroom. The hairdryer The next morning only 2 sets of towels were there, the sheets were not changed. The staff are so not happy to see guests. We asked for parking informations when we arrived and they didn't even inform us that you can save 20$ at the one at the corner of 5th and 30th, we saved more than 40 bucks cause the parking guy told us not to forget to get our voucher stamped by the reception to get the rebate.We had to wait 20 minutes to pick up our stored luggages and we were the only ones in the lobby. Now I understand why this hotel is not busy compared to all the ones we stayed in Manhattan at the other visits. PROS: The room space was large enough to move around. Great location but there are lots of other hotels around the block. I know we are only there to sleep but just hope that we can help some families or parties to avoid a bad experience which could make your NY trip less enjoyable cause we love NY.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLocation only advantage\u201d", "Author": "Perrone", "ReviewID": "UR6485122", "Content": "Couple - 30s, We stayed for 5 nights early Dec.

However for my full experience, read on: FLIGHTS & TRANSFERS: I have no complaints about the flights we got delayed going out and coming back but that was an air traffic control outage in Edinburgh and Glasgow, so was not BA problem. BA did however, managed to not send one of our cases, which was very frustrating but at least we had the other one. We were told we could spend up to \u00c2\u00a350 for the inconvenience and the case turned up 48 hours later. I had booked Supershuttle through Expedia for transfers to and from our hotel but they are not a 24hr company and had stopped for the night before we arrived. We got a lift from somone offering us a lift in the airport. He cost $50 and was fine, however after reading our guide book it said never to do this and I understand why, you never know what could happen. HOTEL: The hotel was my main concern after reading reviews. The entrance to the hotel is nice, due to our late arrival my girlfriend and I had to spend our 1st night in the hotel sharing a single bed as there were no other rooms, however we were so tired it was good enough. However the single bed was not too small and it meant we had to be cuddle up close, but that wasn't so bad :o) The next day we got a phone call to say our new room was available. The room looks like the pictures on their website, its not big but was good enough for what most people will be using it for, sleeping. We did not unpack our stuff from the cases as it was too much hassle and the wardrobe and 2 drawers were a bit limited but not exactly a show stopper. There was a safety deposit box provided also. Now some reviews said the hotel was dirty and smelly and I can understand what they mean, however do not let this put you off as it is not that bad. The maids come in with fresh towels and make the beds, however I think it was however only once \"quickly\" in the 5 days we were there, but again not a big problem as it's not as if you are trampling mud into the room. So all in all the room wasn't bad at all. As for the smells, the corridors could smell very strongly off smoke and as we are non-smokers it was unpleasant but once in your room it was fine. The towels were changed daily and bathroom was a good standard. We stayed on the 10th floor and there did appear to be residents (doors were different) but we never heard nor saw them so this was not a problem as some people have reported. So all in all I WOULD recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good base. LOCATION: The hotel is well located, it has a starbucks and McD's round the corner, along with a Duane Reade (like Boots or Superdrug). Your only 2 blocks along and down from the Empire State building, which was really fantastic for views. Macy's is close by (I will detail this later). Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Designer shops and Central Park are all about a $10 cab journey (incl. tip) away or about a 15 block walk. SHOPPING: Main reason for going. Macy's is hell on earth for any bloke and most woman. t is the biggest shop in the world (apparently) and is 18.... Yes 18 floors of hell. My girlfriend is a keen shopper and spent 4... Yes 4 hours in there and we only made it 2 about 4 floors, it then became too busy and by the end of it my girlfriend even hated it. The shop display outside is cool though but NEVER GO TO MACY's :o) I am not a bad shopper but was in a very bad mood by the end of it. A few days later we went to the Good shops i.e. Chanel, Dior, Loius Vitton, Gucci, etc and this was much more pleasant. We did not have loads of money to spend but had saved really hard to have a good time at the shops and my girlfriend did this, with the exchange rate being so good and the pre-christmas sales we managed to get a real Gucci bag tha was originally about $800 for about \u00c2\u00a3150 because of sales and conversion. So if you are a bloke and can handle a bit of shopping stick to the designer shops, it is a much more pleasant experience. SITES: When I was in NYC, being a massive Christmas person, I only wanted to see the big Rockefeller Tree. However in my naivety I did not expect it to be busy as the films and pictures you see it never seemed to be, but like I said I was naive and it was absolutely mobbed, the closest I got to the tree was about 50m and I struggled to even see the angel garden, so although it was nice to see the tree I was left a bit disappointed. Bloomingdales has a very cool light and music christmas display which I thought was fantastic. The rest of the sites you knew in NYC were great and will leave you all to discover and experience for yourself. CONCLUSION: Be prepared for a lot of walking and being tired at the end of each day, we got home most days at about 7 or 8pm and that was us done, reading a book, watching a movie or playing a DVD, just to unwind at the end of a day. Highly recommend the hotel for the price and location as well as NYC as a place to visit at least once :o)", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cHotel Thirty Thirty A pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Lafferty", "ReviewID": "UR6440193", "Content": "Hotel Thirty Thirty Nov 25 -Dec1st After reading a few bad reviews and a national Scottish newspaper, My five friends and I were anxious however we were pleasantly surprised.

There is a daily room service which you have to request by hanging a sign on your door and then all that happens is your towels are changed. The hotel is in a good central location near the empire state building and times square- the thing I liked best about the hotel was it was slightly away from the centre which made it that mch quieter- you could still hear cabs honking so I dread to think how nosiy hotels on times square are. With regards to New York itself it is one place everyone should go it was amazing - I reccommend buying a New York Pass as it gives you discounts and lots of attractions and lets you skip the queue in lots of places saving valuable time. Another tip is buying tickets at the main bus station to Newark airport as it works out much cheaper than getter a cab.

There was a range of guests and some lovely Americans gave us subway tickets to use and we found everyone really friendly and helpful. location wise, this place is spot on. You are round the corner from the Empire State, a couple of blocks from Grand Central station and in the middle (literally) which makes Soho easy on foot and central park pretty easy too. the shopping was AMAZING! I was in heaven and we ate pretty well for relatively little money; drinks were quite pricey but hey we went to enjoy ourselves! We would recommend taking the Staton Island ferry to see the statue of liberty, there are no queues and you get a great view - it is also FREE! The Twin Towers area is very eerie and I found it quite sad but you should go as it is somewhere that I think everyone should see just once.

Everywhere was booked up at the time, there was a HUGE conference at the time and everywhere was booked, the only place we could get was this (for want of a better word) 'Hotel' and it cost us an arm and a leg for the seven days we stayed. I fear this 'hotel' may have gone downhill since our visit, and we vowed that we'd NEVER stay here again, and try to warn as many friends and people as we could not to book their accommodation here. First of all BE WARNED - this 'hotel' was previously 'The Martha Washington' which was a hostel for women. I can vouch for the fact that there are residents still living in the building, and despite there being a complaint investigated yesterday by a top Scottish Sunday paper who sent a journalist to stay and investigate this accommodation, the Thirty Thirty denied that there was homeless' people living there, which is indeed true, however they did not confirm that there are residents living in the building from previous 'Martha Washington' days who have the right to live in this building. After our journey, we arrived at a busy reception to find that they did not have our room, and my dad was given a rollway bed, which I may add, was at rollaway prices for the week - about $150! We had no iron, but the room was spotless and the bathroom was brand new and ultra modern. There was no tea/coffee making facilities, which was a major disappointment and not good for a hotel that CLAIMS to be 'New York's Best Kept Secret' (as stated on their website). Staff were okay, but there was customers (groups of them) who had major complaints which I don't believe were resolved to their satisfaction. In comparison, our stay seemed okay, but I would NOT at any price stay at this 'hotel' again. I've since been to NYC since, (2004) and am booked up to go again next year, this time to the accommodation which I stayed at in 2004 which I can FULLY recommend to anyone, adults, families, couples etc (Radio City Apartments, Times Square) which costs a fraction of what the Thirty Thirty charges. You should check the amazing reviews for RCA's in comparison to the Thirty Thirty, and it's an room with kitchen or apartment with kitchen, WAAAAY better than what the Thirty Thirty has.

We were lucky because the room was actually a good size, had 2 single beds as requested, and we had a nice view of the Empire State Building too. We requested extra pillows and these were promptly delivered. And I had no complaint over the housekeeping either as our room was adequately cleaned every day. However our stay was not without its problems. There was a huge space under the TV where a dressing table could have been - but there was none, and also there was no mirror at all in the bedroom area. This made getting ready to go out very frustrating as we had to manage with the bathroom mirror! A full length mirror and dressing table in the bedroom were badly needed, rather than a kitchen that we didn't use. Also a bigger wardrobe could easily have been fitted in - it was tiny!!! Also, on our second night our heating stopped working. The weather in New York during our stay was lovely, but by the early evening in our room it was chilly and we wanted a blast of heat, but nothing. We contacted reception and eventually 2 men and a ladder arrived and fiddled in the roof - and it was fixed. But by this time we were under the bedcovers freezing. We then decided a nice warm shower was in order to warm ourselves up and get ready for our night out (and by now we didn't have much time as we were going to a gig). Unfortunately the shower was very cold and we were told the water temp. would be fixed in 30 mins, but we didn't have time to wait so we made do with cold showers and went out feeling decidedly frustrated. I have to say that most nights the shower pressure was dodgy, and at times went down to a trickle before coming back to normal pressure. The location was great though, and the beds comfy.

Firstly the staff (especially the evening ones) do seem to dislike being there and being asked to do anything (ordering the airlink/supershuttles to the airport, changing rooms to a smoking room, checking the availability of bigger rooms - even though this would bring them in more money) though I only mean the lobby staff. The staff and food at Zana's are both lovely. I had no problems with them finding my booking at all, which was a relief. The porters can and are happy to order you the airlink coaches even if the night staff try to fob you off to do it yourself. If you are staying in the standard rooms and think the space is a little tight, the beds are moveable and my mum and I found that by moving the beds against the walls and cupboards that this gave a lot more space. The bathrooms are huge in comparison to the rooms and the showers are hot and powerful, fresh towels are provided each day and there are conditioners, shampoos and soaps provided. I would say that the rooms and hotel in general are clean, if a bit scruffier than the pictures make out (why the teddy bears? this rather jars with the receptionists' general attitude to the hotel) Though the cleaners are friendly and didn't try to put back our room arrangement! The tvs are huge and have most of the main cable channels. Although there is no air conditioning the windows are openable and the hotel is warm, meaning you can get the room the temperature you want quite easily. The hotel backs on to an office block, so it's a little like the episode in Friends where joey and his neighbour across the way are singing 'morning's here' through their windows, but I would imagine that most NY hotels have this problem. At least the area is quiet and there is a nice deli on the corner towards madison avenue for snacks if you arrive late evening. I brought a travel kettle with me and Zana's do nice coffees and sell mineral water, so I didn't find the lack of facilities too bad. Yes if you are near the elevators there is a faint 'ping' sound in the background and the air vent from the restaurant is rumbly on and off during the day, but stops about 10 at night. There is a safe in the room which is easy to use. Overall it is a basic OK clean hotel which is a place to crash on a short break for those who don't expect to be spoon-fed. The location is good for the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue and one of the New York Sightseeing Loop bus stops (which I can't recommend highly enough for those on a short visit) and Zana's and the 24 hour deli on the corner make the stay more enjoyable. For breakfast, I recommend walking 5-10 mins to greenley square on 6th avenue and going to the martinique cafe for pancakes. I would stay there again, but only if it were for a few nights.

The corridor to our room constantly smelt of smoke, the rooms were small, not cleaned properly when booking, the shower was grotty and event the toilet paper in our bathroom was stained and dingy as if it had been dried out earlier that day! We asked to be moved to a different room and were given two rooms to choose from as an alternative - the first, had the delightful addition of a grubby kitchenette which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming only added room's somewhat peculiar aroma. The second - an exact replica of the room originally allocated complete with grime and dust!

(Spend the extra money and ask for superior.) A group of 10 (mostly deaf seniors) booked five rooms for 12/18/05 - 12/22/05. All rooms were superior, some with twins, some with queens. The queen rooms do have more space than the twin rooms. Yes, the hallway carpets were somewhat worn; but they were clean and so were the rooms. Yes, some of the staff was a bit reserved; but most of them were great! No one in our group had any complaint that was not taken care of immediately. One couple's closed captioning on the TV was not working - it was fixed immediately. Another room did not have a wash towel; one was brought immediately. My room didn't have a box of tissues.

We bought tickets which allowed for 24 hours use of the subway for only $7.00.

We booked the Thirty Thirty hotel with a company called DialAFlight and it was a package deal. We were supposed to be staying here for 3 nights. We arrived at approx 4.30pm Friday 6th May 2005 at the Thirty Thirty to be told (after a 9 hour flight) that the travel company had overbooked the reservations and that we would have to go to another hotel. The Thirty Thirty did organise another hotel for us but told us to go outside and flag a cab down and didnt even give us the correct address. WE couldnt get a cab so we went back to the manager and told him the least he could do was order us a cab. Eventually he went outside himself and got us a cab!! But we had to pay!! We were really annoyed because we had planned our holiday around mid town Manhatten and ended up on Broadway. The only nice thing was that the hotel we eventually ended up in was much nicer than the Thirty Thirty. They upgraded us to the Penthouse suite on the first day and then we had a standard room the rest of our stay. But I am still annoyed at the treatment we had at first. For anyone wishing to stay in a lovely hotel with pleasant surroundings, great rooms, excellent service from the hotel staff the hotel we stayed in was called On The Avenue, 77th Street, Broadway. Absolutely fabulous. Rooms very clean, plush duvets and pillows/bedding etc. Pianist plays in the lobby few nights a week and the hotel staff will book you a posh cab to take you to the airport on your departure. Take advantage of it, you get a Town Taxi (not yellow cab) for the same price and its a smooth (air conditioned) journey back in a Merc or Limo!!!

The room size was absolutely fine, it was actually L shaped and there was plenty of room to get round the bed plus an extra corner with a desk, TV and room for suitcases. The carpet was a dark colour which my partner was a bit suspicious of given that it could have been hiding dirt! But it was fine. The bathroom was a generous size, had a hairdryer and was perfectly clean. It was white tiles rather than the natural stone ones shown in the pic on the website. The staff were very friendly, and when our flight was delayed due to snow they offered us our same room back at $99 for the night (without prompting). They also phoned the airline for us to get an update on our flight time. The hotel will organise a car to the airport - the taxis don't do flat rate fares to the airport, only from the airport ($45 from JFK). We took the organised car which was $60 to JFK, because we didn't want to take a metered fare given the snow conditions could have held us up. I suspect that there are cheaper flat rate cars to take - check out the adverts in the back of the magazines sitting on front desk. The foyer is just as seen on the website - trendy mosaic tiles with minimal furniture. This is a fairly no frills hotel, there isn't a restaurant in the lobby or anything like that, however there is a restaurant right next door to the hotel that you can access through the hotel that does a very nice breakfast (whatever you want... eggs, pancakes, bagels etc). We stayed in room 1215, which had no view because it looked straight onto another building, but there was zero traffic noise so we could have the windows open with no trouble. I suspect it is slightly pot-luck whether or not you like this hotel depending on which room you get, but ours was fine. We decided on a superior room because I could see from the photo on the website that the standard rooms are indeed tiny.

When we arrived the hotel informed us that they didnt have rooms with two double beds, despite their room 'photo' on expedia showing two double beds!

The shower didnt work properly although it was fixed within an hour of reporting. We moved from this poor excuse of a room on our second day because we saw two cockroaches crawling along the wall by our beds. We were moved to a room with three dogs and two cats for neighbours (a pet friendly hotel is fine, but the pets seemed to be kept at one corner of the tenth floor) The area reeked of pets and there was a soundtrack of constant barking. Our third and final room was better but maybe we just felt a sense of relief as the only thing not working properly was the window (it wouldnt stay open). Throughout these room changes, despite us being polite and respectful, the staff were frosty and seemed put out that we wanted to move rooms due to an unwanted third and fourth guest (cockroach 1 & 2).

Both hotels had had mixed reviews but we had never been to the City and my girlfriend was especially keen to stay at the Plaza.

We were upgraded from our standard room to a fairmont room as it was our first time which was a nice start but when we walked into the room we were very disappointed. The room was a good size but very dated, and the bathroom was small and shabby with cracked tiles. To put it bluntly, the whole hotel needs complete renovation. I spoke to the Front desk manager on departure to express our disappointment, and he was very nice, admitting he dealt with these complaints all day everyday. He said it hadn't been renovated for 9 years, when most hotels get refits every 5. It has apparently just changed owners in the last month and already there are rumours that it will close for a year to be completely renovated - I hope they do this - It desperately needs it. However it sells out every night, living off its name and iconic stature, with people like us handing over our cash!

When we first started searching for a hotel in New York we were of course overwhelmed by the number of hotels we could choose from. Our goal was to find a clean, decent hotel located centrally in Manhattan and we wanted to room to be as cheap as possible and we wanted a private bath and a TV. After searching for quite a bit and looking into the option of using priceline we ended up on Hotel Thirty Thirty. We booked it through a travel agency here in Norway and we had to pay about 6400 Norwegian Kroner for the 6 nights (with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate that is about 150 dollars pr night including all taxes). I also used tripadvisor.com which is an excellent site where you can get feedback about most hotels in the US and around the world. We arrived in New York City at Penn Station and we took a cab to the hotel. The hotel is located on 30 East 30th street near Park Avenue (only a few minutes walk from Empire State Building). The taxi only took 5 minutes to get there and we paid about 5 dollars. The lobby of the hotel was nice and quiet and the check in was extremely fast. I just had to sign a paper and they swiped my credit card and then we got a non-smoking room on the 11th floor (1141 to be precise). Our room was quite small but nice. As you can see from the pictures there room was pretty naked (pictures can be seen on my homepage gardkarlsen.com. There were a carpet on the floor and the walls were covered with a light wall paper.Apart from the king-size bed we had a chair, a TV that was mounted on the wall in corner of the room, a couple of draws and a wardrobe with about 5 hangers. The TV had lots and lots of channels to offer but I felt like it was like the Bruce Springsteen song \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd :-) One strange thing about the room was that the sink was in the bedroom itself and not in the bathroom. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why it has been done like this but we got used to it :-) There was also a telephone and an alarm clock on the night tables next to the bed. The bathroom was also quite tiny but big enough to room the toilet and a shower. The bathroom was covered with tiles on both the floor and the wall. The shower was a step in type with a glass door. In the shower we found little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and in the room itself we found little bars of soap and moisturizing cream. Our window faced towards 29th Street and the view from our room was not great to say the least. We looked right out on a typical New York landmark I guess\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a water tank :-) But at least we were high up so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problem with noise from the traffic on Park Avenue at night. Location In our opinion the hotel has a pretty good location. It only takes a few seconds to get to places where you can have breakfast. We ended up having breakfast on Suzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen quite a lot but there were also a Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee right around the corner and a Pax place near by. There is also a restaurant connected to the hotel (Zana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment on it because we never ate there. The hotel was also pretty good located when it comes to getting around. It only took us 2-3 minutes to walk to the 28th Street/Park Avenue subway station\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and once you are on the subway you can reach most places in New York. We like to walk and on our first afternoon we walked to Empire State Building and after that up to Times Square. Apart from this there is not that much more to say about the hotel. They have a laundry service, there are an internet option in the lobby (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try it out but we used The Log-on Caf\u00c3\u00a9 across the street from the hotel), and you can borrow an iron in the lobby if you need one. Conclusion I see that there are many different opinions about this hotel on places like Tripadvisor.com. We felt that we got what we expected and I think that the information on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website -------------------- is pretty accurate. We got a small, clean room in a hotel that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much more to offer than a pretty good location. But when we are on a big city holiday we are not really looking for a hotel with lots of amenities. After all most of the day and evening is spent sight-seeing anyway.

There was a miniscule hand basin in one corner and a loo in the other and to use either after showering meant walking across a soaking wet floor. It's the sort of thing you might expect in a cheap room in the med but not a hotel room in New York! The decor was drab and the room in no way resembled anything that appears on their website so beware!", "Date": "May 7, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel LOLA", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d125274-Reviews-Hotel_LOLA-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$232 - $429*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">29 East 29 Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10016</span></span> (Formerly Hotel Thirty Thirty)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "125274", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/c8/d1/bar-lola.jpg"}}
