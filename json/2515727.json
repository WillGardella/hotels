Next when we came back after a day out, we found that although they provided a daily room service this meant that they removed the garbage, made your bed, BUT they also took the soap you had only just opened and didn't replace it.

The cons: Traffic can be heard; didn't like the flimsy window next to the door and flimsy 1980s dated chain lock on the door; could easily hear both sets of my neighbors on either side of the room; the breakfast was terrible, which is frustrating since how can you mess up cereal and milk?

Upon entering our room, I noticed that it very clean and neat, which is a must have criteria for me. The room we stayed in had two king beds, a mini-fridge and a 25\u201d TV, along with the baby crib we requested. With all the furniture, appliances and our luggage, the room became a bit cramped, even though it is a larger room compare to most motels I stayed at during our CA trip. The bed I had was comfortable and I was able to relax after full days at Sea World and Legoland. The motel is conveniently located with various types of restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We counted no less than 30 restaurants and fast food joints within 10 minutes driving distance. We took advantage of the complimentary breakfast which consisted of muffins, coffee, cereals, fresh orange juice, milk and boiled eggs. The kids enjoyed the breakfast; I\u2019d probably have had outside breakfast for a change if staying longer than a week. I would stay there again if traveling to San Diego with my friends or family.

Break-fast is much better than most other places - quantity and quality of everything they had was more than satisfactory. The only compaint I have is their pillows are huge and hard, so it left my neck uncomortable. They don't have any software or smaller pillows as replacements.

The room was nice and clean, the bed was a little on the hard side, and I believe because of the renovations, some of the screws to things were loose, the chrome shower fixtures I tightened as much as I could with my hand, the toilet seat moved, and I also noticed toward the end of our stay that the door security latch was loose, which was a bit scary considering many rely on it for safety, I tightened that with tweezers. The parking is narrow like others have said and I found the walls to be too thin.

There is one opening into the parking lot and the width of the actual space between rows is smaller than average. It took about 10 minutes to get in and out of a parking space with a compact car. This is because you simply cannot pull into a space, without doing various back and forth manuevers to make sure you don't hit either the cars on either side or the ones behind you.

Rooms were supposed to be renovated, but they still gave a feeling of a 1 star hotel. What I mean is that the room just feels \"cheap\" considering it is a 2 star hotel. In fact, even \"renovated,\" I would say it is a more of a 1.5 or a 1 star than a 2 stars hotel. Breakfast is just danish and coffee - and not very good, I might add.

Expedia had not forwarded their reservations. Instead of trying to solve this issue, she was sarcastic and very argumentative with them. When I walked up to her, her greeting consisted of \"What's your name?\" With no further word, she located my reservation, literally tossed my keys to me and disappeared into the back office. So much for a welcoming greeting. The room has a cube refrigerator (you defrost),TV, tub and shower, pretty basic Best Western stuff. The bed was made without a fitted bottom sheet. The maid used a top sheet for the bottom sheet (top sheets are smaller than bottom sheets). Naturally, whenever I rolled over the bottom sheet came undone and in short order wrapped around me. Impossible to sleep as everytime I rolled over I had to reset the bottom sheet. I mentioned this to the front desk the next morning and they said they would have the maid put a fitted sheet on. That evening I discovered she again used a top sheet and shorted the sheet so that a good third of the end of the mattress had no bottom sheet. I re-made the bed. Next morning, same promise. I asked to be given the bottom sheet, I would put it on myself. I was handed a mattress pad. I asked the receptionist if her life depended on it, could she tell me what it was. She said she did not know. So much for knowledgeable staff. She suggested that if I wanted a fitted bottom sheet I should go to Walmart and buy one. That's just what I did. On leaving I mentioned that I was really put off by the reception I received and the bed linens. The response I got was basically, \"Yeah, that's too bad\". Then inspiration struck: I told them I was going to review their hotel on Travel Advisor. Almost INSTANTLY the manager/franchise owner appeared. After listening to my concerns with an obviously well practiced show of well practiced professional sympathy he offered to take 10% off my bill, which covered the cost of buying a fitted bottom sheet. I asked him if he thought it was inappropriate for hotel guests to provide their own linens. He stated that \"No Best Western provides fitted bottom sheets\". Of course his statement is nonsense. In checking with Best Western's corporate offices they said each Best Western is individually owned and the bedding type is determined by each owner. The customer service rep seemed taken aback that they were using top sheets instead of fitted bottom sheets. The owner's explaination of the rude reception I received was \"Well, that's a good reason not to make your reservation through the internet\". Huh? I told him I made my reservation directly through his hotel and still received a rude reception. I understand it's not the Four Seasons, but his staff is still presumptively in the hospitality business, they just don't know this.

I didn't have high expecations, but it turned out to be a very comfortable stay. The room was very clean. It showed a little wear-n-tear, but not much. The TV worked perfectly, nice clear picture and the mini-fridge looked almost new. There was an attempt to have some attractive art on the walls. The bed - a king - was very firm and comfortable with three big fluffy pillows. The air conditioning worked well, and was fairly quiet. The water pressure was good and the showerhead was far enough up the wall that my tall husband could fit. (I hate the low motel showerheads!) Although there were noisy kids staying next door, once they were inside their room you couldn't hear them through the walls. There is a small table and two chairs in the room, so you can grab a quick bite, or spread out your laptop. The staff was friendly. The young woman working the desk when I checked in was very pleasant and professional. When I later came down for an extra towel, she cheerfully gave me a whole stack. I didn't take advantage of the free breakfast, but it's served daily from 6:30-9:30 AM. There is a small dining room just off the reception desk. There's also one outside table where you can sit and eat/rest, but it's right next to the entrance and a busy road, so I couldn't say it was scenic. The Inn was recently bought out by Best Western and there aren't good signs out yet, so it's easy to miss. I pulled into the Motel 6 next door by accident, and my husband, who came seperately, missed the entrance. The hotel sits right next to I-805, so it's very easy to get anywhere you want to go. Within a 5 minute drive away are a large variety of restaurants - mostly fast food and small local places - so there's no need to eat at the place across the street (which isn't so great).
