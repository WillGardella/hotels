Only three things that can be stated as \"negative\" are: little breakfast lounge with often not enough space for all (avoid breakfast around 9,00 am); since hotel lobby is generaly small & breakfast is served practicaly in the lobby, during cold mornings it can be quite chilly while you're eating your breakfast. Third thing is lack of hotel bar which means your evenings can be quite calm and restful, which is a purpose of most of our private trips, isn't it? If you, on the other hand, want to have a drink, dinner or quick snack, there's a lot of that in the area. We will come back for sure to WOH.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTiny but room and patchy service\u201d", "Author": "Travelingbiz", "ReviewID": "UR98986591", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for one night. It is really convenient if you arrive into Gare du Nord with the Eurostar. The hotel is a 15 minute walk away. The good points are that the hotel was recently renovated and the design is fairly stylish for a 3* hotel. The breakfast is sufficient and most of the staff are excellent. However we had a bit of a rocky start in the hotel. We arrived at 1240 and did not expect to be able to check in. The concierge told us that the room was not ready but that it would only take 30 minutes. We decided to wait in the breakfast area with a little snack but over an hour nothing happened. We overheard the receptionist speaking with the chambermaid who had not done the room. However the receptionist did not bother to tell us nor to apologize for the fact that it took much longer than expected. Again no problem if the room is not ready but one would prefer that they you straight away rather than keeping you waiting. Having said that for the remainder of our short stay the staff was very friendly. Second, it is important to be aware of the fact that some of the rooms are tiny. We stayed in 105 and while the decor was nice, it was on the small side even for Paris. In fact, it was so small that one might have difficulties placing a medium sized suitcase in the room or unpacking it into the tiny wardrobe. We did not use the Internet given that one had to purchase a special card at reception which I believe were 10 Euro for a day. Free internet would have been a nice feature and walking down to reception for an access card seems a little old fashioned. Overall, the hotel is new, quiet location and overall the service is friendly, but be aware with early check in and ensure to avoid room 105.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBoutique hotel that was better than its 3 star rating would have you think\u201d", "Author": "sokeeffe", "ReviewID": "UR96746960", "Content": "Looking for a decent hotel in Paris that is not too expensive is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and while Windsor Hotel Opera may not be that needle it is pretty close. A 10-15 minute walk from Gare du Nord and turning onto a quiet side street will find you at the Windsor Hotel Opera and its quirky decoration. With a stunning chandelier in the lobby, a reception desk that looks like it is the interior of an airplane, and a moving cloud light fitting, it is a interesting looking hotel. Once up the tiny lift that is common to all Parisian hotels and past the kooky photos of seventies cars and holiday homes you find yourself in a very reasonably sized room for a Paris hotel. With a comfortable double bed, desk, and a mini sofa-bed, my fiance and I had plenty of room to move around. An en-suite bathroom with excellent shower (as long as you are 5'6\" or under!), roomy cupboard, and decent sized TV ensured the room had all you needed. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from three different metro stations (Poisonierre, Bonne Nouvelle, and Chateau d'Eau), and certainly close enough to the main drag of the Champs Elysees, Arc du Triomphe, and Louvre to be excellently positioned. We didn't partake of any room service and had little interaction with the staff to make any real comments either way.

You have to look carefully for the street in which the hotel sits as you are likely to walk past first time. The hotel has an aeronautical theme in the public areas and is quite nicely done. The bedroom was unusually big for a three-star hotel in Paris. In fact, I don't think I've had a room this big even in a four-star. The room was quite large with a separate seating area and a large settee with small coffee table. That was good. The bathroom was the next surprise. It was clean and modern and had a proper bath as well as a shower. Again, not something yuo frequently find in small hotels in Paris. There was a good mini-bar, too and a working, electronic safe. The room was warm and cosy even though it was very cold outside. As other reviewers have said, it is located only about 10 mins south of Gare du Nord. It is also handy for a number of restaurants on the Boulevards which, themselves, are only another 10 mins walk south from the hotel. The staff were polite and helpful and all spoke English. Breakfast, which was included in our rate, was very good. Most certainly better than what one normally expects in Paris. There was fruit salad, bread and pastries, cold meats and cheeses and, the first time I've seen this in Paris, a hot buffet of scrambled egg, bacon and sausages. The bacon was a bit well done but, hey!, a breakfast like this in Paris was a revelation.

The lobby is fun with its airplane theme and the room was sleek, bright, and modern. Yet, the windows opened to a tiny street that still had a warm, older world feel. Nice. Location was terrific. Just a short walk away was a \"main street\" area filled with restaurants and cafes. Lots of activity. As we explored we kept finding more and more sections in the general neighborhood that had restaurants. The Bonne Nouvelle metro was a short walk away. The Chateau d'Eau was maybe 10 to 15 minutes away (at most). They were on different lines and, between the two, we got around very easily. We were in Paris for a one day transportation strike. We walked to the Louvre in under 30 minutes. We were not rushing. We also found the Opera Garnier during an evening, after dinner stroll. Again, it's really not all that far away. So, though it was my first time staying in the 10th, I was pleasantly surprised at how \"close\" many things were. There are a couple of little \"variety\" stores within a few minutes of the hotel where we got our water, Coca Lite, etc. And there was a lovely patissierie nearby with delightful pastries and even some light sandwiches that we got for a snack. We did not have breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment on that. Oh - and the elevator is very, very tiny. Two trips - one for us and one for the luggage - was required. It wasn't a problem for us...just a fun \"quirk\". But if someone had to use a chair, then I'm not sure what other accommodations are available. The staff was courteous and helpful.

The staff were all very polite, I speak french and was looking to improve so the staff spoke clearly and slowly to help me understand which was nice, but they do also speak english. Our deal included breakfast which was served in the lobby (under the moving clouds!), it was simple but very nice. With a good selection of hot and cold food. Our room (11) was on the ground floor, this might have been annoying but since the street was very quiet with little passing traffic there was no noise at night. The room was very spacious - not just by Parisienne standards, with modern decoration, mini-bar, air conditioning and was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was a very high standard with a great shower and again very modern. I would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.

Hotel took some finding as small side roads were not named on the map we had. We had got a small printout of the hotel location from hotel website but that did not show the larger roads so we then had to look at both maps to try and work what direction to go in. Took us over 20 mins to find hotel in the end so arrived hot and sweaty after pulling suitcases along aswell. Hotel is in small quiet side street in perhaps a more rundown area of Paris. Would not recommend trying to find it in the dark late at night. We were asked for credit card details and 3 digit security number to cover use of telephone and mini-bar on arrival but if you dont wish to give this you can pay a 50e deposit instead. There were 4 of us and we had asked for one room so were allocated a room in the roof space with one king size bed and two single beds that pulled out from a sofa bed. Room had velux windows so no view though this didnt really matter as there wasnt much to see anyway. As attic space room it was very hot though the hotel had done their best to try and cool it down by closing the blinds before we arrived. We were offered a smaller room on the floor below which was cooler but decided to stick it out in the room we had and indeed by the time we had come back later in the evening the room had cooled down and we had no difficulty sleeping. Room had a safe, mini-bar, internet connection but unfortunately no tea making facilities. The bathroom was very clean with towels changed daily. Beds were also made. The breakfast was 13e each - can't remember how much for children - but we decided to eat out anyway as it was cheaper. The hotel has a small lift which is supposed to fit 4 people in but think it would be a bit claustrophobic. Three of us managed to fit in though ok or one person and two suitcases. If you dont like lifts though, it is quite a climb to the top floor. Check out is by 12 on the day of departure and reception were quite happy to look after our cases until later in the day when we returned for them before catching the Eurostar back home from the Gare du Nord. Only a 10-15 mins walk back this time as we knew which way we were going. Overall a good clean hotel with all that you need for Paris break. Location is great to reach most attractions.

The location is great: We easily walked to Notre Dame and the Louvre from the Hotel and there are metro stations very nearby. It's on a quiet side street so you don't suffer from the noise of the main roads, yet you're still really close to local shops, restaurants and bars. I would suggest printing a street map off the internet before travelling though, as the street is quite well hidden! It doesn't appear on guide-book maps and even the locals couldn't tell us where it was! Luckily, another hotel gave us a detailed map and directions. The staff are friendly and accommodating. We arrived 2 hours before check-in and our room was already prepared and they happily let us check in early. Also, upon check-out they were happy to hold our suitcases for us as we had a late flight. Can't fault the service at all! The hotel itself has been recently renovated and looks stunning. The decor is similar to what you would find in any decent boutique hotel and we felt really comfortable there. We stayed in room 15, which is a very good size with the biggest Parisian bathroom I've ever seen! (In my experience they're usually the size of a broom closet) The bathroom was amazing: A massive wet-room style shower that easily fit 2 people and a huge shower head that delivered plenty of steaming hot water. Towels and complimentary toiletries were changed every day and the towels also seemed brand new - fluffy and gorgeous! The bedroom was just as good with a big comfy bed, dressing table, flat-screen tv, wardrobe, mini-bar and free safe. It also had a digital thermostat so it was super easy to get the room temp you wanted. And it was all decorated in a stylish, modern, comfortable way. We didn't take advantage of the 13 euro breakfast as there were plenty of local eateries to explore, but it looked delicious with a range of bread, croissants, cold meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, cereals and juices. If we went back with a bigger budget, we'd definitely eat at the hotel! The only vaguely negative aspect was that our room was on the ground floor and the french doors led to a tiny courtyard with high walls all around, so light in the room wasn't brillient. this didn't bother us in the slightest but is not ideal for people wanting a view. Saying that, I'm not sure how many (if any) other rooms had this lack of view! We've stayed in Paris a few times now and this is by far the best hotel we've been to and we'll definitely stay here next time and recommend it to our friends. 100% happy!", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous refurbished hotel\u201d", "Author": "AMSTravels", "ReviewID": "UR21057246", "Content": "Lovely.
