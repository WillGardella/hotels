It is one of the loveliest hotels I have ever stayed in. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous. Our room, which was a one bedroom suite with jacuzzi. was marvelous. It was very spacious, nicely decorated and had all the amenities one could want on vacation. We stayed in the 3rd building with a lake view on the 5th floor. I would highly recommend the 3rd building as it is centrally located between both pools (a few mins walk) but far enough away to be peaceful. We slept both nights with our balcony door open (nice plus that the balcony is screened in to keep the bugs out) and fell asleep to the sounds of the fountain in the lake. The staff was amazing. Our room was ready for us to check in about 3 hours before normal check in time. I did call the before our scheduled stay to advise them we would probably be in the area sooner than the normal check in time. About 20 mins after we settled into the room we received a call from the front desk asking if our room was up to our standards. It definitely was!!!! I didn't expect there to be any housekeeping services as we were only staying 2 nights-because of this I kept the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. On our 2nd night we had a message on our phone from the housekeeping staff stating that they were unable to service our room due to the sign and to call them if we had any requests. We also a bit later got a phone call from the housekeeping manager asking the same thing. We did call and request some assistance after a bottle of wine was dropped and busted in the kitchen. Someone was up immediately with a vacuum to help us get up the broken glass, and after they left we got a follow up phone call from the front desk asking us if everything had been taken care of. The service is really top notch. We only went to the main clubhouse pool. It was wonderful. I had the most pleasant time lying in a lounger in the sun which a bit of shade from the palm tree above me. I never had a problem finding an open lounger. We weren't expecting any \"activities\" by the pool and they were a welcome surprise. It was nice to have dj type music playing or a live band to listen to as I was lounging around. They had nice adult and kid oriented activities available. The 1st day we had lunch at the pool bar and grill (food and prices were good, service could be faster/more attentive-but overall a decent experience) and watched a few couples participate in the Newly Wed Game and Battle of the Sexes. The 2nd day while I was lounging around you could tie-dye a t-shirt for a small fee. We never received any marketing phone calls and our stay was nothing but pleasant.

There is no other way to put it. We were treated like royalty from the second we checked in. The reviews and photos here don't do this place justice. I don't even know what to call it, as it certainly isn't a hotel. It's more like a community within a compound. You could literally check in and NEVER LEAVE for your entire vacation and feel like you got your money's worth. We talked to the woman who let us into the compound on the day we checked in. She gladly gave us hints about which buildings were the best (6 and 7). Here's something VERY important to remember...check in is a negotiation. Know what you want, and stick to your guns. They will break out a map for you and show you what they are offering you. If you don't want it, ask for something different. We had room # 807 in Building #7, and it was the best room in the place. It was on the highest floor, overlooking the lake, but it was quiet. It had a king bed in a separate bedroom, a jacuzzi, huge closet, gorgeous bathroom, screened balcony, full kitchen with utensils/plates/cookware, a dishwasher, dining table, two TV's, sofa bed, and best of all...WASHER AND DRYER. We could not have asked for anything more! There was one night when housekeeping missed us during the day, but they fixed it immediately. They are very accommodating, and if you give them a range of time during which you intended to be out of the room each day, they will try to clean your room then. There are tons of activities. Something is always going on. We had some bad weather while we were there, but whenever there was a schedule change, there would be a voice mail left for all the guests describing the change. If a movie was scheduled for outside at the pool, it would be moved inside. They have a quiet lounge and an active lounge. There is a big, main pool with lots of neat water features. Plenty of shade for those who want to stay out of the sun. There is a smaller, quieter pool on the other side of the compound as well. The lake has a bridge over it so you can walk from one side to the other. There are jogging paths. The lake contains all kinds of wildlife...we saw gigantic fish, tiny fish, HUGE turtles, and lots of adult and baby ducks. The lake has a couple of fountains in the middle that are lit up at night. So beautiful. We rented a car to get around, and it was worth it. We paid about half of what we would have paid for meals inside the park, and we had a wide variety to choose from, as the hotel is located near International Drive.

Both \"rooms\" were equipped with coffeemaker/iron and ironboard, individual screened in balcony. The Master was also equipped with washer/dryer and a single complimentary pkg of detergent.

It also included a fully equipped kitchen w/serving dishes and utensils for 4. We were located in building #3 which is midway between both pools and had a beautiful view of the center lake.

After extensive pushing on our part, HGVC reimbursed us the cost of the stay (in HHonors points) and promised a VIP experience for the next trip (as if we would stay there again!).

We were in Building 1, which I highly recommend if you have children and want to be near the pool and children's activity / craft room. Our room was on the 4th floor facing the side of the building (looking towards Building 2), and we were never bothered by any outside noise. We also never heard any noise from other units. We found that it took about 20 - 30 minutes by car to really get to your parking spot at any part of Disney (maybe the traffic was worse because it was a busy season). Tons of restaurants nearby. Gorgeous property - great running / walking trail around the pond. Lots of fish / turtles to see in the pond. Lots of reviewers complain about parking availability, but this was never an issue for us at Building 1 - probably because there are also spots because of the adjoining main activity building. Full activity schedule, including a passport program where kids can get \"points\" for participating in activities, and then cash in for prizes at the end of the week.

This is a wonderful place for families because of the pool activity day and night, basketball court, etc. We\u2019re a \u201cmaturing\u201d couple who do not use the pool so avoid the busy side of the resort.

Because these are all either studio suites or one bedroom suites, some with lockouts where you could, if you had a large group get a two bedroom with two kitchens, they are ideal for couples. There are no units with the option for two separate beds. All the units have one king bed and one sleeper sofa in the living room. They are nicely appointed, with granite counter tops, GE appliances, glass top dining room tables, whirlpool tubs in the bathroom (some units have tubs in the bedroom). A big plus is a stackable washer and dryer off the kitchen. Both times we got units on high floors which overlooked the center court pool area. The screened in porches are nice to sit on when the weather is not too hot. If you do intend to cook, the kitchen is stocked with some basics, like dishes for 4, silverware and very few actual cocking utensils. It\u2019s ok for cooking breakfast, but probably not for dinner. Not certain why these suites condos have decided that absolutely no one wants two separate beds in the bedroom, but this really limits who you can stay here with. So it\u2019s fine for couples but doesn't work as well for friends travelling together. My single biggest complaint is parking. If your are out for the day and get back late at night, all parking spots are taken and you end up parking several buildings away from where you are staying. If you are staying here to visit the theme parks, it\u2019s a pretty good location. Most parks are just 10 - 15 minute drive away. This particular property is now 3 + years old, and it\u2019s starting to show some signs of wear and tear. Our unit had a broken kitchen cabinet in it and the cover on the tub appeared to have been broken and just propped in place. The carpet in the living and bedroom area is also starting to look a bit worn. Since these are vacation condos, not a \"hotel,\" not certain when these things will get taken care of. Our one \u201cnegative\u201d experience was with the concierge desk. When we checked in, the front desk encouraged us to use the concierge to help us get theme park tickets. The next day I visited the concierge desk. The woman who greeted me asked, \u201cAre you here on a marketing package?\u201d When I said I was, she no longer wanted to assist me and treated me as if I were some bum who had wandered in off the street.

Here are my thoughts... Positives -The units are very nice and well maintained. -The grounds are immaculately maintained. Albeit you pay the price for this with morning weed wacker and leaf blower sounds. -Grills are cleaned frequently and the pool area is in very good shape. -Housekeeping does a decent job but the quality of the work varies by individual. -Pool activities make it feel like a resort and fun for families. Negatives -Signs are posted that you cannot reserve pool chairs and that any items left for more than 30 minutes are subject to removal. However, we have frequently observed guest \"reserving\" prime chairs early in the morning with towels only to come to the pool by 10am or later for an hour or so. When they leave, they adjust their towels to keep their chairs claimed for a later visit. The hotel needs enforce their own policy and have someone remove used towels and make these chairs available to all owners/guests. -There are no 2 room units with a king bed and a second room with 2 queen beds. The website claims that this is an option you can reserve but guest services confirmed that this configuration does not even exist in their complex. This bit us when we expected three beds and they gave us a unit with only two. Pull out couches don't count as beds. HGVI needs to fix their website. - Grounds employees mostly use gas golf carts to commute and move cargo around the grounds. They slow down and gun it after every speed bump and the carts are loud. They need to get all electric carts. -If you arrive back at your condo late after the parks have closed, expect to park at the front of the complex. Or at least not at your building. They could assign one space per unit right at your building with extra parking located where appropriate. All of the negative items can be solved. I hope the resort management read this review and address these issues. It's a very good destination but could be incredible by accommodating a few of the negative items.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cSecond visit, but probably won't be back\u201d", "Author": "Christina K", "ReviewID": "UR127429813", "Content": "My family (husband and two young kids) stayed at this hotel last year in building 7. We had a two bedroom that faced the outlet mall. Other than the lack of view, we were very happy with our stay last year. This year we headed back and booked a one bedroom. Wishing to be closer to the pool, we were placed in building one. Thank goodness for white noise machines, because it was LOUD all day until 9 or 10 at night. For most families with young kids, this would have been horrible. We were able to tolerate it by turning the white noise up full blast, but it definitely made for less than relaxing evenings for my husband and me. The room itself...eh. The housekeeping was not done until about 5pm each day and was spotty. Kitchen counters not wiped off, vacuuming not done, some days kitchen linens, some days not. The room seemed to be getting run down and a little dirty. And the roaches. Ew, the roaches. Found one just about every day we were there, usually in the kitchen. Saying they have a shuttle to the major theme parks is kind of a joke. It's expensive and very limited. Read about lots of other people having issues with parking, but we were usually home early enough to avoid any problems. Pool was very crowded, with all of the good sunning spots \"saved\" with personal belongings by about 7 each morning, despite signs saying this was prohibited. Not that big of a deal, but kind of annoying. Not really the hotel's fault. The pool was very lively with lots of fun things going on all day long. We enjoyed this during the day, not so much into the night. We didn't have much issue with the whole timeshare hassle thing. They called us once at home before our trip and then pushed it when we checked in. Then I wisely unplugged both phones in our room after reading about people getting so many phone calls during their trip. Keeping them unplugged throughout our stay seemed to solve the problem. Ha!

We also went over to the Welcome Desk and expected a \"push\" to attend an update, but instead we met a guy named Conan who immediately understood our wish to just have family time...no push whatsoever. He had good information for us and when we met him in the lobby later in the week, he remembered us. Impressive! Our room was the 1 BR and we found it to be clean and located in Building 4, 3rd floor overlooking the Laguna Pool. This was a great location and we especially enjoyed the screened porch with table and four chairs. Our unit had a fully equipped kitchen, though only had 4 place settings of dishes and stainless (could have used 2 more) and had the usual pots and pans. We suggest that in case you don't get a teflon fry pan you bring or buy some spray PAM. Very necessary! There's a dishwasher and a washer and dryer in the unit. Bedroom also has a large jetted tub. Orlando water is somewhat \"smelly\" so we bought bottled water and found this to be a good help. The king bed was extremely comfortable with nice, soft linens and pillows. Our son's unit was a 2 BR which is a ! BR with a studio lock-off. It worked very well for 2 adults and 2 kids. The hotel staff was always very friendly and all we met seemed to really enjoy their jobs and being with people. Staff was also very responsive to any needs we had. There is a business center and also a computer to print boarding passes for free. The two pools on property were heated and we always were able to find lounge chairs. There are bars/snack bars at each pool. We tried the pizza at the Laguna pool and it was excellent! There is a Publix grocery store across the street and a very large outlet mall directly behind the property. We tried the Outback Restaurant which is about a half block away as well as the Carrabas Italian Restaurant which is just past the outlet mall. Both were very good. There's a Subway next to the grocery store. Location of this property is really excellent! Easy drives to the Disney properties and SeaWorld. The hotel does have a shuttle to these places but we opted for the convenience of being able to come and go whenever we wanted. Once the $14 parking fee is paid at one Disney property, you can park at any of the others the same day for no additional fee.

The resort as far as I'm concerned is second to none. The accommodation was superb, the staff are so friendly and nothing was too much trouble a real credit to HIlton. One word of advice, make sure before you get there they have your reservation, as when we checked in I am convinced HGVC did not have our reservation as the guy at the front desk asked if we had already checked in, (this began to make sense, as about a month before we traveled I sent an e-mail to Hilton requesting the room location I would like etc., I got a reply back stating that Hilton central reservations did not have my reservation but they would forward my e-mail directly to the resort to sort out. I didn`t get a response from HGVC so I phoned them about 5 days before our arrival to make sure they actually had our reservation and according to them, they had.) I'm convinced that there were another family with the same surname as why would they ask if we had already checked in. The room we were allocated was in building 7 on the ground floor, I was really disappointed with the room as it was so gloomy due to the position on the side of the building and the shrubbery growing around it seemed to be blocking out the natural light. I contacted the front desk to ask for a room change and explained my reasons for it, but was informed that as the place was full nothing could be done until the next day and was promised a more suitable suite. When we finally got the keys around 1 pm, we were certainly not disappointed, the suite overlooked the lake (building 2 5th floor) absolutely beautiful, spotlessly clean and well appointed. The location is great for all the Disney / Universal / Sea world / Epcot , 15-20 min drive, we could actually see the observation tower at Sea world and the fireworks at Epcot at night from our balcony, about 30 mins from the airport. If I had one gripe about this place, it would be the pool bar / restaurant, not a great selection on offer and quite pricey for what you get, not great quality either. We ate there 2 or 3 three times if coming back late from the parks. However there are some good local restaurants , the Outback steakhouse across the road and if you turn left out of the resort, drive for about 3 or 4 mins you`ll come across firstly The Longhorn, and if you like Italian cuisine then try the Carrabbas Italian grill ( try the Red Snapper if they have it on ) both serving great food with excellent service. Back to the resort, 2 lovely pools, good games room, plenty of activities going on for young and old to enjoy. There is a deli on site which has a breakfast and lunch offerings.

Staff was very pleasant to deal with. Check in was easy. I traveled with my 15 year old daughter and husband. We booked a King Suite. I was a little hesitatant on the comfort of a pull out sofa. Much to my surprise this mattress was the best I have ever seen for a pull out sofa. Room was very nice. King bed was comfortable. Screaned in patio was very relaxing to use. Coming from Buffalo, NY where the snow is flying any opportunity to sit outside and eat breakfast, read or relax is a delight in February. Kitchen has some basic kitchen equipment: blender, a cookie sheet, a few kettles, plates, glasses and utensils. They also had dish detergent and washing machine detergent left in the room. The only negative I found was I was in building 4 facing the parking ramp to the outlet. So the view and car noise wasn't great. Two beautiful pools. The main pool was busy with daily entertainment. There was a bar pool at each of the pools. The second pool was still a good size. Both pools supplied plenty of towels. Scattered around the resort were BBQ area's. The lake in the center has a path around it that is approximate 1/2 mile. Lots of joggers buzzing around in the morning. Several times a day security was seen going around on their segways. Within walking distance was a Publix grocery store, Walgreens (with red box video rentals to use in the room DVD player) McDonalds, Out Back Steak Restaurant and a nice outlet mall. At the entrance of the resort there is a bus stop for the troll and the Lynx bus system. I took the Lynx from the hotel to the other outlet mall on intenrationial drive. It was $2 and took about 40 minutes. You can take the trolly to get to the same location with many more stops along the way. If you do this you can look up the bus schedule on the LYNX website (they run about every 15-20 minutes ) and you take the Oak Ridge link. If you want a taxi it would run $25. This is location on intenrational drive was less busy than the area near Sand Lake Road. Sand Lake Road area has a ton of restaurants and lots of traffic. The only recommendation I would make would be to request a room with lake view. Personally I would request building 2 or 3. These buildings have a lake view on one side and on the back side a view of the parking lot for the resort and another resort on the back side. Building 1 is facing the main pool and can have more noise all day, building 4 & 5 could have rooms that face the out mall parking ramp.

Well....if you stay at this property, you will also get intruding telemarketing calls directly on your private room phone during your vacation!!! Hilton feels it is \"within their right\" (according to the Resort Director - Mr. Abed Ereikat) to pass along the personal information we provided to the front desk reservation personnel/system to its telemarketing department so they can call you in your room, in the middle of the afternoon, intrude on your vacation AND afternoon nap in order to annoy you to attend their timeshare sales breakfast. As a data privacy professional and senior corporate executive, I was shocked that Hilton would undertake such unethical business practices. I thought it was perhaps the actions of a rogue employee to misuse our personal information in this manner that we did not authorize - however, I have been told by the Resort Director that they make these calls everyday, it is part of their standard practices and endorse by Management!!! Unbelievable!!!

Their first comment when they entered and saw my laptop. \"Oh, it's a Mac.\" Found that quite humorous as the issue was not with my equipment but due to the fact that the resort was in the process of an upgrade to a new provider. I had the same housekeeping issue as previous posters. They asked when I wanted my mid-week cleaning and I told them. When I returned at 8pm nothing was done. I called again and they said they would send someone up right away. I took a walk and when I returned the unit was tidy with new linens. When I checked out the first trip I told them I would be returning and to please put me on the 2nd or 5th floor as the tech's told me those were the floors with working Internet. They honored my request and the Internet worked flawlessly. However, same problems with housekeeping. They were a no show 2 days in a row. I spoke with the front desk and was assured things would be taken care of the next day-which they were. I have stayed at this property since their opening week. Pros: I choose this location when I know I want to either do some shopping or when I know I'll want to walk after dark and choose to walk at the outlets so I'm not alone. Pizza shop on site has nice staff and a decent pizza. I expect to pay dearly-it's a resort. But they are friendly and the pizza was tasty. Location is very convenient to the places I like to frequent. The pool is always very pretty even if I don't go in! Onsite Starbucks is nice albeit double the price of the one around the corner. But again, you're paying for the convenience. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom is spacious and washer/dryer was very convenient. Cons Units are starting to show their wear. Tub in second room was coming apart from wall. Outlet by kitchen sink was coming out of the wall. Second unit had lukewarm water, barely hot enough for a shower. Parking has been a nightmare since day one. They overbuilt for the amount of spots they offer. Quite often during peak times you have to park by the main entrance and be shuttled to your unit. Although a nice touch it is a true inconvenience when you are unloading or loading your vehicle. Definitely not fun if you are bringing children. The issue of the timeshare sales. Yes, expect to be called. BUT if you tell them when you check in that you have no interest in their sales pitch and that they are not to call you, they will honor your request.

Despite our request, he put us in a room next to the outlet mall and the maintenance garage overlooking a busy road and a Publix shopping plaza. 2. At 8:30 a.m., we were awakened by a call from the hotel trying to sell us a timeshare \"opportunity\" which was not something we had expected or requested. 3. Our room was not cleaned when we returned at 5:30. Called room service and was told the cleaning would be done before 8:00 p.m. No one came until we called mgmt. Apparently, the hotel reserves the right to clean up till 10:00p.m. Unacceptable. Especially since the cleaning crew were able to be at our door, knocking, to clean our room at 9:30 a.m on the morning we were checking out when the hotel checkout time is 10:00a.m. Their inability to properly run housekeeping is disruptive and intrusive. 4. Ordered two salads at the poolside cafe. It took one hour to receive our order despite this being the off season. Cost for our two small salads and two drinks was $50! And the salads were worse than those from a fast food restaurant. 5. The hotel is located right next to the Premium Outlets with a gate pass thru. Convenient for shopping, especially since this outlet area is a popular tourist stop and parking there is almost impossible. But, due to the popularity of this shopping destination, getting in and out of this hotel is an absolute NIGHTMARE! For example, we sat in a miles long line of traffic for an hour Saturday evening trying to get to a nearby restaurant. Same issue Fri and Sunday. Too many tourists for the road the hotel shares with the outlets so, unless you enjoy Christmas season type traffic every day, stay away! 6. The pool area is pretty but the \"resort\" is basically many crammed in buildings around a circular drive/manmade pond. Don't expect green/lush Floridian type areas..not enough room. Feels like an apartment complex, not a resort. Don't expect poolside food/drink service. You have to go to the poolside restaurant on your own. Resort looks very dated. 7.

We had a late flight into Orlando, and planned to get up early to go to The Magic Kingdom. When we arrived, check in was very easy. The parking is gated, and accessed either through using your room key card, or through the front gate, where security has to grant you access. When we checked in, Phil, the front desk agent was pleasant, and knowledgeable. He explained all of the amenities of the property, confirmed my special requests were taken care of, and directed me to the bellman who got us a shuttle to our building, Building #6 - Highly recommend this building. We had a 1 King Bed Suite. Mini fridge, microwave, sink. More than we truly needed for our short stay. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. Large flat screen television, Large comfy chair, as well as a small table with two chairs, perfect for a small meal if you choose to eat in the room. There was also a decent sized screened in balcony with a plastic table and two chairs. The balcony on our room looked out onto the lake, as opposed to a room that might look out upon the Outlet Mall or parking lot. The room was very quiet. The only issue that I will bring up is with parking. They have a main parking lot by the main lobby and building. There is also parking that goes around by each of the buildings (1-7), however there is only parking near the individual buildings for about 85% of guests if the property is fully booked, as it was when we stayed. The hotel does offer a shuttle to the main parking lot, however they have 2 different types of shuttles, and it seems to be luck of the draw. One is a 15 passenger van, the other is a 6 passenger golf cart. If it is raining, and they send the golf cart, prepare to be wet. Hector, our shuttle driver was very nice, and did the best job he possibly could to dry the seats on the golf cart shuttle. There is one outlet mall that you can access directly via your keycard and a shortcut through the parking lot.

It is by far the nicest looking resort of all the resorts on that end of I-Drive.The staff is amazingly accommodating and very pleasant. We were traveling with another couple and requested rooms close to each other, since they did not have any King Studios close to each other we received a complimentary upgrade to 1-bedroom units that had connecting doors. Not once during our stay did anyone ask us about doing a timeshare presentation. Upon arriving we were greeted by a gentlemen in the lobby while waiting in line to check in, he asked us some generic questions about why we were in the area, what our plans were and if we had been in Orlando previously. I had mentioned in our conversation that we had Bluegreen timeshare and that may have given the hint that we were not interested in a presentation on HGVC Ownership. The resort is gated, you must use a room key to get through the gates or be let in by the gate attendant. The grounds are immaculate, everyday there were dozens of workers planting new plants/flowers and maintenance workers keeping everything in working order and looking fantastic. Security Officers are always around and acknowledge you nicely every time you cross paths. We were in Building 5, closest to Laguna Pool and the Outlet Mall's private gates, couldn't have asked for a better building! The unit we occupied was very spacious as it was a corner unit, bigger than our traveling companion's unit. Very clean, well stocked and not dated in the least. Loved the washer/dryer and the screen balcony. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, we slept great! One downfall, parking is a nightmare! We arrived late on Thursday afternoon and found a parking spot near our building, a little bit of a walk with our luggage though. We returned on Saturday night around 11PM and there was a sign in front of the gate indicating parking was full and to see gate attendant to park and be shuttled to your building, that was not ideal! We had to walk to get the car and drive up to the building to load in our luggage on Sunday morning. I called the front desk to ask about recommendations for transportation services to Universal City Walk and was surprised to find they contract a private SUV for up to 5 people to anywhere in the Orlando area. It arrived at our door in less than 10 minutes and only cost $24 to be dropped curbside at Universal. Plus, the driver gave us his personal cell number to call him whenever we needed him again! We LOVED the pool, it is beautiful and relaxing.The pool water is the perfect temp, it was upper-70's the days we were there.The pool bar offers delicious drinks and has a good lunch menu, try the Citrus Chicken Flatbread...a surprisingly delicious dish! I love how you can charge all drinks and food to your room so you do not have to carry a wallet to the pool and then just have it charged to the credit card on file at the end of the stay. They have so many great things planned for everyday that there really is enough at the resort to occupy you for days if you aren't coming to the area to go to Disney/Universal, like Wine Tastings, Dive-In Movies at the pool, Black Jack Tournaments and Live Entertainment. It's truly a great vacation experience, you will not regret choosing this resort!

Went to this timeshare with my adult daughter for some fun and rest. Beautiful grounds. Read many of these reviews before I went. I was concerned when I read about the cockroaches. Well, we requested building 7 as it was the newest building and right across from the outlet mall. Great view of the lake as we got a 1 bedroom suite on the top floor of the building. It was nice but could have used a good rug cleaning. Upon leaving the room for our first venture outside, another guest was complaining to one of the staff that her camera was stolen out of her room. Not good. First two days were fine. On the thrid morning of our stay, I entered the bathroom to see a big black cockroach running under the door to the room my daughter was sleeping in. Went to the front desk and requested another room. So we packed up and moved down to the third floor and he assured me this room would have no problems and no bugs. This was a nice room but could also have used a good cleaning of the rugs and drapes. This was the last night of our stay. My daughter was in the bathroom getting ready for bed after midnight when we encountered our newest cockroach. This one she was able to step on before it disappeared under the door. She tried to call the front desk but only got a busy signal (which happened almost all the time) so she finally called the operator and they asked if they could come up and spray the room (at 12:30 a.m.!!!!). NO. Even though we had a noon checkout, housekeeping came at 10:00 a.m. to clean. Yes this is a nice place. Location is excellent. The pool cafe was wonderful and so was the wait staff. The bell staff (Hector) was very friendly our whole stay. The timeshare desk was rather annoying in the first thing they asked me was where was my husband and when I replied it was just me and my daughter, the desk person said \"are you divorced?!!!\" Where does he have the right to ask me something like that. I said NO and then thought about it later that he probably wanted me to go to a timeshare presentation. I would not stay at this timeshare again. I would go back to Parc Soleil as it is superior in all aspects other than not within walking distance of much.

A screened in balcony is right outside the living room area. The bathroom contained a large, enclosed stand up shower, full tub with water jets, and double sinks.

The Grand Floridian and Contemporary would have been our firt choices but the cost was ridiculous and still not as big as our accomodations. The ONLY advantage would have been being on the Disney property. We have not used the restaurant or pizza area. They have a few nice Weber Genesis grill areas for guests to use. The workout rooms do look small but c'mon, who you really want to work out after walking miles each day? Not us! Relaxing at this amazing pool I'm sitting at right now is my exercise of notice while the rest of the fam. Is in the excellent hot tub for the third time today! Disney is so close to here! We ate at Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze for nicer dinners....both great! Every imaginable fast restaurant nearby. Seriously the only COMPLAINT we have is the coffee. There's a nice Cuisinart coffee maker in the full size kitchen but the coffee provided is awful! Tried it again for 3rd time....zero coffee flavor. Perhaps they could try different vendor! We are making Starbucks runs. As far as time share pitches: I received two calls 48 and 24 hours before arriving here. They wanted us to book a time to listen. I didn't. When we checked in I asked the receptionist if we were going to be asked this all week. She promptly put us on a NO CALL list. This is day 6 and we have not had a single call nor has anyone ever approached us! Amazing! Thanks Hilton and thank you Abed, the Resort Director!", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait City, Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "Javier S", "ReviewID": "UR122798029", "Content": "We've stayed here 5 nights during our recent visit to Orlando.

I truly hate to see my vacation end, because this has been a great place to stay. That being said, there are a few annoyances that would be so easy for management to fix. I feel petty for pointing them out, but in the hopes that management keeps up with their reviews here they are. First, the fitness centers (there are two) are astonishingly inadequate. For 400+ guestrooms, between the two fitness centers there are three treadmills and three ellipticals. I've had much better facilities in Hampton Inns. Secondly, the hotel boasts a \"restaurant.\" The food is reasonably priced but not terribly good. Everything tastes very frozen and preprepared. It sort of feels like someone in the back is heating up the latest finds from Costco. It seems like with a little effort, this would be easy to fix. Find a few good recipes and learn how to make them. Parking is an additional nightmare. Having a resort without enough parking is crazy. The efforts to mitigate the parking situation with golf carts are admirable. However, constantly tipping the valets gets pricey quick and failing to tip feels wrong. It\u2019s not the valet\u2019s fault that parking is impossible.

This continued for two more phone calls or until we said STOP calling us. We are Gold Hilton owners already and were only trying to use the investment that we made a couple years ago. We do NOT want to get the hard sell every time we use our vacation club. Their sales pitch even continued at the pool where they ran this recording that sounded like you were calling to buy a timeshare with interruptions every 2 min. or so giving the hard sell again.Through the stereo system at the pool? Come on - all I wanted was to relax and feel the warm sun in peace. I don't appreciate that in the least bit!!! If the hard sell was lightened a little bit, this hotel would have been one of the nicest places we have stayed and we are big travelers. We had a two bedroom and we could not ask for anything in the rooms. Well, good pans would have been nice. They were spacious and beautiful! When we needed anything, they brought it right away. We had a late flight and requested a late check out (2PM) and they said yes with a $75.00 charge. That is not normal for a Hilton to charge gold members for a late checkout but what I was told is that this is not your average Hilton Vacation club. There is no owners club which is disapointing for us as owners. If you are using the room to eat with a family, wash clothes before returning home while running to the parks every day...it is a great place. There are events at the pool, play ground for kids and lots to do with the family.

The room was huge with a very comfy king size bed. The room had a dining table area and tv and dvd player. It also had a kitchenette with coffee maker, microwave and large fridge. The screened balcony was lovely we were able to sit out and enjoy a glass of wine without the bugs annoying us. All the staff were lovely. Lots of staff riding around on segways and golf buggys, I felt so safe. The shopping complex is right next to the hotek complex you access it through a locked gate which you open using your room key.

In the bathroom, you are provided with toilet rolls, plush towels, soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer and tissues. The bedroom has a center fan, TV, IPod Alarm clock. The duvet and pillows are filled with feathers. They promptly changed these when I told them about my allergy! I also requested 20 more coat hangers, which they sent up to the room immediately with a follow up call. The hot tub is next to the bedroom. The Housekeepers were friendly and came everyday. The premises are beautiful, there are lots of fish and turtles in the lake, beautiful fountains everywhere and beautifully detailed buildings, in a word, beautiful. Both of the pools have bars, towels and plenty of sunbeds. All the staff are friendly. There is a full activity programme for adults and children, most activities take place by the main pool but they are not intrusive to the rest of the residents. We found the bar food to be tasty and reasonably priced, although limited choice. You can buy a soft drink for $3 and get free refills. There are hot tubs by the pools, we were served Iced grapes whilst in the hot tub, touches like that really make this place special. There are two gyms with cardio machines, weights and toning equipment. Towels, headphones and water are provided. You can also control the A/C. There are plenty of BBQ's around the complex. We had 2 lovely BBQ's. The BBQ's are gas and look like they have never been used! However, they are checked and cleaned everyday. You can easily walk to the Outlet mall, we used the food hall there a couple of times. Publix is across the road, along with MacDonalds and the Outback Steakhouse restaurant. I can highly recommend the latter. We also travelled by I-trolley to other shops, restaurants and attractions. We used taxi's to travel to Disney on a couple of occasions, the charges ranged from $32 - $45. The rest of the time, we took the hotels shuttle services. The shuttles are $9 per person return journey. As a rule, we try not to stay in the same place twice as we like to have different experiences for our holidays, however this hotel will be the exception to the rule!

Coffee was provided in the room and there is a Publix grocery store on the other side of the resort. Everyone who worked on the property was super nice and approachable.

Pizza dough is not made on-site and tasted like cardboard. The toppings were cooked in a way where half was overdone in terms of cheese too gooey and other toppings were completely undercooked.

My partner and I are in our first week of a two week stay, our first visit to this Hilton property. I am so pleased with the experience so far that I decided to write a review. Firstly, a compliment to the staff, who went out of their way to accommodate every request regarding our room preferences. We got exactly what we asked for - a gorgeous 2 bedroom suite overlooking the lake, without the afternoon sun, in Building 7, which is very quiet and the newest of the buildings. We have two balconies, a huge jacuzzi tub, second bathroom, spacious living area and large kitchen between the bedrooms. Everything was immaculately clean and we have had instant attention from housekeeping and maintenance over anything we have requested - more hangers, extra towels and shower gel...no problem. There is free wi-fi, just as important as electricity or air-con these days, yet far too often charged for - thankfully the HGVC in Orlando decided not to peeve their guests by stiffing us for this basic service. Everywhere we walk, on this large property, we are greeted cheerfully by staff who are happy to help with advice and information. There is no stiff formality, but a warm and friendly professionalism that makes one feel at home immediately. The property is very close to Disney World and Sea World, and shuttle transport is available. Some low cost attraction tickets are offered by Hilton for folks willing to attend a timeshare marketing presentation. Another plus is the Publix grocery store over the road, making it easy to set up a home away from home. It's great not having to eat out all the time. We even pack lunches to take to the theme parks so that we can avoid the endless junk food binge. There is a big outlet mall very close by, also - you can walk there within minutes, by crossing the hotel parking area around building 5 and 6. HGVC caters to families, yet it's also a nice place for mature guests, offering various daily activities like yoga, movies, kids activities & child care. Some are free, others are charged at a modest fee. If you want to feel close to the \"action\" you might like buildings 1, 2 and 3 most. If, like us, you are seeing space and time out in the quieter part of the property, buildings 6 and 7 are probably the best choice. Ask for an upper level room with a view of the lake. Sometimes the ideal vacation is one where there is plenty of fun to be had nearby, a lighthearted atmosphere, good dining and amenities within minutes, quick and easy access to attractions, and a spacious comfortable suite. This kind of time-out is why we chose Orlando; the HGVC is a perfect fit for this visitor-focused locale. No resort facility can possibly please every kind of vacationer, but both my partner and I have traveled extensively all over the world and stayed in all kinds of hotels, from B&B to 5 star international. I can honestly say that HGVC pleasantly surprised us and exceeded our expectations.

We couldn't read the menu because it was so dark because the show started when we were taken to our seats. Use the concierge with caution. There were so many buildings and that was hard to get adjusted to but we figured it out after the first day. I could see why some people would not like how large the property is but we liked it. We walked around the pond and sat on the benches to watch the fish and turtles. Our room was a suite with an adjoining bedroom/bath/refrigerator/microwave/sink area. We had the adjoining area and the other couple had a large bedroom with a large bathroom. Between the bedrooms is the living/dining/kitchen area and it was spacious. The kitchen was well equipped and modern. The washer/dryer is just off the kitchen and helped us not over pack since we could do wash while the men napped. Each balcony is private and our view was of the pond and fountain. We did not notice too much noise at night. The two pools were great. One had the bar/grill area which at night became a outside movie theater and party area. The area also had DJ's during the day and other entertainment during the day. The other pool area was quiet and smaller. It even had a walk in area for people who could not use the steps and for little ones who could not go in the deep water. The location of the hotel was great except that it was in the middle of all of the traffic. International Drive is a very busy road.

The grounds were lovely (but they were resurfacing the parking lot while I was there - which was a minor inconvenience but a temporary one). I visited the quieter pool at the very back of the resort - small but nice and not crowded but it was very off-season and mid-week.

The resort is very convenient to everything - there is a supermarket right across the street (so if you were staying longer you could stock up the mini-fridge), fast food joints right there and an Outback Steakhouse all within walking distance. There is also a great outdoor outlet mall adjacent to the resort - great shopping and a full food court. It is also convenient to the parks - it was about a 10-15 minute drive to Disney area. My only negative is that the room's lighting is very dim. There is too much use of low wattage energy saving bulbs - especially in the bathroom.

My husband and I just returned from a 7-day stay at this property. It was a time-share swap and one of several trips I've made to Florida within the past few years. In general, my husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this property. The people are nice, the location is great, the units are clean and well-appointed, restaurant is good and the price is good...what else is there?? For starters, the location of this property is a great base for exploring all things Disney and other Central Florida attractions (Universal Studios, Sea World, outlet malls, dining, etc). The property is minutes from Interstate 4 and other key local routes (including the road to the airport). John and I managed our way over to the Gulf Coast to house-hunt and gather information, which proved to be a breeze. In general, the location is great. Be warned, though that many of the local access roads are \"toll\" roads, something quite common in Florida. So make certain that you have dollar bills or exact change ($0.25), especially upon leaving Orlando International Airport. The property is very pretty and impeccably clean. Housekeeping was provided x 1 @ mid-week. The two pools are beautiful and well maintained. John and I never had problems snagging a lounger by either pool (however, the first week post-Labor Day is apparently the slowest travel week for the area, so we were told). Our 1-bedroom suite was huge and larger than many Manhattan apartments we have seen (and lived in-smile). Full kitchen was well stocked. Bathroom with separate jacuzzi area is huge by any standards. I must say that the bed was one of THE MOST COMFORTABLE beds I've ever slept in. I slept like a log all but one night (and I usually have terrible insomnia). Views from our large, screened-in balcony were great. We even had our own, regular-sized, stacked washer and dryer, which I LOVE having when on vacation. As an aside, I love doing laundry during a vacation, so 1) I do not deal with packing stinky clothes for the return trip home, and 2) I do not have to do load after load of laundry upon returning home. Overall, vacationing here for one week felt like being at home minus the hassles of home-lol. The staff were all great. John and I ordered nachos by the pool one day and they were super tasty. Our waitress was nice. John and I actually were the winners at one of the \"Not-So-Newlywed Games,\" being offered pool-side. I had loads of fun...not so sure about John-lolol. But yes, WE WON!! Our prize was a great bottle of wine (per John 'cause I do not drink wine). Anyhow, I have NEVER been able to talk John into entering any pool-side games in all our travels. This is an indication of how comfortable we BOTH felt at this wonderful resort. Not much more to say except that per usual, the lowest point of the week was dealing with the timeshare folks. Not surprisingly, my husband likes to hear the \"pitch\" so he can compare \"deals\" to what we presently have in the way of timeshares. He also likes to think ahead about swapping, trading, selling...something I have ZERO interest in doing. Anyhow, despite the never-ending grief that WE bring onto ourselves by attending the timeshare pitches, our vacation at this property was quite enjoyable. I've stayed at hotels, resorts, timeshares, etc a lot in Florida and for the price, this property is about as good as it gets.

We arrived about 10pm after travelling up from Miami our room was ready and was spotless (we stayed in block 5 which they told us has recently been updated). We had a 1 bedroom apartment the bed was massive and the sofa bed in the lounge for our girls was great the matress on it was really thick like a normal bed mattress. Flat screen TV in both bedroom and lounge, the bathroom was huge with jacuzzi bath walk in shower, double sinks the room was cleaned every day with clean towels and beds made. There are 2 swimming pools we were nearest the smaller one but my girls preferred the larger one where they used to show movies on a massive 20ft inflatable screen whilst the children could swim which proved a real novelty. The bar was great you could by a soda for $3 and have refills all day which we did. Glass of wine was expensive at $9 but I saw that price at several restaurants around Orlando. There is a deli with a small stock of groceries again quite expensive and we only really used it for ice creams. The Publix supermarket over the road is fantastic I would compare it to a Waitrose really good products. The outlet store next to the hotel is great and we enjoyed shopping and getting great bargains from Lacoste, Raupl Lauren, Juicy Couture, etc. Our stay here was great you are right at the far end of International Drive so you do really need a car to get around there is an i hopper bus that stops right outside the hotel that you can use but we decided to keep our car. There are only a few restaurants in walking distance we loved Outback across the road, Mcdonalds for a quick bite when you shattered from being at the parks all day, you can also cut through to Longhorn by cutting up by the GAP and Nike store.

We asked if there were any other rooms available and were told that there was another one available on the other side of the building on the sixth floor, but it had no view either and that it would not be ready for another hour to an hour and a half. Nonetheless, we agreed to move. We then left the hotel and returned at 9:00 P.M and were told that only the studio part of the room was ready and that the living area and the master bedroom were still being cleaned. Finally, at 9:30 to 10:00 P.M we gained access to our whole room and found that we had a fantastic view of the entire hotel grounds.

The apartment: Our 1 bedroom unit was located in building 6 in the corner with partly lake view. The screened balcony was perfect for breakfast or afternoon drinks. It even has a ceiling fan! (I am not used to that). The screen is really dull but probably necessary to keep insects out. The units are a bit out of style but functional with an old fat TV in living room. (They have flat TVs in some buildings though). No DVD-player. Radio, fully equipped kitchen incl dish washer and dryer and washing machine. We brought our own dish tablets and washing powder, not needed if you don\u2019t intend to wash often since some are included. Onsite and eating: Onsite is a Pizza Hut and a pool restaurant/bar and a minimarket. At the minimarket you can eat OK breakfast buffet for abt $8 if you don\u2019t want to prepare your own. There is also a pool table and internet accessed computers to use (not for free of course!). I think there is a gym as well. Pool area: There is one main pool at one side of the resort and a smaller one at the other. We only tried the pools in late afternoons and evenings \u2013 then there was never a problem getting a sun bed. Around the pool area there are activities almost all day long every day of the week, such as wine and beer tasting, pop quizzes, movie night (twice a week) and mainly lots of children's activities. We found the pool a bit crowded by youth water activities at times. You do not go there for peace and quite. Then use the smaller pool - a bit calmer. Transportation: Hilton has a taxi you can use which is $14 if you go to Disney area. Or they arrange any taxi for you. Affordable. Or you can take the cute IRideTrolley for $2 anywhere up the International Drive. It stops all the time and take an hour from one side to another \u2013 but since the end stations are at the Outlet mall you get a chance to get a seat so it is OK. (Not very comfortable though). Along the ride there are many restaurants and activities. (see their website). Also the resort has at least one transfer to Disney area at 8 in the morning. Neighborhood: Just walking distance away from the hotel area you have a few restaurants \u2013 The Outback Steakhouse (Very inexpensive and so good!!) and Carrabas (longer walk). You also have McDonald\u2019s, Walgreens and Publix supermarket just across the street, which is perfect \u2013 none of the other HGVC Orlando resorts have that. The Premium Outlet Mall is literally next door. It closes at 11 at night so you can do all your shopping afterhours :) We are very satisfied and would definitely stay here again.

The price was right. I was in town for business. This is not the place for business. No internet access. I am a Hilton Honors member and did not have water in my room when I arrived. I was on crutches. I specifically asked about the location of my room and that it be closed to parking since it was near 100 degrees and I have to struggle to get far. The front desk attendant asked if I minded being on the upper floors, I said no as long as I don't have to go far to get to the elevator and not far from the elevator when I reach my room. The design of the Bldgs is a U shape. She said there were elevators on each leg of the U and since the legs of the U came out towards parking I thought I would be fine on the 3rd floor. When I departed I asked the men posted at the entrance if I could get assistance with my luggage. They followed me on a golf cart and were there when I arrived, which was nice. When he saw which room I had he said this is far for you to walk. He called the front desk to see if they could get me another room. He was put on hold and then told the computers were slow. He finally (since we were standing outside) suggested I be placed in the room they gave me until an alternate closer to my car could be designated. He got me to my room and made sure I had what I needed for my wait. 2 hours later I hadn't heard from anyone. I called the front desk and was put on hold and transferred (spoke to 3 people) and was told they would look to see what they could do. I told them I needed to get dinner and to just move my items and I would stop at the desk when I got back to find out where they were moved. The maid was outside when I went to leave so I told her I had been in the room and used the hand towel and sat on the bed and was being relocated so she may need to freshen the room. She didn't speak english well and didn't know what I was saying (hope the next occupant didn't enter a partially used room). As a gave up with her, my room phone rang. The front desk had a room for me but I needed to be present to be relocated so I waited. The bellman arrived in about 10 mins (bell staff was really great with service and timeliness). I was being relocated to the same room on the first floor. I specifically asked for something near the parking lot. They have several bldgs all with a U shape and with the legs of the U extending to the parking area, yet I was kept in a corner room. If the lady at the desk had had to haul her behind that far on crutches in the summer heat, she would have relocated herself. I gave up and just sweated my way to dinner and back and didn't go out again. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED! IF THIS IS HOW THEY ACCOMODATE SOMEONE WITH A BROKEN LEG ON CRUTCHES WHO IS A FREQUENT CUSTOMER (HILTON HONORS DIAMOND MEMBER) WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO SOMEONE WITH A PERMANENT HANDICAP??? I do not recommend this hotel for anyone that is looking for quality service and client focus. It is a good buy if you just need a place to stay with a kitchenette and the grounds are nice and near an outlet mall and not far from the amusement parks.

This year we're looking forward to free wifi in all the rooms - that wasn't yet available in Feb. Pool is heated and very relaxing and quiet. The crowd at this property seems to be primarily retirees and their extended families from the Northeast and Midwest. A very happy bunch of people when they're in FL during the harsh northern winter.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWent for a timeshare presentation and absolutely loved the property!!\u201d", "Author": "littlemom5", "ReviewID": "UR113428118", "Content": "After reading reviews on the property before visiting... the positive definitely outweighed the negative.

For those with kids, the pool area is great. They had music and games and ice cream for the kids so the kids in the area seemed happy.

You are better off staying at a Disney property which we have done in the past and will do the next time instead of trying to save money.

Here's why: We got a unit away from the main pool and it was quiet. It was also a penthouse unit, so we didn't have anyone above us. The resort is now completed and is very nice. It is adjacent to the Premium Outlet Mall, which was packed Labor Day Weekend. We were able to park in the resort and walk through a little gate in the wall to the mall. There is everything you need within walking distance. I took the teens to Universal and the new Aquatica and dropped them off. The trips both took a minimal amount of time. No more standing in line at theme parks for me; I have done my time. I highly recommend the spa at Portofino Bay. You can drop the teens at Universal Studios and head to the spa. Arrange to meet them at City Walk at a certain time and you can be sipping Mojitos while you wait! Tuscany's features are very nice. The kitchen is modern and clean. The living room for the two bedroom lacks seating for a full family to watch a meeting, but you can either bring a chair from one of the bedrooms or the kids will lay on the floor with pillows. There is a Blockbuster machine inside the Publix across the street; the resort has movies, but not as big a selection. Just on the other side of I-4 there is just about every restaurant known to man. We ate a Golden Corral (not a good choice) and cooked in a few nights, after a great lunch at Cracker Barrel on the way there from Miami. There is so much to do in Orlando, Be sure and buy a local paper and see what's going on for free. There are tons of parks and concerts, etc. There are also sales in some of the outlets that you won't find unless you get the paper. Grab the coupons at the restaurants and hotels before going to the mall. (I stopped at the Thor-lo sock outlet by Universal Studios and got a deal-deal). There were so many activities for our teens at the resort, we were very happy just to relax while they checked out the dive in movie, the video game tournaments, etc. The security there is excellent and there are people riding around on those \"Sequeway\" vehicles - always with a smile on their face and ready to answer questions. We did not have housekeeping scheduled because we were only there for a long weekend, but if we needed anything, we just called and they brought it right up (extra towels, soap, etc.) Don't forget -- this is a timeshare resort and not a hotel, so the rules are very different. If you are not sure, ask. Close to Disney, Sea World; about 20 minutes from Universal (use Universal Boulevard). Coming from the South? Take Osceola Parkway and head west. The exit 535, take a right and go up to World Center Drive and take another right. Go straight until you see the left turn for International Drive; resort will be a few miles up on your left.

We are owners, which probably makes us bias, however, during our stay we heard countless positive comments from first-time guests. Returnees would agree with them, and our sentiments were echoed many, many times. Guests, to include ourselves, love the accommodations as they are clean and include a complete kitchen for those who would like to save on eating expenses (so we can occasionally splurge at the Resort eateries). There are a Publix and Walgreens directly across the street, and an Orlando Outlet Mall is directly behind the HGVC property for all shopping conveniences. Public transportation is available just outside the gate as well. The resort itself offers the best in family fun, with an Activities Center that keeps children of all ages busy with exciting games and crafts as well as catering to the more mature guest when such a dynamic is present. We love to take romantic strolls at night around the Lagoon, and found a great alternative to the Resort Fitness Center treadmill early in the morning (as do others). The Lagoon also serves as a great educational experience for the little tykes. Personal favorites are the ducks, but the turtles and fish seem to be a big hit with the kids. As this was our first trip seeing the Resort through the eyes of a four-year-old, we were even more impressed with what we already saw as a great home away from home. Management and staff members go to great lengths to ensure that the guests of their Resort are made comfortable, happy and are thoroughly enjoying their experience. With that said, management is well aware of complaints with parking and have addressed this issue with a shuttle service as other alternatives are explored. The only other complaint we heard, and agreed with, was regarding guests leaving towels on the lounges at the pool and leaving the area for quite some time before returning to what is prime seating (we see this only during PEEK vacation periods). Posted signs prohibit this practice and advise that belongings could be removed, but that does not deter some guests. Our advice is to get to the pool early and obey the rules posted for all guests. We travel extensively so this writing is not from novices but from a couple that knows that any stay at Tuscany will exceed expectations, which is the primary reason it is our home away from home.

The two problems that we encountered were that we stayed in Villa di Falconni and when we got in at nights which were around 10pm, we would have to park almost at the entrance. the upside to that is, we always caught one of the many golf carts patrolling the grounds, to and from the building that housed our room & they made you pay for using their computers to surf, it was like $1.00 per minute which is outrageous but free Wi-Fi was offered in the rooms.

Considered a lot of different Orlando motels/hotels before booking at HGVID. Was not disappointed. Real nice place, great location, super friendly staff (prob the friendliest hotel staff we have ever encountered), an overall great value for the cost.... We had a studio room which was big enough for two. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom, patio and kitchennette area was good. We used the paid upfront non-refundable option to get best price possible and we booked about 10 days before our arrival date. Car travel is easy in an out on Vineland Ave. and you are in center of all the Orlando action....you are close to everything. You can get most everywhere in 10-15 minutes. Publix right accross street is a nice convenient bonus. We had read in reviews that parking was sometimes tight but we found parking was easy (free as some places charge for parking) and we were always able to get a spot in front of our building (we stayed in bld #2) no matter what time we returned at night. No pressure for timeshare sales after we turned down free TS info breakfast at check-in. Not contacted re: TS sales during our entire vist after check-in...so if you are concerened about being hassled you do not have to worry if you opt to not attend the breakfast. The ability to walk to the adjacent Premium Outlet Center using keycard exit is also great feature that we used a number of times. We did not use the pool as the weather was on cool side but it is AAA+++ pool and definitely would have spend time there if the weather was warmer...but it was January and 65-70 degress was terrific compared to 20's back home even if not ideal pool weather. We could not get the wireless internet to work in our room but used cable internet option they had in room and it worked just fine. SUMMARY: HGVID is a great alternative to typical Orlando hotels...but way more bang for the buck and, again, super convenient location.

When the towels arrived, we were told we would have to move the garbage and old towels ourselves to outside the room. Clearly unacceptable. Also, the bathtub is downright dangerous, with a smooth surface and no grab bar. I'm 45 years old, and was terrified of slipping in the tub when it became soapy on the very smooth surface. They need a different surface, bath mats, or a grab bar, or some combination. Finally, the location is OK, but under no circumstances should you try to exit by driving towards the outlet malls on Vineland Ave. Go to International Drive, and head to I-4 and the theme parks that way.

We frequently visited the hotel website in excited anticipation of our stay. True to the website photographs the hotel is beautifully laid out and really close to all the location leisure attractions. We have been a few times to Orlando and know our way around there pretty much. So We tend to spend less time doing all the usual rushing around seeing this and that and visit the things we only really interested in. Giving, us more time to chill and relax. One of the unique advertised features of the hotel is its lakeside BBQ areas. We planned on two occasions to use these facilities. On both occasions we had to call the engineer to light the BBQ. The second time we had to wait for more than and hour & half before they came to light it, by which time the sun had set and we had to try cooking our food in the dark and cold. What a let down...... as this was the last day before leaving for our cruise the next day. During our stay, we believe someone had attempted to get into our electronic room safe. This necessitated the security man to come and open the safe on our behalf. The safe has an automatic cut out system if the wrong number is entered more than three times. No further enquire was made by the staff as to why this may have occurred. We sometime later realised that a small amount of our UK money my wife had left in the room (\u00a360) had gone missing in addition to a pair of gloves. As indicated by other posts we were harassed by the concierge trying to get us to attend a sales meeting of their new time share apartments. After seven times of telling the woman we were just not interested, I rudely had to ask her 'what part of no don't you understand?' Only then did she get the message. We had booked our hotel in advance before our cruise (12 days) and (2) days after the return from our cruise. Again on the last evening before our cruise we were seriously let down by the hotel staff. We waited for more than hour for our luggage to be collected by the bell boy, in the end we pushed the luggage trolley ourselves as we were already late for an evening appointment. The hotel staff were full of excuses that they were short staffed, but its not something I expected to hear, had we been told this prior to waiting the hour it wouldn't have been a problem and we would not have been late for our appointment with friends. We had a similar issues with the hotel staff when returning after our cruise. Our travel agent made a mistake in booking us into the hotel a day early whilst we were still on our cruise. We were greeted by the reception team with 'you should have been here yesterday! We were taken a bit aback by the of the receptionist's attitude. We had not realised that a mistake had been made. They were not prepared to credit us with the error for the unused room. We were further told\" the room is booked at a reduced rate anyway, so we wouldn't be inclined to offer a refund or room upgrade on that basis.' you need to sort it with your travel agent.' We were stunned by the poor attitude. After getting our room keys we then waited almost forty minutes for a bell boy to collect our luggage and take it to our room. The bell boy arrived with a Mc Donald's milkshake in his hand. I leave you to think what our thoughts were......... Its true we could have left the bags to be brought over to the room later, however we had some fragile items in the bags and needed them to be treated with some care. Some things you need to know about the hotel. It is a massive place with apartments built around a large lake. Luggage and guests etc are ferried around too their apartments by small trucks. Only specific members of the hotel staff are permitted to drive the trucks, so if you don't drive you have to wait for these to be available. I believe that the site was previously all timeshare apartments, which are now being reverted to a hotel complex, due to the fall in the timeshare market. The swimming pools, gyms, games rooms etc are some of the best we have visited in our worldwide trips. The rooms are ok, but dated, the carpets in both rooms could have done with a clean, or replacement. The televisions are dated. The tv channel hotel welcome page is one of the poorest I have seen. Check the the adjoining door is locked to your room as we had children coming to our room after we had gone to bed 00.30! Our fault for not checking the door was locked on our side.. If you are located to a room near the lifts, the lift pings all day and night on each floor. The corridors are open air with quay tiles. Four to six storey high As people are arriving day and night there is a lot of noise from luggage trolleys, children and the closing of the heavy apartment doors. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are cleaned daily. The drinking water is horrible, full of chlorine. BAthrooms are excellent and clean & the water hot. All rooms have balconies over looking a big lake. The balconies have netting, keeping out the bugs, which was really great. Charging for the use of telephone was really good for local calls. The hotel is rated as a five star, I would rated it as three based on our experience. Would we stay there again, no way! if anything I would like to kick them in the pants, especially the concierge team, who need some lessons in good customer care.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Vacation & service response\u201d", "Author": "Jasminelive", "ReviewID": "UR91240566", "Content": "Enjoyable stay and service has been top rate.

Now, this place is really advisable for families on vacation and lots of idle time to spend. Lots of space, very nice pool, well maintained (it's a new resort). However there is a very important point to remember: this is NOT an hotel in the traditional way, but rather a time-share property, where the rooms have they own mini-kitchen. So, if you are in a business trip you might find annoying and time consuming the big walking distances between reception and your room (which can be wherever in one of the buildings within the resort). Also there is NO dedicated room for breakfast, so you have to go to the Deli/Starbucks within the resort and have your breakfast there. Again, this could be surely nice for a vacationer, much less for a limited-time business traveler. Two general considerations: the resort is at the south end of International Drive, so a little far from the center of the action (which you can join by taxi - 20 min- or by bus - 45 min and more). The only interest at walking distance (litterally 4 minutes) is the huge Outlet Shopping mall which guarantees hours of good shopping. The only really annoying things are the fact that the room walls are REALLY thin, and, above all, that it is impossible to completely shut off the a/c system in your room, so that even if you don't need it, it will go on during the night, adding noise and cold air to your sleeps. I will end with a very positive note regarding the free wifi connection at the room. Working really well and fast.

Limited dining options on site but to be fair the poolside food is really tasty and reasonable and the coffee shop has a buffet breakfast that looked tasty although I don't eat breakfast myself. If dining out the Pointe (stop 24 on the trolley) has a nice selection of restaurants and I would recommend Cuba Libre and the Italian as the best. One bit of advice avoid the Outback Steakhouse across the road from the hotel, went there the night we arrived just out of convenience and it was very poor.

She has been better of late and I wanted to treat her to a fabulous vacation at a beautiful property and I certainly found that in the Hilton Grand. It totally surpassed my expectations! When we first arrived I asked for a beautiful view on a higher floor. I did not think that my request would be granted since I was not a club member, but to my surprise not only did I recieve a gorgeous view overlooking the pond on the 4th floor, but I was given a suite in Bldg.7 one of the newest Bldg. Never once were we asked to sit through a timeshare meeting either. Our suite was spectacular and we loved the screened in balcony where we drank our coffee in the mornings and played cards in the evenings. It had a ceiling fan that kept us cool too. The pools were gorgeous and the grounds well kept. We really enjoyed the salads at the snack bar down by the pool. Apple salad was great too, and reasonably priced at $8. I did think that the Margarita's at the bar were a little high though....$17 for two. Housekeeping was not a problem either. Girls worked hard! Be sure to tip, they deserve it. In the future, if this property is offered to the public for the great rate that I received, I will definitely be going back.

Also, the toilet was a bit loud, but that's probably due to the sound echoing in a bathroom that is larger by itself than most other whole hotel rooms. No worries about water pressure, and the shower alone was about the size of the total square footage of other hotel bathrooms. We've traveled a lot, so we're not easily impressed, but the staff here was awesome, and the only time we heard other guests was when we accidentally fell asleep without closing one of the two doors to the screened balcony. The screen is a great touch if you're traveling with young children and/or if you want to sit outside without bugs joining you. We made the most of the full kitchen too (equipped with pots, pans, dishtowels, paper towels, plates, flatware, blender, coffee maker, toaster, and dishwasher with detergent) to have some real sit-down meals and even bake cookies (a rare treat for this busy family). There is a real grocery store literally right across the street from the hotel, and we used the UPS store in the same plaza to send things home. I normally prefer to ship my dirty laundry home rather than lug it back in a suitcase, but there wasn't much need for that this time -- the suites have a washer & dryer right off the bathroom. I did, however, opt to buy my own detergent rather than use the kind provided by the hotel (I have sensitive skin) and then I used UPS to ship home the rest of my detergent, plastic wrap, foil, and unused non-parishable food at the end of the week. In theory, there is plenty of parking, and it is free, but don't expect to be right in front of your building if you come home after about 10pm. On the other hand, you don't need to drive that often since many shopping venues (from Nike and Champion to Burberry and Coach) and personal services (several nail & hair salons) are either adjacent or across the street. Right on the property, there's a deli (with Boar's Head brand!), Pizza Hut Express, a friendly poolside bar, and even a little shop that sells pool toys at surprisingly low prices (like $11 for a lifesize alligator or shark float). Oh, and free wireless internet too! They also have a full menu of activities each day, like playing Wii games on a giant inflatable screen near the pool, ice cream socials, and even a beer tasting. Of course, most don't normally choose to visit Orlando for the pretty rooms and waterfall in the pool, but it's nice to find all this within a few minutes drive (or shuttle ride) of the theme parks. While you're there, make an effort to check out our favorite Orlando restaurant, Thai Thani, which happens to be close by; order the chicken satay even if you're not a big fan of Thai food. We've visited them several times in the last 6 yrs and every meal was just wonderful, so it was just a bonus that the front desk gave us a discount coupon for a place that we couldn't wait to visit again!", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNew manager needed\u201d", "Author": "katgirl21", "ReviewID": "UR79849941", "Content": "I stayed in here for a week on my Honeymoon.

The buildings look all more or less alike, but differ in proximity to the central pool and recreation area. Building Nr. 1, for instance, faces almost directly onto the main pool area. Building Nr. 2, where we stayed, was far enough from the pool to be quiet, but not so far that it was an inconvenience to walk back and forth. That being said, the bridge that crosses the lake connects the resort in such a way that none of the buildings is isolated. There is a second pool in the \"back\" area of the resort, with a seasonal bar as well as a Pizza Hut restaurant (which delivers). There is an activity center, with planned activites for all ages (mostly centering around the pool area), as well as billiard and chess tables, etc. The resort is directly next door to a huge outlet mall, and across the street is a Walgreens drug store and a Publix grocery store, both open 24 hours, which is convenient if you are late arriving. The location is on the far south end of International Drive, which doesn't really matter since you need a car in Orlando, no matter where you stay.

As a Hilton Honors member I am all too aware of the standard Hilton has set regarding comfort, safety, amenities, and cleanliness. In writing this review I will hit on some of the highlights and then give some negative insight also so as to allow readers to make a fully informed decision. The Pros: The location, if anyone is headed to the Orlando area in order to hit the theme parks, is incredible. Unless you stay on the property of the theme park you could not stay closer. The security is amazing. Constantly patroling and keeping things in order and safe. I found the security personnel to be courteous and professional and the security gate at the front entrance is just that - total security. The landscaping is beautiful. The lake is clean and is a wonderful healthful walk totalling about 1/2 mile all the way around. There are ducks, fish, and other fowl in the lake which is essentially a center focal point of the property. The Outlet Mall is just outside of the gate area and is an easy walk. There is a great food court at this mall that is definitely worth a visit. The service staff are also professional, courteous, and attentive. The meal we ate from the deli was delicious and served right beside the pool in the outdoor eatery. The pools are both amazing. Large enough to never feel crowded and plenty of seating. The check-in took all of 5 minutes. And much of this was spent telling us all about the incredible amenities of the property as well as the directions to our suite. Our suite was large, inviting, and had a wonderful view of the lake and one of the pools. There was plenty of parking outside of the suite also. There is a grocery store right across the street within walking distance. The high speed Internet was just that - high speed. And convenient. Now for some negatives: The A/C in our room did little to cool the room. Because we spent most of the time outside of the room it did not ruin our experience. And it was running normally; I have little doubt that it was doing what it was meant to be doing. There is only one restaurant on the property and it is a little pricey. The food was wonderful but another restaurant would be nice. There is a deli but $9 for a sandwich is a little steep in my book. The location, while incredibly convenient, also forces you to fight traffic to get to the Disney properties or some of the local restaurants. Just leave early and plan an extra hour for the traffic. The door on the suite was really heavy. Good for security but bad for trying to close quietly. If left unattended it would slam hard on its own no doubt disturbing the rest of others. Throughout the night I would hear other doors slamming as other guest faced this same issue. One elevator in our building (number 3) was HOT. The A/C in this elevator was clearly out. The second elevator was cooler than our room! Overall, and in summary, this was a very relaxing get away for my wife and I. We would definitely visit the property again but would not unpack unless the A/C was working. It is filled with photo opportunities from the architecture, professional and courteous employees, and just an incredible and memorable stay.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Haven, CT", "Title": "\u201cNice Property\u201d", "Author": "dbbohner", "ReviewID": "UR76847733", "Content": "This was our first stay at our home resort since purchasing through HGVC.

We had seen previous reviews on this site for this particular resort and understood that building 7 was newer. We asked to have building 7. As they were not expecting a change, there was about a 1hour wait as they needed to prepare the room. This gave us enough time to \"venture\" out for a bite to eat. The staff were accomodating in every way. Our room was fantastic! It had a fully equipped kitchen - stove, dishwasher, fridge, microwave. Plates/silverware (setting for 4), cooking utensils including all the extras such as pots, pan, broiler pan, cookie sheet, cake pans (2), bowls, strainer, plastic containers, hot plates and cutting board. Dishtowels were provided along with the dishwasher soap. A comfortable sitting area was off the dining area with a flat screen tv. The bedroom was large with not only a tv but also a massive jacuzzi tub (2 person for sure). The bathroom was separate with a shower. It also had a washer/dryer in the room which actually came in very handy. A large screened in balcony was wonderful. Had views from 3 sides (two of which were water and the fountains) and also had access from the bedroom. There was a full size round table and four chairs with room to spare. What a nice place to just relax. Housekeeping came daily and actually cleaned up any dishes and started the dishwasher. They also vacuumed the condo. I found this to be a little uncomfortable as I am use to picking up after myself but any used cup lying around was either put in the dishwasher or the housekeeper washed the dishes in the sink. Right across the street is a large supermarket \"Public\" and there is nothing they do not sell.

There are special concierges devoted to helping get park tickets, etc. The hotel also has many activities for kids, teens & adults. We didn't get to take advantage of these because we were so busy going to parks, but they looked like fun. Our room was quite nice and very big. Beds, furniture, kitchen things were all clean, nice, etc. Having the kitchen there was great -- we ate breakfasts in the room and could store snacks, etc. Each of the three rooms had its own TV. Bathrooms were big and nice. We were really quite happy with the rooms. There are two pools, the main one by the lobby and a smaller one at the other end of the property. Our room was by that small pool. We only used the main pool once (being so busy). It's good, but is more of a relaxing type pool (no slide for kids, etc.) which was fine for my wife and me. The grounds around the hotel are quite pleasant. There's a huge lake in the middle and all the buildings surround it. The rooms had free wired and wireless internet. I only used the wireless and it worked fine. There is a Publix grocery store right across the street from the main entrance to to the hotel complex which is very convenient. We stopped in the first night and got supplies for our 4 days there. Many restaurants and shopping areas are within a mile. One negative has to do with location: The easiest way to the hotel from I-4 is exit 68 (Highway 535). From that you get on Vineland Ave to go to the hotel. The Orlando Premium Outlets mall is off that road. At various time such as the early evening, when you leave the hotel to get back to I-4, the right turn from Vineland Ave to get back onto 535 (and then I-4) really backs up, perhaps even 1/2-1 mile. It can be a huge wait. We did our best to avoid that at critical times. There is another way to get to I-4 using International Drive as well. It is longer, but may be better at particular times. Note that Hilton's other Grand Vacation property very close to this is called Parc Soleil. That is where our HGV presentation was. (I believe there is another on International Drive too.) This one (Tuscany) and Parc Soleil are very similar in style, their rooms are quite similar. Parc Soleil is a little newer and nicer, I would say. For example, the rooms have LCD TVs there versus CRTs at Tuscany. Similarly, the pool at Parc Soleil looks a little more exciting for kids. Parc Soleil is kind of in the middle of nowhere though, while Tuscany has much very close around it.

We have two boy's ( 8 - 12) who like to keep busy and there was so much to do together as a family. The resort is next to to the Premium Outlet Mall, grocery store and lot's of restaurants to choose from if you desire. I have no negative things to say about this resort. We had so much fun during our 10 night stay. What you get for the price you pay per night is worth it. It is so nice to be able to cook your own breakfast/lunch and not have to drag bags of clothes to washing machines....it's all right there in you suite.

We were doing a cruise leaving from port canaveral so we decided to go a week early and do Orlando. We found a great deal through this hotel, stay 2 nights, get 1 free, so we stayed 7 nights, we ended up paying I think like $100 a night or so, it was a great deal! The room was huge, it had a living room, dining room, kitchen, big bathroom with a standup shower, a whirlpool tub, a separate bedroom, a washer and dryer, and a balcony, which we had overlooking the lake. The hotel was beautiful!!! The pool was huge! so even when there were a good number of people out there, it still wasn't crowded. The staff was very friendly!! everything was just beautiful. There was a bar/cafe type thing by the pool that served dinner. They also had a little cafe with coffee and ice cream and little odds and ends. There were grills to BBQ if you wanted as well. I know people on here were saying they were bugged with calls about buying a timeshare, but we were called when we first arrived and my husband told them we weren't interested and that we were on our honeymoon and we never heard anything from them again. There were only a couple of negative aspects... 1) one time we called for towels they never brought them to us 2) the shower had no place to put anything so you had to put all your shampoos/soaps on the bottom of the shower so that was a little inconvenient 3)the safe in the room locked us out and we called for someone to come and reopen it and it took them like 30 mins to come. But those things really were minor! The hotel was really close to everything! It was only 5 minutes from sea world and probably about 10 minutes from disney. We LOVED this hotel and cannot wait to stay again!! We are hoping to go back again next year!", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midville, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSecond time around..\u201d", "Author": "I.Z.E.", "ReviewID": "UR70144565", "Content": "First of all, as stated in previous reviews, this property is a timeshare venture managed by Hilton and frequented by Hilton Grand Vacation Club members. However, I am not a timeshare owner or a Hilton Grand Vacation Club member. Nevertheless, I am a Hilton Honors member and this is our second visit to this property. Our first visit was in 2007 during the construction completion phase. Our dates of travel were 30 June through 4 July. Our stay was in a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen, large bathroom, living room, and screened balcony in building 3(can not remember the imitation Italian building name with the Tuscan/Tuscany theme) room 3602 on the 6th floor. POSITIVES: Our speedy/efficient check-in and check-out process was handled by the lovely, professional and courteous Ms. Alicia Murad. She should solely get paid for her beautiful smile and geniune personality which deserves an emphatic \"WOW!\". I have witnessed very few hospitality professionals with her sincere enthusiasm. In other words, I was very impressed with the service from Ms. Murad. Moving on to other areas of our stay, the 1 bedroom suite was very clean. However, as true in most hotel properties, the corner suites provide much more space. Parking is wonderfully free. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Premium Outlet Mall is a short walking distance across the parking lot near building 5. At all times, on site security was very visible, friendly and non-intrusive. The swimming pools access is on the ground level at the rear of all buildings. In other words, as you face the ground entrance of the guest buildings from the parking lot, follow the hallways pass the suites to the rear of the buildings. In one direction on the sidewalk behind the structures in front of the pond, the sidewalk leads to the main pool by the cafe and the other pool near the pizza stand and outlet mall entrance in the opposite direction. Due to an unexpected incident, we called the front desk at 0630 a.m. for a housekeeping issue. Just like a Dominos Pizza delivery, they responded in 30 minutes or less. Also, we got a follow-up call from the front desk to schedule housekeeping service for the remainder of our stay. Another note about housekeeping, there were plenty of clean towels in our bathroom combined with friendly fast service. Our screened balcony had a ceiling fan, patio furniture and electrical outlets in excellent working condition and suitable for late night laptop usage. Even though the wireless service was flawless, we noticed at least three networks. the network named HGVC was usually at medium strength early in mornings and late evenings. But, the public access and the curiously nameless(?) wireless network was always at full strength. Due to our suspicion of hackers, we chose not to use the public access network or the mystery guest network option and I did not inquire about the wireless situation with the front desk staff. Very nice gas grills are available in tents near the pool areas equipped with patio furniture. The grills seem to be reasonably clean to avoid outdoor HGVC bacteria while cooking among very few cigarette butts scattered nearby. The pools were slightly heated, clean and full of eye burning chlorine for random multiple guests swimming. There's a small, covered and litter free playground near the main pool for toddler size children. NEGATIVES: Of course the property does not look as pristine as it did during our visit in 2007. As a matter of the fact, the guest building parking lots, courtyards and fountains look like \"tar ball\" casulties of the Gulf oil spill. The youthful pool side bartenders need a little more training in beverage classification. We requested two glasses of sweet or semi-sweet wine and the young man could not think beyond white, red or rose'. Unfortunately, I engaged in a brief discussion with a seemingly less than qualifed HGVC bartender about the nuances of chardonnay, rieslings and zinfandels. Anyway, we did not let this lack of competence spoil our stay. The whirlpools needed a lot of TLC near the pools. However, the thrusters and water jets seem to be in good working order. The suites' kitchens are not as fully equipped as they once were in 2007. The minimal inventory of pots, pans and utensils made cooking meals somewhat challenging but maybe saute' pans and spatulas are available upon request..? To our dismay, the hot tub did not work but it made an odd and interesting humming noise. The televisions need to be updated wtih plasma or LCDs ASAP! Also, the BOSE system is a nice feature with a radio and DVD player but it does not intergrate properly with the video on channel 2. HGVC is charging too much money for nightly rates to not provide updated and functional electronic entertainment equipment. WORTH MENTIONING!?!: The street address, 8122 Arezzo Way; Orlando Florida, did not work well in our GPS. Before our GPS navigational days, we used the directions from the HGVC website. It is good to remember that the property is off International Drive on Vineland Avenue which is the same street for the Premium Outlet Mall near Interstate 4. Arezzo Way appears to be a drive way off Vineland Way exclusively for the HGVC Orlando International property. The property has two entrances. The main entrance is gated with a guard on duty 24 hours and 7 days per week. The other entrance is only accessibe by registered guests and staff with a cardkey. Off site, we enjoyed some excellent meals at Padrinos Cuban Bistro and Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. Also, we discovered an asian cusine gem in Seito Sushi in the same shopping plaza as Whole Foods Market on Turkey Lake Road which intersects with International Drive right down the street from a Super Walmart. CONCLUSION: All in all, we had a great Orlando, Florida stay avoiding the parks, driving 45 minutes and enduring three toll booths east to Cocoa Beach, Florida. We are looking forward to our next Orlando trip to either this HGVC or the recently built Parc Soleil.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sf bay area", "Title": "\u201cFabulous place to have as a home base in Orlando\u201d", "Author": "travelnchica", "ReviewID": "UR69716931", "Content": "It was such a lovely 5 day stay in May, from the beginning to the end.

At first we were concerned about noise, as there was a door to the adjoining studio suite, but we never heard any noise from that direction. We did hear a lot of noise from the hallway outside (it is an outdoor hallway), especially from unruly kids who didn't seem to realize they should use quiet voices until out of the building (gotta blame the parents for that one). But it wasn't anything that would ruin our stay. The kitchen was nicely equipped, and the gas grills scattered througout the complex were great (there are 6 or 7 of them). The unit was clean, large, and very comfortable. I was able to walk to the Outlets Mall, which was great for shopping (but not so great for the pocketbook!!). We both thought the value for what we paid was fantastic (less than $150 for a one-bedroom suite, with full kitchen including full-size refrigerator, resort with two pools, beautiful lagoon, evening movies at the main pool, etc, etc, etc).

The rooms are big and very well decorated. We had a two-bedroom suite and for the price, they are probably the best rooms I have experienced. This is a time-share so you will get plenty of opportunities to sit in on a presentation. We politely declined. The ground are fine - nothing too fancy. A lake in the middle of the complex. We were near the main pool and it was busy at times. One thing I noticed is that people got up early to stake out there chairs and put towels and other personal items on them. The chairs were occupied maybe 25-50% of the time but were hoarded for some reason. I found this disappointing and attribute it to not having enough chairs to accommodate peak time. We rarely went to the pool at high time so this didn't present too much of an issue for us but wanted to warn others.

Rooms - Can't really moan, and any problems were fixed straightaway. We had a lovely 7th floor room with balcony. Very clean and up to date. Free wi-fi was welcome. On site - The deli was great. The poolside bar was good, if slightly expensive for the basic food. Also nice to have a Pizza Hut! There was a kids playground under cover which was very popular. The gym had a very high standard, and seemed to be brand new..with complimentary ear phones for those of us who forget our ipods. It wasn't big by any means, but then I was always on my own in there! Does anyone go to gyms in the US ;-) Pools - The pools were exceptional, and our kids never wanted to leave. The only slight downside was that the toddler friendly pool was on the far side of the resort so didn't have any poolside service.

The kitchen had everything you could possibly want - full sized fridge, dishwasher, full oven and flat top stove, microwave, coffeemaker (didn't try the coffee), blender, toaster, lots of different utensils, casseroles, etc. There were double ceramic sinks in the granite counter in the kitchen and his and hers sinks in the bathroom, a dining room table with glass top and four dining room chairs, lovely sofa and lounge chair with ottoman. The TV's were definitely older in our room, but got lots of channels. The screened-in balcony would be lovely on a warm evening, overlooking the lake and smaller pool area. There were even ducks on the lake. Bring your own bubbles for the double jacuzzi tub. There is a McDonald's and Outback Steakhouse across the street and if you like to walk, it's easy to do. A pretty nice McDonald's actually. There are a stacked clothes washer and dryer as well. I think they give you a small pouch of laundry detergent, enough for one load. We loved the place and would love to stay there for a week or more another time. We also just used the walk-through to the Outlet Mall next door.

Housekeeping did not respond to our request for a bathroom clean after the second visit. The suite furnishings in the living room were worn. The wireless internet or lack thereof, and a call to get a signal / assistance took 20 minutes per call ( three times ) and two in-person visits per day plus the attendant phone calls for follow up and requests for feedback. We ended up using the wired connection because we didnt want the multiple calls, the hold time with the help desk, the feeble 'sorry's ' . The kitchen was OK but lacked enough dishware for a family of 6. The washer dryer was a nice thing to have on hand even for our four day stay. The weather was unseasonably cool and we didn't take a swim in the pools. If we had had the opportunity to use more of the outdoor facilities we may have been able to overlook the issues with the internet, but a working toilet or one fix to a toilet should be enough to deal with. Im left with the feeling that the guest who informs the staff of unit problems helps them troubleshoot where these things should be checked on routinely to avoid the guests having to report it for them.

I booked a studio but when we arrived I decided to upgrade to a one bedroom ($30 more a night). It was well worth it. We have twin 8 month old boys so we really needed the extra space. As soon as we checked in they wheeled up 2 cribs for us which were no frills but were clean, safe and seemed comfortable b/c our boys slept well. The room was VERY nice and VERY clean. The balcony was really large with a table and 4 chairs and a ceiling fan. Unfortunately we couldn't spend any time out there at night b/c it was too cold in the evenings but I could see it being really nice in warmer weather. Then later in the stay we requested high chairs and they brought those up right away also. There was plenty of space to throw a blanket down and let the babies play and I wasn't worried if they touched the carpet like I would be at other places I've stayed in the past. The hotel staff from the front desk to the grounds people to housekeeping and the restaurant staff were really, really nice and pleasant. We got coffee one morning in the deli and got burgers at the pool one day for lunch. Burgers were good and they have Blue Moon on tap which was a bonus for us! Parking was no problem but we weren't out late like a lot of other reviewers. The outlet mall next door was great - we just walked over one morning and it's open really late at night (11pm). We walked to Publix (note - they make great sandwiches at Publix deli - way better than Subway which is right next door to Publix). Definitely go over there and get coffee (the coffee in the room was BAD) and some snacks and drinks. One thing I really liked about this place was that it wasn't full of rules. Families were at the pool with snacks and lunches for their kids and no one seemed to mind. We would bring beers from our room and no one had a problem with it. We ordered a couple drinks from the bar but mostly just grabbed beers from our own fridge. One day the bartender was handing out mango and banana drink samples. That was really nice (and good marketing b/c we then bought a drink!). We spent time at both pools. They were both very clean and nicely heated. We never had a problem finding pool chairs, but then again it wasn\u2019t perfect weather. They didn\u2019t have a baby pool but there were lots of stairs in the pool that a baby could sit on. And a zero entry pool for younger children. There was also a jungle gym area but no swings. Couple tips \u2013 ordered carry-out from Outback across the street and it was excellent (there was an hour wait for dine in!). The concierge can make reservations for you or give you cards for certain area restaurants and in exchange the restaurant will give you a free cocktail or appetizer. One night we went to Big Fin http://www.bigfinseafood.com/ because we wanted a nice seafood dinner. It was really good and they knocked $12 off our tab because we had a business card from the Hilton. Overall we just loved our vacation and we spent the majority of it at the Hilton b/c we didn\u2019t do any theme parks. Highly recommended. Oh and we didn't hear one peep from any other room!

I have traveled for a living, and have distinct preferences and standards for a hotel. The price of this resort was so reasonable (and I had also read some negative reviews)\u2014I was worried we'd be disappointed with the property. I chose the resort b/c I was traveling with a 10 month old and a 2-year old. I needed a full kitchen to heat and wash bottles, clean utensils, and a washer for bibs and pajamas etc. We booked a 1-bedroom King suite. Upon arrival at 2:00 pm, the room was not ready yet but they took my cell phone number and said they'd call me when it was ready. We were able to dine poolside at the bar/grill, and they held our luggage etc. with the bell staff. There are two pools at the property, with beautiful chaise lounges. The main pool has a bar/grill with table or chairside service. Pleasant wait staff and bartenders, typical of a full-service resort. I did not expect that from a timeshare. Poolside activities go on throughout the day (there is a schedule) and lots of things/crafts for the kids. The pool was meticulous and heated to a wonderful 85 degrees (or higher!) There are also two jacuzzis. The secondary pool features a zero entry kids area that was perfect for my 2-year old! There was also a Pizza Hut Express at that pool, in addition to a smaller bar for poolside cocktails. Our room was located in Building 4, on the 3rd floor, with a view of the lake and secondary pool. Screened in balcony was lovely, with a full table and 4 chairs (you can dine out there!) Very roomy accommodations, and upscale design. Everything was clean and in perfect order, except the carpet had stains in some places and even a few tears where the carpet met the ceramic tile. Could use replacement, but it was not skeevy or a major factor in my opinion! Kitchen had granite countertops and a full size refrigerator and plenty of cabinets for your stuff. Lots of pots and utensils etc. Plus, they stock your room with dish detergent, sponges, dishwasher powder and even laundry detergent! Big dining room table with chairs too. Bathroom featured a tiled stall shower and double sink with nicely lighted vanity/mirror. Lots of drawers too, so your stuff does not have to clutter the counter!! Between the king bedroom and the bathroom, there is a foyer area that has a huge closet and a huge jacuzzi tub with beautiful tuscany columns. It made bathing the kids difficult b/c it was so deep...you actually had to go in WITH THEM, but I imagine it would be nice to get to enjoy a soak for an adult!!!!! All bathroom amenities were Crabtree and Evelyn, and supplied daily. Living room featured pull out sofa, and they provided both highchairs and pack-n-play for my kids. Could have used a little more drawer space for clothes...but we utilized the closets which was fine. I did not have any issues with neighboring noise...the only noise issue was that the living room sound system was very loud (BOSE surround sound) and you can hear that pretty easily, even at a low volume, from the bedroom. Not a huge deal! Wireless internet was FREE and worked great. Lovely grounds feature bridges and walking paths, great for strollers! Parking was never an issue, never had to park more than 50 yards away...and most of the time we got a spot up front near the building. Service overall was friendly and immediate. We had a broken lint screen in the dryer, and I had a new one within 5 minutes of contacting the front desk. Location was fantastic in my opinion. Publix across the street, 7-11 and Walgreens a block away. A few restaurants with curbside to-go are also nearby. But International Drive is FULL of restaurants...and this property is literally 5 minutes from DOWNTOWN DISNEY...which is awesome for nighttime strolling, getting ice cream, shopping, or dining/cocktails. And, the Orlando Premium Outlets have an entrance right from the resort...you can walk there!!!!! Plan on 20 minutes to Disney's Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom, we always parked at a resort and took THEIR transportation. If you go to the parks you have to pay $14 dollars, and then take a tram AND a ferry or monorail. This is a pain with strollers. So at the resorts you can just take their bus etc. Just tell the gate guard that you are dining at one of the restaurants. Sea World is around the corner...a 3 minute drive. Anyway...long story short...it was a wonderful stay and we'll definitely choose this location again for our next visit b/c the convenience and value made it well worth it. In my opinion, paying more for a room within the Disney Parks is not a smart idea...you get a small room with two double beds. This way, you get some living space for a family...feel free to email me with your questions!", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStay here!!\u201d", "Author": "CarolynLeanne", "ReviewID": "UR57733843", "Content": "We absolutely loved this resort.

I have positive and negative comments on this Hilton. Here are the negative things: I had originally called 1 month before my trip and again 1 week before my trip in insure I had both rooms close to each other. I was traveling with my husband and my 1.5 yr old son along with my mother and father. I booked 2 rooms and wanted the rooms close to each other but when I arrived at the hotel they had us on 2 different floors. They were kind enough to switch the room after about 2 hours. The second negative thing is that I wanted flowers, cake and balloons in my mother room when she arrived ( it was her birthday) and the staff did not do this. I had to call the front desk to find out where the items were and they eventually delivered the items to my mothers room. The third issue was the T.V in my room. I had to call every night for 3 nights in a row to get my tv fixed. I kept turning off after being on for 5 min. They fixed it and eventually replaced the t.v. with a new one. They came to my room quickly even though it was passed 9pm. They replaced and fixed the problem in a quiet manner while my son slept. Positve things: The hotel ground were beautiful and located away from the other hotels. It was located next to the premium outlets and across the street from a Walgreens and Pulix grocery store. Were were 5-10 miles away from any of the parks-Disney, Seaworld, Universal, etc. You are able to get to the outlets from a gate in the front of out hotel. We stayed in Building 7 which is the newest building located across the pond and next to the outlet. The gate to get to the mall was next to our paking lot so it was very convienent. The rooms are beautiful especially the jacuzzi tub. It was quiet and comfortable. Houskeeping came every day to do the bed, and clean the room. They even did started the dishwasher to clean the dishes. Our flight was cancelled and the hotel accomodated us another night.

Have lived in Florida over 25 years and had Seaworld passes and never knew this vacation club/hotel was available without \"owning\" a timeshare membership. The entrance way was \"grand\" Had a security gate that was for new arrivals and another for registered guest that you could use your key. We parked our car in a circular drive and was greeted happily by a doorman. Once inside, a desk clerk quickly greeted us and was checked in less than 5 minutes. Not one time during the entire weekend did anyone ask us if we wanted to do a tour. Asked me our preferences on type of room /floor level and location. I asked for non smoking and a top floor. Got the 6thfloor in the \"Georges House\" building. Our room was totally new and remodeled. In room safe. Cleaning supllies, vaccuum, mop, laundry soap, dish detergent. Plenty of trash bags, Ironing board etc. Had granite counter tops, tiled floors in kitchen and bathroom. Small fridge and microwave, sink and dishes, silverware, glassware for two. Very tastefully decorated with a West Indies look of dark woods and floral pictures. A Phillips Flat Screen TV with good assortment of channels for everyone. But who is there to watch TV. Plenty of activities for the kids and adults alike. Spa services that were reasonably priced. A tennis pro available for lessons with a appointment. Hd a nice screened balcony with 2 chairs and table. Pools were heated with exception of one that shut down overnight, so the temps in all the others was around 82 and the broken one was 72 degrees. Plenty of towels were always available and no stress on getting them. No one monitoring how many you were taking. Pool side coral grill to eat lunch. Hot tubs were nicely placed throughout the pool area. Lush tropical landscaping. Parking was ok. plenty during day but in the evening could fill up after everyone home from nearby theme parks. This hotel is nicely located near everything. They give you a great instruction map for all your local shops , such as Super Walmart (only 2 miles away) . International Drive is a short 10 minute drive away. This is a quiet off busy interstate and \"hotel row\" resort. Saw lots of young people with jogging strollers on sidewalks in front of the resort. Very safe. One employee named Julio was very pleasant and greeted us, introduced himself and offered to help us with anything we needed throughout our stay. Everyone we made eye contact with said hello. Just an overall nice weekend. No stress, no pressure sales or invite to see any presentation. Checkout was just as easy as check in and you could check out from your phone. We did receive a call from Guest Services asking us if everything about our stay was acceptable. Housekeeping even called and asked if we needed anything because we left our \"do not disturb\" sign on the door.

This time share hotel offers large comfortable rooms in an environment that is more like a large apartment complex than a hotel. The rooms are all suites and have small kitchens, washers and dryers and would be excellent for families. However, there are several important problems to be aware of. Definitely avoid rooms ending in 14. I was in one such room and it was directly next door to a mechanical room. The noise from the mechanical room would cycle up and all day and night (sounding kind of like a jet engine starting) making it almost impossible to sleep, even with ear plugs. I had to relocate to a different room. I decided to sleep in on the last day of the conference but had the housekeeper ring the doorbell at 8:30 AM (I had not put out the DND sign). Also, the hallways are finished in tile and the housekeeping carts make a racket as they are rolled from room to room. It is also important to note that the food service is extremely limited. There is basically a deli-style cafe with a fairly narrow selection of offerings (and it is a long walk from many parts of the property) and there is no room service other than an embedded Pizza Hut Express. Finally, I was shocked to learn that the check-out time at the hotel is 10am. While I was able to extend it to noon, I have never experienced a hotel that expected you to be out of the room that early on the day of departure. All in all, I would say that the hotel is well-suited for families on vacation to Orlando who are planning on longer stays. While the room sizes are good and the free internet access is nice (although rather slow), the limited service makes it much less appealing to a business traveller.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cThe best resort we have stayed at to date!\u201d", "Author": "KrysNJeb", "ReviewID": "UR46572587", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to Orlando for our anniversary. In preparation for our trip, I did a lot of research of the hotels/resorts in the area...I wanted to stay at a resort with class and elegance, but for a resonable value. I found the best rate on Sams club.com (almost 60 less than expedia, ect). We decided to book the GHVC since it was a good location to the PRemium outlet mall and Disney...it is located literally next to the outlet mall (if you park in the garage, you can see the resort - less than 100 ft). Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly staff member who escorted us to the front desk represenative. We stayed in a bedroom suite in building 7 (the newest building)...our view overlooked the pond and fountains (beautiful). The rooms were very clean and elegant! I was impressed with the bedsheets and down conforter...it was almost like I did not leave my own bed! The balcony was a nice area to sit back and relax after a long day at the parks. Suggestions/Tips: the elevators must not have air conditioning, the parking is not accomodating - but they have security that will drive you to your complex), house keeping does not regularly come out, they do not have a full length mirror. On the plus side: there is a nice flat screen TV and a DVD player in the room as well as a kitchen area with all the items you need to prepare a small meal (microwave, coffee maker, toaster, mini fridge, microwave, blender, and dishes/utencils). We elected to eat breakfast at the Fresco deli on site...not a good idea! The food was not great for 9.00...if you are ok with fast food - I recommend leaving the hotle, or bringing your own breakfast. The pool area was very nice and there are 2 hot tubs in the main swimming area...if you want to relax witout a lot of noise, I suggest the Laguna pool located near building 5. They have an onsite photographer that will take several pictures of you and your family throughout the resort and you recieve a 5x7 photo complimentary! There is a shuttle that costs 12 to get to the parks as well as an on-site area where you can purchase tickets at a discounted price - FYI - the shuttle times were not great, so we paid the extra 2.00 and drove our own vehicle. The best part of our stay was when we arrived to our room on Saturday to find an anniversary card for us (signed by ALL the front staff) as well as a chesse/cracker/fruit and wine basket waiting for us in the fridge...that truley blew us away and eliminated any \"suggestions\" we had for improvement. I would definately recommend staying at this resort....we were never even called for the timeshare offering; in fact, I learned about that part when I searched the hotel to write this review.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dk1980", "ReviewID": "UR46517795", "Content": "My wife and i have just returned from staying here for two weeks and thought the hotel/apartment complex was excellent. We had a one bedroom apartment with a kitchenette and balcony overlooking the lake and the premium outlet mall was right next door, which was very convenient. The hotel was really nice and everything was really clean and the hotel grounds were lovely. the staff were very helpful and friendly and the made service came everyday and did a good job. the hotel offered a full days entertainment each day, which would be ideal for young families. there was a pizza hut on site which was nice, i think it was around $10 for a pizza and 2 fitness suites located at each pool, but were bit on the small sized. The hotel is opposite a Publix and the outback steak house (which i would definitely recommend - we had some great steaks from here) and the i-ride stops right outside the hotel, but you could always go over to the premium as the i-ride's bus terminus is located here. it would take about 1 hour to 1 and half hours to travel the full length of i-drive on the i-ride though. There was a shuttle bus to the parks which costed $6 per person return trip, 3 shuttles in the morning, the last of which was 11.30am, and 3 pick ups, the last of which was 9pm, but double check this as our last pick up was 7.15pm 1 hour after universal had closed. the only problem we had with this occurred when we wanted to have a night out in city-walk. as we would be getting dressed up for the evening we couldn\u2019t really get the 11.30am shuttle! So we had to get a taxi there. plus there was no late evening shuttle as well, not even at the weekend which i found strange. the scheduled transportation was the only let down of this hotel. i have stayed in other hotels in international drive which offer free transportation to the parks which run several times in the morning and once or twice early & late evening, the last of which was around 12am/1am. I cannot understand why other hotels can offer free transportation to the parks but this hotel cannot. Anyway a taxi to universal is just under $25 each way and i think to go to downtown Disney it would be around the same price. I would definitely stay in this hotel again and i would recommend it however if you are thinking of not hiring a car while you stay in orlando, i would recommend staying in another hotel.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton Ca", "Title": "\u201cHappy with Hilton\u201d", "Author": "sftnslky", "ReviewID": "UR46470888", "Content": "First off let me say this resort is GEORGOUS!!! The grounds are huge and stunning. It is all built with an Italian/Tuscan theme. We really did not know what to expect as we had never even heard of this hotel before they called us. We literally were in the middle of planing our Disney Cruise vacation and trying to find a hotel big enough for the 7 of us for pre cruise, when we got a phone call from Hilton Grand Vacations Club [HGVC] offering us a free stay in Las Vegas. At first I said \"No thank you.\" And explained to them that we were already going on vacation and didn't have the time or dollars for another one. So they asked what days we would be in Orlando and then said if they could get us a two bedroom suite for 3 full nights for basically free, as long as we agreed to go on a time share tour, would we be interested. I thought about it for less then a second and said \"Yes!!!.\" After flying cross country from Northern Ca, to Orlando for 7 hours, then spending another hour waiting for our rental car we could have slept on the concrete for all we cared, but thankfully Hilton had other ideas. As we pulled up to the guard station, he already had all of our parking passes ready and pointed us to the reception desk. When I checked in I asked the gentleman at the desk if they had already placed the rollaway bed in the suite...he looked a little confused and said \"Ma'am we haven't had rollaway's for a few years now\" I instantly thought \"oh great here we go.\" I explained to him that the gentleman who called assured me that you would have a rollaway for our sons to sleep on. he then asked how many of us were there. I explained 7...3 adults and 4 kids. He told me the room that we had was what they called a 1/studio. Another words it was a full one bedroom with an attached studio. The bedroom would sleep 2 in the king, and in the studio 2 can sleep on the pull out and 1 or 2 in the queen bed. He then offered that they could bring a mattress from one of the other fold out sofas and put it on the ground for my son. I was happy with that so as we were finishing up all the paperwork, when this other gentleman came over and punched something into the computer and said \"give this to them please.\" They had a full two bedroom with 1 king, 2 fulls and a queen pull out sofa bed that they had on hold for someone, but they had canceled at the last minute. So yippee skippy we are on our way to our room. We were in tower 2 on the 5th floor. The bellman brought ALLLLL of our bags up..poor guy, thankfully hubby tipped him well. The suite was AWESOME. A full kitchen fully stocked with plates, silverware, coffee maker, pots and pans, etc... beyond the kitchen was a dinning/living room, which was very large. with a dinning room table that could seat 6, and the living room had a desk/chair, large sofa, 2 overstuffed chairs/ottomans. Directly off of the living room was the fully screened in lanai with a patio set that could seat 4, ceiling fan and light. The lanai was also accessible from the mater bedroom as well. Off to the left of the kitchen was a hallway with a stackable washer and dryer..which came in handy several times. The second bedroom with a full walk in closet, 2 queen beds, a very large dresser, and large flat screen tv. across from the laundry area was a full bathroom, with a tub/'shower combo and your standard toilet, sink etc... across from the bathroom was the master bedroom. As you opened the door you were greeted with a MASSIVE Jacuzzi tub that could have easily have held 4 adults, or several children. There was a super comfy king size bed, with two night stands a chair, a smaller walk in closet with an in room safe. There was also the bathroom with an amazing walk in rain shower. The shower was also MASSIVELY large and could have held 4 or 5 adults. As you can guess we were VERY tired from all the traveling and did not feel like going out to get something to eat. We found a pizza hut magnet on the refrigerator, and found out they were onsite and would deliver to your room. So hubby called and ordered pizza while myself and brother in law went across the street to Publix grocery store to pick up some basic supplies. When we returned, hubby had taken all the kids swimming and to see the outdoor/pool side movie. Two days a week they show family movies on a huge blow up screen in the pool area. After swimming and pizza we all fell into bed. The next morning came VERY early for hubby and I. We had agreed to go on the tour and they had reserved our time to be 8:15 AM...which for us is 5:00AM. We went on a non stressful tour, watched the informational video and was asked several times if we were interested in purchasing. After the 1 1/2 hour tour we went back to the room and met up with the rest of the family. We found out from the front desk that the property backs up to the huge Orlando Factory Outlet Stores, and we simply had to walk across this wooden bridge to the back gate, use our room key and walk across the street to the outlets. Our wallets wish they would have never told us this \"secret.\" The pool area is very large with the pool its self looking like the Olympic rings with a gorgeous waterfall that resembles the Olympic cauldron. There is a small cafe/deli pool side and several bars, and during certain times of the day there is a young lady that will do hair braiding and air brush tattoos. There is also a small gift shop. There are 7 towers that all encase a very large manmade lake. The grounds are landscaped very nicely with many palm trees. There was also several screened in basketball courts that we personally didn't not use, but saw several folks enjoying them. The final morning came quickly and with a 10AM check out time [YIKES} we were off to enjoy the rest of our vacation. We could have easily spent an entire week at HGVC, and might in the future. One downside, besides the early checkout is they offered no shuttles to any of the surrounding tourist areas. And the overly priced deli items via poolside, but I guess that is to be expected. I only wish we would have arranged to stay here for the 2 nights after our Cruise, but that is another report.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cHGVC - Great location for the theme parks\u201d", "Author": "minnow1982", "ReviewID": "UR45948985", "Content": "We stayed at this HGVC on one of their \"previews\" or timeshare presentations.

There is also a deli on site, and since our place had a kitchen, that was also useful. Wireless internet was free and also rather quick. A pleasent surprise. The hotel buildings are set around a small lake, which has turtles and fish swimming in it. There is an on site gym, though I did not use it. There is a free computer for printing boarding passes, though it did not seem to work for my BA flight. In the immediete area there is a retail outlet park right next door, and Hilton guests can access it through a private gate. An easy way to spend money on designer labels! There is also a supermarket in the other direction and a few restaurants. Theme parks Disney, Universal and Seaworld are all fairly close.

The fact that the rooms are villas with plenty of space to spread out and relax is comfortable and inviting to stay longer. The kitchen is fully equipped right down to salt and pepper shakers. The towels, soaps, and bath extras were generous and the suite was spotless, all added to the plush pampering. We had a one-bedroom villa with a king bed, whirlpool (just like the hotel's website pictures), a queen sleeper sofa, a screened in balcony with a ceiling fan/light that had a patio table with seating for 4.

Even more impressive to us was the safety we felt in the evenings. The security staff is excellent with patrols watching and caring for you and your vehicles. Parking can get tight, but there are sufficient spots on the property, it might not be near your building. However, with the frequent security golf carts stopping to ask you if you would like a ride back to your room, no need to worry about exercising, unless you want to. Not one Hilton staff was rude or cold, whether on duty or not, these are people who like their jobs and it shows. There even a preview center filled with over 125 salespeople who greet you and may try to soft sell you but are not overbarring or rude.

We were put in Building 5, which is without a doubt the worst building they have. And not only was it the worst building, it was the worst room: it had a view of the Premium Outlet parking lot. We could hear nothing but road noise, breathe in nothing but auto fumes. We called to complain and were told the only room available was in Building 3 overlooking the lake, but that the air wasn't working, and we would just have to wait until it was repaired, when ever that was---probably tomorrow. So I unpacked. Less then an hour later, they called to tell us the room was available for us if we wanted, so we moved. It was steaming hot. We waited another hour. It got hotter. We complained again. This time we were moved to the top floor (the best view), and everything seemed OK. Housekeeping was scarce, definitely. When you ask for more detergent, its like prying coins from the ferry man. The pools are busy, but fun for the kids. The main pool has a bar and grille, but its pricey like everything else in Orlando. There's hair-wrapping and tattoos, homemade icecream, and free ice pops. They offer social activities like karyoke night, dive-in movies ,and music. They also organize stuff for the kids, but I found the staff somewhat unfriendly. The biggest problem is that there is no lifeguard on duty. The rules are not enforced. Other children were jumping into the pool on top of my kids, and were first asked not to do it, then told to stop because it was unsafe, ran to tell their mother. A very low-brow confrontation ensued, with the children crying theatrically and me being cursed at by their heavily tattoed mother and grandmother. Security did nothing for us. It spoiled our stay somewhat. What really put the kabash on it was the stultifying and oppressive checkout time: 10AM. And they mean it. We called to ask for more time that morning (they tell you late check out is available when you check in), and at first they refused, they had the room booked. We said we only need till 12. After haggling for 10 minutes they finally said we could have until 11. So while we waited for the clothes to dry, we swam for 20 minutes. I swear they were watching us. When we returned at 10:45, they called at 11:05 to see if house keeping could come in, afterwhich she knocked 3 more times, and had management call again at 11:45.

I did a lot of research on different hotels to stay at in Orlando and based on reviews I chose the HGVC @ International Drive. I just returned about 2 hrs ago and felt it was worth to give a review. The hotel was AWESOME!! No bogus pictures on their site, the hotel looked exactly as the hilton.com pictures. Rooms were beautiful. I stayed in a king size studio suite with frig, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, etc. Everything is upgraded. I traveled with my 10 year old son and he had a great time. Honestly when we were at the parks, he was talking about how we were going to go back to the hotel and chill!!..He looked forward to the arcade room, the activity center that housed two pool tables, checkers table and chess. The pools were beautiful and well maintained. Water was nice and warm and the spa whirpools were great. I must say the prices were also incredibly reasonable to include the food prices. They had a pizza hut onsite that charged the same prices as any other pizza hut in your local neighborhood and the food at the tuscany bar and grill was awesome. Drinks were made well, no water down and adults could sit by bar or lounge by pool and keep a nice eye on the children. Staff were always friendly and extremely helpful. I arrived at 11:00 am and my room was ready although check in is 4:00 pm. They also allowed me to check out 1 hour after regular check out time. They have seven bldgs so getting to the front building can be a bit tiring, but you can call the bellman and someone will come pick you up. However if you enjoy scenery, take the walk to the front of the hotel around their beautiful lake. They also have washer and dryers on 2 floors of everybody building, which was great to be able to wash bathing suits and towels. Although the hotel provided nice warm towels for the guests while at both of their pools.

We had a King Size bed suite with full kitchen, living room and washer/dryer. We had an amazing view of the water and it was wonderful sitting on the screened in porch overlooking the water as we had a snack or ate breakfast. The room was very clean, comfortable, we had a great whirlpool tub which we used every night and it was fabulous. Housekeeping was great, came in everyday and did the dishes, emptied garbage, made beds and kept everything neat and clean for us. The grounds are very clean, the workers were some of the most polite people I've ever met. Everyone smiled, greeted us warmly and always asked if there was anything we needed. I was so impressed with the staff. The pool was immaculate and my daughter loved it. It was a lot of fun to have movie nights out by the pool and the staff also had games you could participate in as well. The bar staff was friendly and the food and drinks were great. There was a deli to purchase food in as well, or you could order from your room and then pick up in deli. There is a pizza hut on site as well. We also rented a movies from the lobby and watched it in our room a few nights, since there is a DVD player in the living room. Originally we planned on staying three nights, but it was so wonderful we stayed an extra night. There is a pier that crosses over from the resort to the shopping outlet mall and it's a beautiful walk. There is also a photographer at the hotel and they offer a free photo of your family/party. It only took about 15 minutes and we have great pictures of our time there. Location is fabulous, only a mile from the Disney World entrance and a mile from Sea World. It only took us a few minutes to get to Downtown Disney, Magic Kingdom and Sea World. Neither of us wanted to leave and I can't wait to go back. I want to take our whole family back next time so we can enjoy it even more! If I had to pick anything as a negative, the only thing I can think of was the parking. There never seemed to be enough spaces for everyone, especially if you came back very late at night. One night I had to park by another building and walk to ours, but the security was amazing.

The lady at the front desk gave me a choice of two different lake-view rooms an ultimately recommended one in Building 7 (newest building).

Loved the furnishings, decorations, granite countertops, huge jacuzzi tub, etc. I found the bed extremely comfortable and it was the best sleep I got during the whole trip. I travel frequently for business and this is truly one of the nicest properties where I have stayed. I had read in reviews that parking could be a problem, particularly in the newer sections. I wasn't out late, but had no problem finding a close spot anytime during the day or when returning from dinner. I loved the location of Building 7 and views were fabulous, although you did have to cross the pedestrian bridge to get to main pool, or down a path to second pool between buildings 4 and 5.. The only negative thing I'd say about the resort is that hallway noise could be a bit loud at times which I'd say could be an issue if you were in a studio room or using the living room sofa bed in other units. Could also hear some walking noise from the unit above but it wasn't particularly loud. Overall I had a great experience at this resort and I would highly recommend it.

However we did mind the view we had from our room upon arrival, we had travelled for 17hrs to be landed with a view of a multi-story parking garage. I immediately phoned reception and they sorted our room out very quickly without hesitation.

The main pool area is beautiful, the sun loungers are very comfortable, friendly staff, a flag on each bed that you raise for service and an excellent daily entertainment programme (we didnt really participate in any of the programmes but it was great for the kids). The pool remained open until 11pm every night which was nice but the pool bar closed with the pool and there was no place else to relax and have a drink unless you did so on your balcony. Drinks were a little pricey, for two cocktails including the tip it was about $21. We ate at the poolside bar twice and both times the food was lovely. There is a deli by the pool that make yummy wraps to order daily. There are resort shuttles running to all major attractions for the price of $6 return which is good value. They only run at certain times and we found the times a little inconvenient.

I am staying in building 11 (Tucker Town), and when I called to inquire whether there was a special code that I needed to access the \"high-speed internet\" that is advertised, I was told that the wireless was \"for the whole resort,\" which is why it is slow \"at times.\" At times???!!! Try ALL THE TIME!!! I am traveling on business and really need to be able to access my work email and folders on my company's secure drives, which I typically access through VPN. Although I can logon to my VPN, the connection is so slow that every time I try to access my work email or work email folders, I get timed out and cannot access them at all. After an unreasonably long wait (~hour), I was provided with an ethernet cable, which did absolutely nothing to improve the internet situation. I have since stopped using the ethernet cable. I think it is completely inexcusable for a hotel to have such poor internet access in the year 2009. If this hotel is just for families traveling without computers, who do not require internet access, then it should be advertised as such. It is infuriating to think something is going to work and then have to do without it. And on that topic, the clock radio is supposed to have the capability to run an ipod or mp3 player, and this function does not work (in my room at least). I also had to take the stairs 6 floors down when I left the hotel this morning, and 6 floors back up when I returned. The elevator was not working. This is particularly problematic considering that the hotel where my conference is being held is approximately 1/2 mile away (although it would be a lot less if not for the ridiculous fence around the property--how hard would it be to allow residents' room cards to work to open the gate in the fence?). Walking 1/2 mile, in heels, in the rain, every time I want to go to or return from the conference hotel is a tremendous inconvenience. The only other option is to take a cab (there is no complimentary shuttle service available).

Overall this was a pretty fantastic place for our needs. The hotel's grounds & pool are beautiful and well-maintained. I booked a package through orbitz and got a great rate. After a mix-up with my room, which was supposed to be next to my family, I was upgraded for free to a 1 bedroom suite which was absolutely HUGE and gorgeous--full kitchen & dining area, huge bathroom with jacuzzi and large separate shower, screened in porch. Also arrived around 11am, and they had the room ready to go--impressive. The studio rooms are also nice, but the suite really made the stay and would definitely be worth the extra expense, especially for families. Maid service and amenities were excellent. We were in one of the buildings at the end of the property, by a smaller pool, but a bit of a walk across a bridge over the lake to the main area. We didn't mind, but could be an issue for the older folks. On the plus side, we were located directly next to the gate for the huge outlet mall across the street, which was really a great place to shop. Ate at the food court there a couple times--good selection and fairly cheap for a resort area. There is also an Outback and some fast food within walking distance across the street. The large pool area was also a beautiful area to relax in at the end of the day, ate at the poolside restraunt a couple times which was pretty good. Had movies by the pool some nights. The one main negative of our trip was the rudeness of the time share presenter that my parents experienced. They originally booked their room with a (slightly) reduced rate in exchange for attending a 2 hour time share presentation. After acting like their best friend and pressuring them to stay longer, my parents declined to immediately decide to pay the $37,000 time share buy in (not to mention maintence fees, etc). The presenter was extremely rude--shoved his chair back from the table, abruptly jumped up and loudly announced, \"This presentation is OVER.\" Come on--how many people actually agree to spend that much money without thinking it over? It kind of ruined the first day for my mom--she just couldn't get over how rude he was. The ironic part was that they actually are interested in purchasing a vacation home or time share, but it sure won't be from Hilton. Finally called and caught me the next day, trying to offer discount Disney tickets, etc--got a big NO. Other than that, the staff was extremely pleasant, going out of their way to be friendly. My husband and I typically stay at Marriott resorts, and I was favorably impressed in this regard with the Hilton. One thing to keep in mind for those who don't want to rent a car, is that the shuttle service ($6/pp round trip to Epcot, from there you take a bus or monorail to Disney or MGM, AK) only runs 3 times in the morning, and 3 returns starting at 6pm in the evening. Takes about 15 minutes to get there. From what we heard, cabs cost about $30 one way. Worked out okay for us, and the shuttle company seemed to be well-run. Cab fare from the airport is about $45-50, with Mears shuttle being $20pp. Overall this was a great trip and beautiful place to stay.

Eventually I was able to persuade the front desk to send up some fresh towels. They didn't offer to do anything else. We cleaned up the room ourselves. Imagine my dismay when we returned the next night to find the room had still not been cleaned. The bedsheets were a total disaster. There were now 6 wet towels in the bathtub. And fruit flies were buzzing around the sink where we had eaten fruit the night before. I called the front desk, and they offered only to send me some garbage bags so I could take out my own garbage.

In addition to the food court at the mall, there is a supermarket and a couple of restaurants across the street. We were tired each day after watching cheerleading and doing the parks, so we just ordered food at the convenient pool bar and relaxed while our child enjoyed the beautiful pool.

We go to Orlando to shop, eat, and play. Initial Thoughts - The location has gated security. This was very important to us. We wanted to make sure that our car was reasonably secure.

Normally one would expect to see signs of wear and tear in a room, but this was not the case. Knowing that this is a Grand Vacations Resort it would be reasonable to expect an owner arriving being given a good room but having booked via the Hilton Honours website, we were presently surprised by the standard of our Studio Apartment. The grounds and public areas were immaculately kept and we were pleased to see discrete, yet efficient, security in place - particularly as there were reports on the TV about home invasions occurring in the Orlando area at the time. The location right next door to an Outlet Mall was a bonus, as was the supermarket and drugstore across the road. If there is only one setback it is the lack of adequate indoor dining facilities. When we were there, a cold front came through and whilst Florida is described as the sunshine state, having to dine and drink outside is not fun. One tip is about traffic. On Sundays the traffic using Vineland Avenue to access the Outlet Mall and the nearby church can make accessing SR 535 (the route to Disney and the I4) a bit of a nightmare as it is single file.

As gorgeous as it looks in photos, they really do not do this place justice. This resort and the grounds it sits on are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! From the minute you drive through the gates, to the time when you leave to go home you are treated like a celebrity. The staff, is wonderful, courteous, and friendly as can be. We stayed in a studio suite, which is basically a standard hotel room. But let me assure you, there is nothing \"standard\" about it. The room has a kitchenette with a microwave, refrigerator, and sink. Silverware, plates, and glasses are all provided. The room has an LCD television, ceiling fan, screened in balcony, granite counters in kitchenette and bathroom. The room also comes with complimentary wireless and LAN high speed internet access. As I mentioned earlier, the grounds are gorgeous and very well maintained. The hotel has two pools. The main pool has a grill and bar, and a wait staff that will bring food and drinks to you as you soak up the sun. Simply raise the flag on your chair, and they will be there to take your order in minutes. Don't feel like bringing money to the pool? No problem...they can charge any and all food and drinks to the room. The second pool is called the Lagoon Pool. It has a Pizza Hut Express and is more of a \"low key\" pool. At night this is a good pool to go to if you just want to be alone and want some privacy. Our week at the HGVC was perfect, and I would not change one thing about this place. The location of this hotel was great too, as it is 5 minutes from Disney, and about 10-15 from Universal. There is a Publix right across the street which was handy, as well as a McDonalds which was a perfect option each morning for a quick and easy breakfast before the parks. One thing nobody ever mentioned on here that should be mentioned is in regards to the toll road. Between the airport and hotel you have to take a toll road, and pay two tolls. The tolls are $0.75 each, which is not a big deal.....but it's good to know that you need to have $1.50 ready on the way to and from the airport. The parking here can be a little tricky in the evenings. We found that anytime after 8:00 PM parking in front of your building was next to impossible. We usually had to park clear on the other side of the complex, which is a pretty good distance. While slightly annoying, the walk isn't too bad. In fact the walk around the lagoon at night can be quite serene. This is easily one of the nicest places in all of Orlando, and if you are trying to decide on a place to stay, the search ends now.

This was my first stay and I booked a one bedroom suite for six nights for a Disney holiday with my brother's family. My brother and his wife used to travel extensively for work and are familiar with many hotels but their reaction to this property was pure shock but in a good way. It's a different experience. The grounds are extensive and nicely landscaped with fountains, a recreational path, small but engaging playground for children, barbecues, 2 pools (with more fountains and waterfalls built into the pool!) and many hot tubs. This seemed pretty but not appealing because the temperature was in the 50's. To our surprise, the water was warm enough, that we could use the pools and hot tubs even in the evenings. The staff offer many kid-friendly activities every day and my 7 year old niece loved the \"Dive-in\" movie (giant movie screen next to the pool). We had tickets to the Disney parks and we had to drag my niece to Disney (!) because she loved the pools so much. We asked for a quieter location and received a one-bedroom suite at the end of a corridor. It was very quiet. Moving onwards to the rooms, we were stunned by the suite. It was spacious and offered the comforts of home: dining area, whirlpool tub, washer/dryer, kitchen with dishwasher, blender, toaster, coffeemaker, TV/cable, wireless Internet access, The bed was king-sized and the sleeper sofa full-sized. The balcony was screened it with some patio furniture. It was sooo nice to let my niece play on the balcony without watching her every second. The bathroom was lusciously large. If you have a group that's comfortable using the facilities simultaneously (hey - there's all kinds out there), 4 people can use the bathroom simultaneously, it's that big. The kitchen has enough cooking utensils that cooking breakfast was a snap, although a full dinner would have been a real challenge. However, the door between the bedroom and the rest of the suite had a gap which allowed lots of noise to travel. We had to be quiet to let the late sleeper rest. As for the neighborhood, there is a supermarket right across the street and a outlet shopping center right next door. The supermarket was convenient although surprisingly pricey. The outlet shopping wasn't very exciting but I'm used to shopping in Manhattan and even bigger outlets in California. The Disney parks are conveniently close. The Hilton does offer shuttles to the parks - I think it was about $6 per shuttle ride. It might have been better to use the shuttles than to rent a car. They do not offer shuttle rides to the airport. We found plenty of dining options within a mile or two of the property - everything from fast food to chains, to nicer restaurants and small Mom & Pop operations with some interesting ethnic food choices. It's worth it to spend about 2 hours driving around to check out your choices. The front desk was very efficient with routine tasks, check-in & out, requests for extra room supplies (they hadn't stocked the room with enough for 4 people staying for six nights). Their informational hand-outs were exceptional. They had the answers for routine questions clearly and concisely spelled out. In addition, I had a contact within the Hilton organization that I could call with special requests for information, tickets, reservations etc... She was wonderfully helpful with deep local information. By comparison, the concierge's desk was not equally knowledgeable. Unfortunately, for special requests and unexpected circumstances, the staff went into denial. It was as if they could not recognize a problem or think outside of their daily routine. Luckily, our problems were minor (the top rack of the dishwasher was stuck and we could not load it, so we ran the dishwasher half full). The difference in customer service is hugely different from the Las Vegas facility where people had a very different attitude. The room service is different from standard hotels. The information sheet laid out the schedule. I only recall that we were scheduled for one visit from housekeeping for the six nights. After thinking about it I thought the trade off for the other amenities was worth it. I mean, they were offering recreational activities and classes from about about mid-morning to early evening many days. I could swear that many of the buildings on the property were empty. We never saw too many guests and it was quiet. We went during the low season, yet the parking lots were full. Could it be the shoppers from the outlet center next door figured out a way to sneak into the Hilton parking? Probably. The parking at the outlet was packed. This is a time-share and you are offered every opportunity to participate in the sales pitch. To their credit, Hilton uses the \"soft sell\" approach. They'll crunch numbers for you, show you pictures, list health benefits of vacations, teach you tricks to maximize your membership benefits but they won't use raw sales pressure to get you to purchase. I didn't catch them lying the way I caught other time-share sales people. We walked through other features of the property but didn't get a chance to use them. The property included an \"active\" lounge with billiards and chess & other games, computer/business facilities, a quiet lounge for reading. A ping-pong table located in a gazebo, a deli, a pizza place (offered room service), a small videe arcade, a spa and a small fitness room. I even saw hoops for basketball. The court was small but the hoops looked regulation size. Overall, I would recommend this as a value for a family or large group vacation. You are surrounded by theme parks so the hip will be bored (seriously, the Dumbo ride?). The property is very pretty but there doesn't seem to be enough privacy for a romantic get-away because the buildings are densely packed with many rooms.

The first night we parked about 3 units away which I thought was bad. On Saturday evening, there was a sign at the entrance that said all parking was full and we must park at the reception area. So, we parked a long way from our unit (at least a quarter of a mile). Fortunately they had a golf cart to take us to our building. However, the next morning no golf cart was around and we had to walk all the way across this huge development to get our car. What a pain. I hate to see what parking is like during the busy times. The noise was noticeable in our unit from people walking, talking and just normal conversation. I was surprised that was the case with what was spent on these units. The place is just too big.

We had traded a week from one of our timeshare properties through RCI for our two-bedroom unit there. We had read other reviews that said an RCI exchange would result in a less-than-desirable room. So, we were not expecting to have a great room. However, we were very pleasantly surprised when our room was on the end of the second floor in building 3 with a great view of the lake and the fountains. We sat on our balcony almost every morning for breakfast and really enjoyed the view. The grounds at the resort were gorgeous and we really loved walking around the lake on the sidewalk every day. The resort is adjacent to an outlet mall and you can walk through a gate (with your resort card key) and be on the mall property. We also walked across the stree to the Outback restaurant and the Publix grocery store. You can also catch a trolley from in front of the resort or use the resort's shuttle service for a small fee. So, the location is great. My wife and I enjoy working out and we used the workout facilities several times while there. The resort has two workout rooms. They are both small, but we had no trouble getting to use the machines we liked. Since we traded a timeshare week to visit the HGVC, we expected to be subjected to some high pressure to buy timeshare there. This was definitely not the case. We received phone messages asking to visit the photographer for our complimentary photo (which we didn't do), but that was the extent of the pressure. The pool areas were very nice and there were plenty of lounge chairs available. The resort also provided ample towels for the guests at the pool. At other resorts we have visited, this is not always the case. The food at the resort pool was very good and reasonably priced too.

Our first visit was immediately after Hurricane Charley. See previous review in 2006. Our most recent visit was for 8 nights from 21st December, 2008. We are a party of 3 adults. We chose this resort because the service is usually very good, it has all the facilities and amenities we need and is close to areas we want to visit. Publix is just across the road. There is a Deli on site which can be useful. The property is within easy drive to Seaworld and Disney. We were not disappointed with our latest visit. This resort is clean, attractive and the suites are very comfortable. We like to have: living/dining/full kitchen with separate king sized bedroom and Jacuzzi, en-suite shower room and full washer and dryer. We have stayed at this property for the last three Christmases. Our check in was fairly straight forward although we had not been pre-assigned a room: I had to remind clerk that I had requested a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the lake, in my online booking. She had not read this on my booking but promptly assigned a suite in the second building. We said we were not interested in time share so we were not bothered at all during our stay. We stayed in this building on our first visit so were prepared when we found that the sofa had seen better days: it was a little worn. However the rest of the suite was perfectly acceptable and my daughter tells me the pull-out bed from the sofa was comfortable. My guess is that the mattress had been replaced. We had a good view of the lake and a side view of the main pool. We stayed on the fourth floor. One of the latest additions is a bridge across the lake making a pleasant walking circuit and easy access to the Premium Outlet Mall. The Mall gets really busy, at this time of year, so you can safely walk from the property without the hassle of parking the car in one of the malls car parks or crossing busy roads. Last year parking was a major problem because, often, we had to park a small distance from our building\u2019s car park; this year, we were able to park immediately outside our building every time. The maid was efficient most days and if anything was forgotten all we had to do was ring Housekeeping and toiletries and towels were sent to us pretty quickly - always with a smile.

We reported the leak and we were told an engineer would be out to fix it, but that never happened. There was also hair and dirt stuck to our dishes. It was definitely not our hair because the hair was blond and we have dark hair. We didn't even bother reporting this because the hotel staff didn't seem to care about the issues we encountered.

The breezeway outside our suite was tile and it seemed like hotel staff were rolling their cleaning carts up and down the tiled breezeways all day long and the noise was loud and clear.

We were assigned in building 4 on the 3rd floor with a view of the laguna pool. I did ask for building 2, but we arrived very late at night so it wasn't available. I must say that we were very impressed with the accommodations! When we arrived at our room, they had a cheese and fruit plate in the kitchen for us, and had a kids snack tray in the kitchenette area for my son. They also had a bottle of champagne which was nice as well. We ended up trading the bottle of champagne in for a couple of bottles of non alcoholic sparkling apple cider since we don't drink alcohol. This was a very nice gesture and very thoughtful of the staff, since I only mentioned it was our honeymoon on the phone earlier in the day. I must say that the bedding was excellent. The mattress was the perfect blend of softness and firmness, and they had a good blend of soft and firm pillows as well. The 2 person jacuzzi tub was a great way to relax after a long day at Disney. The tub fills very fast which is nice compared to some hotels where it takes forever for it to fill. We had daily maid service since we booked this through Hilton.com and not a timeshare program. The main bathroom has dual sinks, standalone shower. The kitchen has a refrigerator, oven with stovetop, microwave, and dishwasher. We ate breakfast everyday in our hotel room to save a little money, and at dinner a couple of times there as well. To our surprise, housekeeping would even load our dishes for us each day as well! The staff was the most friendly staff we have ever encountered at any resort or hotel ever. From the initial greeting at the security gate, to the final goodbye from a staff member on the way out, everyone greeted us with a smile and a hand wave. When we had an issue, it was quickly taken care of. We only had two issues during our stay. My son's bathroom had a moldy smell due to a shower curtain that was replaced very quickly and one day housekeeping forgot to restock the Evelyn and Crabtree shampoo and conditioner. They had a gentlemen bring up a whole bag of conditioners, shampoos, and lotions. Anytime we did call for a service issues, someone always followed up to make sure it was taken care of. I couldn't imagine our honeymoon stay to go any better than it did. Thank you HGVC and your staff. You made my honeymoon a wonderful one!", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plain City, OH", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel and Nice Staff\u201d", "Author": "OSUBuckey", "ReviewID": "UR20241950", "Content": "This was our first trip to Disney World.

There are two pools and the second pool as a wonderful kiddie pool that slopes down. We did have to switch rooms on the second day because we have a 1 year old and it was a little noisy for her to take her naps during the afternoon. We were in building 1 and, although its very convenient to the main pool and other services, you could hear all the games and activities going on over the loudspeaker from the pool. They were very nice and quickly moved us to another room in Building 3. I would definately request this Building if you want a quiet room. Its in the middle of both pools so you can not hear all the loudspeaker noise. We were in a studio and enjoyed the refrigerator, sink and micorwave. My parents were upgraded to a 1 bedroom and it was very large. They had a seperate bedroom, kitchen and dining area.

Day #1- Check in Bldg 2, room \u201308, gorgeous view of the lake, but right next to the elevator- too noisy. Staff was friendly and helpful. Was reassigned to Bldg 5, quieter, but had a view of the multi-deck parking lot and construction. Which was fine since we would not be spending too much time in the room looking out of the balcony. Hotel ground is very beautiful, very impressed. Pool and hot tub were nice too, but did not swim in it. Other reviews can give you a better insight to their opinion of the pools. Got a sales call, and told them no. Never got another sales call again (GREAT !). Few notes: 1) was surprised that there is no daily maid service. You get your room serviced on an assigned date. Not sure if this is customary at a time-share facility. 2) I stayed at a kitchenette. It has a refrigerator, sink, microwave, 2 sets of plates, cups and mugs and sufficient utensils for party of 2. 3) For such a gorgeous place, was surprised that there is no flat-screen TV. 4) No place to put luggage. Thus, we had to put on the chair and then remove from chair when I need to sit by the table. A disappointment. Room d\u00e9cor is standard and a bit on the smaller size. 5) Pillows were too soft- difficult to stack them and use as back support while watching TV. 6) Location is truly awesome. Next to the Premium Mall, right off I-Drive/ I-4 and right across from Publix/ Walgreens. Very quiet and serene and still close to everything. Would not be able to stay in a hotel directly situated on I-Drive- too noisy and too much traffic. It\u2019s worth it just for the location and the beauty of the hotel ground. Day #2 Went to Downtown Walt Disney, about 10 mins away by car. Free parking. Was not too impressed if you are adult without kids. Too many stores, over-priced caf\u00e9/ restaurants (but Ghiradelli ice cream store is worth it). Like the section around Lego Land- saw landmarks made of lego blocks and a huge Loch Ness Monster in the lake. Kids will love this place- you can buy everything Disney-related. No place to shield pedestrian from the heat- either you have to go inside a store/ restaurant, but still no seats to sit around. It was not comfortable on hot sunny day. Went to the town of Celebration. The town center is called \u2018Market Street\u2019, it is very quaint and clean. The houses are absolutely beautiful- mostly Victorian and antebellum style. If you like architecture, I recommend a drive through Celebration. Went to The Crab House (Palm Parkway) for dinner. It was not busy on a Monday night, but got good great service and food was good. Can either order a la cart or buffet (not a lot of selection though). Buffet is approx $29.99 pp. Most of the seafood entrees start at $20.00. Food was good, but if you have several people in your party, it can get pricey. Discount Tickets- My husband works for a major corporation and he was able to get some discount tickets via his company\u2019s partner stores. One of them happens to be All Access Tickets (8472 Palm Parkway, Orlando.). They ask you which company you work for and then let you know what the prices are. Not sure if it\u2019s cheaper than other discount ticket places or online purchases. Here are some examples: Kennedy Space Center $34.50/ adult (list $40.00) Univ Studio, adult one day/ one park, $58.00 (list $73.00) 1-Day WDW and 1-day Univ Studio, Adult (NO park Hopper) package $135.00 La Nouba, adult $76.00 (list $86.00 for category 2 = seating preference) Our seat was toward the back, center row (there are no bad seats here. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s better to sit in the back, you can get a better view of the aerial shows).

Of the 4, I'd rank this last-- but that doesn't mean it wasn't nice. We staid in a 2 bedroom which was actually a one bedroom suite with a connecting door to a studio room (regular hotel room). So that was a bit of a surprise, since most HGVC 2 bedroom properties have double beds in the 2nd room... since my mother-in-law and her mom were in the studio, it would have been better to have had 2 beds, or at least been told about that ahead of time. We were in building 4- which has a pool directly behind it. The main pool, bar, deli are all off of building 1 which was a bit of a walk (in the pouring rain!) but not bad. We loved having the laguna pool so close to our room since there were less than 10 people there each time we went... the main pool was packed so we appreciated a calmer area for our son to play. The hotel is walking distance from some high end outlets- which made my sister-in-law happy! There is also a publix right across the street which was great! Disney attractions are about a 15 minute drive if there is no traffic and you catch 50% of the red lights- we budgeted 30 minutes when going to visit my brothers who were staying at one of the disney hotels and that was usually about right. They will call and ask you to see the timeshare presentation, but unlike some of the other HGVC properties- we said no once and they didn't bug us again. The hotel was very quiet at night- and they even provided an in-room highchair for my son which was great! Full size fridge, washer and dryer made it easy to pack light.

We flew into Orlando with (GASP) \u2013 ourselves (late 40\u2019s), my parents (83, 78), Our kids (19, 13, 10), and each kid brought a friend (18, 16, 11). Let me tell you \u2013 traveling with such a huge group was a trip report in itself \u2013 but I won\u2019t bore you with it. Unit Features (3 bedroom \u2013 2 bedroom will be the same minus the lock-off): Bedrooms \u2013 Master bedroom has a king-size bed and a bathroom. There is one closet and plenty of drawer space. There is a television, which we didn\u2019t use. In the room is a really huge Jacuzzi tub. The master bath has a 2 person size shower, toilet and one sink. Living/Kitchen Area \u2013 Sofa bed (the younger girls slept on this and it was a horrible sofa bed \u2013 I do not recommend it for kids under the age of 6), a lounge chair and a TV. There\u2019s a desk area where you can use your computer \u2013 free wifi \u2013 but also a plug in if necessary. There is a big kitchen table. The kitchen had everything a full kitchen should have. \uf04a Laundry facilities are in a small closet by the kitchen. Deck \u2013 The deck is enclosed with large with a nice table and chairs. We rarely used it because our view was so bad. BUT - if you have a nice view- the deck will be AWESOME!!! Tidy Service \u2013 One tidy service was provided free of charge as timeshare owners - if you rent, you will get maid service daily. Pool Area \u2013 Absolutely divine. There were plenty of chairs. There were plenty of chairs \u2013 no need to reserve them as so many people are at Disney. The water was a perfect temperature \u2013 refreshing, but not cold. I loved the beautiful waterfall. There is a bar area where you can order burgers and chicken fingers, along with expensive, but important on vacation, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Restaurants/Marketplace \u2013 The pool bar has a decent menu. The children loved the freedom of going to the marketplace and buying extra food. This was their fun, though there\u2019s a Publix directly across the street. Of course we stocked the fridge, and of course the kids preferred the junk elsewhere. Great resort - View matters to me - so I will tell you about that so you can attempt to do better. That said, even with a bad view, the resort is awesome - and don't let our ugly view talk you out of staying here. When we arrived, we were assigned a room that had a very ugly view. We were in building 7 \u2013 view of the construction. We had a 3 bedroom. My parents had a 2 bedroom in building 7 \u2013 slightly better view \u2013 but not great. They insisted that the three bedrooms only have bad views because they\u2019re corner units. I do not believe this for one minute. Go for building 1 \u2013 4 if you want to be closer to the pool (though we didn\u2019t mind this part at all). Building 7 and beyond are across the bridge. Actually, I liked the short walk across the beautiful bridge to the pool. Lots of ducks and turtles greet you. We ate off site every night. Here\u2019s a list of restaurants: Best restaurants (all off Disney) 1. Le Coq Au Vin - French (TOP NOTCH - reasonably priced) 2. Seasons 52 (TOP NOTCH reasonably priced) 3. Oceanaire (TOP NOTCH - expensive) 4. Moonfish (Great - most expensive!) 5. Capital Grill (Very good -expensive) 6. Antonio's (Good - huge portions) 7. Fishbones (hated it) All are within 10 minutes from the hotel \u2013 though allow yourself 20 minutes with traffic. Property \u2013 Magnificent \u2013 Lovely pathways, benches, and gardens make a lovely walk. There is a gym, which is very mediocre \u2013 3 treadmills, one elliptical, 2 bikes, and poor weight machines. . The market place has plenty of what you need day one before you goes to the much less expensive supermarket nearby. The lobby is very pretty, and the staff was courteous. Sales/Staff \u2013 We were treated gloriously when we arrived. Then we were asked to go to a sales pitch (of course it was called an owners\u2019 breakfast). We didn\u2019t go. Planned Activities \u2013 Absolutely wonderful activities for the kids (adults \u2013 some \u2013 not as much). The kids could choose (most had charges) \u2013 hair braiding, tattoos, Wii challenge, make your own stuffed animal, pool party, dive movie night, on and on and on. Disney \u2013 We went to Magic Kingdom, Disney Studios, and Typhoon Lagoon. Remember \u2013 this was August and it was hot. Magic Kingdom was great because we used tours.com (from underground tourist). We followed the suggested route, and we had almost no lines. Most lines were air-conditioned, so although it was hot, it was very tolerable. We did arrive at 8:30 am \u2013 very important. We left at 2. The girls were exhausted, but the boys returned at 6 until 10 and had a blast. Disney Studios was another story. Again, we arrived at 8:30 am. We hit Rock \u2018n Roller Coaster with no lines (LOVED IT). But after that, lines got long and it got hot. Typhoon Lagoon was not, in my opinion, as great as we heard \u2013 but there were some fun rides \u2013and of course we weren\u2019t hot.

The bathroom was bigger than my bedroom at home. Having a full kitchen and washer and dryer were wonderful and I enjoyed the screened in balcony. Nice new Publix across the street as well as a gas station, Walgreens, McDonalds, Outback Steakhouse, and a fabulous Chinese restaurant-Citrus Garden, and oh yes, a liquor store! Also backs up to an outlet mall which my daughter and I had fun browsing during one of our many rainy afternoons. 2 pools, both beautiful. Plenty of lush beach towels provided, seemed to be adequate lounge chairs, 2 hot tubs. Lots of fun scheduled activities but we were unable to participate in the majority of them due to our daily plans and the weather (tropical storm Fay!). Our last night we were able to go to the main pool for the \"Dive In Movie\"-they have a big inflatable movie screen, showed a family movie, sold popcorn and candy etc-fun! The kitchen was nice but there was really no place to put groceries besides in the fridge. Parking was tight. We were there on what I would consider a bit slower time of year and still had trouble parking close to our building. Not a big deal but seems like it would be a major problem during high seasons. The ice maker in the freezer didn't work, some outlets didn't work, and the remote went out the 5th day we were there. Housekeeping also only comes once a week which didn't really bother us-we used the in room dryer to dry our bath towels because the humidity prevented any air drying; even with the AC on any opened food was stale in 24 hours. My only other complaint may be isolated based on the room we were in-we were evidently located next to some sort of storage closet for the housekeeping/maintainance staff and the one day we attempted to sleep in we were unable to because of the noise outside our room-the walls seemed thin. One more note-the staff was extremely good about keeping us apprised of the \"hurricane\" Fay situation in both voicemail messages and notes under the door (although they called Fay Kay). They did close the pool for 1 or 2 days and cancelled a lot of activities but we appreciate the proactive caution. Overall, we were extremely pleased.

We reserved a 1-bedroom king suite which included a king-sized bed + sofa bed + chair with ottoman that my 10-year old slept on 1 night. THE ROOM: Very pretty d\u00e9cor and nice furniture with marble countertops, new appliances, huge whirlpool tub, washer/dryer, flat-screen TVs in both the bedroom and sitting area, plus free WiFi Internet access in the room (bring your own laptop). The hotel gave us free laundry detergent and dryer sheets so we were able to do laundry during our stay and not run out of clean underwear for the kids! The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean and crisp. Since the property has 7 buildings, we were worried about the walking distance to the main lobby. Due to health/mobility issues, we requested a suite in building 1 and we were so happy to find out the hotel granted our wish, with a first floor handicapped-accessible room! While we enjoyed close proximity to the pools and main lobby, the downside to having a suite so close to the action is the noise. We didn\u2019t even try to put the kids to bed before 11 pm every night, due to the dive-in movie (see below) and pool noise. Also, our room was right by the elevator where, as early as 7 am, people talk very loudly while waiting. We heard entire conversations while trying to catch up on our ZZZs. In hindsight I think we would have been better to request a higher floor in building 1, or at least a room not right by the elevator. Before booking this hotel, we read other reviews that complained about inconsistent maid service, but we never had a problem. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels, bath products, etc. They even cleaned the kitchen with our dishes and gave us fresh Starbucks coffee daily. PROPERTY: Beautiful lush & green grounds; heated swimming pools with a waterfall; interactive children's fountains and 3 whirlpool spas; active lounge with chess, checkers, pool tables, computer with Internet (for a small fee); quiet lounge for reading; activity center for the kids with art supplies, projects, games/puzzles, books etc; a professional photographer on site that we did not have time to take advantage of; and more! Everything is new, clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly. When we first checked in we were asked if we wanted to attend a 45-min timeshare presentation but simply said no thanks and that was the end of it. We ate at the bar/restaurant by the pool 2 nights & found the prices to be reasonable. There is also a Pizza Hut and a deli (sandwiches, salads) with small grocery store on site. Every day there are activities scheduled for both kids and adults. At night from 8-11 pm the hotel brings out a huge projection screen and shows a nightly \u201cdive-in\u201d movie right at the main pool. You can lounge in chairs by the pool, eat, watch the movie, or swim the entire time it is showing. One night we watched \u201cCollege Road Trip\u201d and another night it was \u201cPenelope\u201d. LOCATION: The hotel is about 20 min from the airport. The taxi from the airport cost us around $50 one-way. Location is 15-20 minutes from any of the main parks. There is a shuttle bus available at no charge to Seaworld, Aquattica (water park) and Universal. The free shuttle was great; the only caveat was the schedule. The bus only picked up only 3x each morning from the hotel (8 am, 10 am, and 12 pm) and only picked up 3x each evening from Universal (5 pm, 7 pm, and 9 pm). So if you plan on leaving the parks in the middle of the day or later at night, you\u2019ll have to take a taxi for around $35-40. Another warning: Hilton Grand Vacations Club is the LAST pick up (or first depending on how you look at it), so we had to stop at 3 other hotels and 2 parks before we made it to our final destination of Universal. Overall, the ride each way took 40-45 minutes. If you are trying to meet friends for dinner plans after a day at the parks, take into account the delay. A couple of restaurants in walking distance: Outback Steakhouse and a sushi place included. We made use of the Walgreens and Publix grocery store across the street to stock our kitchen with breakfast and snack items. Due to the kitchen---stocked with pots, pans, plates/bowls, cups, silverware etc.---we were able to eat at least 1 meal in our suite each day and save some $ from eating out all the time. KID COMMENTS: My 10-year old says: \u201cMy favorite is the pools. They are better than other pools because they are kid-friendly (3 feet in most areas) and then they get really deep, so it\u2019s really fun.\u201d Worst thing about the hotel: \u201cThe movies at night because you can\u2019t go to sleep earlier than 11 pm.\u201d My 4-year old says: \u201cMy favorite thing about the hotel is sleeping and eating and playing in the room. [Note from mom: I think he liked the very large suite, as opposed to a regular small hotel room.] I liked going swimming. I liked looking for lizards.\u201d Worst thing: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the waterfall.\u201d OVERALL: The hotel was very responsive to our needs. The property and suite were beautiful. There was so much that we didn\u2019t even have time to do.

They do have sandwiches, salads, and also they sell whatever you are missing at your appartment. The smaller pool has also a bar but it closes earlier than the main pool. At that smaller pool you also have an express pizza hut which is also great. Staff are amazing. We never missed on anything.

We were led to the check-in desk, where everything was as smooth as silk. We were on time for check-in...exactly 4pm. I expected a line, but there was none. We were directed to our suite...a 2 bedroom lock-off. I didn't understand the concept at the time of booking, but it is a 1 bedroom suite attached to a studio. This was slightly difficult for us as we have children of the opposite sex. Our daughter got the studio and our son slept on a pull out sofa in our room. Not great, but no complaints. My husband and I lacked some privacy, sharing a bathroom with our son, but it's not like we don't share at home. They do have conventional 2 BR condos on site, but none were available at the time. No big deal for us. HGVC leaves nothing to chance, every detail is covered. Kitchen supplies, toiletries, etc. The only thing missing during our stay was salt and pepper. Shakers in the units would be a nice touch. The only other suggestion I would have for the resort is placing a small teak bench in the master bedroom shower. It is massive, but there is nowhere for a lady to place her foot during shaving...a critical need for swimsuit weather! The grounds, furnishings and buildings were immaculate. Housekeeping was excellent, the room beautifully reset each time we left. Our only issue was that they only left decaf coffee for us, even after we left notes requesting regular. After speaking with some of the staff, it became apparent that English was not their primary language, so our notes may not have been understood. Certainly we could have gone to the front desk if it really bothered us, but it didn't. EVERY staff member we happened across welcomed us to their resort and asked us to enjoy our stay. The pools were very nice, complete with hot tubs. There were always plenty of towels available, even for a late night swim after returning from the park. I read on this site about the construction going on behind the resort, but it was never a problem for us. In fact, it was a bonus because we enjoyed some beautiful sunsets from the screened porch. The picture is blurry because of the screen, but you'll get the idea. We attended the required presentation, which was done very well by Sean. It felt somewhat like a car dealership, but not too much pressure. I wish we had this information 10 years ago, as Hilton's point system is far superior to the traditional time-share week system.

Wait for the elevator was less than 1 minute.(After reading previous reviews regarding longer waits, perhaps it was a busy time of year).

We ordered once from their grill and had it delivered to the room, no complaints, pineapple sorbet was great. Though the brochure in the room states that housekeeping is an additional charge, she came in daily and I incurred no additional fees. Perhaps because we were on the 7th floor but we were unable to hear any sounds from other guests. The location of the hotel was ideal as well being close to attractions yet far enough not to feel too touristy. A publix supermarket, 7-11 and outlet shopping across the road. The pool area was well kept. Towels are provided and there was a staff member making rounds if you needed anything, or would like to order from the pool bar/grill. Though we don't have children yet, the place offered many activities for children as well as adults. There is one large pool and a smaller pool I believe for children. Due to the size of the place, another pool would be great although the main pool was never too crowded. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend but only in the same building and on the same floor so you arent TOO close to the pool area which may become noisy when fully populated.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntersville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat pool, poor service\u201d", "Author": "Eduardo F", "ReviewID": "UR16153007", "Content": "Hello I stayed at this hotel as an invitation to buy the Hilton Vacation Package.

This is way too late, however, we checked in at 6pm and they gave us a totally dirty room that looked like someone was still inside of it. They changed the room, but that was the first impression and welcome at this place. - Corridors full of trash: Housekeeping clean the rooms but leave the trash on the corridors until late hours. Not a good presentation at all; - SUPER EARLY check out: Management told us that the maximum he could do is 12pm because takes time to clear the rooms, yeah right, how come mine wasn't clean at 6pm? You know that bad word BS ? That what it is. - Not much parking at this location: You have to drive around the hotel to find a spot at late hours which is way ridiculous for a Hilton hotel that is trying to sell packages. Overall experience was disappointing. I would never return or recommend this location to anyone.

I was just a tag along on vacation. Overall, the hotel is nice, with a grand entrance! Check in was very slow, which is sad in my opinion, because there was only 1 couple in front of us. One thing my husband and I could not get over was that there was plenty of staff standing around behind the check-in desk, yet only one woman was checking people in. This was frustrating, but we tried to keep an open mind. After we were finally checked in, we drove all the way around to building 7 to find our room. (yes, this hotel is super big, to big in my opinion) The property is very pretty with well maintained landscaping. However, there is major construction going on right next to it, but the noise did not bother us at all. When we got to the elevators we waited and waited and waited. We were on the 7th floor. I am being completely honest when I say these are the absolute slowest elevators I have ever ever used! ***If you stay at this hotel ask for the lowest floor possible so that you do not have to use the elevators** We had to allow 10 minutes at least for the elevator ride. Many people complained about this, not just us. You could just feel the frustraion in the air when you were riding with other people. The rooms were nicely decorated. They could have been cleaner though. We had a 1 bedroom king/studio. We like to stay in hotels that offer a kitchenette for quick morning meals. Well unfortunatley, we had to wash all of the silverware in the drawer and the bowls in the cabinet. They were clearly dirty from the previous hotel guests. The room was pretty dusty as well. You could see my husband's hand print on the top of the coffee maker, the dust was so thick. Also, I don't think they ever moved any chairs to vacuum around them. The bed and bathroom were clean, and I guess that is the main thing! The pools were nice, however with a hotel of this size, they needed more pools. The location of this hotel was o.k. The outlet mall right next to the hotel is nice, but there is a much better one up the road. We visited downtown disney about 5 minute drive away. Fun for a couple of hours. Ate at the House of Blues, terribly disappointed. Even the waiter said that the food looked bad when we addressed it. Did have some good food though at other area places. So overall, decent hotel. Need to keep rooms cleaner and have a more attentive front desk/conceriege staff. We encountered the same problems at the conceriege desk as we did the front desk. Plenty of employees, but only one person helping customers. The line was pretty long and we gave up. **Very important if you stay at this hotel, make sure you get a room on a low floor, so you can avoid the elevator*** One more thing, be prepared that this is family hotel. Many screaming kids and the walls are thin. The family next to us, had 2 kids that screamed until about 11pm every night that we were there. Just know that there are a lot kids at this property, it is not a quiet and serene type of place.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation at the HGVC!\u201d", "Author": "redward", "ReviewID": "UR15974330", "Content": "Had a wonderful one week stay at the HGVC on International Drive. Booked a two bedroom suite, which is actually two rooms -- a one bedroom plus a studio. We arrived for check-in just before 4:00 pm and were advised that our room was not ready as the hotel was unexpectedly filled to capacity, and the staff were trying to get the rooms ready ASAP. Having been on the move since 3:00 am that morning (had an early flight out of Toronto) and travelling with two young boys, we waited in the lobby until the first available room was ready. The first room we were directed to was in the building furtherest away from the main pool, on the opposite side of the small lake. The room had a view of the parking garage for the Outlet Mall next door. I called and advised that as I had booked and paid for the accomodations in full back in July, I expected to have a much nicer view than a parking garage. In less than 30 minutes, we received a call from the staff and were moved to a new room (with a much, much better view) in Building 4. The room(s) themselves were spotless and quite spacious for the four of us. The balcony with seating for four was also a nice touch (but the mornings were a little bit cool in November.) We took advantage of the full kitchen and the fact that a Publix grocery store was just a short drive away to enjoy a number of meals in our apartment. Also, the grounds were a pleasure to stroll around and the main pool was a lot of fun.

We are HGVC members so made the reservation using our points. This was our third trip to Orlando but second at a HGVC property. We stayed at the Sea World in 2004. I received a call the day before and was allowed to make some requests for rooms. Reading trip advisor I was told to avoid Building 1 (noise from pool) and Buildings 6 and 7 (because of Outlet construction). I was recommended Buildings 3 or 4. Traveling to the resort was a little difficult. We had a Garmin GPS that we brought from home and could not find the location. The Outback that people rave about also was not to be found. We tried the Premium Outlets but that took us on a wild loop. I would recommend using the Publix Market or McDonalds as the destination point. Upon arriving at the hotel around 10pm, we were told our requests were not available. The person at check in wasn't even aware of the construction noise. We ended up choosing Building 6. BTW, the walkway to the outlet are closed due to the construction so you gotta drive. The resort map does not show this nor did the check in person tell us this. For a studio, I can understand why there have been compaints about the construction. They started at like 6am EST with the jackhammers and the pounding. Thankfully, we had a one bedroom and there were two or three closed doors before the bedroom, but the noise was obvious. The HGVC- International Drive had all the amenities one would expect from an HGVC (full kitchen with frig and dishwasher, washer and dryer, jacuzzi bath, great cable tv channels, and free wi fi for internet). The internet was a little slow connecting almost every day but worked when connected. The screened in patio was similar to the Sea World HGVC. The deli shop could use some improvement. There were no magnets, no decent postcards, no HGVC logo attire. The lack of parking after 10pm is evident. NOTE: The 3rd HGVC in Orlando opening in 2009 is suppossed to have three floors of parking below each building. Overall, the ambience of the lake and swimming pools were impressive. Sort of makes you not want to leave the resort, but alas Disneyworld beckoned. The only other complaint I had was the wake up call. Every morning at 8:20am there would be a wake up call. I called the 2nd day and they showed no record of any wake up call. But it happened again the next day. Because we have a 2 year old we unplugged the phones, but before we left there was another wake up call. Quick Tips: Each building has a room with carts to carry luggage to and from the room. I believe it was located on the 1st floor. Also, the HGVC has a computer for free printing of boarding passes. Make sure to ask the lobby about the location of the computer.

What a wonderful resort. We checked in early, at 2 pm, although check in was not until 4....I was prepared to wait but was given a room without any problem.

The corner floor plan is a little different than the interior ones, from what I can tell by looking at the photos and also a floor plan that I found on a website. Walk in the front door and the bedroom is behind and to the side of the hall with access to the bathroom from the hall and from the bedroom....closet in the hall, then at the other end of the hall was the dining area and the living room, with the kitchen beyond and to the side of that. Sliding glass doors from the living room to the screened in patio. The bedroom was very comfortable and the bath was luxurious. This unit, again I'm thinking because it was a corner unit, did not have the jaccuzzi in the bedroom as the photos show....we had a double sink marble top vanity, a very large glass door shower, toilet and jaccuzzi all in one room. The kitchen was better equipped than my home kitchen and had a stacking washer and dryer behind the cabinet doors. The living room was comfortable with a nice TV with a Bose surround-sound system. We enjoyed coffee on the patio the morning we left. (coffee was much better when made with bottled water as opposed to the tap water!!) Everything was perfectly clean, I did not see anything out of place! The grounds were kept immaculate. The little deli by the main pool was good and not too expensive. The pools were beautiful and everyone, but everyone, that we encountered was friendly and helpful....from the front desk staff to the maintenance workers in their golf carts to the security guy who let my boyfriend try out his Segway. Everyone said \"Hello\", \"Good Morning\", etc. As expected, we got the call about the time share within 2 hours of check in....they just advised us that the presentation was at noon the next day...that's the last we heard of it. Housekeeping was a little slow...we left early the next morning and didn't return until 2....they had not been there....but they knocked at the door at 3 pm. We only needed some towels so it wasn't really an issue. We walked to the outlets although we had to get there via the front entrance as the construction has closed the direct walkway. As others have said, there is a Publix and a Walgreens just across the way. As much construction as there is in the area, we didn't once get disturbed by it.

Everything was very clean and the staff was friendly. We received one time-share call but refused and were never solicited again. Our 3 year old enjoyed the walking path around the lake and the covered playground. It was nice to have the supermarket within walking distance to stock up the fridge. My favorite part of the resort was our balcony overlooking the lake. It's large and screened and romantic to sit out there in the evening. My three year old loved the jacuzzi tub the best, which was big enough to be his own private swimming pool. My husband loved having a livingroom to relax in. The pull out couch was like sleeping on a bunch of broken springs but the king bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable. I loved the DVD player in the living-room.

We would leave the park on Vineyard, get on I-4 and we really had to pay attention because the exit to the parks would come up so fast.

They have a grill next to the main bar where you can get meals throughout the day and also a Pizza Hut to order from. Also there is room service available from the grill. We spent time going to the theme parks but also made time to sit by the pool and have some drinks as we weren't expecting November to be such great weather in Orlando. They offer shuttle bus services to the theme parks and these can be prepaid for to make it easy in the mornings. The concierge was so helpful getting us tickets to the Cirque Du Soliel show at Downtown Disney and also organising taxis for us.

We got a price of $99 for 3 nights total. The catch......we had to attend a \"vacation ownership\" tour. The presentation was not pushy at all and we were able to be done in 1 hour and 50 minutes. They gave us a 1 bedroom villa. It had a full kitchen, washer and dryer, king bed in it's own bedroom, pull out sofa sleeper in the living room, and a dining table with 4 chairs.

We erased them all. Just a tip, make sure you check the messages they leave daily. There are two pool areas. Both are very nice. There is a deli/sandwich/icecream shop and a poolside bar area that has a menu for cooked to order meals. One thing I thought was kind of crappy was the business center. Internet use is .10/ minute and printing is .75/ page. We decided that we wanted to stay an additional night, so we check availiblity on the internet (that we had to pay for). There were rooms available at a rate of 129.00/night. So.....we went to the front desk to book another night and were told that no rooms were available. When we confronted them about what we found on the website, they said their computer system was down at the moment and they would check for us later. Well, we went back and they all of a sudden had several rooms available. However we were quoted 189.00 and 200.00/ night. We decided that we no longer wanted to stay after being lied to. My guess is that they want fresh visitors in their facility to get them to attend the timeshare presentation. I wonder what they would have done if I just booked it online at the cheaper price. I asked if they had a book of other Hilton locations and we were sent to the \"tour center area\", because they have a giant book of all Hilton locations with numbers and addresses. Well, when we walked over there to ask to see the book, they had no idea about a book and asked who sent us over there. What a crock!!

This construction site faces the back of buildings 5, 6 and 7 which you will hear and see if you stay there. It is a large construction site which starts on the right hand side of the main entrance and stretches down the length of the resort. Tell the resort that you know about the construction and that you want to be away from it, so try to stay on the opposite side of the lake where it will quieter. There is however construction work on the lake itself as there is a bridge under construction across it, although this was relatively minor in comparison and not as noisy. We were going to stay in the 'Floridays' Resort but decided not to because of construction in the area.....we were rather suprised to face the same issue when we arrived at the HGV Resort. Still with us...........still interested..........? We had arrived by taxi from the Disney Cruise terminal in Port Canveral with the fare showing $220 on the meter, but as the driver could not find the resort (she was not the only taxi driver who had trouble locating it, so if you do stay here, take some directions for the taxi driver) she accepted the only offer I was going to make of $150. There a number of HGV'S around the area and so the taxi may indeed take you to the wrong one...it happened to us twice. We arrived in HGV after two weeks of Disney (Resort + Cruise) so where a bit Disney weary at this stage and were looking for a quiet resort where we could relax by the pool and chill out, whilst slotting in Universal, Sea World, Cape Canaveral and some shopping in what would we planned to be an unhurried week sipping Pina Coladas. Arrival was smooth, with some valued assistance from the courteous and welcoming doorman who broughts our bags inside and stored them whilst we made our prescence known at reception. We had arrived some 6 hours before normal check in time, and so lazed by the pool for most of the day with the kids having a great time in the fenced off pool area and hot tubs. After 4pm we went back to reception to formally check in and get our room key and were taken to building 5. On the golf cart trip to the buliding, one look at the construction site (big enough to build a football field !) filled us with some trepidation. The room itself was great and for $165 per night...unbelievable value (see all the candid pictures). The location however was awful. Our balcony directly faced the multi storey car park for the Premium Outlets shopping mall, as well as the builidng car park. It was perhaps the worst room location on the resort. This was not acceptable, and we had to move and so we called reception to which the stern response was a 'not possible' until tomorrow. At this stage, we were looking at the yellow pages for an alternative hotel. Meantime, Brad, the bell boy who had escorted us to the room, went to get us some drinks and to see if he could assist us. He came back with an alternative room, and we went to see it, which was on the ground floor of building 2 facing the lake and closer to the man amenities. Much better ! Brad made us feel welcome and went out his way to help us (Thanks Brad !). Little did we know that this would be the most positive and helpful interaction with hotel staff we would experience in the next 7 days. Whilst unpacking, the front door opened and another family started to enter, who had onbviously checked in at about the time we had moved rooms and been given keys to the room. The next thing we know, the phone rings with reception asking us who we are and what we are doing there in a very accusational tone. Time for the yellow pages again....... We left it some time before we actually unpacked and made up the double sofa bed. We had to bother housekeepoing to bring correct bedding ( and it felt like we were bothering them such was the huffy response when we asked for bedding to sleep under), but aprt from that we had a quiet first night...pizza....from the onsite Pizza Hut Express. It was too late for anything else. ROOM ? - The room was very nicely fitted (a bit smelly...ground floor...damp ?) with comfortable beds, two TV's, kitchen, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher etc. Could not fault the room/suite. LOCATION ? - On the resort itself see my initial comments if you are staying for any length of time. The resort location is at the bottom end of International Drive and 'walking across the road' distance to an excellent supermarket (Publix) and Premium Outlets shopping mall. Disney Downtown is not too far by cab. There is a lot of construction on other resorts in this undeveloped part of ID but apart from looking unsightly when passing, does not affect you. It is not surrounded by eateries that you can walk to. HOW DO I GET AROUND ? - Hotel shuttle bus to Universal,Disney and Sea World. These are to a fixed timetable which ultimately did not suit us. Taxis. I-Trolley bus whic goes up and down International Drive, although we did not use it. DO YOU NEED A CAR ? - In the end we hired a car so we could have the flexibility to come and go at the amusement parks at times we (the kids) wanted, as well as try some different food spots around the area, and to prevent what could be a $60/day taxi habit to and from various places and restaurants. The GPS we paid for with the car was great and recommended. THE RESORT ? - Room - Great Pool - Nice...I would expect some sun lounger reserving goes on in busier and on warmer days. There were some serious sun worshippers you do not want to steal their lounger from. Eating - No restaurant but good casual food from the open air bar menu. The Deli had some basic provisions as well as good coffee and a nice atmosphere. Getting about - Some accommodation buildings are far away from the main amenity blocks, and with the construction on the go preventing you being able to walk all around the resort, it may take you some time to walk there for your Starbucks coffee and muffing in the moring from the Deli which was great. Not great if your not too mobile and hate walking. Kid's Activities - There is an advertised program, but at this time of year, not very well attended or lively (no kids !!) and of no comparison to what Disney were offering on the cruise, so we did not really use this. Customer service - Left a lot to be desired and was our biggest headache on a daily basis, with some rather questionable, unfriendly, unwelcoming at times, exchanges with reception staff. As one other reviewer has stated.....an apology here and there goes a long way when a guest is inconvenineced or has a legitimate gripe. One example being that the resort had us checking out 2 days before we were actually due to check out (the bill hanging on the door with the daily paper being a subtle reminder), requiring a visit to reception to sort this out before I could even shower and have a coffee. On another occassion, they seemed to have lost my credit card details and so they had sent a very stern letter under the door saying that my room key would be deactivated unless I immediately went to reception to corrected this matter. Another trip to reception first thing in the morning. There are ways and means of dealing with problems and perhaps this resort needs to go back to basics on this. This resort perhaps does not know if it is a hotel or a collection of high rise condo buildings, that happens to provide a few basic amenities just to keep you sweet for all that money you have put into your timeshare. The symptom of this identity crisis could well be the complacent/unwelcoming type of customer service experienced by those who have the audacity to pay a nightly rate for our suites. We would not stay here again in the foreseeable future due to the construction work, which does impact on the resort, and the poor customer service experience we had. Lots of other resorts in this area of International Drive have construction around them so be careful....the web sites may or may not tell you about this. Overall we had a great time in Orlando and Florida. The weather did us no favours during our stay, so trips to Florida Mall, after having done all the parks that we could manage, in our now essential hired car were a welcome break. If you do go to Florida Mall for a major shopping spree, you have to eat in the Nordstrom department store Bistro. The food is out of this Orlando world. Real food !!! Another good eatery was Taverna Ola, a Greek restaurant further up at International Drive. Alternativey, there's always Denny's or enough steakhouses/fast food joints to keep you energised.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Weekend at the Hilton on International Drive!\u201d", "Author": "chancetravel44", "ReviewID": "UR12635736", "Content": "I just got back from running the Disney marathon in Orlando and my boyfriend and I stayed at the Hilton on International Drive and make a weekend out of it.

I would agree with one of other review: \"Disappointing aspect was terrible customer service. Without going into all the boring details, the staff repeatedly said all the things they'd been trained to say (empathizing with customer etc ...) but repeatedly failed to deliver the actions we'd agreed. \" The service was terrible, I had an impression, that they just do not care. If you are staying in the building not near the WaterFall pull, you have to take a little walk (depending on where your building is located) we stayed at Smith building and it took us 5 minutes walk to get to the main lobby. They do have a golf carts picking up people, but you have to call to the hotel front desk and even so they tell you the guy is on its way, usually you wait for them minimum 10 minutes, so might as well just walk to the main lobby. It is not a problem to get to the building from the main lobby there was always somebody available to pick us up. Perhaps they have only one guy riding and picking up people. The shuttle service to attractions is limited and I think that the drivers do not care so as the hotel employees, the drivers were late all the time at the first point of destination . Usually when you take the shuttle the bus driver is giving you a little tour of the city (from my experience staying at other Orlando hotels), nothing like that here, but the huge sign on the front window \"re tips\" is there :) I would not recommend use the taxi service from the hotel, I got impression that they use some transportation for hire, which is more expensive that local taxi service. For example, the driver gave us the rate to Arabian Nights show one way as $45 v local taxi service $17.00. The deli shop was terrible, and very small for such a big resort. Go to the grocery store and fill out your fridge because the food quality and selection at the deli shop is very poor. If you forgot a swimming suite you will not be able to buy it in the hotel, there is no gift shop, but the deli shop sells some t-shirts. There is no food room service, you can order pizza only, but at the extension numbers provided nobody answers the phone (I guess they are too busy) Not a big deal, we ordered pizza online, this is only the one good thing that they provide wireless connection at the hotel free, you just need to have your laptop with you. There is only one restaurant, the breakfast buffet at the restaurant was ok, the dinner I did not like. I will not come back again to this place and would not recommend it to my friends.

Before we even had our luggage upstairs, we got a call from the timeshare salespeople, asking if we would like to take a tour in exchange for a discount on Disney Tickets. When I asked the price, I discovered it was more than we can get them for by buying a multi day pass. I declined, and thankfully, never heard from them again. The unit was lovely. Everything we needed as far as utensils and start up soaps and detergents were there. Luckily there is a Publix Market grocery directly across the street. There is also a 24 hour Walgreens drug store, and an emergency medical clinic a few blocks away. The pool areas magnificent. There are gas and charcoal grills available, so you can have a BBQ, if you wish. A very nice children's playground, which is covered from the sun is a nice treat for the kids. My only complaints are that although it is a \"non-smoking\" facility, people sneak their cigs. in the bathrooms, apparently, as the bathroom reeked of smoke, from either above or below. It was more than just a whiff...very strong. When I called the desk, the receptionist stated that someone in a room near ours is probably smoking, but they can't go knocking on doors. This was continuous, and annoying. It even affected the smell of the bath towels. Maid service is provided halfway through your stay. You can keep ordering new bath towels, but they don't take the old ones away unless it is time for your maid service. Luckily, the giant jacuzzi was sufficient to hold all the dirty towels. When you are having a family reunion, and visiting the parks all day, who has time for a leasurely soak, anyway? There is a back gate on the property that leads to a large outlet mall, which is open til 11 p.m. A car is a must here, as the property is so large, it's a long walk to the grocery store.

We were very happy with this resort. The main pool is wonderful and they have waitresses that will deliver drinks right to you while you are laying out (very nice). They also serve food at the pool bar as well. There is a small deli on site also which makes very nice sandwiches. Of course the deli and bar are a little pricey, but that is the cost of the convenience of it. There is also a second bar (between bldg 4 and 5) which is much smaller, but also includes a bar. We used both pools on different days and neither were very busy. We stayed in bldg 6 which had its positive and negative points. Building 6 is located on the other side of the lake from the lobby and main pool, so it was a little walk to get to those amenitites. On the other side we had a little gate right outside of the building which could only be opened with your condo key and it brought you right to the Premium Outlets. If you are staying here don't bother going to the Prime outlets since they are under construction and right now the Premium Outlets are much better. There is also a small food court located at the Premium Outlets and except for Sunday everything stays open until 11:00 pm, so it is handy for some late night shopping or a quick snack. We loved being able to go and sit out on the screened in porch and have breakfast or for calling home. The kitchen is very nicely appointed. We did not have a rental car while we were here and we were able to pick up the I Trolley and the Lynx bus right at the Premium Outlets (right out the back door). Although it takes a little while to get anywhere using either of these types of transportation it isn't really that bad. We also used the resorts transportation to Universal several times and that was very convenient. I was disappointed though that you actually have to pay for the shuttle to Disney even though it is just as close. We only went to Disney one day and we ended up paying for a taxi since it was about the same price as the shuttle and we could come and go as we wanted to rather than having to stick to the shuttle times. Truthfully I am glad that we didn't have a rental car becuase the parking seemed awful at this resort. Every night we came back there were no spots outside of our building and people were usually squeezed into spots that weren't actual parking spots. If you are planning on some down time (lounging by the pool) then this would be a great place to stay.

After a quick & easy check-in we were allocated a 2-bed appartment. This was actually a 1 bed appartment joined to a studio appartment. The appartment was terrific, clean and spacious with almost everything you could want. The only things we would have liked were an English tea-pot & an electric kettle. Why do American timeshares never provide a tea-pot ? The bathrooms are spacious, with granite counters. Plenty of white towels & Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. Unfortunately the maid had a habit of removing partially used toiletries and not replacing them with new. The same applied to the kitchen supplies. So, we had to keep asking for new supplies. These were delivered promptly to the appartment. The only bad thing about the appartment was that the air-con kept coming on at 2am which disturbed us as it was noisy & draughty. You can only switch the room thermostat on/off, you can't actually control the air-con. We were initially given a ground floor appartment adapted for handicapped people. We don't know why as we are both young & able-bodied ! We complained & we were given a much nicer appartment on the 7th floor of block 6. Also on floor 7 we noticed a woman in a wheelchair struggling to use the lift ! Very strange ! The view from our appartment was lovely as it overlooked the lake & fountain. There is building work taking place on site, right next door to building 6 so we also had a good view of the construction site. While we were there the exterior of the new building was being painted & the interior fitted out. The workmen arrived at 7am every morning and it was noisy & there was a strong smell of diesel fuel. If you like to sleep late don't stay in building 6. It didn't bother us too much as we were always awake by 7am & we were out all day. The site has 2 pools. We used the smaller one as it was nearer our block & it was nice & quiet, apart from the dreadful piped music ! There are also 2 gyms. I used the larger one regularly. The equipment was good quality & clean. There were towels & water too. Unfortunately there was no music to work out to, only 2 TVs. There were no free weights either, only machines. The appartment blocks are built around a lake and there is a nice walking path around it. It only takes about 8 mins if that to walk from the furthest block (No. 6) to reception/gym/main pool. It's hardly a long walk ! Even quicker if you run ! It's a very attractive site & the landscaping is lovely. Although the resort is on I-Drive, it's at the quiet southern end. The Publix supermarket is just across the road (Vineland Ave) and you could easily walk to it if you wanted. Premium Outlets was also next door to the resort & easily accessible via a secure gate. Excellent Thai restaurant nearby too. The resort was very quiet at night which was good apart from one night when we arrived back to find 6 police cars, an ambulance & a fire engine outside our block ! A \"domestic\" incident, apparently ! All the staff at the resort were friendly, helpful & courteous. We received one phone call asking if we were interested in buying timeshare. We said no & we were never bothered again. There is lots to see in the area apart from the theme parks. Visit Winter Park with it's lovely shopping streets, cafes, fabulous homes & Rollins College. There is also a boat tour of 3 lakes. Also worth visiting are Windermere with it's magnificent houses; Florida Mall; Millenia Mall; Prime, Premium & Lake Buena Vista Outlets; Cypress Gardens; Harry P Leu Gardens in downtown Orlando; Silver Springs & Blue Springs State Parks; the town of Cocoa; Merritt Island & it's mall.

There was a dinig area with a large table and six chars, or you could sit at the table with four chars on the screened balcony overlooking the lake. the balcony was screened, which helped our peace of mind with a very active 3 year old. The room also had a washer/dryer, complete with a single-use box of Tide. The only aspect of the room that I didn't like was the size of the closet. It wasn't small, but compared with the rest of the suite, it wasn't impressive. The location is great. It is about 2-3 miles from the entrance to Disney, and a short drive up International drive to Sea World. There is a very nice Publix grocery store right across the street where we bought our breakfast stuff. There is a market/deli on the property that we didn't use. The pool areas are nice. The main pool is huge. My son liked the smaller pool at the back of the property best. It had a zero entry and lions heads statues that \"spit\" water into the pool. Both pools had bars, but only the bar at the main pol was open since we were there in late September. We were told that maid service was not included except on the third day of a seven night stay, but we had maid service each day of our 3 night stay. We were hit with the sales pitch phone call soon after arriving, but my husband told them we weren't interested and they didn't bother us again after that. This is a HUGE resort with lots of amenities. I don't know what it's like during the peak season, but our experience was super.

The activity schedule for the children and activities, the ice cream sundaes at the pool, the furnishings at the pool and bar were top notch! I can go on and on, I cannot see anyone giving this property anything less than a 5 star rating. What else could you ask for? We were not badgered about listening to any timesharing pitches. We were contacted and asked to attend a presentation and we kindly declined and were not bothered again. I mean, I am not going to rant about being contacted, these folk have a job to do and they took \"no\" for an answer very well and left us alone thereafter.

I finally decided on this one because it seemed to have everything I wanted. I am so glad I'm so anal about these things because the hotel was really exceptional and we had a blast! It was within 5 minutes or less of the parks, right next door to an outlet mall, tons of restaurants close by, and it had easy to access the highway and International Drive. The resort itself was beautiful. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite for 8 days for just over $1100.00. That works out to only about $137 a night. WHAT A BARGAIN! I got the rate by calling Hilton directly and got a non-refundable rate. We had a big comfortable bed with tons of pillows and new linens, washer and dryer with detergent, fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, glasses, utensils, everything), a whirlpool tub big enough for 3+ people, two televisions with surround sound, and beautiful view from our fully enclosed balcony. Housekeeping was unbelievable. They even did our dirty dishes! We always had fresh clean towels, a clean bathtub, and a clean kitchen. It was really like a home away from home, but with your own maid. You really dont even have to leave the resort to have fun. They had two pools- our room looked over the quiet pool (Villa Teodoro), a restaurant, pay to rent movies, a cafe with fresh coffee, pastries and bread, a library with board games, a couple bars, poolside food and snacks, and an 'animal encounter'. (Which, for me, was the highlight of all the amenities.) You also get complimentary photos with your stay done by a 'professional' photographer. She was very rude, mostly jealousy I think. ha! Despite the need for her to get over herself, the photos turned out great- we took the two free ones and bought a couple extra. The resort as I said before is very well situated. I do NOT recommend taking the bus or relying on Disney's transportation system (which is always crowded and always took forever.) I felt bad for some of the little kids I saw waiting for the Disney bus/tram. They looked hot, tired, and uncomfortable. It is not impossible to get around without your own car (restaurants and grocery store right across the street, and bus stop right outside the main gates) but it was a HUGE advantage having our own rental car. With the car we could eat where we wanted, explore, and grocery shop for snacks. We rented an economy (a Turcel? Something I had never heard of) through Budget and were upgraded to a Pontiac Grand Prix. I map quested directions to the Disney parks, Universal, and the beach before leaving home. I found it was easier though, to leave the resort going left past the outlets until you get to International Drive (not the busy part at all) and go right until you see a Disney World entrance on your left. This road will take you to all the Disney hotels and parks. There are a ton of signs so its easy to navigate even if your not a Magellan, like my dear boyfriend. ;) We didnt get lost once. (Thanks to me!) Mapquest suggested we get on the highway- which I found to be more confusing than going down my 'secret passage road'. Like I said before, it only took about 5 minutes to get the Disney entrance, which was awesome. Discovery Cove and Universal are easy to get to as well and didnt ever seem to take us a long time. Maybe ten mins tops. Tip: We got a AAA parking pass, which lets you park in 'special' reserved spots at most parks. They never asked to see ours and told us just to \"follow the green line\", which also led to more parking that for some reason everyone wasn't allowed to park in. (Even though it wasnt full.) We never parked far from the main gates at any park by doing this. At one park- there was no parking attendant so we just drove around the cones, followed the green line and parked in AAA parking. We are big travelers but hardly ever find a hotel that we love enough to stay in again. For this hotel, we will make an exception.

Upon arrival, we were all pleasantly surprised at the appearance of of the resort/hotel. I say hotel, but I think these HGVC properties are created to be sold as timeshares. I'm not sure how all that works but we were solicited in our room with several calls from management to attend a 90 minute orientation meeting (free breakfast or lunch included) to listen to their presentation. I wasn't interested in that and politely declined. They were not quick to give up but didn't pressure us too much. I declined to answer the phone when it rang during the next couple days assuming that they were trying to rope us in again and figuring our friends and relatives all knew to call us on our cell phones. LOCATION: EXCELLENT - Just off of I4 at exit #68 the hotel is about 10 minutes from Disney, Sea World, Universal Studios and other attractions. We had a rental car and found it super easy to get to Disney from the hotel. Sea World and Universal Studios would have been just as easy to get to as well. From the Orlando/ Sanford airport it took about 45 minutes to get to the property and about and hour getting back to the airport during heavier morning traffic. HOTEL EXTERIOR: EXCELLENT - 7 Mediterranean styled buildings (each 7 stories high) surround a small lake. Landscaping and 2 pool areas were first rate. A sidewalk wraps around the lake behind all the buildings allowing you to easily walk to anywhere on the property. HOTEL INTERIOR: VERY NICE - The rooms are decorated more traditionally than our taste would prefer but they were well done including granite counters in the kitchen and bathroom which also had a large Jacuzzi tub. Nice porch area that is totally screened in which I liked since it kept bugs out. Every room space appeared to have a similar screened in porch. POOL AREA(S): EXCELLENT - There is a large pool area nestled between building 1 and the lobby area. The pool area is beautifully landscaped and seemed to have plenty of chairs towels and space - never seeming too crowded. There is also an open bar/cafe area at this pool where you can order drinks and food. We ordered food here one night while watching the outdoor pool movie (shown twice a week). Food was very mediocre but hey, it was convenient. There are also 2 nice hot tubs in the large pool area. We did not spend time at the smaller pool area which is located at the end of the lake with building 4 on the one end and building 5 at the other. It was equally well done but quite a bit smaller and less grandiose. There is a little Pizza Hut express at this pool. SERVICE: A FEW PROBLEMS- the first night we asked for an extra blanket and it took over an hour to get it after several calls. Other than that, there were a few minor glitches but nothing major. All hotel employees appeared friendly and professional. Maid service was good. OTHER: There is a new strip center with a Publix Grocery right across from the entrance to the HGVC which was convenient for getting groceries - also Walgreens in same center. International Drive is just down from the HGVC entrance and there are many restaurants and shopping areas on this road which can get congested at prime times. Unfortunately, most all the restaurants are typical chain restaurants so you're not likely to find any great new dining experiences. There is also a new upscale outlet center (?) which can easily be seen from I4 right behind the HGVC property. OVERALL: GREAT CHOICE - We were very happy with our stay here. Even the one bedroom condo (or whatever they are) was sizable and comfortable for a family.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa in building 4. I think it is called Teodora or something similar. (Room 4411). We had a great experience, and would highly recommend this hotel. Accommodations: The room was great. It was 1 bedroom with a full kitchen, 1 bathroom that had a shower stall and double sinks. The bathroom had Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries, and there were plenty of towels. There was a HUGE whirlpool tub in the little room between the bathroom and the bedroom. There was also a large fully screened porch with a table and 4 chairs. It was accessible from the living room and the bedroom. We had a great view of the \u201clake\u201d and the laguna pool. The living room furniture and bed was comfortable. There is a TV with a DVD player in the living room and a TV in the bedroom. There is a washer/dryer as well as a safe. The kitchen had everything you needed, including a toaster and blender. They provided a couple of dishwasher soap packets, a little sponge and small dish liquid, and a single use TIDE box for the washer. We didn\u2019t use the TIDE until the last day, so I am not sure if they would have replaced it or not. Housekeeping was good, but we didn\u2019t get service on the second day. I think they may have come later than normal and we had the Do Not Disturb on the door. Otherwise they always had the place cleaned by noon. Our sons feet did get really dirty one day, I think it was from the porch. Recreation / Activities: There is a main large pool and a smaller pool. There is a hot tub near the smaller pool, and 2 hot tubs at the larger. The smaller pool was right near our unit, and was great for our son because it was a zero entry pool with a maximum depth of around 4 feet. He loved the pool, and it was never too crowded. There was \u201cswim noodles\u201d around the pool that could be used for free. They had plenty of towels and chairs. There are restrooms and a bar at both pools. At the main pool they have a hut that sells snacks and some sundries. At the main pool, they also have \u201cfountains\u201d for kids to run through and play in. Our Son also loved this. The bar at the main pool is large and also serves food. They have 3 small charcoal grills that can be used. They sell charcoal in the deli/market shop. They have a playground area that was nice and covered by a tent/canopy, which was good to be in the shade. It has slides and things to climb on, but no swings. It sits on a nice \u201cpadded\u201d floor for safety, and there are benches for the parents to sit on. There are also planned activities every day. They were mostly for kids older than our Son and some for adults, but there was a \u201ctoddler activity\u201d for children 5 and under the one day. We attended and our son had a lot of fun creating a visor with glued on foam animals. There are 2 pool tables in the \u201cactive\u201d lounge, and a ping pong table by the main pool. The pool tables are free. For the ping pong table, you had to buy a ball for 25 cents from a vending machine. Dining: There is a Pizza Hutt Express located on the property. We went there once. It was a little pricey but convenient. You can order ahead for pickup. I believe they will deliver to your room, but I am not sure about that. The Bar at the main pool serves food, but we didn\u2019t eat there so I can\u2019t comment on that. The Deli/Market has various items that a small convenience store would have, and they serve Starbucks coffee. They also make some sandwiches and have fresh pastries, cookies etc for sale. The muffins and cookies are VERY good. We had gotten \u201ccontinental\u201d breakfast as part of a BounceBack vacation special. You get coupons good for 2 bagels or muffins, 2 Coffees, and 2 Orange Juices (Small Tropicana bottles). If you purchased these items it would be about $10, so consider that when comparing the cost of booking a regular room, versus a room that includes the breakfast. Location: You are a short distance to Disney, Universal, Sea World etc. There is a Publix supermarket across the street and restaurants all within short distances. They are also building a 7-11 across the street. You are also about 2.5 miles from I-4. There is a premium outlet right next store. The hotel provides a sheet with driving directions to the major attractions, as well as to a Super Target and some other shopping choices. General: Check-In was quick and smooth. Everyone who worked at the hotel was extremely friendly. We got a call a couple of hours after checking in to verify everything was ok with the room. During the trip we got one call about attending a presentation about a new resort they are building. They were offering a free breakfast, and either $150 or 20,000 Honor Points to attend the 90 minute presentation. We declined because it would be difficult with our 2.5 year old. They understood and that was it, no high pressure or anything.

The alarm clock/cd radio was not working properly so we just turned it off. The bedroom has access to the balcony as well as from the living room. The balcony is a full length net so no bugs can get in. It has a wonderful view of the lake. We stayed on building 6 which is next to the construction of building 7, but we couldnt hear ANY construction noise. We liked that it had a door that led out to the Premier Outlet Mall without requiring us to drive. It worked great for us. We like having the Publix, Walgreens, McDonalds, Outback and Tokyo Sushi just across the road from the Resort. The Outlet Mall has a food court with numerous food choices and a Starbucks. The hotel Deli has a Starbucks too just a short walk away. The resort has a Pizza Hut by the small pool. Overall the resort is a great vacation place for both adults and children. My only complaint is that the carpet was not quite clean. My 11 month all loves to crawl but he ended up nasty with black knees and hands just from the carpet. We had to restrain him from crawling to keep him from getting soo dirty.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "McKRy", "ReviewID": "UR7636187", "Content": "We just got back from a week at this hotel, it was really nice!

We booked a suite for our theme park holiday because as vegetarians with children who are fussy eaters we needed a full kitchen I also wanted to avoid car hire for at least some of the holiday and so the free shuttles to Seaworld and Universal studios were perfect - though they could have been more frequent (if you missed the 8am bus you had to wait until 10am for the next one) Having said that after a couple of days of full on theme parking 10 am is quite early enough) I thought $12 per person for the shuttle to Disney was a bit steep so we hired a car for those days. I loved the room with insect screened balcony - cleaned every day and really spacious for our family of 4. The 2 pools were both beautifully landscaped and you could hire floats from the pool tower for your children to play with. The pool bar was quite dear for alcohol but I liked the food (whiuch was reasonably priced) and there was even more than 1 veggie option! Having the pizza hut express on site was useful. I was very happy with the location. Very central to the parks and opposite a supermarket, pharmacy and chinese restaurant. We even had our own gate to access the Orlando premium outlet Mall next door. An added bonus was the activities the hotel laid on every day from 11am. My daughter loved the animal encounter hour when she saw an alligater, iguana and sloth to name but a few. All in all our stay was FANTASTIC.

We needed a place to stay both before and after the cruise. After a bit of research and checking into prices, I saw the reviews posted for the Hilton International Drive. I was able to book directly through Hilton and even received a AAA discount by calling them instead of booking on the Grand Vacations web site. We found the accomodations to be much more reasonable than the price of the hotel rooms during the same time. We would have also had to have booked two hotel rooms versus one two-bedroom suite at the Hilton. The rooms were what we expected. The furniture was very nice. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. Both units we were in were quiet. Both kitchens were well stocked with everything we needed. It was great having a place to store my daughter's milk and snacks. We picked up a few items at the Publix across the street to keep in the kitchen. The dining area was large and very comfortable. It was nice to be able to sit and have a snack together. The living area and bedrooms were all nice and large. Much larger than just having a regular hotel room. My daughter was able to sit and play. She could take a nap in one of the bedrooms while we relaxed in the living area or out on the screened porch area. The room we had before the cruise was in excellent condition and spotless. The room after the cruise was nice, but the carpet was worn in a spot and, to my surprise, I think the maid had forgotten to dust...probably for a while. There was quite a bit of dust on the tables and lamps. We wiped it up, then moved on. The best feature was the porch off of the living area. It was screened in and had very comfortable outdoor furniture. We were able to sit out there and relax in the mornings and in the evenings. There is a cafe on the property. My husband woke up every morning and headed to the cafe to pick-up coffee for all of us to enjoy on the balcony. The pools were beautiful and immaculate. We never had a problem finding five chairs together. The poolside food service was excellent, too. There was a small covered playground area for the kids. It was a great place for our two year old to have some kid time. The business center looked O.K. I tried to print out some directions using my laptop there. The connection to their machine was bent and I was unable to use my laptop. Then I was told that the printer doesn't always work, so don't rely on using it. We left without the directions. We only received one phone call about attending the timeshare presentation. We declined and were never approached again. One thing I would like to mention, since this is something we had not planned for, is that check-out is at 10am. The outlet mall is right next the the hotel complex. It had many upscale shops. We found quite a few great items there and ended up having to purchase an extra suitcase to get everything home! All in all, I think my husband and I will now always check to see if there is a Hilton or a Hyatt vacation club wherever we are traveling. It is a much better and more comfortable way to travel, especially with children or a group. It would have cost us almost four times the price to accomodate our group into a comprable hotel, and we would not have had the kitchen, dining area, outdoor area, or a big living area. I am pretty sure we would have been fighting for chairs at a hotel pool, too.

Our first trip was this past summer, when we had gotten a deal through RCI. The carpets were filthly, but someone came to clean them the next day. It was our second visit that really had us raising our eyebrows. We went there in November '06 for my birthday. First, we had to wait for two hours to check in because they were \"cleaning our room.\" Yeah right!! I guess it was cleaned by a blind person! Second, (this is the doozy one!) our 2 yr old found a sex toy beside the nightstand and bed!! She walked out into the living room with it to show us. I must have scrubbed her hands for an hour! Third, there were huge roaches in the closet of the master bedroom, YUCK! Well, needless to say, after the sex toy was found they could hardly talk at the front desk. In return, they gave us a two night comp stay for us to use at another time. Well, here we our now for our third visit in March 2007 for our daughter's birthday. Again, the carpets were filthy, countertops dirty, missing dishware in kitchen, but I'll save the best for last. On the first night I woke up around 3 AM to get a drink. I flipped on the lights in the kitchen and TWO HUGE PALMETTO BUG ROACHES crawling across the counters! It took everything I had in me not to scream and wake up our daughter. It took my husband and I 30 min. to kill those damn things. I called the front desk shortly after and was told, \"oh, how disgusting. I'll send someone to clean and spray for bugs tommorow around 11 AM.\" Did anyone show up at 11 AM,..... NO! I called the front desk and was treated like it was no big deal. Someone finally showed up later to clean our place. They also sprayed the entire unit which I asked them to only spray the kitchen and entry. I didn't want our little girl breathing that crap in. But from the response of the front desk, I guess they're accustomed to roaches everywhere. It's a shame. The resort on the outside is gorgeous. I guess we learned a big lesson in \"it's what's on the inside that counts.\" Sadly, from other magazines and whatnot, I've noticed a lot of other people complaining about all sorts of Hilton resorts.

I got a great room rate of $133 on the Hilton website and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. This hotel is Tuscan styled and just over a year old. There are 7 condo like buildings arranged around a center lake and two swimming pools. All rooms are studios, 1 or 2 bedroom suites and feature king size beds. THERE ARE NO TWO BEDDED ROOMS--ONLY KINGS!!!! All rooms feature the Hilton Suite Dream Serta mattress along with a wet bar, small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, safe, 27'' TV with cable, DVD player and free high speed wireless internet.

The bathroom is nice sized and has a large granite counter top surface for all your stuff. Towels are plentiful, soft and fluffy. All rooms have a screened in balcony or porch with a table and chairs. Rooms also have a ceiling fan and thermostat to control the temperature. There are 2 pools and 2 hot tubs that are great! There is one restaurant on-site (Tuscano Bar & Grill) and is at the main pool. it stops serving food at 10:00 PM so if you arrive later in the evening, get something to eat before you settle into your room for the night. The food is good and is reasonably priced considering it is Orlando. There is also a little shop that sells snacks, beverages, coffee, etc. The prices are a little high. I would suggest going to the Walgreen's or CVS down the street and stocking up on snacks and water to keep in your room fridge. This hotel complex is adjacent to the Orlando Premium Outlet and is accessible to hotel guests via a short walk across the parking lot. There is a security gate separating the hotel from the outlet and you MUST use your hotel key to enter or exit. My only complaint about this hotel is that if you have a parking lot facing room, you have to walk around the buildings to access the interior hotel grounds. Also, there is no free shuttle to Disney parks from this hotel. There is a shuttle service which costs $12 per person and reservations have to be made in advance. The first shuttle leaves after the parks open which doesn't work if you want to beat the morning crowds. You're better off taking a cab directly to the Disney parks which will set you back around $10-15 with tip. You can also take a cab (or drive) to Downtown Disney (just across the highway) which has free parking. You can then take a Disney bus to the park of your choice. Please note that the Disney buses don't pick up at Downtown Disney until 10 AM and it is very difficult to get a cab here before the shops open.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "OSU_Fan1967", "ReviewID": "UR7190888", "Content": "We just returned from relaxing week at this resort.

A few nights we came home around 10pm or later, and had to park quite a ways away from the building we were staying at. The hotel was nicely located right next to upscale outlets (IE Fendi, Burberry, Dior.) It was also located close to Disney World and a quick drive up Rt. 4 took us to Universal. A AAA discount made the price of the room a little more affordable, so definitely check that out if you can.

We were looking for a hotel that we would enjoy spending relaxation time at, between excursions to Universal Studios and other Orlando attractions. I was impressed by the reviews of other TripAdvisor users and the hotel's website, so we gave it a try. We were very impressed. We stayed in a king whirlpool suite. It was basically a really nice furnished apartment, and the place was immaculate. The screened patio was a great spot for breakfast and reading. My husband was impressed by the Bose sound system on the large TV in the living room. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we liked the layout that put the bedroom on the outside wall, so there was no concern about \"neighbor noise\" (although we never heard any neighbors at any time while in the room). What's more, the whirlpool was actually big enough for tall people...and to share. Outdoors, the pools and whirlpools were again immaculate and big enough so that kids and adults could all enjoy them without getting in each others' way. We took advantage of the poolside bar and dining more than once, and were impressed by the day-long schedule of children's, family, and adult activities available through their Recreation Staff each day. When we checked in, a bellman whisked us and our bags off to our building in a golf cart - a new experience for us, probably unnecessary for us but a very nice convenience for families or those with more luggage. We were not bothered by sales reps trying to get us to come to an ownership presentation - we were invited once, on checking in, and that was it (maybe we didn't appear old or wealthy enough to be their 'target audience'?). All the staff - and there were a LOT of them, were friendly and greeted us whenever we passed. We did not have a car during this trip, but that was no problem. The hotel has a shuttle service that makes a few scheduled trips to Universal Studios (free) and Disney (for a fee) each day. They also have their own driver to take you to other destinations (airport, restaurants, Downtown Disney) for the same price as a cab but with friendlier and more dependable service. Also, the hotel is on the bus and International Drive trolley lines, and within walking distance to a large grocery store and drugstore, so we had no trouble getting where we wanted to go. The only minor complaint we had is one experienced by other TripAdvisor reviewers - most of the people staffing the concierge desk were less than knowledgeable about basic questions regarding Orlando attractions - however, they were willing to investigate and find out, and eventually would find the answer for us.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "knightmvp", "ReviewID": "UR6596597", "Content": "The place is beautiful.

We vacationed at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club on International Drive from 1/1/07 - 1/8/07. We booked a one bedroom unit for $179 directly from the HIlton website. We consider ourselves \"hotel snobs\" and will only stay at a luxury property. We previously stayed at the Dolphin and Disney's Wilderness lodge. We usually check in to a hotel and have to make several room changes before we find a room we are happy with. This was the first time we opened the door to a hotel room and said, \"Wow, this is great!\" I had made my room requests when I booked the room asking for a 3rd floor room overlooking the pool and that's exactly what we got. I would have preferred it to be overlooking the main pool, but since I didn't realize there was more than one pool, I just requested \"pool\" and that's what I got. I couldn't get the main pool because the hotel was sold out. The room was gorgeous! A beautiful kitchen with granite counters, a full size refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal and all pots, pans, containers, cookware, and utensils you could possibly want. Even an icemaker int he fridge. Right off the kitchen was a washer and dryer which was wonderful.. The bathroom was large and had a glass door shower and double sink with granite counters. There was a main entrance to the bathroom and a sliding (lockable) door to the bedroom. In the bedroom there was a large, beautiful jacuzzi. Also, a king size bed, a TV, a very large closet and sliding doors to a large screened balcony that had a 4 seat patio table and a ceiling fan and light. The dining room was open to the living room and kitchen and had a large glass dining table with 5 chairs, a fancy chandelier and the living room had a pull out sofa (bed was not that comfy though) a TV, a writing desk, a chair and ottoman and a coffee table. There was also a door to the screened porch from the living room. 5 of us stayed in the room (Hilton allows 4 in this room, but never asked me upon check in how many we had). My 3 year old slept with my husband and I and my mom and 6 year old son slept on the pull out couch. We all absolutely LOVED the Hilton. It was just so spacious compared to the rooms at the Dolphin or Wilderness Lodge. Considering the Wilderness lodge is $350 a night and has less than half the space of this one bedroom suite, the Hiltom would be my FIRST choice when we return to Orlando. Everything was so luxurious and decorated so comfy. The bed was soft and had a cozy thick comforter and 5 down pillows. We had daily maid service because we rented, they told me time share owners only get service every 3 days. The house keeping was great, she even washed our dishes. I can't say too much about the hotel amenities because we left in the morning to go to the parks and were back late at night. I can say the main pool was beautiful and I'm sad we didn't get a chance to use it. There arent' many restaurants on site just a deli with sandwiches and only a few hot item choices. The hotel is within walking distance to shopping including a Publix grocery store across the street. The kitchen was wonderful because we bought groceries and had breakfast in the room every day which saved a ton of time and money.

Then catch the MEARS bus that runs every 30 minutes from the Hilton to the Disney parks.

Both nights we ended up parking near the entrance and our building was three down from the main building which, after walking all day at theme parks, was the last distance we wanted to walk.

We decided on staying at this hotel after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor. After staying at the hotel, I can say the reviews have been accurate. The propery is very, very nice and the rooms are updated. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite (2 adults, 2 children: 7 and 3 yrs) and were very happy with our choice of hotel. Pros: 1. extremely close all theme parks and restaurants. I would recommend renting a car since the hotel is located on the quieter side of International Drive. With our rental car, we were able to get to Kennedy Space Center (saw the launch of STI-116!!), Disney (~10 min) very quickly, up and down International Drive for take out, etc. Dining options are limited on the property, so a car came in very handy. 2. As mentioned, the hotel is in a quiet area of International drive. Our suite was very peaceful....no noise, very quiet at night. No issues with construction despite facing construction on the lake side. 3. Upgraded, clean suite* (see below under Cons) 4. Clean pool, quiet no loud music 5. Friendly staff*(see below under Cons) Cons: 1. The conscierge (?sp) was TERRIBLE. We called to ask how to get to Disney and the person did not know. You would expect a conscierge to know this type of information immediately or at least know how to retrieve the info. On a separate occasion, we called to ask for a recommendation for a nice restaurant for breakfast. Conscierge has no idea. Recommended Denny's...even though I asked for a nice sit down place. She made no attempt to even look up my request. Lastly, called for her opinion on a particular aJapanese restaurant and this person (same one each example) had no idea. Extremely unhelpful! I can understand a person who admits they are unaware of a restaurant, but this conscierge was rude and condescending. 2. Despite a clean suite, there were little, tinny tiny ants in our bathroom. We had the bathroom sprayed, but the ants were still present. You can hardly see the ants since they are hidden well against the background of the floor tile. Look closely...we were on the top floor in the building. Tips: 1. Rent a car 2. Housekeeping will change linens, towels, clean up every 3rd day of your stay. You can ask for daily cleaning for $30/day (1 bedroom suite). We noticed that our suite was cleaned every day, despite not asking for this option. Turns out that when you book HGVC through Expedia or Orbitz, the daily cleaning charge is added to the cost of the hotel. We were charged $149/night. I am unaware of how you can opt out of the daily cleaning charge; nevertheless, was very happy to get clean sheets and towels everyday....something so nice about coming home to a clean room after being out all day! But I suppose if you are on a budget, the $30 is a little steep. 3. Hotel does charge for a roll away bed, but no charge for a Pack n' Play 4. pack light! With a stackable washer and dryer at your disposal, you can very easily wash your clothes! In fact, my son had an accident, so I had to wash clothes...called up housekeeping and they sent up 5 boxes of Tide!! 5. eating choices limited on the property, but a mere 5 min away up International drive, there are HUNDREDS of restaurants...so many, it;s overwhelming!

I was so excited to be able to get this property after reading all of the wonderful reviews. I was not one bit disappointed. The resort was as beautiful as all of the pictures I had seen on their website & on this website. Unfortunately, the weather kept us from enjoying the ammenities to the fullest. It was quite cold during our stay. Our room in building one overlooked the main pool which was just beautiful . There are 2 hot tubs on the pool deck as well. Our two bedroom lockoff unit had not one, but 2 screened in terraces. Again, it was too cold to sit out & enjoy it. There is a children's playground that is actually covered, so that if it was a little rainy, the equiptment would stay dry. There is a basketball court also. There are many activities run by the resort for children & for adults. They did charge a fee for some, but not all of the activities . One night they had a complimentary \"wild animal encounter\". It was very informative and interesting. There was an alligator, a lemor, a baby owl, a snake & and an iguana. You got to see them all up close & even touch some them if you wanted to. Other complimentary activies included a \"Dive-In Movie\". They showed a movie on a screen at the pool at night & you could float on a raft & watch. Unfortunately, it was too cold & was moved to the \"active lounge\" while we were there. There are three lounges for the guests. There is a \"quiet lounge\" for you to sit & read if you wanted to. There was an \"active lounge\" with pool tables and a big T.V. There was also a children's lounge where 5-12 year olds could go to do crafts & play games at scheduled times. You could drop them off or stay if you wanted to. Some of the crafts had fees of about $3-$4. There is a video game room adjacent to the children's lounge. That was a bit disappointing for my boys. There were only about 5 games in there. But, they had plenty of other things to do. Dining at the resort was somewhat limited. There is a pizza hut that delivers to your room. There is also room service available from the poolside bar menu for lunch or dinner. There were things such as salads & burgers on the menu. There was a pretty well stocked market that had starbuck's coffee. They had really good muffins as well. The only thing I would have liked is somewhere to have a hot breakfast on site. However, there is everything you need to cook it yourself in the unit's kitchen if you are so inclined. That brings me to the room. We had 2 adults & 4 children in a two bedroom lockoff unit. We were all very comfortable. For those of you who don't know, a lockoff means that there are actually 2 rooms with seperate entrances with a connecting door that can be locked. One side was a one bedroom with a livingroom & a full kitchen. The other side was a studio with a partial ktchen. Both units had extremely comfortable kingsize beds & there was a pull out couch in the livingroom. The master bedroom had a huge jacuzzi just outside the entrance to a bathroom with a stall shower & double sinks. The other room had it's own full bath with a regular tub. The units are spotlessly clean & nicely decorated. Everything is top notch. The kitchen & baths have granite counter tops. There is every comfort of home & then some. The room had cordless phones & dvd players. Everything you could possibly need was in the kitchen, even a blender. There is a small washer & dryer in a closet. They give you starter packets of dishwashing detergent &, laundry detergent. They even give you a small packet of condiments & coffee for the coffee maker. Housekeeping comes in once a week, on the third day of your stay. In between, they will exchange your towels & give you extra supplies if you need them. You will see them with their carts each morning. There is a carpet sweeper, and a broom with a dustpan in the closet, as well as spunges & paper towels if you need to tidy up after meals. Most of the staff were very helpful & courteous. Everything is so well thought out though, that I hardly needed to contact them. They even give you a card when you check in with directions to & from all of the area attractions & major shopping. I had to call about a problem with the dishwasher & they came immediately. The maintenance man even fixed a broken toy for my son while he was there. The front desk followed up with a call to make sure that the problem had been taken care of. I did have one major problem while I was there and I hate to even mention it, because everything else was so perfect. My wallet was stolen while I was sitting by the pool. I think that the staff could have showed a little more concern. It took several calls to even get security to write up a report. You might take this as a sign that there aren't many security issues there. They told me that this has never happened before and that if something is missing, it always turns up. I would not let this stop me from staying at this truly wonderful resort in the future.

We did our laundry so that we were able to leave Orlando with clean clothes, watched TV (we had two so no fights over the choice of channels), and swam in the wonderful main pool.

You can actually go through a guest only access gate from the resort to the outlet though I'm not sure if it's available yet since that part of the resort is still under construction.

I was so comfortable that I was able to walk around in my bare feet which I rarely do. The staff are so accommodating and friendly. They really go out of their way to make you feel at home. The guarded entry into the resort makes me feel safe too. Parking can be a pain during the busy season, but there is parking even if it means not being able to park next to your building. The location is perfect. We didn't have to travel far from the airport. The gas stations on International Drive aren't as overpriced as those across the free way. Like I said, there's the outlet next door just in case the airline loses your luggage, restaurants are abundant, Walgreens is walking distance, and all the theme parks are close.

The staff were among the friendliest of any hotel staff I have ever interacted with and the resort is beautiful. I would definitely stay here again. Some specifics: Rooms: suite, 1 Br., 2 Br., 3Br. All are very clean, newly furnished have free wireless internet, have kitchens with stoves, refrigerators, microwaves, coffee makers and silverware / dishware. We had a problem with our phone when we arrived and it was fixed he next morning after one phone call (it would have been fixed earlier, but we got in late). Bathroom is spacious and very clean with plenty of towles. Facilities: Outstanding! This is a new complex that is still under construction, but the construction is on the other side of the lake (there's a lake in the middle of the complex -- no swimming) and we didn't hear it al all, not even during the day when we were out at the pool. The hotel is built on a Tuscan theme and the artitecture is very cool. The pool is expansive, beautiful and very child friendly...4 feet at its deepest. There's a big waterfall and several fountains that add to the character. There are also two hot tubs, a bar and pool-side waiter/waitress service. Lots of loungers, tables and chairs and all the towels you want. In addition there is a second pool that is smaller with a hot tub on the other side of the complex. There is also a coffee shop/deli that serves breakfast sandwiches, coffee, lunch sandwiches and stocks some groceries / wine as well. Workout facilities looked great. Children's activities: Great place for kids! Two nights a week they have free \"drive-in\" movies at the pool (outdoors). On a big screen they show a G or PG movie. Lots of kids watching on loungers or on floats in the water. They also have pool activities during the day such as make-your-own icecream sundaes and bingo. The sales pitch: This is a \"vacation club\" -- sort of like a timeshare, but different. In any case, those who do not own a stake in Hilton's Vacation Club will be asked to attend a sales pitch where they will try and get you to sign up. Of course, you may decline the invitation.

First, a little about the resot. In a word, GORGEOUS. The rooms are very nicely appointed with modern appliances (black kitchen appliances, Bose surround sound system for the living room TV, etc.) and furnishings, WONDERFUL down bedding, and the place is well laid out. If you think you might need to do laundry, spend the little extra if you can to get the 1 bedroom suite. It has a stack washer & dryer nicely tucked into a closet (as well as a full size kitchen rather than a kitchenette) and the convenience of it proved to be priceless at the end of the trip. We never felt as though we were at a resort, but instead felt right at home. Sitting out on the balcony in 72 degree weather, over the beautiful pool at 9pm was pure heaven. Of course, there's also the jacuzzi tub which was perfectly suited for 2 persons. It was cheesey or sleezy like some in-room jacuzzis are, it was nice and tasteful. I didn't take any pictures of the room, but I can guarantee you that what you see on teh Hilton website is EXACTLY what you get. In the room you'll find coupons for some nice freebies, including a very nice 5x7 vacation portrait, taken by the on-site photographer. We also were given at check-in coupons for free newspapers every day of our stay and 2 bottles of water. We did have a small glitch at check-in, but why complain about it, it's not like it ruined our trip. Other than that, the resort staff were excellent. Everyone was kind, helpful, and courteous. In fact, the one thing that did go wrong was the cab we called for didn't show when it was supposed to and we had a wedding to get to at the Grand Floridian. Instead of calling another cab, the Hilton staff sent one of their 2 private limo cars to drive us, at no additional charge and without us asking. Above and beyond service for sure. The location was excellent! We left home in a rush so things were forgotten but directly across the street was a full-fledged outlet mall to get in trouble with as well as a strip mall with, amongst other things, a large Publix grocery store and a Walgreens drugstore. There is an Outback Steakhouse there to I believe. About the resort sales - I had one phone call on day 2 of our stay offering us $100 or 20K Hilton Honors points in exchange for a 90 minute breakfast or brunch presentation. We were interested in exploring a timeshare option at this resort so I clearly said I'm not into high pressured sales and that if I encounter this I am walking out. As promised, when we returned to the room later in the day I found a written guarantee with the invitation stating that there would not be any high pressured sales tactics. Guess what? It was true! One last word of advice... if you have AAA, use it when you book the room. When I first looked at the rooms the rate was $175 for the full suite/apartment with large tub, kitchen & washer/dryer, and $145 for the smaller hotel-like room with kitchenette. Using AAA got rates of $130 and $103! I have seen the $103 drop to just under $100 as well, depending of course on when you go and availability.

My young son also enjoyed playing in the kid\u2019s play ground area. Several nights during the week, they even played outdoor movies at the pool. One night it was the movie, Curious George playing. The staff at the resort are all very nice. The front desk people were great. I checked in on Sunday and checked out Sunday. When I checked in at 5:00 PM there was only one other person in front of me. They initially placed me on the first floor next to the parking lot and I asked to be moved to a higher floor and they accommodated me. We were on the fourth floor in a corner facing the parking lot. It had a partial view of the lake if you look out the balcony. When we checked out at 9:45 AM there was no one in the lobby. It was the easiest check out I ever had. We had a two bedroom suite and it was of decent size. In the master bedroom there was a jet tub, but we didn\u2019t use it. In the master bathroom, we had tiny ants roaming around the edges of the counter. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance person within 15 minutes to spray the counter. The natural \u201cnon-toxic\u201d spray worked for about 2 days and the ants found another opening and came out again. This time when I made the call, it took maintenance 45 minutes to show up. These ants are kind of hard to see initially because of their small size, but once you see them, you notice them right away. The master bedroom had a king size bed and the second bedroom had 2 full size beds. Each room had its own television with many cable channels to watch. The beds were very comfortable to sleep in and the A/C worked great. The resort is also pretty quiet during the day and night. I never saw the maid, but they cleaned the unit once during our 7 day stay. The suite was clean and well maintained. There are plenty of pots and pans in the granite kitchen as well as dishes and utensils. Dishwashing detergent was provided as well as detergent for the washer and dryer combo. The washer and dryer was a plus during our 7 day trip as we did many loads of laundry. We were so busy visiting Disneyworld that we never really got to enjoy the resort. We had a rental car and drove to Disneyworld visiting the various theme parks as well as the two water parks. Downtown Disney is about a 5 to 10 minute drive depending on traffic. There is a market across the street from the resort as well as a McDonalds. There is also an outdoor outlet mall nearby, however it would be kind of far to walk if you have to carry things. To stay at this resort, I would definitely recommend a rental car to get around. Overall it was a great stay. The resort is nice and the staff is friendly.

Usually on a two-week holiday my wife starts looking forward to \"sleeping in her own bed\" about halfway through the second week. Not this time though, we really did not want to go home. We arrived late afternoon and were dealt with at reception and in to our room immediately. All of the rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. I hadn't told the wife about the double Jacuzzi tub and so that was a nice surprise for her and we used it every day. The kitchenette had everything including cooker, microwave and fridge/freezer, although we only used the coffee maker (complimentary coffee) and the icemaker. There were two large TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The living room TV was connected through a bose sound system so I was glad to have taken some CDs to listen to. The living room also opened on to a patio protected by mozzy nets (though we didn't see any mozzies) with a great view of the pool (see pics) The bedroom was spacious enough and the king-size bed was extremely comfortable. This led to the Jacuzzi tub and through to the bathroom with double sink and shower cubicle. Other features were a wash tub and dryer, iron and ironing board and digital safe. The maid service was efficient and unobtrusive. The amenities at the hotel are great. The reason I picked this hotel is because I wanted to be on i-drive and I wanted a place with a good pool and good poolside bar. Spot on. The pool was great, the bar was great (especially the mango daiquiri and the watermelon snow cones), the food at the bar was great, and the staff were the best. There was an endless supply of sunbeds and towels and the two heated Jacuzzi pools were a treat. They also have \"swim-by\" movies, giant jenga and ice-cream specials. Amazingly, we did use the gym (okay it was only once) and again it was well kept and we enjoyed the games room too. The on-site shop wasn't very well stocked but there is a foodmarket across the road although it was at no odds to us, as we didn't cook. Next to the Hilton is the Premium Outlet Mall which is good news if you are bargain hunting but bad news if you have a wife with a fondness for shoes. Right outside is the stop for the i-trolley. You'll need this, as this is a remote and quite part of i-drive. But for a dollar you can use the trolley to go anywhere on i-drive and this it what we did (we would recommend Bahama Breeze). You can also use the trolley to get to and from Sea World if you choose. The trolley claims to come every 20 minutes but we never waited more than 5. However at the busiest times when it is stopping more regularly it can take 45 minutes to get to the busiest part of i-drive, but this didn't bother us. And it only runs until 10.30pm so you'll have to do as we did and taxi back (about $20-25, reasonable by UK standards). Getting to the parks is easier as the Hilton puts on complimentary shuttles to Sea World and Universal and $10 shuttles to Disney. There were three pick up times through the morning and three return times in the afternoon/evening. We used the shuttle all the time without problem.

The pizza took an hour and 30 minutes to deliver, was lukewarm, and cost twice the normal cost of their pizza. Don't bother. I do recommend eating at their poolside dining area. This food was delicious, hot, and competitively priced.

The check in was smooth and we stayed in Building 5, Suite 5210. It was a 1 Bedroom Whirlpool Suite and was layed out perfectly. Our suite was equipped with a stove, full refrigerator, microwave, garbage disposal, washer, and dryer. They also have several kitchen utensils for cooking and eating. It was almost like being at home, but BETTER. The appliances are very modern. The countertops in both the kitchen and bathroom are done in Marble. The living room has a Bose system and TV where there is a DVD player as well. The screened in porch is NICE and the bedroom has a TV as well. The Beds are very comfortable and the seperate walk in shower was very nic. The bathroom has two sinks and lots of counter top space. The housekeeping staff is friendly and brought up anything you needed immediately after your call. They provide you with Tide laundry detergent as well to wash any of your clothing. Housekeeping kept our room full of clean fresh towels that were neatly placed. Housekeeping does come in daily to replace towels and make up the bed free of charge. Please NOTE: If you want your bathroom/kitchen cleaned etc... beyond bed making and towel chaning, this is seperately billed! It is called Tidy Clean service and begins at around 25.00 for Studio room and 35.00 for the 1 Bedroom. The staff was very nice and they bring the luggage to your room at check-in with no problem. Do not let any negative reviews scare you away from this place. The property is beautiful and you receive a complimentary photo from the resort photography of you and your family. There is a pizza hut on site and a deli as well. However, there is a 3 dollar delivery charge and 22% gratuity added to anything delivered to your room as well as sales tax. You may want to stay away from this. We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. I never experienced any problems with the elevator breaking as a previous review states from the same week.

We stayed at the All Star Movie resort in Disney for 7 nights and then we came here for three nights and after being in the tiniest room I have ever stayed in this seemed like heaven! We stayed in a one bedroom whirlpool suite with a screened in porch in building #2. When we opened the door to the suite we were so happy with our choice! It was big and clean and just what we hoped for and more. This apartment had it all! The kitchen had a full size fridge, oven, dishwasher, microwave and garbage disposal. There is a stack washer dryer in the suite also which we put to use, that was a big plus for us. The first day there we had a problem with ants, they were coming from the porch and made a line across the wall to the kitchen, they sent someone right away to spray and the problem was fixed. We were offered another room, but I already unpacked and was happy with this one. The whirlpool bath was big enough for two and very relaxing. We were 2 adults and 3 children, my oldest son slept on the sofa bed which was pretty comfortable for a sofabed! And we have twins who slept in cribs and even with the sofabed open there was still enough room in the livingroom area for the cribs. The kingsize bed was beyond comfortable! There's two closets, one is really big, but there is not much drawer space for clothes, not a big deal though. We were happy that there were 2 TV\"S one in the living room and one in the bedroom, and there is a dvd player in the livingroom. Housecleaning does a great . The pool is big and clean and the kids loved it. Not over crowded at all and there are plenty of lounge chairs and towels. They have pool toys to rent for the kids and a childrens play water fountain. There is also a bar and grill poolside and a deli. Across the street there is a Publix for food shopping and a Walgreens and also a McDonalds. We did get the timeshare phone call and it was very low pressure. And after being here we actually talked about buying a timeshare, we enjoyed it that much. We were not bothered by the construction noise at all, we heard a tiny bit of noise after 8am but it wasn't bothersome. We drove to the disney parks and it is a 10 minute drive to Magic Kingdom from the hotel. The hotel is listed as being on International Drive but it is away from all the hustle and bustle and close enough to all the restaurants with a quick drive. Will definately go back!

If you believe in the Hilton brand, this resort will solidify that belief. Check in went smoothly, everyone was friendly from the secnd we pulled up to check in. We checked in a smidgen early, and they accomodated us graciously. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in building 4. (It was five of us - 2 adults and three kids) We had a perfect view of the 2nd swimming pool, as well as the lake. The villas are very well appointed, with everything prisitne and new. If you are the type that likes to fix meals, the kitchen had everyhting you needed to put together a good meal. Once getting in to our villa, the only small problem was the master bathroom toilet was stopped up. But no problems there, a maintenance guy arrived quickly with plunger in tow. My kids were so excited to go swimming, but first we popped across the street to the Publix to stock up on snacks, breakfast items, and drinks for the week. We fixed a nice breakfast in the villa daily, before we headed out to the parks, and that usually carried us until late afternoon, so that was very cost-effective. (Note: In my opinion that Publix prices were not that great. I would suggest going to the Super-Walmart 5 minute away. You will probably end up spendfing a lot less, and they too are one-stop shop for liquor, food, and they also have a gas station attached, which had the cheapest gas in the area.) There are two pools on property, with the largest being the most popular. There is a nice bar, and they have a menu that you can order from, and eat poolside if you like. The Pina Coladas were great, and the service terrific. My kids loved the pool, and seemed to be more interested in swimming than, going to theme parks. In fact we cut one park out of the schedule, and jkust let the kids hang out at the pool all day. The pools stay open until 11:00 pm, and we stayed until closing on more than one night. The property is extremely beautiful, well-kept, the landscaping perfect, and the property has an overall luxurious feel to it. You will forget you are in busy tourist-trap Orlando, and imagine you are in the middle of a lush, tropical Italian resort. If you love shopping, there are great designer outlets within walking distance, and all of the theme Parks are very close, within 10-15 minutes... I have become a bit of a hotel snob, because of the amount of travel I do for business. This resort met my expectations and then some. I remember one evening my husband I were sitting on the screened-in balcony, with the ceiling fan blowing a nice tropical breeze, looking out over the pool and the lake, and he with a beer and me with a wine cooler. We looked at each other, sighed, and smiled. We both could not think of a better way to spend a family vacation. There was truly enough to do on the resort property, that you did not have to venture out, if you did not want to. The have planned kids activities daily. There is a small fee attached, but they appeared to be very interesting. Things such as tee-shirt dying, treasure hunts, arts and crafts. They also do a movie at the pool one night a week. They had bingo, kids-night-out, etc. We, however, did not get a chance to take advantage of much of this because we were hitting the theme parks, and got inlate most evenings. Some previous posters mentioned construction noise early in the morning. We were in building 4, and could see the last building that is under construction, from our villa. I did not hear a thing, and I am a pretty light sleeper. So, peace and quiet were maintained. (maybe we missed the noisy phase of construction. There were workers on the building, but they were not doing any thing noisy.) We loved this place so much, we did purchase the time-share, and cannot wait to go back next year!!

I was assured that all of the hotel's rooms were non-smoking so there wouldn't be a problem. When we went to our room it reeked of smoke - a smell so strong no one, especially the housekeeping staff, could have missed it. I went immediately back to the desk to get a new room. Apparently at midnight all of the front desk people except for one employee leaves. The girl behind the desk was completely overwhelmed with multiple phone calls from rooms with no towels, sheets, pillows, etc. She told us that there were no more rooms and we would have to keep this room. We told her that this was completely unacceptable. She kept clicking on her computer and telling us that she didn't know how to check for more rooms, change rooms, get more keys, etc. She had no one to call for help, and when she got too confused she just walked away and talked to someone on the phone about sheets and other items she could handle, leaving us standing there. 30 minutes into this process another guest arrived and she was completely ignored while this poor girl tried again and again to figure out what rooms were available. After over 90 minutes she finally found a room but still didn't know how to make keys, so she told us that we could have the room but we could never leave all at the same time until the next day when someone came in that knew how to produce keys. She called a maintenance person who was supposed to drive us to this room, but he didn't have a key either and we ended driving around the complex in a golf cart looking for other employees. After 2 hours we finally were in the replacement room (well after 2AM) which was not very nice. The carpet in one bedroom was soaked and smelled like cleaner (apparently someone had been smoking in this room too but they had tried to clean it). The pull out couch was FILTHY to put it mildly - it looked like someone had used the mattress in the yard - and it had footprints on it. The Master Bedroom was OK. In the middle of the night someone appeared with the key. By that point we didn't care - we just wanted to sleep! The next morning we went to the front desk and spoke to the supervisor of the front desk personnel. We told her of our problems and she was very helpful.

We stayed in a studio, #1314. I was most pleasantly surprised at the entire resort upon arrival......then we got to our room. It was even nicer. I especially appreciated the small kitchenette with mini fridge, microwave, sink, utensils, etc. Although the kitchenette had a blender in the cabinet and other small appliances, we weren't there long enough to use any of them. If we ever come back and spend more time there, we would definitely take advanatage of the kitchen for small meals, etc. The small fridge worked great. Too great in fact- I had turned the temperature knob all the way down so it would cool faster and it ended up freezing all the things in the fridge, no problem though. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room is nicely equipped with a ceiling fan, TV and DVD player and CD alarm clock. The bathroom was a good size and had real drawers in the bathroom. It was very nice to have a drawer there to put small items in. The closet was also pretty spacious. The only drawbacks in my opinion would be that the A/C in our room seemed to be sluggish. I noticed that no matter what setting I put it on, it never dipped below 75 degrees. And it felt more like 80 even when it would go down to 75. I believe that they have master programmed it not to go below that temp, as it would cool to a certain point and shut off. We used the ceiling fan at night. We did not end up calling maintenance because we were getting back to the room late at night and we had left the A/C on all day to see if it would cool off, but it never did in the 2.5 days we were there. When housekeeping is cleaning rooms, they leave bags of dirty towels in the halls outside the rooms. Kind of unsightly. Also if you take the elevators be warned that they are \"hotter than a bucket of hell\" inside. The work-out room is great. It has everything you need for a complete workout.

I read the reviews here, called the hotel directly and spoke with several employees, and decided that this resort would be a good fit for our stay. I am so glad I changed our hotel to this one! We stayed for 7 days in a 1 bedroom suite in Villa 1. The grounds were beautiful, lush and peaceful - a welcomed change for the end of a day at disney theme parks. It was nice to escape to the quiet, yet playful resort. I told my husband that if I didn't know better, I would have thought we had left the country for an island vacation. The atmosphere was very complete...and it felt like I had traveled to an island paradise without having a passport. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. For the first 10 minutes upon entering the room, my husband, son and I went around and just called out to each other the \"neat\" things we found in the room, like the full refrigerator, dishwasher, stove and microwave in the kitchen. (Nice to have access to, but we didn't do much cooking.) My son, 5, loved the patio, it was screened in and he loved to go out and play and we could keep the doors open without tons of FL bugs finding their way in. (I love FL, but ya gotta admit, FL does corner the market on the bugs. We didn't see any in our room during our stay) My husband and I loved the 2-person jacuzzi, especially after a long day on our feet at disney. The bathroom had gorgeous granite countertops, a beautiful shower...and did I mention the jacuzzi tub? The king sized bed was comfortable, might be a little soft for some, but it was those pillows...wow. I just love big, plush down feather pillows. (for those of you with allergies...sorry, the pillows totally rock!) We ate breakfast on the patio, and enjoyed the view overlooking the palms, and the main pool. As for some of the reviews that spoke of noise, to that I will say that I noticed some noise, but I didn't find it disturbing. It was mostly just the activity of a busy summer resort in my opinion. Our room was directly above one of the hot tubs by the main pool, and on the second floor, so we were close enough to hear activity, but at no time, did I find there to be a noisy environment. I'm pretty noise-sensitive and while I did find the music at disney dizzying, I thought the hotel was quiet. (as for the construction, I know I saw an entrance for construction, but I never saw or heard any sign of it. Might have been somewhere, but I never crossed paths with it.) As for the timeshare deal, we were asked once during check-in if we'd be interested, and someone called our room once during the week to check if we were interested, but we were not pressured in any way. I was a little leery of staying at a hotel that was involved with timeshares because we're not into that at this point in our lives. We didn't want to sit in on anything, we didn't want discounted tickets, etc. We just wanted to stay at the hotel, and that was not a problem. We were asked, politely, and when we said no thanks, that was it. No pressure. I appreciated the reviews from this site a lot. Everyone's comments helped me make a great decision and I hope I can do the same for someone. I just wished we had had more time to just spend at the hotel, and enjoy the pool and the activities.

Two activity lounges were a great touch - one an \"active\" lounge with pool tables and games, the other a \"quiet\" lounge with chairs, books & a fireplace. The view with the lake, fountains and the screened-in balconies were great, too. The rooms were very clean & very spacious, 2 baths, 3 TV's, DVD player, full kitchen.

The resort itself is beautiful. HOWEVER - as another user had posted, make sure you request a room away from the elevator (which I did) so while I got away from the elevator, I had a up close and personal view of the constuction site, which is pretty bad. The noise from the construction isn't so bad, but what they fail to mention is that right next store is the I-Trolley busses that go up and down International Drive. These busses were coming and going, and backing up (and when they back up they make that loud beeping noise at 10 decibels that we could hear loud and clear up on the fifth floor) until TEN THIRTY at night. My 3 year old daughter who is a light sleeper had trouble sleeping. So, if you are traveling with children, make sure you request to be A. As far away from the construction as possible and B. As far away from the I-Trolley busses! Overall it wasn't a huge deal but just a friendly recomendation to make your stay more pleasant! But, the resort was BEAUTIFUL! We couldn't have been happier. The housekeeping staff was SUPERB. They even took the time to neaten up my make up!? They did a great job - the accomodations were wonderful - the bed was nice and comfortable - we loved the glass shower / jacuzzi tub and having dishes / a microwave on hand came in handy! The staff was very friendly - for example - I usually get up early andrun but the fitness center there opened at 7am - so they opened it early for me at 5am so i had the whole place to myself, which was nice! We did get a deal on this so we had to attend the timeshare presentation. That was mildly painful. But we got the hotel for 5 days and 4 nights for $299 and they threw in our Seaworld & Disney tickets & a $50 dinner voucher for Planet Hollywood. So for all that, I can't complain! The sales pitch is pretty heavy though. The guy told me \"if you don't want it, just tell me and that's fine. I get some clients who say that they have to check w/ their CPA, etc.\" So I told him, \" I don't want it,\" (after all, I had not even been at the resort for 24 hours and this was my first trip to Orlando in 10 years - not ready to drop 20K just yet) and he spent the next 30 minutes trying to convince me otherwise. Then, when you think you are done, they grab a manager to rehash the thing with you. Then, when you think you are FINALY done, they swing you over to someone from \"corporate\", who was very rude by the way, but all in all, it's well worth the money for what we got ! There is also a playground for the kids that is shaded , which we liked - considering it was 95 degrees in the shade! The pools are BEAUTIFUL!!

We were in Building 3 which is directly across the lake from the one under construction. It did not bother us one bit and we did not hear any noise from the construction. I think that people that complain about that are just looking for something to complain about. Any one who reads the reviews knows before going that the hotel is still under construction. (this is the last building) We spent two days at the pool with our boys and enjoyed it very much. We ate lunch at the pool both days and found it good and a fair value. It was about $35 for two adults and two kids...drinks included. The bricks around the pool get extremely hot so make sure you wear sandals to the pool. The kids had sores on the bottom of their big toes from walking on the hot bricks. The hotel has a lot of great activities at the pool and in their activities room. We enjoyed two pool side movies, made ice cream sundae's and enjoyed the animal encounter on Sunday evening. Our kids participated in an outing with the kids program and my husband and I were able to enjoy dinner together. We spent 8 days at this hotel and then went to Cocoa Beach. When we got to our hotel at Cocoa Beach (which is suppose to be one of the nicest ones) we knew we weren't at the Hilton any more. We called the Hilton to see if we could come back for a couple nights and cut our trip to Cocoa Beach short but the hotel was booked. We ended up staying two nights at Cocoa Beach and then booked a room for two nights at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at Sea World. It is also very nice but is older. It has the same great pool side activities as the one on International Drive. The International Drive location is a little more convenient to the Disney parks. If we had to do it over, we would have booked our whole trip at the Hilton on International Drive and made one or two day trips (a good hour drive) to Cocoa Beach.

However, the pool the serves our building was much more quite and calm then the main pool with the water fall. There are couple of pizza hut's at the resort, as well as, bars, deli, market and massage services. This time we did not try out the massage service, but i am sure if it is anything like the resort - you would be overly satisfied. The front desk staff was friendly and very attentive. The suite was like a one bedroom townhouse in a really nice area and very, very nice decor. We were only there for 4 days/3 nights, having never visited Florida - you need a good week to three weeks to do everything!!! However, we were very satisfied with what we were able to see and do. We visited Epcot center which had plenty to see and do. I would say if you go for a few days and want to capture the Disney experience Disney do Epcot. We were told by locals that Sea World, Epcot, and Universal are the best. But for the dollar Busch Gardens and Sea World are tops. The weather was perfect not too hot or humid(85-95), coming from California we soaked in the nice warm weather - its been cold and rainy here. We were ready for some good warm sun. The nights were great 80's at mid-night. Cons: The pool closes at 11pm, but you are ok if you are in there before 11pm they will not ask you to leave. Pros: to many!!! For the ladies that enjoy shopping - there is an outlet mall directly behind the resort. There is a Walgreens and Publix market across the street. Places to chow: The best place was Texas Brazilan steak restaurant. This place is not idea for kids because of the prices $42.00pp but the meat is top quality and its all you can eat. Truly an upscale experience, reservations are recommended but not required. The next best place was The Boston Lobster Feast - another all you can eat seafood restaurant. Beware of this place because there are lots of imitations. The one we went to is located on International Drive next to the pirates attraction. The price is about $32.95 pp but it was well worth it especially if you like seafood. Having read all of the reviews of the resort and location of the restaurants i was disappointed because when we exited the freeway on international drive i did not see all these restaurants and attractions that i was told about. Well just take international drive allllllllll the way down and around and you will have a time choosing where to eat. Staying at this resort you will need a car, there is so much to see in Orlando. We enjoy just getting out and seeing as much as we can from all directions. Finally this experience was very memorable we will be back in April 2007.

I found it impossible to read as well, since the \"music\" is a mixture of pop, country, and - I hated this - rap. I find it impossible to concentrate with words being shouted at me that way (Disney does this right - they have generic ambient music playing at just the right volume - way better). I also didn't like waking up to Hootie and the Blowfish on my vacation, but the pool music starts early and ends late, and you can't help but hear it. Had it been tropical music, I wouldn't have minded so much. Or even something beachy like Jimmy Buffett or Jack Johnson (I'm not a fan but the mood would at least have been right). Calls to the front desk didn't help - they say that they'll ask to have it turned down, but it didn't make a difference. Apparently it's Hilton's policy to play it, so it's not going to change.

It's huge, and a lot of fun, with a huge water fall and multiple smaller water features. There is a pool bar and grill just steps from the edge of the pool, which was very convenient. There are several lounges adjacent to the pools with couches, tvs, pool tables.

Didn't know that until check-out when I was told it was too late to change it. Towels and sheets were very nice. Comfy bed. Kids said sofa bed wasn't too bad.

I managed to leave a necklace behind after my one night stay. I called the hotel (never thinking anything would come from it, but I had to try) and was put in contact with housekeeping.

Drive, Orlando which I booked on the advise of tripadvisor reviews. As others have said it is a beautiful property, minutes from all attractions (if you have a rental car). Pool area is huge and beautiful with two jacuzzis, kitchens are fully equipped with great quality appliances and utensils, beds very comfortable, and service excellent. Try to request buildings one or two, others are further from the pool, and four is a bit close to the construction area across the lake. If you have never toured a Hilton timeshare, you can save a considerable amount of $ by taking the two hour presentation. When you are calling to book your stay, say that you may be interested in purchasing a timeshare. You can schedule the tour as early as 8:30 am so that you can still have a full day free. Of course it is a bit high pressure, but you can just say no. Also be aware that although they clean the bathroom and change the sheets daily, they do not really clean the kitchen. This differs from when we stayed in a Disney property with a kitchen, they put the dishes in the dishwasher and cleaned thoroughly. Since I didn't really cook there, it was not a big deal, and I think the property and rooms at HGVC are just as nice as Disney villas, and also newer, at about half to one third the price. Also check out the kids activities they have - good to break up a day that you are just relaxing by the pool. Food is decent poolside and comparably inexpensive.

I usually find something to complain about, but this place was top notch. We stayed in a one bedroom king unit with 2 adults and one 5 year old. The accomodations were top notch. We had a problem with the jacuzzi tub shooting out soap scum the first time we used it, but housekeeping was on the ball and came up with some bleach at my request to sanitize the system. Later I figured out that the reason the tub accumulated soap scum was because the soap provided contained shea butter. After long days at the parks, the jacuzzi was wonderful. We stayed as an owner referral promo and got a great deal. I went to the presentation which was not high pressure. We were really interested in buying and eventhough we decided not to purchase at that time, we were offered a decent deal on future accomodations within 15 months. The reason we didn't buy or take them up on the offer is that the salesperson outright lied to me. He told me that the only way we could EVER stay at this resort was to buy or have an owner referral. This was pure bull pucky. I went right up to our room, got online and pulled up the same accomodations on several internet booking sites. When I mentioned a resale I had seen on the net, I was told that the owner would never be able to sell to me because Hilton has \"first right of refusal\". Which meant if I tried to buy from the owner, Hilton would refuse to sell to me and snatch it up themselves to resell at closer to their retail price. I don't know if this is true or not but it was a definite turn off to buying. We had a corner unit, which was laid out better than the unit I toured. The kitchen was fully equipped with refrigerator/freezer/icemaker, double sinks, microwave. stove oven, dishwasher, cookware, untensils, dishes, glasses. The bathroom was well appointed also with double sinks, toiletries, a one person jacuzzi and a walk in shower for two. Reasonably priced room service was available. Publix, Walgreens and several restaurants were just across the street. We watched the Seaworld fireworks from our balcony. The bed and even the sofa bed was comfortable. The pool was huge and heated. The only draw back was that there was no deep end, but in a way that was ok too. We could relax and let our son explore without worrying about him falling into the deep end. Lots of free activities on the pool deck. They had an upclose animal encounter where a person brought several animals from birds to a lemur. We had a special encounter on the way to the poolside bathroom (also well appointed with showers, lockers and hair dryers). While the animal handler was setting up, my son and I got to touch and interact with the lemur. It climbed up my arm, licked me and sniffed my sons' nose which he took as a kiss. He was delighted. Actually, so was I !! As far as staying there in the future, I would definitely book again. If in the future I decide to buy, I'll try a resale (always love a bargain) and see if the salesperson told another fib. This is fabulous property.

Location is prime - on I-Drive, close to every restaurant imaginable and of course, Disney World. A rental car is a must since all attractions / restaurants are spread out. Once we arrived, we checked our bags with the concierge. We hit the Publix (grocery store) across the street and stocked up with food and booze for the week. We were given a two-bedroom suite...WOW! Words cannot do this place justice. The kitchen was marble with beautiful wood and had every utensil that you'll need for cooking. The only thing that the kitchen didn't include was spices. Thus, pack salt and pepper and anything else that you may need during your stay. The living room had a nice dining room table (seating for 6) which overlooked a lake. The master bedroom was most impressive with a view and a jacuzzi tub that comfortably fit two. The second bedroom was equally nice minus the jacuzzi tub. A washer and dryer is located in a closet and housekeeping will provide you with laundry detergent. Outside of our room, the resort had nice amenities. There are lounges for reading (quiet) and for playing pool and other games. There's an on-site convenience store if you want to get coffee or anything else that you may have forgotten to buy at Publix. And then there's the pool...one that rivals a fancy Las Vegas resort. To my untrained eye, I figured the pool to be the length of a football field accented with a towering fountain in the middle. An outdoor bar that makes great cocktails abuts the pool. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. On the first night, the lights wouldn't turn on. Within 5 minutes of reporting the problem, two maintenance workers were there to fix it (Circuit breaker). On another occasion, I had to send an urgent fax and the front desk was quick to accomodate and didn't charge me a dime. Since this is a time share, I did receive the expected call asking if I wanted to attend a sales presentation. I politely declined and I was never asked again. Hilton has gotten it right. In my opinion, the precedent has been set for timeshares / vacation clubs with this resort.
