The bathroom was modern and clean. Fresh towels were supplied everyday. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the main centre of things.

However, if some of the previous reviewers had an bit of common sense they would have figured that out quite quickly from the price of the rooms. When you pay for a skoda don't expect a merc. This hotel does not make itself out to be anything other than what it is --- basic accomodation, (mainly) for young people looking to have a good time who are not too fussed about where they stay. If you're worried about decor and can afford to take the time to pick out all the faults in a place you've obviously got way too much time on your hands. The bed linen was clean, the bathroom/toilets were spotless and the hotel was within walking distance of all the major attractions. The person who mentioned something about rats/mice has obviously little understanding of a city thats primarily built upon a waterway system. Amsterdam is old and full of canals, no matter where you go it will be suseptible to rodents because of this. This is not a reflection on the hotel itself so much as the city structure as a whole --- personally we found no sign of any infestation. To sum up, this is not going to win any prizes for comfort, it is basic but it's clean where it needs to be and it's right in the city centre --- what more do you want?", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR156672015", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ACADE"}, {"Content": "Welcome to hell I have booked this hotel because I liked the area in which we had lived some years ago. Despite its excellent location it is just a tourist hell. Carpet and wallpaper seem to be so dirty that one wonders, if there was ever a cleaning or renovation in the last 150 years. The room stank strongly. When I came back at night the receptionist was completely stoned standing in the middle of the entrance and inviting me to the ratty bar. In the room itself also someone seemed to have been in it because there were ashes in the bin and black hairs in the sink which have not been there before I had left. In bed i notice that the bed-lamp was broken and the ventilator in the bath-room made the whole night every two minutes a peep-sound which made it hardly possible to sleep with this built-in permanent alarm-clock. But I guess to go down to ask the stoned receptionist would have been also a bad idea. In the morning I was supposed to have breakfast in the bar at 8.00h but none was there. after knocking for five minutes at the reception door, the stoned receptionist showed up in his undershirt. I said I would like to have my 8 EUR back I paid for breakfast, but he refused, saying that he had prepared breakfast (where???). However please do not go to this hotel.

Perhaps 10 years ago I discovered what hostels or shared hotel rooms were when, for want of a cheap hotel in a crowded Amsterdam, I found myself going with another guy from the train station who had called around and found beds available at the Hotel Keizergracht. It was the first time I experienced a place selling a bed for the night, not a room, and I found the place acceptably clean with the basic amenities needed for hostel sleeping and going out in Amsterdam: Clean linens on beds made up each day, shower with soap and towels, drinking glasses; all cleaned each day of a stay. The rooms, at least the quads and triples, are airy, bright, and clean -- though I did find mosquitoes at night a problem one year. The locale is generally very quiet, so you can expect a peaceful night. The feeling of security is good. Now I contrast this to stays in other hostels in Amsterdam: Some I found equal in overall comfort, and some I found to be quite a disappointment. But in terms of room comfort, I have not found a better hostel. Yes, there is a 3:00 AM curfew (which I have never tested), and this on occasion has limited my nightlife involvements. On the plus side, their check-out time is later than that of other hostels in Amsterdam, 11:30 I think. I do remember the scrawl on the door to the small elevator, as well as fresh linen stacked in corridors which I assumed meant the housekeepers were doing their work. I have never taken breakfast there, knowing that I can probably get a good value at nearby restaurants. I did not find the common areas well-populated, meaning that one of the pleasures of hosteling, meeting like-minded travelers, is limited to who might be also assigned to your room. But I found the staff friendly and helpful, and I've been happy that they seem to recognize me (from an earlier stay) when I show up at their reception seeking a bed in a quad (lowest rate!)

Some friends and myself stayed at this hotel for 7 nights last week and found the standards of cleanliness a shock. Upon entering the room the first thing to strike us was the smell. The room smelled like it hadnt been aired in a long time, with a musty old smokey smell. My friends bed sheet had a bloodstain on it and despite having the bed linen changed everyday the bottom sheet was never changed only the top. Aside from smell and the sheets the wallpaper on the walls was peeling off and in one corner seemed to have damp or be peeling due to a leak. There was graffitti on the window frame and balcon (in the room). The picture in the room was torn and it seemed someone had smeared pizza over the back of the door which was never cleaned off the whole week we were there. Before booking this 'hell' we didnt realise the hotel had a curfew of 3am and as fairly young adults this cut into our club time seen as most clubs in Amsterdam open around 11.30pm. Several times we missed curfew and were forced to stay with friends who live in the city. The one good thing about the hotel is the pool table which we made alot of use of seen as there was no form of entertainment in the room. The table was 1Euro per game which was very good compared to the pool hall or nearby coffeeshops. However the bar was a let down due to the lack of staffing and the extortionate drinks prices (2 Euros for a can of coke so i dare not think what Beer was)The staff on the whole were very pleasant and friendly. However one day a friend who had visited the hotel before and left something there came by to collect it and the lady on reception did send a message up to the room and would not let them up which i found very rude. Other than that though, we had no problem with the staff.Now me personally, i'm a student and am used to roughing it and not worrying about luxury, and my friends also were not expecting luxury but there are basic standards of hygine and clenliness you expect, not just in a hotel but just from day to day living and i dont think our expectations were high by just wanting clean sheets (we can even live with peeling wallpaper...)", "Date": "Sep 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR889679208", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "teammonkey"}, {"Content": "a pure hell hole. i would advise no one to stay in this hotel, it is a dirty place it is stinking, wee booked three rooms one of them had a rat box, the hotel has rats a bloody disgrace, i would advise no one to stay there, i would rather lie on the street DONT GO THERE!", "Date": "Sep 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR882912019", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "montana75"}, {"Content": "Don't ever stay at this hotel simply Lousy!!!

For a major Western city the room rate was staggeringly cheap - ergo, more money for beer. Cleanliness was not great - I found a dead mouse by the radiator in our room, but what the hell. We just left it there and told the lady at reception who apologised profusely. But the main thing was that the beds were spotless, and the bathroom clean. If you are lads or lasses on the beers who just want a safe pillow in what can be a unpredictable city, but require no frills, you'd do a lot worse than stay here.Another plus point, there are bucketloads of bars and restaurants within yards of this place.
