We were lured to the Days Inn due to the low price (about $60 including tax), free airport shuttle, and included breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The airport shuttle was fast and frequent. The van was aged but clean and the driver very friendly. Check-in took only a few seconds and the staff was very courteous. Upon arrival at the room we were greeted by dated decor but the room, including the bathroom, was cleaner than the last two Hilton's I stayed at. The mattresses were old and springy but comfortable enough for a good night's sleep. The in-room coffee maker was much appreciated. The room had a weird layout where the sink and bathroom counter were in the main part of the room and offered no degree of privacy. The bathroom had a full sized tub and toilet but no place to put anything. With the bathroom door closed there was barely enough room to change clothes. This is not a hotel room where you would want to spend any amount of time in but we were there only to sleep and it worked out perfectly for our needs. Climate control, television, and coffee maker all worked great. The free wi-fi worked well on my daughter's i-touch but it would not work on my PDA. After examining their network I traced it down to having multiple routers with the same broadcast ID which doesn't always work well with older handheld devices. The included breakfast included cereal, muffins, toast, and waffles. There was no protein (eggs, meat etc) or fruit. There was Sunny Delight but no real juice available. If you are into a big hearty breakfast, don't expect to get it here. There is no such thing as a free meal. The included breakfast was on par with the price of the hotel so there were no complaints. This hotel was only a few minutes from the Seattle Airport. There were a lot of restaurants and a small casino within short walking distance of the hotel. Everything from fast food to fine dining was available. A 7-11 was two doors down. The location was very convenient. The business center consisted of one computer in the lobby of the hotel. A teenager was monopolizing it when I wanted to print out my boarding pass and the front desk clerk offered to kick him off for me, but I did it myself. Being that there was only one computer available a policy against wasting time on teen sites would be a good idea since most guests aren't as assertive as I can be and might be inclined to wait politely instead of taking charge of the situation. When we returned to the Days Inn about a week later on the way back from our vacation the hotel staff remembered and welcomed us.

We waited about 15 minutes and they were there. The driver loaded all luggage for us and then unloaded onto a luggage cart at the hotel, which was very helpful because I was alone with two small children. Check in was a breeze. The room was very clean and spacious. We had a room with just one queen size bed, but they obviously could have fit another in the room, so it gave the room a very open feel. The continental breakfast in the morning, which is included with room, was very good. They even had a waffle station where you could make your own belgian waffles. No problems checking out. The shuttle back to the airport leaves every half hour, and we were the only ones waiting for the time that we left, so there was plenty of space.

Once we were finally dropped off, our room still wasn't ready, despite calling the hotel two hours earlier receiving confirmation that they would have a room ready when we arrived. The lady manning the front desk said it would be another hour or hour and a half before our room would be ready and that we should go shopping or something (?). My husband was ill so I told her we'd wait in the lobby instead. Within 5 minutes she found us a room. Amazing! The front desk staff appears to be overworked, at least I would like to attibute her uncaring attitude to this reason. We tried to use the computer in the lobby to check the net and when we couldn't get a connection, she replied, \"it's down.\" Duh! My husband took the initiative and rebooted it. Problem solved. After we finally got into the room, we noticed that our window was open and wouldn't shut, obviously pushed too far from either the maid or the previous guest. The front desk did send someone to fix it. While the maid did the best she could cleaning the room, the wallpaper was coming off the walls and had marks on it as well as the carpet raveling at the seams. This hotel has seen better times in the past... We had a 6:45 a.m. flight the next morning. After telling us the shuttle ONLY runs on the hour and half hour we decided to get a wake up call at 3:30 am so we could take the 4:00 shuttle. We arrived at the front desk at 3:50 a.m. to see the same lady who was there the morning, afternoon, and evening when we arrived still at the front desk! The shuttle was gone already! When we confronted her with the rules about shuttle times that she gave us the day before, she said, \"Well, the van was in an accident.\" Ok, but I still didn't see the relevance to the van leaving early. When the van finally arrived, it was the same van as yesterday, with the same dent in the door as yesterday. Any answer to get us off her back, I guess! Thank heavens we planned well and had plenty of time to get thru the airport security, etc. The biggest problem with this hotel is that it's like living in a college dorm room. You can hear every person in the hallway and every door being open or shut. It's EXTREMELY noisy! On top of this, I believe the hotel is situated at the end of an airport taxi way or run up area because all night we could hear loud blasts from plane engines.

On the plus it's very close to airport and staff are friendly and shuttle service is grand. But, when you learn what we learned when you get there that is there is about 20 other hotels in short walking distance to this hotel surrounding it. They can't be any worse than this dump. Only that I live so far away in Ireland. I would actually start a campaign to get this hole of a place shut down. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. Oh! and did I say that this place is AWFUL!! because it is.

We were welcomed with a warm friendly smile upon arrival although we had to catch a cab (only $5) because the shuttle bus only runs ever 30 minutes. Room was clean and spacious with all the facilities you need after a 16-hour flight. Unfortunately the TV didn't have all the channels it promised but that\u2019s a minor complaint!

On close inspection things were dated, but it didn't jump out at you. The bathroom was small. The service at this place was absolutely terrible. Our TV didn't work when we arrived, and when we called the front desk they immediately made it clear this was more our problem than theirs. It took numerous phone calls and 6 hours to get the TV fixed. No one would take responsibility for this problem; someone else was always \"on the way up\" to fix it. The breakfast went until 9:30 AM. When we showed up at 9:20 AM everything was gone. We asked them to restock a few things, which they did... but very slowly and very grudgingly. The did not seem concerned about or interested in our plight (9 adults and 3 kids without food). They were also clearly understaffed, which explains why they were so slow. The location is convenient to the airport, but not to downtown, especially with traffic - 45 minutes each way. There is free internet in the lobby, but no printer attached (can't print out boarding passes), which seems inexcusable to me for a hotel at the airport with a free airport shuttle. On the plus side: we paid $51 for a room for 4 adults, there is a free breakfast, and there is a free shuttle.
