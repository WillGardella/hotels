Before departure, I search a lot to manage my money to get the best quality from the lowest money spending. Before leaving to London I searched many sites and read reviews. With all bad reviews about Park Hotel lastly I decided to stay here for 2 nights for the following reasons: 1. Many of London\u2019s sightseeing are in walking distance. So, I saved for transportation cost. 2. I was leaving hotel in the morning and coming back late night. What I wanted was a basic breakfast, clean bed, clean toilet and hot shower which was included the rate. 3. I traveled in January when is off-season and hotel offered me a good price (29 Pound per night for ensuit room and basic breakfast) Luckily my room was a double bed. Still small and old but I could move! Hotel has a wireless internet zone but I didn\u2019t use. If you stay here remember: 1. I saw the pictures of other guests some rooms were very shady. My room was 219. It was ok compared to those pictures. But window was broken and I cut my finger while trying to shut it. Finally, I couldn\u2019t! 2. Ask the reception to switch on the heater at night. 3. My room doesn\u2019t have cooling system. So for summer might be a problem 4. I saw some scary pictures of other guests here in Trip Advisor bit by bedbugs. I didn\u2019t see any. They were not around because of winter!? 5. When open the tap in the shower room be patient! Hot water will come after 10 minutes! 6. Hotel doesn\u2019t have lift and stairs are narrow. 7. Hotel runs by 2 staff. One is reception and one is multifunction! 8. During the pick-season rates increase up to 66 Pound to 160 Pound! Unbelievable! But I think other hotels also increase their price! So still Park Hotel will be cheaper. 9. I saw about 50 B&B in Belgrave and Warwick area. But all look same size and same quality. If one of them is a bit better in service then the price will increase. 10. Definitely, owner knows about many deficiencies in his hotel but also he knows travelers can not find a cheaper hotel in London. So, why to spend money for improving it!? 11. Don\u2019t miss the Cypriot/Turkish restaurant in Warwick 5 min by walk from Park hotel. And finally: 12. If this hotel was in another city I was giving much lower rate to this property. .", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cbudget hotel\u201d", "Author": "amit4717", "ReviewID": "UR123126086", "Content": "This hotel is budget hotel in central london.The room was not great but was manageable.Booked the hotel over internet because of the location.

We said that we were happy with a double bed which we had booked and a call was then made by the receptionist and we were told that we had to stay \u2018down the road\u2019. We asked if the room was the same standard and that it was all Ok and we were advised that \u2018yes it was a very good room and we had to stay there because the Corbigoe was full\u2019 (despite being offered a twin room and a vacancy sign showing on the door). We were taken to The Park Hotel on 64 Belgrave Road and were taken to a room 4 floors up (very steep stairs) \u2013 Room 14. This room was a very small room with a standard double bed. The room did not have any wardrobe or hooks \u2013 so in fact no-where to hang clothes, no cupboards, drawers or shelves so no-where to place anything. The bed was made up with a single sheet on the double bed so only half the bed was covered and the mattress was exposed. A thin blanket and a sheet lay on the bed. There was one towel, one mug (unwashed), one spoon, coffee, tea and no sugar in the room. We were unable to unpack or hang our clothes so spent the night getting ready stepping over our cases. The kettle would not fit under the tap so we could only fill it by scooping water from the dirty mug. The kettle then could only be plugged in on a plug half way up the wall and the kettle had to be held whilst being boiled. We went to Reception and asked to change room and was advised that nothing was available. We asked for the bed to be remade with a double sheet as we did not wish to lay on an exposed mattress, we were told there was nothing wrong with the bed and the sheets were changed only once per stay \u2013 after a lot of arguing we finally got a sheet and made the bed ourselves. We asked for an extra towel and again was told we could not have one, the towels were only given out once per stay, we tried explaining it was not reasonable to expect us both to use the same towel and after much arguing finally we got an extra towel, the same went for the mug. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful and made it very hard for us to get these extra items, we asked to speak to a manager but was advised one would not be available until Monday am. When we returned to the room a few minutes later the receptionist burst into the room without knocking and said; \u2018sorry sirs you are right the room is terrible, I will get you a refund, the fu~~ing cleaner did not do his job properly, tomorrow I will F~~k him F~~k him..... we were completely shocked by this outburst. The receptionist continually apologised agreeing the room was disgusting and said that tomorrow (Sunday) he would get us a better room and a refund for Saturday, he had also brought with him an open plate of sugar which contained dirty bits. We had an unpleasant nights sleep in what was a dirty cold room and showered in a disgusting mouldy shower. We could only sit on the toilet sideways as our legs would not fit in front of us. That night we returned to the hotel at separate times. My partner came in and went to bed taking the key from reception (we had to leave the key at the desk when going out). I returned at 4am and after knocking continually at the Reception window the receptionist got out his bed which was made on the reception floor and advised me I could not have a key to get in but I must wake up my partner to get in my room\u2013 which I therefore did. The following morning we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we did not feel satisfied that the food hygiene would be up to standards as the room certainly as not. We spoke to the same receptionist in the morning and again he apologised and said we must speak with the manager on Monday morning (Mr S...?) and he would arrange a refund for us. In the meantime he had said that he had arranged for us to return to our original hotel to a larger room with a wardrobe so we could hang our clothes \u2013 all was to be in order and waiting for us. We walked back to the Corbigoe with our luggage and was told by the receptionist that we had to pay \u00a315 extra for the room! By this time I was really annoyed and made it clear i would not be paying anymore. We were then taken to a room on the 3rd floor \u2013 room 13. This room was larger with a wardrobe and contained 3-beds. The room was still dirty and the beds made with just a single sheet on the mattress, it was again a disgusting room , however we could hang our clothes. The beds that night were extremely uncomfortable and the towel rail fell off the wall, the Tv only had 4 working channels. During our stay I noted that every fire door was propped open and I advised the receptionist that this was not correct as the fire doors should remain closed to prevent the spread of fire, the receptionist would not accept this and said they were left open to let people in/out. This therefore gave us grave concern as we were up on the 4th floor and our only means of escape in the event of a fire was down the one set of stairs where all the doors were constantly propped open! I also noticed that some fire extinguishers required a re-service this month. That night I returned to the hotel before my partner (who had the key on him) and asked the receptionist for a spare key, he told me \u2018no\u2019 and that i had to get the key from my partner. Not being happy I insisted he opened the door with a master key to let me in, finally he gave me a key but said I must return it immediately after unlocking my door, I said NO as I did not wish to walk up/down 4 flights of steep stairs, and reluctantly he followed me up to take back the key. Again we chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. I explained to the receptionist that i wished to have a written confirmation of my complaints which he refused to give. He said i must speak with the manager but the manager was away on holiday. I have photos which I can send you showing all the above mentioned faults should you wish. I am an operations Manager for a Warner hotel so I did realise that @\u00a350 per night we would be not be getting large rooms or anything special in London \u2013 we just wanted a clean place to sleep, shower and take breakfast;, however we did expect a clean room and bed, towels, blankets and sheets and to stay in the hotel we had booked and not get treated rudely. We did not get what we paid for and in fact one night did not even get to stay in the hotel we booked for. The whole experience ruined our weekend as we felt uncomfortable walking and washing in dirty rooms, stepping over our cases because we could not hang anything. We tried to speak to a manager and was refused 3-times.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWORST HOTEL EVER\u201d", "Author": "abm1970 Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121247121", "Content": "This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at. the ceiling had been badly re-plastered after what looked like a water leak the carpet was filthy and was covered in staines the bathroom was filthy and full of mould after i complained i was told they were full and had no other rooms available and that i wouldnt get a refund. i recommend everyone give this hotel a miss as its filthy and the owners just want your money and dont care about you", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atherstone, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful- smell & bed bugs\u201d", "Author": "marie-ann p", "ReviewID": "UR120113304", "Content": "I stayed here with my friend & our two children (room 11).

The hotel was obviously low-budget, and we know that price is relative to quality at times so I guess we weren't expecting top notch quality.. BUT to witness a hotel being run under such poor hygiene standards is just absolutely shocking. Firstly, the room was awful; extractor fan on the window which had been stuck together by tape essentially, a carpet and bed cover which were absolutely hideous, shoddy electrics; my friend tried turning on the tv with a remote, as you do of course, and that wouldn't work, so we then tried to turn the light switch off to go to bed and that turned out to be the trigger for the tv to turn on! BUT the worst part of it all BY FAR was the number of BED BUGS we found, and the reaction/\"damage control\" of the staff.. We found bed bugs of all sizes, from small undeveloped ones, to ones who have bitten people before (we then discovered they grow with the more blood they have). We squished a few and saw the blood coming out as we did.. was as gross as it sounds, and to be honest i don't know how this hotel still operates under those circumstances... anyway I then proceeded to making a complaint to reception, and demanded a full refund. Person at reception dealt with this terribly, as he actually said we would have to wait till the nxt day to talk to the manager, even though he admitted from the very first second that yes, they have been having problems with bed bugs. In fact his reaction to my question of whether they had beg bugs was: \"What room are you in?\" Very reassuring what can I say!! Anyway after a long conversation and a lot of frustration later, we decided to take his offer of a different room as my friend and I were exhausted and didn't know where else to go. BUT no that didn't work either; that had BED BUGS as well!!!

Not sure why but each to their own. I asked if I could purchase the 1 week Wi-Fi and he said that I could but couldnt. Whatever that meant... I took my suitcases up three flights of narrow stairs. Noticed the dried chewing gum on the carpets and the growing mould up the walls. Passed a smelly shared toilet that despite having an \"Out of Order\" sign on was open and unclean. Finally made it to my room. The first thing I noticed was no wardrobe to hang clothes. Yet much to my surprise I found four coat hangers on the toilet chain. So at least I had somewhere to hang my clothes! The \"Tea and coffee making facilites\" was comprised of a kettle that didn't work, and out of date dried coffee and tea amongst toe nail clippings and hair. The bed was hard, had one flimsy blanket and two lumpy pillows. The window was cracked, did not open and also had mould on the broken wooden frame. The TV did not work but the best was the bathroom. Hanging my towel on the plastic rail, it came off. The sink had no hot water, the shower took 45 minutes to drain and when I sat on the toilet my knees hit the sink.

On arriving there we were greated by a gentleman through a hatch window who told us we would be staying in one of the basement rooms. He gave us the key which fob said 202 but said the room was number 2 and that we just had to walk through the corridor and down the stairs. From first entering the building we noticed a strong smell of damp that got worse as we went down the stairs. The walls and paintwork were dirty and wallpaper and paint were coming off in areas. At the bottom of the stairs we were greated by two rooms the first being ours, only to notice that by the second door was a filthy matress propped up alongside the next rooms door. After some fiddling around to get our key to work in the lock the door finally opened, and I froze at the utter sight of the room. If money had permitted I would have been out of this filth hole like a flash. In the room were two beds with the most distasteful bedspreads thrown on, more like old curtains really. However the only good thing was the sheets were clean and looked new. The first thing we noticed on entering was there wasnt anywhere to hang our clothes other than a very small single white wardrobe which was broken and was leaning against the wall at an odd angle. So much so they had rammed card under the one leg to stablize it. Sat on top of this unit was a tv that didnt work and looked like it was about to come crashing down at any moment. With the added useless two coat hangers they supplied and the danger that if we should try to hang anything in it we quickly decided to leave our clothes in our suitcases. The only other unit was a very small bedside cupboad with a tray on it with two dirty mugs a spoon, a kettle and some sugar tea and coffee sachets all of which were damp. The window was covered by closed old curtains that had large slashes going through them and did not looked like they had ever been washed. Behind the curtains was a mouldy window with broken catches and a cracked fan in the top pain of glass. The window looked out onto a small area of yard not more than 8ft square, The yard was completely sided with brick walls belonging to other sections of the house and was constantly gushing with water from the drainage system, The whole area stank and was covered in fag butts, bird mess and unwanted bits and pieces. There was deffinately no chance that it could be used as a safety route incase of a fire.Probally the cleanest area was the bathroom which had been recently updated. On further inspection we noticed stains and iron burns on the carpet, lamps hanging of the wall, sockets either not working or partially broken and hanging off the wall but most probally the most worrying thing was the smoke alarm which had no cover on and looked like it had been disabled. The other worrying factor was we kept getting the smell of what appeared to be gas. For those that opt for breakfast and pay the extra supplement dont bother it consists of either standing or stitting on a stool up against a wall with what can only be described as a wall shelf to eat off. Its self service so in the corner they supply stale cornflakes from a dirty container or cheap value stale bread to be used in the toaster. The fresh orange tasted like it had been watered down and the tea and coffee were not that great either. The whole hotel mood is very sombre and everyone around you complains that there rooms are just as bad. The only good thing about this hotel is that its away from all the hustle and bustle, cheap and close to Victoria Station other than that do yourselves a favour and spend a few extra pounds and find somewhere else thats clean and safe.

There were LIVE cables sticking out of the walls behind the pillows on the bed and the tv was hanging off the wall. The bedding was filthy so we had to lay out our own towels to lay on as the filthy stained towels they provided looked like they were harbouring some sort of horrific disease ! Out of the window was a little courtyard where rubbish and rotting food was thrown and random people walking around at night. Every morning there was something going on in the corridor, lots of asian men banging around and just sitting outside the room staring, it really put us at unrest, we ended up taking all our valuables everywhere as they were not safe in that hell hole. The bathroom looked like it belonged in an aeroplane it was that small, there was mold and general filth all over the shower and sink. Then to top it all off, we arrived back after an amazing night at the theatre to sum dodgy man saying we havent payed the bill and we owed hundreds of pounds. I argued for about an hour and said i was calling the police, i had the number dialled then he changed his tune. We tried finding somewhere else but everywehre was full as it was New Years Eve (we genuinelly we scared for our safety that night) I stayed up all night just in case and could here someone outside the door and when i banged on the floor they ran up the stairs. NEVER EVER EVER stay at this hotel, it is an embarrasment to London and to England that this hellhole is allowed to stay open.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cdon't go there!\u201d", "Author": "shoegirla", "ReviewID": "UR111316701", "Content": "When I've checked in the guy at the front desk told me I have to pay in advance, gave him 100 pounds in cash, got the key... only when I got upstairs (very narrow, quite hard to carry a larger suitcase) did I realize he never gave me a receipt.

I had no choice but to leave after the first night. The issues I encountered were as follows: CLEANING The hotel was generally unclean, and the room I was given (# 7) in particular was filthy: 1) The balcony outside the room was littered with cigarette butts and other rubbish 2) The carpet in the room was soiled, shabby and had not been vacuumed 3) The draws of the bedside were covered in stains 4) The bed linen was torn and stained 5) The room had a stench of dampness 6) Due to concerns regarding cleanliness of the room, I felt uncomfortable about the hygiene risks of using the bed. Instead I kept my clothes on, covered the bedding with spare clothes and slept rather uncomfortably in that state. 7) The floor, hand basin, toilet and shower unit in the bathroom so dirty I was not able to make use of the bathroom at all. MAINTENANCE The overall standard of maintenance of the hotel and my room (# 7) was very poor: 1) There were large holes punched in the walls that had not been repaired 2) The plumbing made an extremely loud noise for at least 2 minutes after I or occupants of other rooms flushed the toilet 3) The wardrobe unit was flimsy, unstable and had folded up maps jammed underneath it to prevent it from falling over INTERNET WiFi internet service was offered at 3 pounds per day. This worked well on the first evening of my stay, however on the following morning it was impossible to access the internet, and shortly after the WiFi router was switched off altogether by the person on duty at reception. Note that there are other free WiFi internet services with good signal strength that can be accessed from the room I was staying in. It was from there I made a booking for another hotel which is less expensive and much nicer. BATHROOM In addition to being unclean, the bathroom was dilapidated and extremely small. Sitting on the toilet in an upright position was impossible as the hand basin was located in such a position to prevent this. The shower unit was big enough for a small child at best, not that I would not subject a child (or anyone else) to using the bathroom in the first instance. RUDE SERVICE I encountered several problems with the person on duty at reception: 1) He accused me of over-using the WiFi service and causing it to fail (anyone with any technical knowledge of internet technology would know this is a ridiculous accusation) 2) He demanded that I \"SPEAK LOUDER\" when discussing the issue of payment for the WiFi service. Note that I had concerns about the reliability of the internet service when I checked in due to the shabby state of the hotel reception area, and was provided the access password in advance to ensure the system would work. The \"SPEAK LOUDER\" incident occurred after the WiFi service had stopped working. 3) When I enquired as to how long it would be before the internet service would be restored I was given the response \"I don't know\". I asked whether it might be an hour, the morning, the day... still the answer was \"I don't know\". 4) When checking out I attempted to advise the manager of these issues. He spoke over me and never gave me the opportunity to explain my reasons for checking out early. BREAKFAST Breakfast was offered for 2 pounds. All that was available was corn flakes, rice bubbles, orange juice, coffee, bread and some spreads. It was poorest breakfast I have ever seen, let alone for a hotel. DEMAND FOR FURTHER PAYMENT / REFUND REFUSAL When I informed the manager that I was leaving, he demanded payment for the WiFi internet service (which had failed by this time) and the breakfast (which as stated above was completely unsatisfactory). The manager stated nonetheless that I should pay for these services. Furthermore, even though the manager was fully aware that no refund was available upon early checkout for the remaining two days booked, he stated that I should contact expedia.com to seek a refund. This was an obvious, outright and extremely insulting lie. Given the hotel had received payment for the following two nights of the booking, the WiFi service had failed, the breakfast was unacceptable and I had paid for two unused nights of accommodation I refused to pay for these services, and even then felt very much ripped off!

The hotel itself is a budget hotel, so don't expect luxury accommodations. Our room was clean. The bathroom was a combination toilet, sink and shower in a corner of the room.

We were given our room and when we got into it we could not believe our eyes....the room was tiny, smelled and didnt appear very clean at all! On a closer inspection the bed looked like it hadnt been changed in weeks, the toilet was absolutely tiny - It actually looked like a portaloo had been stuck onto the side of the room, but also managed to fit a shower and a sink, so it was impossible to move in it. The light in the toilet was hanging off, which is pretty dangerous considering its surrounded by water. The mould and grime on the window/door was revolting (please look at my pictures), and when the bedside drawer was opened we were faced with a half eaten jar of jam, tub of nutella and lots of crumbs! This proved that the room hadnt been cleaned properly for our arrival! :-( The room also had no lock on the door from the inside, so you wouldnt have felt safe during the night. We left our luggage in the hotel, and went to enjoy the start of our holiday. The hotel makes you leave your key at the reception which on looking back was a bad sign. After we left we decided that we couldnt stay there, so we phoned the hotel and they agreed to change our room when we got back from our day out. When we arrived back at the hotel, the receptionist, still as happy as ever, told us that he had moved all our luggage to a different room, in a DIFFERENT HOTEL without informing us. We tried to kick up a fuss about it as they had done this without telling us anything, when they did have a contact number to do so, but the man was extremely rude and didnt see what was so wrong with what he had done. I asked to look in the room which we were in, to ensure that no personal belongings had been missed, but he wouldnt let us, and said the room was being used by other guests already, which i highly doubt because nobody could stay there. He then told us to follow him to the other hotel, and whilst following him, he never said a word to us, not a single sorry passed his lips. On arriving at the other hotel, and after being shown our room - which was no better, i asked the man for his name incase anything turned out to be missing. He told us that we had to check our luggage infront of him to ensure that nothing was missing, and that as soon as he left he was not being held responsible for anything. I kept asking him for his name, which he refused to give us, and would only give us his managers name and the hotels phone number. He then walked out and left us to it. Still no apology! :-( We decided that we couldnt stay in the new hotel either as it was just as unclean. This one was called the Corbigoe Hotel. So we decided to find another hotel and stay there. I would no way recommend any of these hotels. For a cheap and cheerful hotel i would recommend the hotel we eventually found which was easyhotels.com - an easyjet hotel on Belgrave Road too.

We turned up to the shabby Park Hotel to be greeted with a grunt from a man behind a glass window. 'Name!' So i replied hoping that our booking had all gone through ok and we had a room for the night seeing as it was now 9pm on a Friday night and we were shattered. Finally a piece of paper was slapped in front of me and i was told to sign. Next the man popped up and said right ur not staying here, ill take you to another hotel down the road. Me and my missus kinda looked at each other and thought ok. We were escorted to an ever shabbier hotel with stick on signs called the 'CORBIGOE' obviously a chain. Here there was a lot of talking in what i think was Urdu, then we were given a huge key and told our room was on the 1st floor. 3 Floors up! we found our room, the door kinda of fell open key or no key, the gap was so huge a small child could have probably sqeezed their way in. Wow the room! Ok it was something from the dark ages, the curtains were hanging off the bedding was filthy, it stank of excrement and smoke. The bed was slammed to the wall and there was another rockety bunk bed in there. The view was a brick wall, the plug sockets were the acient 3 pin type to stop anyone using power (no mobile phone charging). And the wardrobe was hanging open as it was missing 2 legs. I opened the bathroom and had to quickly shut it again before i caught something, the tv was hanging off a bracket and sparked as i turned it on. I think i found HELL! We quickly went downstairs and made a complaint. The man their then made us wait as others were booked in, constantly being told their cards wouldnt work in the VISA machine. A couple passed us and shouted at them man 'There better be a blanket in our room later its like the north pole in there' . They stomped out. Finally after about half hour the man spoke to us and showed us 3 other rooms all generally as bad as each other, none as bad the first but still dangerous to your health to stay in. Next we were told right we can go back to the Park and be shown some rooms there, they were just as bad, one even smelt like a gas leak! We had had enough by this time and told the guy were going, he said ok and that we would be charged for one night, he in fact did not even contact the travel company and if it hadnt been for me doing this i would have been charged for another night. So 10.30pm off we go in search for another hotel and may i recommend the Novatel! You get what u pay for in London! So in a nutshell, the staff are useless liars.

After telling the receptionist of our booking he told us the credit card we had used didn't work so we had to be moved down the road to a different hotel. We followed the man to the reception of another hotel where he told us we would be staying. The man at the new hotel said he didn't want us, so like a heard of cattle we were ushered back to the original 'Park Hotel'. Once there he told us he had a room for us, however there wasn't enough beds in the room, so he would arrange for a mattress to be put on the floor for a 10 pound discount. Reluctantly, and with no other option, we accepted and made out way to the room. We then couldn't get into the room because it was still being 'cleaned'. The guy who was cleaning was taking so long messing around I offered to hoover up for him, just to get rid of him and so we could get into our room. It was hardly cleaned as it was, cans outside the window from previous guests, a manky shower/toilet room, no towels and no toilet paper. The view from the window was spectacular, a breeze block and a metal bar! The bathroom was a box in the corner, where the toilet was placed so you couldn't sit on it with the door closed. The shower curtain looked like it had previously been a piece of wallpaper, and the pipe to the shower head provided most of the water to the shower, not the shower head.

Needless to say, it was a squeeze trying to shower and not bang one's elbows on the surrounding walls, or to use the toilet without banging against the unlockable door. It is high time for the piping system to be replaced as there were loud sounds whenever the taps are open and funny smells ensued from the water outlet. Breakfast was simple but sufficient - unlimited amounts of orange juice, coffee, tea, toast, cereals.

Even after this time I still can't get over how bad it was. My wife and I stayed with another couple who we were travelling with in the very bottom room of the place (it had two double beds). Our first impression was VERY LOW BUDGET, but we had accepted it would probably be cheap and nasty when we booked - and we had decided the location was worth the risk. I can still remember the room and its problems even now. I get a chill down my spine thinking of it. Here's a list of what was wrong: 1) My wife pulled back the bedsheets and found a used band-aid. So much for clean sheets! We slept in sleeping bags instead on top of the bed. The beds were also awful. I'm sure they must have been on Noah's Ark. 2) Our room was right below the entrance. Every time (lasting until 2am in the morning) when someone entered the hotel above us, we were all woken by the creaking floor above. 3) The shower/toilet/basin made it possible to simultaneously shower, do a #2 and clean your teeth at the same time. Not that we did, but it was the first (and only) such bathroom where this would be theroretically possible that we have seen. 4) On the subject of the bathroom - a furry mould grew in it, and water leaked out of it into the room at the rate that the Thames River discharges into the sea. 5) The TV was precariously placed on a wardrobe. I refused to sleep under it because I felt that either the TV would fall down, or the wardrobe would collapse - either case leading to a visit to the Royal London Hospital if it happened. I was frankly amazed that the TV was in colour given its age. 6) Some rude staff. One of the staff members would abuse his cleaning staff in front of guests for being 2 minutes late. Very unprofessional, and also uncomfortable. 7) Stairs down to our room were so narrow I had to go down sideways. I am not overweight. The width of the stairwell would have been approximately 40-50cm. So far... 7 points against. The only plus is the location. We did stick it out for our full 5 nights, though, as we didn't have the money to book a better place. I'm not quite sure what ill effects I suffer to this day after staying there - but I'm sure there must be something. No one could stay in a place like that and not pick up some disease/fungus. Oddly enough one staff number took a liking to us. He even referred to us \"Ah my friends from number 1\" (our room number was 1).

My wife and I stayed at the Park Hotel for one night in 2003. We often reminisce about our experience there, and I logged on to Trip Advisor recently to see if anything had changed. Surprisingly, the hotel seems just as awful as it was in 2003. I am frankly shocked that the health authorities have not shut this \"hotel\" down. As was the case with so many other individuals who have reviewed the Park, we stayed there due to its proximity to Victoria Station. We were flying back to the States the next day and just needed a place that was convenient for one night. We stopped into a British Tourist Information office near Victoria Station, and the employee there told us that we'd \"really like the Park\". We were surprised at having to pay the hotel prior to our stay, but figured that the room would at least be passable. As so many other reviewers have stated, this is the worst, most disgusting, unhygienic hotel that I have ever seen. At first, it just seems small (especially the \"bathrooms\"), a little smelly, and laughable, but it rapidly goes downhill after a few minutes. Neither my wife nor I were initially willing to admit to the other that the place was awful - especially after we had paid for the night. It was only later that we discovered that each of us was ready to leave the moment we got into the room. In fact, my wife deliberately stayed up the whole night, fearing that sleeping on the bed would give her some sort of disease. I awoke after a fitful sleep to the overpowering stench of disinfectant in the combination sink/toilet/shower that measured perhaps 2-1/2 feet squared. I'm convinced that the Park stays open due to some sort of questionable arrangement with various regulatory agencies and/or the British Tourist Authority. It certainly can not get its customers through repeat business. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually recommend staying at the Park for one night. It will make you appreciate literally anywhere else in the world you stay. It will also give you a benchmark for atrocity in service, cleanliness, truth in advertising, and anything that can possibly go wrong in the hospitality field.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NH", "Title": "\u201cBooked a Double Room, got a Bunk Bed\u201d", "Author": "Michiel096", "ReviewID": "UR7871689", "Content": "I booked a Double Twin Room, more than 4 months in advance.

It was, to be fair, quite close to victoria station, although at least 15 hotels are closer. We found our room, un-cleaned at 3pm, to be about as big as most standard box rooms in student flats. The TV was hanging onto the wall for dear life by a bracket that doubled as a wardrobe. There was a gap of about 2 inches between the bed and the walls. The bathroom was essentially a large plastic sink, walled into the corner of an already small room with the pleasant odour of mildew eminating from within. The hot water outlet had no tap, so just poured out onto the floor. The shower took around 15 minutes to warm up. Unfortunately to leave the shower running for 15 minutes meant that the badly fitted shower curtain blocked the plug hole, flooding the bathroom and dripping on the unfortunate souls below you. If you wanted to play a practical joke on someone, you might book them a week in the park.

The first place we try is the Corbigoe Hotel, 101 Belgrave Road. They tell my partner it will \u00a395 to stay the one night. After a 3 mintue haggle, we managed to get it down to \u00a345. We weren't expecting much, just a place to lie our heads down for the night with the basic needs one expects in a country such as England. So, we were told to walk down to number 64 Belgrave road...which was indeed the Park Hotel. We were 'greeted' by a very rude Pakistani man who tried to say the agreed price was not \u00a345 but higher and was playing games. As it was 3:00 am we were not in the mood for this, we just wanted to sleep...however, we insisted he calls his colleague at the Corbigoe Hotel. He reluctantly did so and then mumbles to us 'ok , but three pounds extra for paying by debit card'. 'Hmm' we thought, ok fine , whatever. So we get given our key to room 205 (right next door to reception) Once we entered that room, we could not believe our eyes. You could argue: well what do u expect if u pay \u00a345 for a hotel in central London. But this is no exaggeration, this place was a flea pit, stinking, crumbling, health hazardous hell hole of a room. We actaully laughed in disbelief. Then we opened a scummy looking door to what the hotel refers to as the bathroom. Imagine you are in Delhi, find the most poverty-stricken neighbourhood you can find, then go into the dirtiest looking restaurant u can find then ask to use the 'bathroom''. I could safely say hand on my heart, the bathroom in Delhi would be cleaner and more efficient than this one in London, at the Park Hotel. I immediately pulled the bed sheets off as I expected them to also be filthy. This is the only aspect whichI was not horrified at. The bed linen was relatively clean and fresh smelling. After seeing the room how it was I expected the bed linen be soiled in something nasty to keep in theme with the rest of the room. Phew, we thought, maybe we could just survive it until check out at noon. As we got ready for bed, and took our socks off we suddenly felt that our feet were damp. The carpet in the room was sopping wet! I knelt down to see if it was cleaning solution but instead I got a whiff of a rancid stench. Yummy! The only place I felt relatively safe was in the bed, but with the worry that the light which was directly above our bed , which was hanging by a string and could potentially drop at any moment and kill us! After actually dismantling the light ourselves so we could rest, we prepared to sleep. At around 5 am we were woken to the sounds of doors banging and people leaving and various other peculiar sounds. This was not really a big deal to me. I am still in shock how a hotel of this atrocious standard can be allowed to take business as it really is not only below standard, it is seriously dangerous. We checked out a noon which was the agreed time and we were aggresively asked by the man at reception to pay \u00a310 for checking out 'late' .Needless to say there was no way were were parting with more money. This place is not worth even 2 pence for a years stay. I said to the man how shocked I was that this hotel can exist how it is, not to mention putting their prices at \u00a395 before negotation. He then shouted back at me that I should stay at the holiday inn if I wanted a shower that worked. Hmm, interesting. We have found the whole experience quite amusing, what else can u do? I am just writing this so that anyone thinking of using this hotel, my advice.... you would be better off buying a sleeping bag from millets and finding yourself a park bench. You'd have fresh air, it's free (minus the sleeping bag cost) and you'd be cleaner by not washing in this hotel, and even if you stay in the clothes you have been wearing for over a month, walked through a swamp, and rolled around in pigs pooh....You'd still be cleaner and have had a more pleasent experience than at this DUMP of a 'hotel' Dont stay at this dreadful place!

The coffee facilities did not include sugar and when I asked for some was told 'five minutes'. However, two hours later it hadn't arrived. Whether it would ever have come or not I do not know. The final straw was when I went to the loo (which was in a room with a shower and was in total no larger than a coach toilet) and after doing the necessary, could not locate any loo paper. In addition, there was only one towel - a small hand towel which would have made it tricky to dry oneself after a shower - assuming the shower worked of course, which based on the rest of the facilities was probably very doubtful. The sink was filthy and had red stains, the origin of which makes the mind boggle. No way was I prepared to stay in this place overnight, even though I had paid upfront for three nights - so I left.", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cHorrible service!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4392760", "Content": "My family of 5 had booked 2 rooms via the internet.

As our flight out of london was in the evening and we had to check out in the afternoon, we checked with the reception on whether we could keep our bags in a spare room till we left for the airport on our last day. The man at the reception was nice about it initially. The next day there however, he told us he'd have to levy a fee of 3 pounds per piece of luggage! we've stayed in numerous hotels round hte world, and this was the first itme ever a hotel asked for luggage storage fee! When we disagreed, he got really nasty. Needless to say, we checked out of the hotel and stored our luggage in left luggage at the airport. Terrible service. Downright nasty people.

I made the reservations almost three months before through an internet site I\u00b4ve used several times before with good results. When we came to the Park Hotel we met a rather surly gentleman who didn\u00b4t seem especially interested in having us as his guests. After I\u00b4d registered he asked whether we would like breakfast, as, he said, this was not included in the price we\u00b4d already paid through the internet site. Unfortunately I had not printed all the information from the site, because there it said clearly that breakfast was included. Breakfast would be (after a while of thinking) five pounds a day for the two of us. As we didn\u00b4t att all like the look of the premises we saw behind the little reception area (looked like a tiny breakfast room, dark and dirty), we said no thanks. All of a sudden there was some problem with our room and he said he would have to send us down the road to another hotel. We didn\u00b4t object as we thought the alternative could hardly be worse than the Park Hotel. So we wound up att the Carbigoe Hotel att 101 Belgrave Road. There we met the only positive part of the whole experience: a rather nice gentleman in the reception. The room was tiny, the shower certainly had both hot and cold water, but the water came mainly out of the tubing as the showerhead was clogged. Two out of four lights in the room and bathroom worked. The bed did have clean sheets, but the rest of the room was dirty, wall-to-wall carpeting of dubious colour, drapes that were graying from dust, ingrown dirt in the bathroom; no one knows what hid under the bed, we certainly didn\u00b4t look and I\u00b4m quite sure nobody else has for years and years. In spite of it all (and thanks to the clean sheets!) we decided to stay the two nights we\u00b4d already paid for and not let the sorry state of the hotel destroy our visit to London, rather take it as a lesson for the future. But please, if you can avoid our mistake, search for another hotel, there are lots of them i London, not all clean, but hardly any in sorrier state than the Park-Carbigoe!", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cNot so cold\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3836222", "Content": "I don't know how someone from Canada managed to be freezing cold in August in Britain.

It was, at that time, described as a cosy, family run Hotel. It was dingy and small and had no heat, We had booked a month early and Expedia had charged us the rent in advance otherwise we would have left and found some place else. They tried to give us a room in the basement we argued with them and then they tried to put us into a room on the first floor. That room was small with a double bed filling the space. The room had a narrow corridoe leading to a grimy window looking out to a light shaft. The corridor was being used to store, upended single beds, making it impossible to get to the window. We finally got a room on the third floor overlooking the grimy rooftops. Of course no lift. The room was dirty the window was so filthy that you could hardly look out of it. The blankets were so dirty we wouldn't sleep under them. The room was freezing cold. We went out for some supper and I told the receptionist that the radiator wasn't working and she assured me she would have someone fix it. When we returned to the room it was still icy cold and the radiator was like a fridge. I went back down to the reeception to encounter a new person who informed me that they can't get an electrician at night....the radiator is supposed to be steam. He offered to give me an extra blanket. We couldn't/wouldn't use the filthy one we already had. I noticed the reception area was toasty warm and saw that it was being warmed by a couple of electric heaters. I demanded one of the them and he agreed and actually carried it up to the room and plugged it in. We spent the night, fully clothed lying on top of the bed. The shower was so small and filthy we wouldn't use it and the toilet flushed only after repeated flushing. We certainly suggest that if anyone is considering this hotel...don't.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester,uk", "Title": "\u201cStay Away\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3706336", "Content": "All the other reviews seem to be telling the truth, pay a bit extra and stay somewhere else .Oh and yes there are bed bugs.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmoe, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cStay in a Park instead\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3607365", "Content": "Stay somewhere else, please!", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d224393-Reviews-Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$100 - $555*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">64 Belgrave Rd, Victoria</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 2BP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514284", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e9/ab/e9abca1a15eed7b5a3de9765b5ea5e564large.jpg"}}
