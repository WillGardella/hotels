It would have been a very pleasant stay except that the woman who works at the desk was crabby, bordering on rude. She seemed to think we were trying to sneak our kids into the family room that we had booked - she chased us down to say that our room rate would increase because we had more than two people in the room. Somehow the communication that we needed a family room for a family had not made it through during the booking process. Bottom line is that this is a nice place but don't expect a warm and inviting reception from the staff.

It is in a perfect location, on a quiet street but near many restaurants and shops, super clean, and extremely affordable (5 stars). The customer service was also wonderful. The staff was very nice and answered any questions, and also gave some restaurant recommendations. We also liked the breakfast (not included, but very cheap!). Unfortunately I had just as many dislikes as I did likes (1 star). Based on previous reviews I asked for a \"garden view\" room to keep away from street noise. The room was super quiet, but our view was basically an alleyway. Fortunately we had 2 huge windows which we kept open the entire week. Keep in mind the hotel doesn't have air conditioning. It was super hot when we were there. Another issue I had was the bed. It was incredibly hard (probably the hardest bed I've ever slept on) and we didn't have normal pillows! Instead there was a long soft roll shaped pillow (about 6 inches thick). When we asked for some pillows, they sent us to grab some from another room (what?! what if there wasn't an empty room??). So we stole some pillows, and fortunately found a small fan in the room too (so we \"borrowed\" that as well). I found another blanket in the closet, and ended up sleeping on that for some extra padding. The room was tiny, but this is often expected in Europe. However, it was so tiny there wasn't a dresser, but we had a few shelves and a tiny closet. The bathroom was a pretty good size compared to the room, but the shower was so small you had to turn the shower head diagonally away from the doors, or the water would spray out of the shower and onto the bathroom floor. There was also a bidet in the bathroom. My thoughts? Perhaps get rid of the bidet, and put in a dresser, or a larger shower? Just a thought :) The bars of soap were the size of my thumb. We went through 4 of them while we were there, and had to keep asking for extras (instead of them being replaced for us w/out asking). And finally, the towels... they were so thin and rough, I can't imagine they have been replaced in years. As I said, I really wanted to love this hotel. It has potential, but definitely needs some updates.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "DH", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel for a weekend away\u201d", "Author": "TKgirl", "ReviewID": "UR117441999", "Content": "The location is perfect: in the 2nd district with many breakfast places, bars, restaurants and metro stations nearby.

My last stay was (in June 2010) for three weeks. I am very happy there. This is a hotel where not only international guests come to stay but the French actually come to stay too. I think that's a good sign. I find the staff warm, welcoming, friendly, helpful and witty. I very much appreciate how considerate the staff is too. The policy is to always leave your room key at the front desk anytime you go outside the hotel. That way, they know when you're not around and that's when they go in and clean. So you'll never have to put up with housekeeping knocking on the door wanting to come in and do the room before you're ready. If you want to sleep in: no worries. I always stay in a single room with toilet down the corridor. It's more comfortable than it sounds. I've always had the impression that I wasn't sharing with very many people and the shower and basin in my single room are always kept sparkling clean and there's heaps of hot water. All the single rooms I've stayed in are at the back of the hotel, so I've never been aware of any road noise. There are bars and cafes very close by and in all the times I've stayed at Hotel Vivienne, I've been kept awake by noise from any of them only once. And I'm a very light sleeper. I recommend ear plugs if you are too. The beds are comfortable and so are the rooms. Some of the single rooms are humorously small but you're rewarded by a gorgeous view of Paris roof tops. I can't believe the location of Hotel Vivienne can be beaten. You can walk to everything and if you're pressed for time, the Metro, RER and pick up and drop off bus stops are all within a block or so. Meals are easy. You can have breakfast brought to your room, have it in the dining room, go a few doors down to Bogary's and buy the lightest croissants for under 1 euro or go to one of the surrounding cafes. For other meals there are brasseries with fixed price menus, cafes, a Chinese/Thai restaurant round the corner, pasta places and dare I say it, a Mcdonalds. Or self cater and go to Monoprix around the other corner. I've had a stickybeak in some of the double rooms with full bathrooms and they are modestly charming.

Very exciting. The Breakfast at the Pain Quotidienne is thoroughly recommended. 8 Euro for a Full Continental with Coffee/Tea, Orange Juice (Freshly squeezed) and the largest selection of Jams and Spreads on lovely home baked breads and buttery croissants.

It has been updated and modernised since my last visit but I still wouldn't choose another hotel as this is central, clean, good value and I have always found the staff to be nothing but helpful and polite. Hotel Vivienne is perfectly placed to visit all the central sights. We walked for miles due to the centrality of the hotel. They ordered taxis, booked restaurants and kept bags after check out until our flight home. Our twin room with ensuite was clean and of a high standard. I remember that the bed on my last stay was incredibly soft and the floor was rather uneven but does that not simply add to the charm of staying in a old fashioned, 'family' run hotel and not in a cloned modern one? No, it is not the Ritz but it is an affordable, clean and, location-wise, perfect place to stay.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, CT", "Title": "\u201cGood Buy!\u201d", "Author": "hedylarue", "ReviewID": "UR3285131", "Content": "This hotel is a great deal for the money.

After reading all the reviews here we thought we had made an excellent choice and were expecting a lot. It was probably because of these high expectations that we were a bit disappointed to discover our room was average; small bed, small room, thin walls, noise from the outside. We also discovered that our room was not flat and we felt a bit like sleeping up a hill. We changed rooms the next day without much of a hassle and were more happy with this room, which was bigger, less noisy and flat! The pro is that the rooms are clean, the showers hot and the location right in the centre. So I guess it's good value for money (\u20ac 67,- per night) We will try another hotel next time though, and maybe pay a little more...

The hotel has a terrific lobby though its lift is amazingly tiny and its walls can be rather thin. The corridors are abit scruffy but the rooms are clean and comfortable. The service staff weren't too friendly but it could be because they're French. Most importantly, the hotel was in a very good location. There are lots of places to eat at and the metro is very near.

The one and only criticism I have ever had of this hotel, and I have stayed there on several occasions now, is the size of its lift...It is only suitable for 2/3 persons with a limited amount of luggage.
