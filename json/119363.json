I never witnessed trash, ash trays or the smell of cigarettes. It was sheer pleasure staying at this hotel. The extended continental breakfast was more than fulfilling, it was down right wholesome, right down to the creamy oatmeal with brown sugar that I enjoyed every morning as I do at home. The hotel staff made us feel welcomed from the very beginning and during the duration of our stay. I truly enjoyed talking with Ms. Judy my last night at the hotel, we talked as if we knew each other from another time. The only problem we had was our refrigerator didn't work well but room service sent someone within minutes of our call for repairs.

When I responded to their confirmation and requested that it be cancelled, I was met with silence. I can understand a delay in opening, but why this property would choose to violate my privacy as well as their merchant agreement with American Express is beyond me. Why would they presume that it was reasonable for us to stay over 20 miles away from where we needed to be? 72 hours before a two week business trip, I had to place a fraud alert on my Amex to protect myself. If there was a plan B for those of us with reservations, some clear communication would have resolved this entire issue.
