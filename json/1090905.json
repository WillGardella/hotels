{"Reviews": [{"Content": "GRIM!!!! Good location. Near restaurants, riverwalk etc. However, that's where the good stuff including the (in-)famous Singapore efficiency ends. Asked to fill out an inventory list on arrival to confirm everything they said they had was there. I am sure travellers everywhere are thinking of flying for the better part of a day to Singapore with two children  3 years to rip off a couple of tea spoons. On departure, had the Room Service Rep hanging over me for a signature for the inventory list while I was trying to change a nappy. Unbelievable.Service appalling. Meant to be a serviced apartment but has no apparent services....or soap, dishwashing liquid/powder or any of the other basics that are typical on arrival at a serviced apartment. We did get a free voucher for a movie which we could have watched on the TV if it worked.Common areas on way to rooms in dire need of a refurb or could somebody clean them please. Not sure if that would fix the smell though which was a cross between stale cigarette smoke and rising damp. Thankfully, the rising damp smell had subsided in the apartment. The aroma of cigarettes passed unforutnately had not. Second bedroom had no room for second childrens bed which meant child #2 was in a cot in the main bedroom in front of the closet. We didn't stay long enough to need to use the closet.Allocated 3 towels - too bad there was four guests. Bathrooms had no hot water on arrival.The quiet room was actually reasonably quiet once the two cranes and the jackhammers on the construction site next door shut down at about 9.30 pm.Stayed less than 24 hours but had to eat the 3356 SGD weekly rate for the pleasure. The long and the short of it is that, having been to Singapore heaps of times, there is no excuse for not having a nice reasonably priced place to stay. Park Avenue Suites is not one of them. Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else.", "Date": "Jun 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR658921027", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Marcelco"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1090905-r17249201-Park_Avenue_Suites-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "1090905", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_1090905\">"}}
