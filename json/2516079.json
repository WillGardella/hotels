This LQ would've gotten 5 stars, but they didn't have a real good pet relief area. I had to walk my dog to the Taco Bell parking lot so my dog could go potty. Other reviews made it seem like this hotel was in the ghetto or something. I mean it's not Beverly Hills, but I've seen WORSE parts before. It's a very busy area since it's close to LAX. I never felt uncomfortable in the area. Yes they do charge 15 bucks a nite for parking but it's LA....you pay for parking everywhere! The breakfast was great, but I would suggest going early because this hotel is always packed, and the breakfast area gets crazy! Another reason I'm not giving this LQ 5 stars is because they didn't have all 3 elevators working. For a hotel this size, and this busy, they really need to have all elevators working. There were times we waited for 20 minutes for an elevator because most of the time they were full and we had to wait longer than expected. Other than that our stay was great. If you don't have a car, they do have a Mcdonald's next door, Subway is across the street and it's a 24 hour Subway too! There is also a Taco Bell in walking distance.

The staff at the desk was competent and helpful. No concierge though, but the desk staff can help. The lobby is just a step above a budget motel lobby. If you want luxury, go elsewhere. The hotel location is on the edge of sketchy. It's located about 1.5 miles east from the LAX terminal one, straight down Century Blvd. If you continue 1/2 mile further east you get into some less desirable spots for tourists (Inglewood). I walked several times 3/10 of a mile east of La Quinta to eat at Panda Express, Pollo Loco and to buy snacks at 7-Eleven. I had no problems, but the area under the overpass for the 405 freeway, that you have to walk through, is dark, dingy, and filthy. There is also a 24 hr. Subway across the street from the hotel and a Taco Bell a short walk to the west. The hotel has a reasonably priced menu in its restaurant, but I didn't eat there. I had a room with a King bed. The bed leaned to the hard side, but I slept comfortably on it. The bedspread was slightly worn with a hole in it, but the sheets were clean. The bathroom was tiny. The bathroom's open door was only about 6 inches from the toilet. Otherwise it was clean and the massage type shower head over the tub was good. Larger soap bars and conditioning shampoo were good. Towels were not thick and luxurious. They were not worn out but were thin and rough. A hairdryer is provided as well as a coffee maker. There was a nice (40\" ?) LCD Samsung TV that had three ShowTime movie channels plus various other cable TV selections. I had a microwave and a small fridge in the room. Room temp was easy to control with the wall mounted digital thermostat. Sometimes they were late (after 4pm) getting fresh towels into the bathroom. the room was cleaned but they would bring the towels later. Sounds from the hall seemed to pass through the door as if there was no door there. I started wearing ear plugs to be able to sleep well. Many guests were very inconsiderate or at least unaware of how the noise they were making penetrated into the rooms even very late into the night. The guests are a little less refined than you see at the Hilton or Radisson I stayed at recently. Pets are apparently allowed in the rooms. There was no evidence that a pet had ever been in my room, but I saw many dogs with their owners in the hotel. One very large Mastiff and its owner accompanied me in the elevator one day. Three elevators in the 10 floor hotel that are sometimes very quick to move to your floor to pick you up and sometimes very slow. Push both buttons to get one to you sooner. A small corner couch, a footstool ottoman and a desk to work at which is part of the 6 drawer dresser in the room. The room was well lit with three lamps. There is a small pool on the 4th floor and an extremely small fitness room on the 2nd floor with two treadmills, a stationary bike and an elliptical I think. That\u2019s it. No hot tub in the hotel. There was free breakfast 6am to 9am which included mini muffins, coffee, scrambled eggs, pre-made waffles, orange, apple juice, water, white bread only to make toast, warm oatmeal (not instant) with raisins, brown sugar, and granola to add if desired, yogurt, bananas, apples and oranges and 3 types of dry cereal and 2% milk.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, OK airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "sailor908", "ReviewID": "UR126244635", "Content": "We booked this hotel simply for a place to sleep after a late flight, so we weren't too particular.

It took her another 15 minutes to bring the drinks plus the raspberry iced tea we ordered was over exaggerated sweet! We had to ask for a glass of water to mix it in. The food was not bad but for the next time I rather go somewhere else for dinner. Overall good hotel.

Instead of staying at the Westin, we stayed across the road at La Quinta. It is adjacent to Holiday Inn and essentially shares the yard with it. Check-in took seconds; the clerk named Frankie was very friendly and professional at the same time. We asked for a quiet room and Frankie gave us one facing away from the road, on a higher floor. Fantastic choice! We could the the scenic mountains in the morning. The room was fairly basic, but clean and bright. Finally, this hotel figured out room lighting so you can actually see at night ! In-room fridge and microwave, coffeemaker with a stainless steel pot, iron and ironing board, free WiFi that reaches across the road and an LCD TV - all great things to have when you are away. I would call the decor Spanish colonial, with a lot of orange, warm yellow and white, with blue accents, as you would often see in tropical places. The furniture was clean and sturdy, no complaints at all. The bed was soft and comfortable; the headboard was like a large addition to the wall above, which was nice. The only surprise was feather-filled pillows, but they also had synthetic pillows. I guess every taste could be satisfied. We noticed a security representative in the lobby at all times, it was reassuring. Breakfast was nothing to write home about: scrambled eggs, toast, Belgian waffles (you don't get to make your own), muffins, yogurt, fruits and a few other little goodies. We did not encounter any meat items for breakfast over two days. Breakfast is served starting at 6 am. One more odd thing: Orange Juice had an unnatural taste to it. I gather it was reconstituted from powder. Very disappointing for a hotel in California! The first night, we grabbed a bite at the hotel restaurant. Two bowls of veggie soup and a bowl of sliced fruit came up to $19 after taxes. Call me strange, but I think it's a lot, so we never went back for lunch or dinner. Speaking of eating out, there aren't a lot of places to eat nearby. There is a Subway and an Internet cafe/restaurant across the road (both get very busy during lunch when there is a convention at Westin); Taco Bell and Macdonald's. People say, there is a Chinese restaurant on the other side of the highway, but we haven't walked there. There are about 20 car rental places in the three buildings surrounding La Quinta, and there is one downstairs in this building, but we did not rent a car this time. Check-out was a breeze, too. They have a designated computer for those wishing to check-in to their flights and to print out boarding passes. We asked to leave our luggage until later in the day, and got the luggage stored for free in a storage room. A shuttle bus runs from La Quinta/Holiday Inn to the airport and back, and you do have to have a hotel bill to get on the bus at the hotel.

Although the bed was comfortable, the noise from the street below was quite loud throughout the night (10th floor, room 1019). The heating/cooling worked well but could not block out the noise and as a result, we did not have a restful stay. The pool area had been neglected during the day. There were no clean towels available and other travelers had left behind food, clothing and other items strewn about on the tables, chairs, and the ground so we decided against a swim in the pool. It was not an inviting atmosphere. There is a nice breakfast buffet in the morning, but our flight was too early for us to enjoy it. We did grab a cup of coffee from the early-bird set up in the lobby before we jumped on the fast, convenient free shuttle to the airport.

This hotel is very large and is obviously a reincarnation of what used to be a Holiday Inn or something, but I am more than satisfied. Tour groups were checking in as I arrived, and they were being handled efficiently without unduly delaying the individual traveler (me). Although located just outside the entrance to LAX and I could see the planes landing from my window, I heard no airplane noise. My room was freshly painted, with new carpeting and Ikea'ish furnishings, including an attractive vanity in the bathroom. The bed was as comfortable as most hotel beds and there were plenty of pillows. The towels in the bathroom were new and relatively thick. When I asked for late checkout, it was granted instantly. I didn't go to breakfast. There's a restaurant in the hotel, which is unusual for La Quinta, and even room service (with a very limited, but reasonably priced, menu) between 3 pm and 9 pm. There's a pool and a fitness center (I didn't visit either one). A free shuttle to the airport runs every 15 minutes 24 hours a day, though since it serves multiple properties you probably need to allow extra time for all the loading and unloading involved. There are 3 fast food restaurants on the block, including a 24-hour Subway across the street. The Westin Hotel across the street has a sit-down restaurant, although it does require walking to the end of a long block to cross busy Century Blvd. safely. There's even a bail-bond agency right across the street in case your LA vacation gets a little too wild! My king-bed room, which had a refrigerator and microwave, was well under $100 before taxes and parking, which is $15.

I noticed numerous security guards in the lobby as well as on the floors. I never felt like I needed them around, but nonetheless it's always nice to have extra security around. This is an airport hotel so the area is ok but not great. It is on a major street but from my perspective this made it convenient....though not necessarily for walking.

I was traveling with my wife, sister and dad. The first night, my wife and I had a room not facing the road, but my sister and dad had a room facing the road. When we checked out the first time, my dad asked for a room away from the road because it was VERY noisy from the 3rd floor (my wife and I only heard a few planes, which is to be expected). They said only rooms with 1 bed were away from the road so he asked to be higher up. When we stayed there a few nights later, both rooms were facing the road. We were on the top floor (10th) and my dad/sister were on the 6th. Even from the 10th floor, it truly felt like we were on the first with how noisy it was. I expected a little airplane traffic, but didn't expect to hear all of the hoopla in the streets. Both nights, we didn't get to our rooms until 1:00 AM so even at that time, very loud.

Breakfast was quite dull though (Hampton Inn's have a much better selection & 1000 times better coffee). There is a McDonalds about 150 feet away along with a gas station. So if you wanted snacks/food, you have access to it. I think there are a couple restaurants across the street as well, didn't check them out though. But, it all comes down to value.

I travel through LAX once a year from Australia, and I usually stay at the Super 8 LAX, which is also excellent value, but wanted a change of pace. So for avout $10 more, I thought I'd try out La Quinta. Check-in was very quick, and even though I arrived a little early before the check-in time, they were very understanding about my long overseas flight and got me into a room right away. This meant a lot to me, as I was dead on my feet. The room was absolutely spotless - being a former housekeeper, I am a harsh judge. But this place passed with flying colours. The decor was modern and very appealing - the sheets on the bed were new and crisp, and felt like 100% cotton. The bed was very comfortable, and the heater was easy to figure out, and the room was toasty in no time. The bathroom was totally modern, and again, super clean, with nice fluffy towels, hair dryer, etc. Hot water was no problem, and the water pressure in the shower was great. The room was also more spacious than I thought it would be. The view was rather average, but that was not a huge factor for me - the quiet of the room was more important, and it was nice and quiet during the day and during the night. The area is also pretty average, but then again, we're talking the LAX airport neighborhood - not a lot going on except for hotels and gas stations, it's not where the \"action\" is! The staff was great - very nice, and very professional. The free breakfast was pretty basic, but just fine for a light appetite - juice, bagels, muffins, that sort of thing. The dining area also had a nice decor. I had brought my laptop, and the WiFi service worked easily, no problems hooking up to the internet at all. The only criticism I have is the airport shuttle - be forewarned that unlike the Super 8 shuttle, it stops off at three other hotels, so I found it to be not as quick. I was worried that I would miss my flight, as I misjudged the time it would take the shuttle to get to the airport (hadn't expected all the stops!). And I did end up missing my flight, actually!!! So plan ahead, and take an earlier shuttle than you think you'll need. Not a big deal, just be aware of the time, and take a little more than you think you need.

Parking was $12 per day, added to $86/night made it quite reasonable. La Quinta has a boutiquish feel to it, with small rooms and nice (fancy) light fixtures, shower curtains, etc. Breakfast was adequate: scrambled eggs (quite good), pancakes with syrup, yogurt (strawberry?), cereal with milk, orange juice, iced tea (or maybe it was regular tea?), bagel w/cream cheese, bread with butter or jam, mini muffins like blueberry (teeny tiny muffins approx 2\" wide), there was a toaster machine to do all the toasting which lots of people wound up getting in line for, and fruit like small apples. Breakfast served from 6a to 9a. Do get there in time because this area gets crowded in the morning. Front desk is nice, the security guy is nice person too. I didn't know about the hotel shuttle service because I rented a car. There is a pool on the 4th floor that is kind of hard to find. It's all the way down on the end of the hall and you have to look for it and take some stairs down to an outdoor area. From what I could tell the pool was heated, but it wasn't 80 degrees or anything, maybe 68? It wasn't freezing cold. I enjoyed using the workout facility on the 2nd floor. Didn't use the treadmills, but did do my jump rope routine happily in front of the mirrors. The workout room is small, only 3 or 4 treadmills/bicycle machine type things (I didn't even bother to look because I don't use those things). There is a tv with remote inside with a water dispenser. The water dispenser was useful because I only needed to buy 1 bottle of water and refill it each day (learned this trick in Thailand). There was an ice machine on my floor (8th). I like the 12pm check out time, anything earlier is usually too early for me. Staff is all hispanic. There is a funny gift shop across the way, selling Mickey Mouse items, candy bars, and other misc stuffs. I don't like the way they do parking. You drive into the parking garage, grab a ticket, and then you have to take that ticket to the front desk so they can put it through the machine so you can leave the facility without paying twice. If someone is already at the desk, or there is a long line, you may wind up waiting a while just to get your parking ticket validated (potentially inconvenient). There is a McDonald's in the area and Subway. I didn't see any other fast food nearby. There is also AM/PM store next to the McDonald's that had the Listerine I needed to buy. This location is very close to \"rental car row\" which has all the rental cars people rent from the airport (Hertz, Budget, Avis, etc.). Would definitely consider staying here again when I come back into town in a few days. Oh, you are very close to the airport. I'm surprised airplane noise was not a bigger issue because those planes pretty much fly right over you. I could hear the airplanes flying overhead, but it was not really a big deal at all. Maybe if I were on the 10th floor it would be a big deal, but I was on the 8th. It was very quiet, sound proofing is very good, although if rude people were talking in the hallways I could hear it. The bed was great, not too soft, not too hard. 6 pillows total. Sheets were thin, I didn't like that part. The heater was quite loud, wound up turning it off completely. Temp control wasn't a big issue, Los Angeles in December, is not really hot or cold. My desk wasn't equipped with a free pen, not sure why. I had the King bed so it came with microwave and fridge. The fridge was useful to keep my fruits and water cold. Coffee maker located in the bathroom with coffee packets ready to use. This hotel is located approx 3 miles from decent shopping area. Just head straight west on Century (towards McDonald's) for about 3 miles and you'll run into Target, Ross, Marshalls, and a bevy of restaurants and stores. Free internet only worked for me in the lobby. I couldn't get it to work on the 8th floor. There are $5.99 lunch specials. Dinner is a little more pricey but they give you 20% off your restaurant meal when you check in. The food at the restaurant is surprisingly good, do not hesitate to eat there.

The gal at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly at check-in. The rooms were nice and clean, but on the small side with two double beds and a small bathroom, but fine for a family of 4. We had relatives staying in the room next to ours, so we were able to get two rooms with connecting doors which was handy. The outdoor pool was adequate....on the 4th floor. The kids said it was warm. Unfortunately there wasn't a hot tub though. We stayed on the 6th floor, Century Blvd. side, and had no trouble with car or jet noise. The beds were really comfortable, the laundry area nice - right down the hall from our room. The only downfall about this hotel would be the parking. You have to park in the garage even for check-in, but the first 20 min. are free. Warning - don't stay any longer than that or they'll charge you and you can't get out of the garage gate until you go back into the lobby and pay. There is a button on the ticket machine that connects you to the front desk, which we had to use twice because of mix-ups with our tickets. They let us through both times, but it was frustrating because we had a line up of cars behind us trying to get out of this tiny parking garage. More of a hassle than anything, but the only option for parking your car. Since we were extremely tired from spending all week at Disneyland, we called in a dinner order to the hotel restaurant. They were out of a few items that we wanted, but the food was pretty good, although a little on the expensive side. There is an In- and-Out Burgers on Sepulveda just about 5 min. away though, which we ate lunch at. If we weren't so tired we probably would have gone back there for dinner.....it was so delicious!!!!! We also were able to drive to Santa Monica Pier after we checked-in an hour early. It only took about 30 min. each way and was easy to get to. There are other beaches that are closer to the hotel though.

If I were consumer reports, I'd rate this a \"best buy\" My family and I stayed one night in December and another in January on layover to and from Mexico. The location was very convenient. It's close to the airport (located next door to the Holiday Inn Express) and we found the free airport shuttle service easy and reliable. The hotel is on the main strip of airport hotels (Century Blvd) which is a 6 or 8 lane main drag which can be congested at some times of the day. We had no problem at all in the evening, early morning or over the weekend getting to and from the airport in about 10 minutes. Also, regarding the location, there were some late night fast food options available within walking distance which included Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds. There was a subway across the street, but it was a very challenging and big street to cross, so I did not consider it. The hotel also offered some room service options. I walked to Taco Bell one night (little less than a block away) at about 11 p.m. The streets were pretty deserted and I noticed the hotel security watched me leave and waited and watched for my safe return. I found this comforting and thanked him. The hotel is not luxurious, but was EXTREMELY nice for the $72 rate we paid. (I booked on the LaQuinta website - checking often for price reductions as the rates did go down a couple of times and it was easy to cancel and rebook at the lower rate) In fact, the hotel would have been acceptable at $125 - $150. The rooms were recently remodeled, very modern with all standard amenities and very clean. The bathrooms were huge. We found the double rooms very accommodating for our family of four. I have attached photos for your review. Some of the extra values that I found impressive were the FREE wireless internet, FREE breakfast, Free airport shuttle (mentioned above), secure luggage check room and the Manhattan Beach trolley ($3 RT-tickets sold at hotel lobby desk) which stopped right in front of the hotel. I was able to access the hotel wi-fi easily with both my laptop and my iPhone. It also proved to be a fast connection. The breakfast was far more than continental. It offered fresh made waffles, yogurt with optional granola topping, 3 cold cereal choices, oatmeal, bagels with assorted optional toppings, muffins, apple and orange juice, coffee and tea. That's what I recall off the top of my head, but it seems there were even more selections. The Manhattan Beach trolley presented an awesome opportunity to kill a few hours during our layover. It makes several stops including the beach (where there is also an aquarium), stolling/shopping areas with boutique type stores and small cafes/restaurant and a stop at a beautiful large mall (where you will find an Apple Store, Bath & Body Works, Victoria Secrets and many other upscale mall stores of this type). The secure luggage check area is a room secured by a security guard (no one else has access) and we were able to check out early, spend the day at Manhattan Beach, retrieve our luggage by 4 p.m., take the airport shuttle and catch our 5:30 p.m. flight. Best of all, I found the staff at this hotel to be very friendly and willing to assist. From the desk clerks to the breakfast team, everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One last thing I forgot to mention is that the hotel has a pool. It is located above street level on the 3rd or 4th floor (I think). It was a nice size and looked inviting. I believe it is a heated pool, but check with the hotel as we did not use it during our stay. I would recommend the La Quinta LAX to anyone looking for a quick and easy airport hotel during a layover.

After 1/2 hour of watching, walking back and forth on the sidewalk trying to get any information, and no shuttle for La Quinta had even been seen however briefly, we gave up on that! We finally stood in a long lineup to get a taxi, and very few taxis appeared. When a taxi appeared, it often didn't take people from the start of the line. People would run out into the street and grab the door handle as the taxi slowed, and thus commandeer the taxi. Finally we got into a taxi when almost everyone else was gone. All in all we didn't get to the hotel until about midnight. The hotel is only about 10 minutes from the airport. We had about 6 hours in bed, and so were reasonably rested. The room was quiet and although close to the airport we were not bothered with airplane noise at all. We were back downstairs at 6:30 with our bags. The included breakfast looked good with fresh fruit and waffles, although we just grabbed a coffee and bun, and stood waiting for the hotel shuttle to take us back to the airport. We had to be there at least by 7:30 a.m. for an 8:30 flight. Finally a group of us, all waiting at the hotel entrance for the shuttle, began to plan to order cabs because the hotel shuttle, which is supposed to be every 15-20 minutes, was just not appearing! Two couples had the presence to mind to order a cab the night before, and they had left. Just as we were all trying to get the desk clerk to order cabs, at about 7:15 or slightly after, the shuttle appeared. The woman driver just said that she was held up in traffic. The net result was our panic on arrival at LAX and we almost didn't make our flight to Honolulu. I have already posted a note on the Los Angeles forum about the lineups at LAX, so I won't repeat it here. The bottom line: don't depend on the hotel shuttle, and see if you can make other arrangements to get back and forth to the hotel. Also be aware that people in Los Angeles are very rude, and you will have to be aggressive to get a taxi at the airport.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temple Hills, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jedivader", "ReviewID": "UR26104023", "Content": "Hotel is in a good location (near rental cars, LAX and freeways).

When we returned from our trip just went to the hotel shuttle spot and we were picked up and dropped off at the La Quinta again.

For the price we paid through Priceline, I don't feel like my friend and I received a bad deal at all. The room was ready for us when we checked in around 3 or 4pm and everything in the room was clean. The room was a bit small and not particularly well-stocked but again, based on the price, it wasn't anything we couldn't overlook. Pros: Close to several fast food restaurants, which is nice when it is late and you are looking for cheap eats. Decent breakfast buffet from 6am to 9am each morning. Close to the 405 highway and to many of the rental car offices, gas stations and LAX. Rooms have a hair dryer, microwave and refrigerator. There is a gift shop on the property that sells snacks, drinks, medications, magazines, etc. Cons: The parking situation is a pain. It is $12 a day for guests but in order to get into and out of the lot, you have to use pain in the neck parking stubs. And there is a prominent sign that warns if you lose your parking stub, you are facing a $200+ fine. To me, that seems rather harsh and we had to spend our time in LA paranoid that we had possession of the parking stub all at times. To leave, you must stop at the desk and have the clerk validate your parking. When there is a long line, this is particularly maddening. One afternoon, we had to wait 30 minutes behind a huge church group of people who were checking into the hotel one at a time. One clerk was working with these people while the other clerk was talking on the phone. All this waiting to simply have a parking stub validated seemed rather needless. There were times at night when noise became a major factor. Surprisingly, there wasn't much noise coming from the airplanes but there seemed to be quite a few guests making noise at all hours. A party of drunks knocked on our door at 2am each night that we were there and one night, we had to roll towels under the door to block out the smell of cigarette smoke and burnt food. These elements are not the fault of the hotel, but are things you should be aware of if you stay there. Bringing earplugs may not be a bad idea if you need a good night's sleep. All things considered, if you are able to negotiate a good price to stay here and are seeing LA on a tight budget (as we were), this is a good place to add to your hotel list.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cOnly average\u201d", "Author": "barbann78", "ReviewID": "UR15855934", "Content": "My husband's family and I stayed at this hotel for two nights this past weekend.

They also charged my in-laws $4 for a phone call to a pizza place right down the road (though they ultimately removed it). The breakfast buffet was sub-par. Not even an extensive selection of fresh pastries was offered as at most budget hotels! In fact, we ended up going to McDonald's the second morning.

The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport, but is not your typical airport hotel - nor your typical La Quinta. The decor in the rooms is very \"boutique\", just incredibly sophisticated. When you walk into the room you might as well be staying at a \"W\" or another hip property. From sculptured towels in the bathrom, to high tech lighting fixtures, from smart duvet covers to incredibly comfortable beds, it is hard to believe that this is a La Quinta. Really, the rooms are that nice... and spotlessly clean! Even the lobby suprises in its decor, presenting a mix of sophisticated California with a hip, New York edge. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, though not overly knowledgable about the area. We asked them where to eat and they clearly had no idea outside of the hotel restaurant. However, here is something that will amaze you. I was in LA calling on a client with corporate offices located nearly 20 miles away. Even our client knew about what a value this hotel offers. Our client actually said that the hotel restaurant was one of the best near the airport. I hardly ever eat at hotel restaurants, and didn't during this stay, so I can't say if their claims proved to be true. But isn't it surpising that a major buyer with one of North America's largest retailers would actually know about this hotel? Much less the restaurant? The LaQuinta LAX must enjoy an excellent reputation with the locals. Two suggestions... (1) All of the lighting fixtures in the room are in brushed steel, however the handles on the closet, main and bathroom doors are in tacky brass. They actually detract from the unbelievable presentation in the decor and would be easy to change out. (2) The television, which you aren't really going to watch anyway, is an old fashioned CRT model. This hotel cries out for an LCD wall mount television. The bathroom vanity is stunning. The artwork tasteful and sophisticated. Everything else about the room is fantastic. I have spent hundreds of dollars a night all over the world for rooms that aren't as well appointed as this.... just please replace the door hardware and the televisions. If you want a great location, convenient to the airport and interstates, friendly staff, and a room that will exceed your expectations.... book THIS LaQuinta. One final word, the check in girl said it was unsafe to walk anywhere after dark in the neighborhood. We had a car and never sensed any danger... however be cautious if you are on foot and don't receive a similar warning.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel at a Great Price\u201d", "Author": "daveqwerty", "ReviewID": "UR11302699", "Content": "We booked La Quinta over the internet (via expedia.ca) for a one-night stop-over in LA. On arrival at LAX, we were quite concerned to find that their phone number had been deliberately removed from their advertisement on the hotel phone-boards. However, on enquiry at the LAX information desk, we found that their shuttle stops regularly and continually at the red sign in the outside booth (too bad they didn't say this on the phone-board). The shuttle comes very quickly and service by the driver was exemplary. He loaded everybody's bags and then, once reaching the various hotels, unloaded the bags, remembering whose bags were whose -- pretty impressive! The shuttle serves about three different hotels which are very closely spaced and the total trip is only about 7 minutes max. The hotel was quite nice. Since we booked one of the cheaper rooms, we did not expect too much but it was very clean. The king-size bed was a bit hard but quite adequate. There was no room-safe which would have been a problem on a longer stay. The sink drain was clogged but on calling reception, a plumber appeared within 2 minutes and, when he couldn't fix it immediately, they very quickly apologized and moved us to a room down the hall. The employees wear a button asking you to tell them if they are not a \"10\" and I would say they tried very hard and we easily gave them a \"10\". The people in the restaurant were extremely friendly and bubbling over with enthusiasm and most helpful. Prices were reasonable and we had a great clubhouse sandwich. On the return stop-over, we stayed with them again. Booking via the internet gets a decidedly lower rate but I suspect a lower quality room as well. They must have changed cooks because the clubhouse sandwich this time was a total embarrassment to the facility but I wouldn't hold this against them since it was so great the previous time. We gave then a \"10\" and would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad at all\u201d", "Author": "RobbieMac71", "ReviewID": "UR11118808", "Content": "This was the first room I ever booked on priceline and was kinda nervous about it.

You should give yourself at least 30 minutes of travel time to go the relatively short distance from the property to the terminal.

Our stay in LA was merely to break the journey back home to Australia, from NYC to Sydney. Not being a fan of LA I was dreading the 24 hours we would be there, however our experience at La Quinta made a huge difference. We arrived at 11.00pm via the free shuttle from LAX and were greeted by cheery staff who actually seemed pleased to see us. As our flight from LA to Sydney was not due to leave until 10.30pm the following night, we requested a late check-out - no problem! La Quinta happily gave us until 2.00pm. We then left our luggage in their care and took advantage of the other free shuttle that runs literally outside the front door from the hotels in the LAX area to Manhattan Beach and Manhattan Beach Mall. This was a great way to fill in some of the 8.5 hours we had to kill between checking out and our flight departing. The room was clean and comfortable; not a fabulous view but then LAX doesn't really afford great views. The room had a lot of space for a budget room, plus a fridge, microwave, coffee-maker and a desk with a proper office chair. The hotel itself has recently been tarted up with new fittings and furniture. The free breakfast was great - everything from cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, bagels/toast to pastries, eggs, home fries and waffles. Nothing can really make the prospect of a 15-hour flight more appealing but our stay at La Quinta ensured we were well rested. We would definitely stay at La Quinta again - they were really out to please, and they did. - Maree & Kevin, Australia", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cConsistently Good\u201d", "Author": "FrequentTraveler54", "ReviewID": "UR10134591", "Content": "I stay here frequently.
