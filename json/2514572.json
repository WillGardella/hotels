My sister & I shared a double room which was small but this is NY after all! And my sister (2nd time visitor to NY) said it was bigger than the 4 person dorm room she'd stayed at previously.

There's no kitchen or microwave but plenty of food options nearby to cater from budget to higher-end tastes. Reception was welcoming - always attentive and ready to offer local knowledge or assistance so thanks to Issa, John, Tyron and Waz. The rooms are a feature - whimsically painted homages to NYC - and we stayed in the Esther Williams room but can't wait to stay in the Orbit room for my next visit. There was an issue with plumbing but nothing in life is infallible! Once I'd notified reception, they got onto it straight away and I was able to shower 30 mins later. Water pressure could be stronger but people should really relax and not complain about every little thing - you're on holiday and some things are out of anyone's control so you just gotta go with the flow.

Anyways, they even told me that the hotel was full and that I would have to go two blocks down to another area if I wanted to stay with them (they don't have elevators, so you have to move your luggage up and down the stairs before you get to the lobby or main doors). Luckily a young girl sitting at the lobby with her luggage told me that happened to her too! So I went over there and told her we should really get the hell out and find another hotel together. In the wee hours of the morning and a busy week in NYC, we were lucky to find a decent and better looking hotel for a higher price. Thank gosh! Anyhow, I thought that was the end of the whole situation and the hotel wouldn't bug me anymore. After 2 weeks later, my travel agent told me that they tried to charge her credit card again!! I think besides writing on this site, is there something else we could do? But Im not sure they have good measures in place if someone sued them or something??

The man behind reception was incredibly friendly and carried my case up the stairs for me as I was pregnant at the time but I still had to lug my tired butt up and down the stairs several times a day. 2) Noise. I know it's New York City but the windows were single glazed and there was lots of traffic noise. Luckily, my friend always packs earplugs! 3) Because it is also a hostel, you have lots of \"bohemian\" types that stay and there also appears to be some semi-permanent residents. There was a party in a room on our corridor and the staff went to stop it which led to a screaming fit at 3am about residental rights. 4) The shower was just a dribble in the private room. We didn't want to complain as it was a free upgrade, we just strolled down the hall to the shared showers or took a bath. 5) One day the maid just failed to show up to make the beds or refresh the towels. 6) Now this is the only reason I have rated the hotel as low as I have - the other elements I fully expect of a budget hotel.....on the last night a mouse ran from under the desk for a minute then ran back.

The people at the front desk are really nice and helpful and will gladly lug your luggage up the stairs for you - I had an elephantine suitcase which the staff member cheerfully lumped upstairs for me. Make sure to get maps, brochures and coupons from the front desk :) It's a no frills kind of place. I stayed in a Superior room as I was pretty keen to have my own bathroom. The decor is pretty dated but the room was a decent size and was reasonably clean. The walls are kinda thin so you can hear if someone next door is watching TV or having a chat or walking down the hallway. But if you're in New York you're not going to spend that much time in your room anyway. The major draw card for the Chelsea Star Hotel is the location. It's right across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, and is a short walk to the Empire State Building, and the blue and red subway lines. You can even walk to Times Square and Fifth Avenue from there. As with the rest of New York there are heaps of eateries around the place, and if you're feeling lazy about breakfast options then the hotel is right above a Subway sandwich shop.

The room was clean, and the shared bathroom/shower was always spot clean and relatively unoccupied in spite of the hotel being fully booked when we were there. It would have been nice to get Internet access in the room, but there was a nice terrace next to the service desk where you could sit outside and connect to the Internet. In all, I must say that this is a good choice for the budget traveler. The room we stayed in was extremely tiny but we managed to stay there although we had four fully loaded suitcases by the end of our stay. Don't expect any luxuries there since this is in fact a budget hotel, but a very nice one at that - One I would definitely recommend to fellow budget travelers looking for a stay in NY at a good location, with friendly staff, for a reasonable price.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cNice decor/location...poor service\u201d", "Author": "luci144", "ReviewID": "UR49582032", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in November whilst holidaying in NYC. At first we were excited to see the lovely decor of the hostel - clean bathrooms, brightly coloured walls, a lovely terrace with tables and chairs and a nice room. We had a double bunk bed and a TV, so it was very cosy. You do have to walk up a staircase when you enter...you can get one of the staff to bring your bags up if necessary. There's no lift. The wait for the shower was a bit ridiculous as there was only 1 per floor, so you'd set the alarm to get up nice and early but could be looking at a long wait. Nothing too dire though. There were 3 toilets per floor which was good. For the price we paid (this was the most expensive of 3 hostels we stayed at in America), our expectations weren't met. Our first hostel was half the price for pretty much the same duration stay and also included free breakfast and wonderful service. I was in the top bunk and only had a bottom sheet and very thin blanket. Our first night, we were both freezing and asked for extra blankets the following day - they never came. We asked two more times after this for extras and again, they made a note but they never arrived! Three times!? Our room was also quite noisy and it was sometimes difficult to sleep (not the hostel's fault however). Otherwise, the room was comfortable and the location was good. The worst thing was that this hostel insisted they had organised us a 4am airport shuttle for when we checked out. We confirmed this twice the day before and they were very casual and reassuring it would be there. At 4am that morning, the shuttle hadn't arrived. In 15 minutes, the guy on the counter rang dispatch and they hadn't received a booking. Surprise surprise. At this stage, we were panicked about getting to the airport while the hostel guy wanted all the details so he could file a report with management. He said a taxi would take 20 minutes to arrive so we were best to go out onto the road and hail one ourselves. We each had 2 suitcases and a handbag and no key to get back into the hostel, so I had to wait with all the bags, holding the door open in the hallway while my friend had to run out and flag one down. We felt this was appalling and unfair on 2 girls at 4am. Luckily we got one, but all this stress so early before our flight didn't seem necessary!

We got clean towels every day and I have no complaints to make about the cleanliness of the hotel or our room.

The hotel is located on W 30th Street, just off 8th Avenue and is a great location for exploring the city. It is very close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and Times Square is a simple 10-15 minute walk. One of the things I do have to comment on about this hotel is the level of noise at night. There must be a nightclub located nearby, as I was kept awake every night by people fighting and shouting in the streets and it was quite scary! that was the main issue for me, so if you decide to stay here, take earplugs!

Our experience: Our original reservation was for a 4 night stay for 8 people occupying an entire 8 person dorm room. We were able to secure very good cheap tickets to the broadway show \u201cWicked\u201d the day after our original checkout date. We called and changed the reservation to a 5 night stay. We made a follow up call about a month later to confirm that the reservation had indeed been extended to include that 5th night. Both times we called, to change the reservation and then to confirm the reservation change, we were assured that everything was fine and that the 5th night (dates were reiterated) was reserved. When the first part of our group arrived in Manhattan and tried to check in they were not allowed to because they were too early (even though we had asked the Chelsea Star in advance that it be alright for us to come that early). The did let us leave our bags behind the check-in desk but no paperwork or payment was processed. When the second part of our group arrived (different flight) and checked in Chelsea Star would not let us do so unless we paid for the entire group. So a member of this smaller group who was not the head of our group and subsequently did not make the reservation paid with a credit card. Chelsea Star did not collect any contact information nor did they provide us any paperwork outlining reservation details or such. Being jet-lagged and tired and overwhelmed by the busyness of the city and assuming we were dealing with a responsible company we did not verify that what we had there is what we actually had reserved (it would have been wise for us to verify that Chelsea Star had not messed up our reservation). We enjoyed our vacation until on the 5th night we returned to Chelsea Star at approximately 11:30 PM and we found all of our belongings in plastic bags mixed together and piled on top of each other in a storage room. The Chelsea Star front desk staff member informed us that our room was now occupied by other people and we needed to get out. We were kicked out on the street with our belongings in garbage bags at almost midnight to find somewhere to sleep. So we ended up dragging our our belongings a few blocks down the street to the Chelsea International Hostel where they had vacancy (per the Chelsea Star staff member). Needless to say the stress and fear of not knowing where to go for shelter in the middle of the night, along with the late hour of the night, we did not have a good night sleep, we were stressed beyond belief, agitated at each other, and had a miserable time the next day. It really ruined our overall experience. After the vacation (and as we were getting kicked out) when we tried to talk to the Chelsea Star staff and manager we got a very aggressive and derogatory response from them that basically told us that they had done nothing wrong, we were at fault, and they frankly didn't care \u2013 they had our money and good riddance; go find somewhere else to sleep. We understand that mistakes happen. They made the mistake of messing up our reservation, we didn't catch their mistake. We would have appreciated them doing all they could to make up for it. We didn't expect them to kick out other guests \u2013 that isn't fair to the other guests who did nothing wrong. It would have been professional if they had found us another place to stay, given us time and space to pack up our things, arranged for transportation to the new place to stay, offered an apology for the mistake, paid for our stay elsewhere, and/ or refunded some or all of our cost of our stay. (Any single one or combination of these things would have been much better than \u2013 get out \u201cI don't want to have to deal with this at midnight\u201d - and we do have an audio recording of the staff member saying that to us). (I personally own my own business and when I make a mistake I do everything that I can to make it right. It is the right thing to do and I care about my customers. Not good business practices to act like the Chelsea Star did at the time of our stay and since then.) As you can tell if you are reading this review we still have very strong feelings about how we were treated and how it effected our time in New York (5 months later). Our recommendation is to find another place to stay that care about their guests and not just about their money, that have the means to take care of emergencies, that stand up and face their mistakes, that don't take the attitude in the end of good riddance get out of our hotel. (Update: Before posting this review I emailed it to the Chelsea Star Hotel and gave them a chance to do something about it. It has been almost 4 weeks now and I have received no reply from them, another indication that they do not care about their customers and have no problem treating people poorly.)", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price\u201d", "Author": "MrsGable", "ReviewID": "UR22922186", "Content": "I went with three friends and we stayed in the apartment suite.

In need of simply a place to rest my head for the night, I booked a dorm room at the Chelsea Star, thinking I would check the place out for a potential week-long stay in a full-size private room this summer. I didn't much want to be there to start with, but I think the front desk staff wanted me there even less. When I checked in I was in a time-bind (had to be at a class nearby in 15 minutes), and the woman in line to check in just infront of me was ultra sweet and let me cut ahead. The woman behind the desk, though, thought this meant she could take her sweet old time. The archaic check-in system is a joke. I also realized during this time that the delightful meaty smell permeating the building was from the Subway restaurant downstairs. I had requested a bottom bunk when making the reservation, which they of course did not accommodate. There are also NO lockers in the rooms, and I didn't trust leaving my belongings in the \"lobby\" (more on that later). So me and my laptop, camera, and iPod traveled together for the remainder of the day and evening. These are MIXED dorm rooms, and as I woman I will never put myself into that situation again. Disgusting, loud men made up the bulk of my roommates, and the guys on each side of me snored all night. The window faced 8th Ave, which was added noise. The bathrooms... yikes. I figured I would stay cleaner if I DIDN'T shower in the morning. I checked out as early as humanly possible. A few people ahead of me did the same, and they complained to one of the staff members that the bathroom in THEIR dorm room also did not have a hook or anything to put clothes on -- so they had to put their clean clothes on the bathroom floor. I involuntarily shuddered at the thought. The staff member just said \"yeah\". Nice. Soon, there was nobody in the front desk area except me and one staff member, and when I sat down on one of the two long padded benches and pulled out my laptop, the following exchange took place: \"Are you waiting for a cab service?\" \"Uh, no.\" \"Then what are you waiting for?\" \"Waiting for my laptop to start up so I can check my email.\" \"Well, you can't sit there.\" \"I'm sorry??\" \"You have to go to the lobby.\" \"What is THIS?\" \"Not the lobby. Go down the hall and take a left.\" He seriously shoo'd me out of the empty check-in area and made me sit in a tiny, dirty room (spilled coffee and sugar *everywhere*) with internet kiosks, and nowhere to set down my laptop. But I wasn't there for long -- all the wifi connections security-enabled, and no password posted or provided to me. So I consider that \"free-wifi\" advertised on their website a myth.

Once I was in a normal hotel room, one with its own bathroom so it was one of their higher end models. The other time I got one of their hostel dorm beds. First of all the hotel part: This is a clean place, just great. It was a great sized room and a great sized bathroom, considering you are in New York. The shower was large and even had a seat in it. I've seen $300 rooms that were smaller in this city. The room had a nice big TV and DVD player and we were more than satisfied. The area inside the hotel was cute and colorful. At this low price, you can't beat the quality, the amazing location, and the simple bang for your buck. It's tops. Now for the hostel part, with the bunk beds: This also is a clean part of the hotel. The bunk beds are located in small apartment units that have been converted to dorm rooms. I did notice mold on the ceiling of the bathroom but that is not a huge deal in my eyes. But there were some glaring problems that are not quality-related. First of all, the staff used our room as a hallway, literally. Literally. I can't stress that enough. The supply closet was in our room and also it was an entrance to the backyard and other places. So at 9am you would have a staffer come right in and pass through or rustle through the closet. They would not knock. This was not an isolated incident, this happened every 30 minutes to an hour on every day of the 3 days we stayed. They would not lock the door when they did this and if we locked the door they would unlock it. This is unprecedented. I have never been in a hotel or hostel where the staff simply barged into your room at all times of the day. Secondly, there is no lobby or other room indoors to hang out. This is a hostel so you have many strangers in a room together. You need a way to get out of the room to relax so you won't bother people. But unless you are staying during good weather and sit down outside (and only during the day), you will be stuck in the room, unable to do much of anything like talk or read or use your computer because of your sleeping roommates. Thirdly, since you are in a dorm situation with 9 strangers in a room, it would actually be beneficial to keep the bathroom out of the room and put several bathrooms in the hallways for the whole floor. This is not the case. The bathrooms are in your room. So when you wake up, prepare to wait 2 hours just to empty your bladder as every single one of your 9 roommates will be in line for it. If you have a bad bladder, you'd best go somewhere else. Get yourself 2 roomies or more and rent out one of the higher end rooms and skip the dorm beds. If you want dorm beds, go someplace else unless your party can fill all 10 beds in a room.

The other people staying on my floor were not particularly tidy and, at times, the bathrooms were not that clean. This is not the hotel's fault. I was, however, disappointed by the fact that my room only got 4 television stations. 2 of the 4 stations were the exact same one. One station was in Spanish and the last was HBO. Sometimes CBS would come in clear and other times it would not.

We flew into JFK and got the tube non stop to the subway at Pennsylvania station and first thing we saw was the Emprise State Building - wow.

The shared room was on ground floor, very small just double bed and a single open wardrobe and TV on the wall so did wonder where I was going to put all my shopping. However it was fine. Shared bathrooms were clean and they are on every floor so if one was busy then you just go upstairs. I kept leaving my shampoos etc in the showers but as they are constantly cleaned I never saw them again so make sure you dont leave anything! I used to just go the toilet in my pyjamas no one cared! The private doubles was a lot nicer, it was on the second floor. Room was large with table/dresser big wardrobes and of course the ensuite bathroom. I must admit the private room with shared bathroom was good for first couple of days but i think if going for a whole week I would definitely book private double room with ensuite just for the space and cosyness.

Otherwise, read on. The hotel is located at the corner of an intersection (30th and 8th) and it doesn't really look like a hotel from the outside (looks like it's connected to a convenience store) so be careful if you are driving and looking for it. Once you find the hotel's door, you need to get buzzed in and then climb a flight ot steps to get to the front desk. This might be tricky for those of you who have heavy luggage or multiple suitcases. But once you get past that it's pretty good. I booked a triple room at the Chelsea Star for three nights but before I left for New York, I heard about a huge snowstorm that was going to hit the U.S. and Canada on the night I was supposed to be leaving. I called Chelsea Star and told them that I might be delayed because of the storm, and I was told that my reservation would be honored even if I arrived a day late. I was supposed to arrive on a Monday, but the storm pushed my arrival to Tuesday, so I told the hotel that if they wanted, they could rent out the room for Monday night. When I arrived at the hotel on Tuesday, I was told no one had recorded that I was going to be arriving late and that my triple room had been taken. I was very distraught, but fortunately, the guy at the desk was very nice and he said that the Chelsea Star would upgrade my reservation and put my friends and I in an apartment suite and only charge me the triple room price. I forgot to ask the check-in guy's name but he's a soft-spoken Caucasian man with curly-ish black hair. If you want great service, go to him. He made suggestions for transportation (where to go to use the subway, what kind of metro cards he thought we might need) and pointed out a few things we could do (ie. take the free Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty). He also suggested a decent nearby breakfast place :) You can also ask for Lilah. She's very nice too. But I wouldn't recommend talking to one of the night-staffers (guy with a Russian accent). He wasn't exactly rude, but he seemed bored/ disinterested, which isn't something you really want in a customer-oriented business. Before I left for New York, I spoke to this guy on the phone about being delayed because of the weather and he wanted to charge me for arriving on Tuesday instead of Monday, even though I had already explained to him that I had called the hotel about the situation the day before. I can understand it if a hotel charges me for being late or for cancelling if I call the day before or on the day that I am supposed to be checking in, but I informed Chelsea Star about the situation two days before I was supposed to arrive, which is their deadline before they start charging cancellation fees. But I found everything and everyone else to be quite good :) The hotel was located in a good place, just steps from Penn Station. The apartment suite is actually in the building next to the hotel. My friends and I stayed in room 1N, which was on the first floor and facing the street. The room itself was pretty good (2 double beds, private bath, small tv, kitchenette with sink, microwave, mini fridge, cups, plates, utensils) but in the early morning, noise from the street did wake me up sometimes but I tend to be a light sleeper. The room was comfortable and clean and gave you what you needed. I checked for bed bugs and I was happy to see that there were none (mattresses were wrapped in plastic to prevent bug infestation). Housekeeping also showed up each day to tidy up, and hot water and pressure were pretty good in the shower. The only drawback I really have to say is that heating for our room was very strange. It was generally ok, but at night, sometimes it became very hot, and we had to crack open the window while we slept. I'd stay here again, but I think it's because I lucked out with the apartment suite. I'm not sure how things are for people who stay single, double, triple and quad rooms. I checked out the shared bathrooms near the front desk and thought they were ok. There were two rooms with only a toilet (clean but only enough room to sit down on the toilet) and one room that has a toilet and a shower (it's a private room made for one person). There's 2 computers near the front desk, which costs $2 U.S. for 20 minutes. One of these computers is in a small room. You can get coffee and hot water in there in the morning but don't expect it to be a common room, because it's sort of small. But there's a little rack in the room that offers cards that describe NYC restaurant and attractions. It's a good resource if you're not sure about what to do. All in all, I had a good time at Chelsea Star and I would recommend this place (or I guess the apartment suite) to other student travellers.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Place !\u201d", "Author": "Leafly", "ReviewID": "UR11219857", "Content": "This hotel/hostel is a 10 minute walk from Time Square !

Although my review is for the hostel room I am sure there are some issues that will apply to the hotel as well. This was my second stay in a hostel. I decided to try Chelsea Star because of the location and price. The price was cheaper than some of the hostels in upper Manhattan (103rd Street) and it has a great location. I flew into Newark and I took a bus to Port Authority at 42nd and 8th. From Port Authority I took the A or C subway train to 34th and 8th. From there I walked to 30th and 8th. The hostel is centrally located and it is only a couple of blocks from Madison Square Gardens. Upon check-in I found the front desk clerks to be very indifferent to the customers. They were very nonchalant and they did not seem friendly at all. The lobby was very nice and the terrace was very well lit and inviting at night. The room was pretty nice as well. I was surprised to have a bathroom in the room and it was very nice and clean as well. The only problem I found with the bathroom was the privacy factor. If you eat gassy food like chili you may be a little embarrassed because the bathroom is right there amongst strangers. Also, if you needed to use the facilities you had to wait for the person ahead of you to finish their duties before you could enter. There was a very simple solution to these bathroom issues though. There are communal bathrooms in the hallway and you can use the restroom there as well as take a shower. Very convenient. Issues with this location: The hallways are very narrow and the floor is metal (see my photos). Although they have a red carpet over the floor you could hear each and every person that walked down the hallway. My bed was close to the door and the floor would shake every time someone walked by. Also, you could clearly hear every conversation that went on in the hallways. The hall is narrow so people did not tend to linger. The other issue was the noise from outside. The hostel is located on 30th Street and 8th Avenue. 8th Avenue is very busy and noisy all day. I could hear horns blowing, sirens blasting, trash trucks beeping, people laughing and talking on the sidewalk, and believe it or not I could hear the subway. I kept hearing a noise every so often and I could not see where it was coming from. The noise comes from the sidewalk vents (do not know the proper term) and you could hear the subway trains each time they passed by. This was a huge issue when I first arrived. After awhile I was able to get used to the noise and move on. I am sure this is an issue at some of the finer hotels in NYC as well. Cabs blowing horns and sirens are a big part of NYC and this cannot be avoided in central locations of NYC. If you have trouble sleeping or if you are sensitive to noise you should request a room that is not facing 8th Avenue. Since this hostel is in the middle of a lot of attractions you must be prepared for noise or bring ear plugs. Otherwise, you may want to book something in upper Manhattan that has less traffic and action. Overall this was a very pleasant experience. I did not like the fact that they did not have lockers in the dorm rooms but I felt safe leaving my things in the room. The roommates were all friendly and everyone spoke and smiled at each other. One thing to remember is that this is a cheaper, lower scale hotel/hostel. You get what you pay for. You can't expect to pay a lower rate and have the accommodations of a five star hotel. Although this is a lower scale facility they have a very nice establishment and it is very worth the price. I definitely plan to stay here again and I give Chelsea Star two thumbs up. The place is very clean and has a clean feel to it. I am not sure how the hotel rooms are so I cannot comment about those.

My daughter picked the Chelase Star as it sound \"cool\", I agree'd because of price and I was mixed up with the classic Chelsea Hotel. We arrived by cab in front of a Subway restaurant and flower shop, we looked at the cab driver like he had 3 heads as he pointed to the sign reading the name Chelsea Star. I instantly felt sick, once we got inside my spirits picked up a bit as it was really decorated cute with bright yellow halls, metal doors and stars stenciled through out. We first had the \"King and I \" room and again my heart sank, very, very small, and dark and dingy looking. I went to the front desk to see how muchi t would cost me to get a two bed room and he advised me that really they were intended for 4 people but asked if we would like to see the \"Coney Island\" room. This room was indeed bigger and much brighter so we stayed. I disagree with some of the reviews on the cleanliness as I felt our room was very clean and the bedding was very white and no smell at all to the blankets. The noise was almost unbearable, not from other rooms but from 8th street. I really knew I was in NY City as I listened to horns honking, a fight from the little bar down the street and some loud mouth yelling at his friends all night. I must say that it was quieter from 1-6am. The bathrooms were not spotless and there was no shelving or hooks to put your clothes or towels on while showering and I really did not want to sit them on the toilet. The shower stalls and bathroom were dark stone and gave it a dingy feel, my daughter disagrees she loved the look of the bathroom. The bathrooms were busier than the other hotel we had stayed at and you knew when someone had showered and the garbages were not emptied constantly as the other place we stayed. The location is very handy, with subway 4 blocks down and airport shuttle to Newark as well, only 13.00 a huge savings over a cab! It is a grubbier area so walking late at night kept me on my toes. All in all, this place was an old dive of a hotel fixed up to the best of anyones ability, they kept it relatively clean and the staff were pleasant and helpful. Great for the young perhaps but even my daughter is not sure she will return and it was not cheap for what you got. Don't get caught up in the cute theme room concept, for the same price you could stay at Hotel 17...read that review!", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cSurviving The Chelsea Star\u201d", "Author": "Milnoc", "ReviewID": "UR3659476", "Content": "The Chelsea Star is a tourist class hotel located in a yellow building on the southwest corner of West 30 Street and 8th Avenue, a stone\u2019s throw away from Penn Station and the 34 Street subway stations, with the hotel\u2019s only entrance located on West 30 Street. Look for the stars imprinted in the sidewalk cement. The hotel itself is actually located on the second floor of the building, occupying three full floors, and has no elevator. So people with heavy luggage may want to avoid this hotel unless you don\u2019t mind the workout. All the private rooms with shared baths are painted and decorated in different themes such as the Rudolph Valentino room, the New York Nights room, and the Madonna. The private rooms with private baths have upgraded accommodations for those wanting more privacy. The hotel also includes dormitory rooms that can be reserved for a maximum of two weeks and can\u2019t be reserved again by the same people for six months afterwards, preventing vagrants from taking up \u201cpermanent residence\u201d at the hotel. Check-in went reasonably well. Not only did the hotel have my reservation, they were also able to assign me the room that I\u2019ve requested, the \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d room, located on the fourth floor and decorated with Asian elements. As you can see from the pictures, the room is very small, but that in itself wasn\u2019t much of a deterrent since it was just enough space for my needs, it was cheap, and most importantly the air conditioner worked properly. Noise was a problem with the room, but not necessarily from the adjoining rooms (I lucked out on thick walls). Much of the noise came from 8th avenue itself, consisting mostly of taxis honking their horns whenever someone got in their way. One way to cut down on the noise is to sleep with your head close to the door instead of the window. The room also had a few other irritants. First, I saw the resident mouse try to escape from my room, making me wonder if it was something about me personally that the mouse didn\u2019t like. Second, along with the dirty carpet as seen in the images, many parts of the room were not properly cleaned such as the phone and the space under the Buddha statuette. Third, the electrical extensions powering the TV were originally stapled to the wall, but eventually came loose over time. Unfortunately, the staples were shot right through the electrical conductors, creating a potentially fatal shock hazard. I showed the wiring to the resident handyman and he replaced it right away. The shared washroom was probably as clean as it could ever be considering it\u2019s the middle of summer, it\u2019s hot and humid, and just about everyone needed to take at least two showers per day just to feel slightly clean. The sink and toilet were fine for their respective duties, but the shower faucets were a bit of a challenge. Turn the hot water faucet, wait for hot water to eventually come out from the showerhead, and then turn the cold water faucet to prevent scalding. In this hotel, water pressure and faucet control are the main plumbing problems. I had to use the third floor washroom one morning because the fourth floor washroom was occupied for a long time (the only time this happened). I discovered that the tap water tasted a bit different depending on which floor you resided. While the fourth floor\u2019s water tasted reasonably neutral for a big city water supply, the third floor\u2019s water had the distinct after-taste of a men\u2019s public washroom. After brushing my teeth, all the toothpaste did was add a mint-flavoured coating to the toilet after-taste, similar to what you would probably experience if you tried eating urinal cakes. The terrace was a decent oasis from the outside world as long as you didn\u2019t mind the rumbling of half a dozen air conditioning units and the site of a few plastic garbage cans at one end which are conveniently hidden from the hotel\u2019s official photos. The patio furniture however was of reasonable quality, and the garbage cans emanated no objectionable smells considering the hotel doesn\u2019t distribute or even allow food in the rooms. The guests themselves were reasonably well behaved and for the most part tried to keep the noise level down to a minimum which isn\u2019t easy considering that despite the metal covering on the room doors, noise would easily pass through them as if they were made of paper. Final tidbits: staff members for the most part were reasonably helpful, and the room key never worked on the hotel\u2019s outdoor card reader. All in all, my stay at The Chelsea Star was a New York Experience in itself, and not necessarily an objectionable one. But would I want to go through the same experience twice? Probably not. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I would prefer to stay in a more expensive hotel the next time I\u2019m in the city, but it does mean I\u2019ll want to try out a different tourist class hotel in another part of the city.", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, convenient and great value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3535686", "Content": "I had read the reviews on trip advisor before going but after booking so perhaps was expecting the worst of this hotel.

The reception was very friendly and they did have our booking but were (not surprisingly for the May Day Holiday) overbooked so asked if we would move from the Superior to the Deluxe room. Initially we said no and they upheld the original reservation, but having seen both rooms we decided to move taking advantage of the discount they offered for our inconvenience. Both rooms we stayed in were clean, sufficiently big for a hotel room in New York which was used essentially for sleeping and showering. The beds were very large and comfortable although I would not recommend the sofa bed in the superior room. The service was at all times very friendly and efficient and what better location could you ask for. I agree it is not a 5 star hotel, but for the money and the sheer convenience of location I thought it was excellent. I will definitely go back especially now that the Plaza has closed!

We booked the dorm beds as we were definately on a budget! At $35 they are the average price for New York in Sept.

Its true that to get in you have to ring the bell and hope someone on reception answers, but i guess we were lucky as they did straight away. We ended up in a two bunk room sharing with two german boys... This was perfect as there was enough space for all our things without us having to get to know each other too intimately!! There was a TV which did have bad reception, but as has been mentioned before...You're in NYC!!! Go out! The locations great....so close to Penn station and the airport bus stop to Newark and JFK.

There is a subway sandwich below but i deffs couldnt smell them! Plus there $1.99 specials each day make life cheap if u are poor like me! You can hear the traffic in the room but deffs get used to it. The common area to sit outside is ok just to chill between exploring. The Bathrooms. Right. Well, I had no problems with them having stayed in places where they have been twenty times worse! But they arnt the cleanest things you'll ever use. However if you simply take your own soap, and try and guarantee you have some flip flops with you and your own towel you should do just fine! They were cleaned when i was there, dunno bout now! People on reception were really nice! I think i might have met the girl that everyone has been going on about as being horrid, but i guarantee if you go talk to her and make her talk to you by asking for help with directions etc she can be way helpful! Having stayed previously at the Milford Plaza near to Broadway for $135 a night (a loverly hotel and very nice peeps etc, but too expensive for my budget), and Jazz on the town (the most hideous place ever ever) which was about $30, I can certainly suggest this place for people who are travellers and have therefore always seen something worst than the place they are!

I provided all the information that was required. We chose this location for price, it looked interesting and because it was within close walking distance of a venue we were attending during our one day trip. I recieved a confirmation email from them that my credit card had been processed and another one stating: \"Thank you for choosing the Chelsea Star Hotel for your New York City lodging needs. We look forward to your arrival and plan to make your New York experience a very special one!\" My reservation was for a deluxe room and my confirmation number was: 821769 It clearly states on the Chelsea Star website that this confirmation is a GUARANTEE that the room will be available when they say it is. Don't get your hopes up. There is a prompt on the reservation form that asks what time you will be checking in. Make sure you arrive prior to that time and wait for your room, because if you are late, they will release the room. Of course there is no indication that they are going to do this, as it seems like they just ask that question to make sure that the room is ready for you when you arrive. My travel partner chose 3pm, and we arrived at 3:45. Upon our arrival I was notified by the friendly but less than helpful desk clerk that my \"deluxe\" room had been given away and I would be staying in a \"superior\" room. Unfortunately this was the room that my travel partners, who were standing next to me at the time had reserved. The clerk fed us a line about how my friend needed to \"reconfirm because you're late (45 minutes late on a room confirmed with a valid credit card) and we gave the room away\" and that there were no other rooms available to accomodate them. The icing on the cake was that they bumped me down a notch into their room just becasue I registered first. The clerk referred us to another hotel, and since we only had an hour to check in and get ready for the event we were attending, we had no choice but to quickly drive across town to the other hotel, (see the review of that disaster elsewhere). He also said he would call and reserve a room for us there, but we watched as he called their so called \"partner hotel\" and simply asked if there were rooms available. No pricing info, no alternates, nothing. Basically, he offered us directions and gave us a map and said \"you are here, the hotel is over here\". Not very helpful. The new hotel was about thirty blocks away from our desired location, which was within walking distance of the Chelsea Star. The prior arrangements we made to park our car in Chelsea were useless, so we had to pay an arm and a leg for parking. All told, between the cost of cab rides, parking and the new hotel, we lost out on any money we would have saved by staying at the Chelsea Star. I won't even mention the time that we wasted dealing with this fiasco. It seems from other reviews that this is the M.O. for this hotel. I would not recommend this non-experience to anyone looking to drop their bags and relax in the great city of New York. I travel frequently and enjoy staying at out of the way places that may not offer the same homogenized experience as a regular run of the mill hotel. It would have been nice to have a positive experience at this hotel as I have had at many others like it. Unfortunately \"Funky\" not only refers to the decor, but also to the way they run the business. If you still choose to brave these odd reservation policies, I would suggest calling the desk every five minutes until you arrive to make sure your \"reservation\" still exists.

Our party of 5 took 3 rooms for 5 nights in November 2004 and found the Chelsea Star a haven among the craziness of New York. Bear in mind this is a budget hotel, if you expect Plaza style service, go pay Plaza prices. We occupied a Superior double, a double and a single. The Superior was magnificent (considering the price) with a four poster bed that would sleep 5, very spacious, clean tidy and warm. With windows onto to the street it is a bit noisy, but hey it's New York City outside. The double was the Madonna Room, which is the very room Madonna stayed in when she moved to the city. It was covered in photo's, records etc. The single room does what it says on the tin, a small room with a single bed and a T.V. The double and the single have shared shower facilities which aren't a problem as the shower is next to the room and were very clean and tidy. The big plus for this hotel is the location. On the fringe of Chelsea it's located in a vibrant neighbourhood, all your needs are on your doorstep. Go for breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner (200m up 8th Ave), grab a sub from the Gardenia Deli across the street along with an excellent range of brewski's.
