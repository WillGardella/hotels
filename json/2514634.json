The room wasn't very big but it was enough for us, the bedding was good and the bathroom was great. There was Internet for free in the lobby. I would recommend it because it's not too expensive and it was clean. The only problem was the noise in the evening, there must a pub in the area playing some music.

I'm a college student at the University of Texas at Austin, and I came here with an organization to visit agencies for one week. I check into SoHotel Sunday, and am checking out tomorrow morning. Like I said, I'm a college student, so I was on a budget. The coordinators of this trip originally planned for us to stay in a cheap hotel in Times Square. After some complications, they chose this hotel based on price and reviews. I'll have to say that that was the BEST choice ever! This location is PRIME for anyone who wants to have an amazing trip while in the Big Apple, for countless reasons: 1. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION: Located on Broome and Bowery, right between Chinatown and Little Italy- I promise you that this is exactly where you want to be. The stereotypical place to stay is near Times Square, but if you're on your own or you want a more authentic NYC experience, STAY HERE. You can always take the subway (2 subway stations within 2 blocks of the hotel) to Times Square, Madison Ave, 5th Ave, Central Park, and the many other typical tourist spots. But if you want to see the REAL New York, stay here in SoHo. You are literally steps away from AMAZING eats, a 5-10 minute walk from some of the best shopping, AND you're extremely close to some amazing nightlife. Broadway and Prince (a few blocks away) is where H&M, Forever 21, Zara, Uniqlo, TopShop, Supreme, and COUNTLESS other amazing clothing stores are. You could literally spend an entire day going through stores and boutiques on that road, and find the most amazing things you can't find in other cities. Also, the food! A few blocks away from Lombardi's (NYC's first pizzeria, consistently voted one of the top 3 pizza places in AMERICA every year), Rice to Riches (the best rice pudding), and Shanghai Cafe Deluxe (where they have the best soup filled dumplings, you will dream about them). That's just to name a few. The Meatball Shop is close as well, along with cute and NYC original stores. My Aunt and other NYC locals I knew gave me a list of the best local food places to try. Literally 90% of them were walking distance from the hotel. If you're a college kid like me or just want to have a good time, this is also walking distance from so many great clubs and bars. There's a cute, quaint bar 2 doors down from this hotel, and I went there to hang out with my friends for a few hours tonight. We basically had the place to ourselves, and it was great. The Bitter End (where many famous people like Lady GaGa and Joni Mitchell started off before they were famous) is a 10-15 minute walk away, and so are many many many good clubs and bars. 2. CUSTOMER SERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am huge on customer service. I believe that good customer service can help make or break your visit. EVERY single time I walked in the door, someone at the desk or near the door was smiling and greeting me. Not in an obnoxious or annoying manner, but in a very genuine and warm way, which I was surprised to see in NY. The two main men who were at the desk when I was there were Zach and Jose. They are both the sweetest men, and you can tell they both honestly want their guests to have an enjoyable stay here. I was bored one night so I had a conversation with them, which ended up lasting an hour because I enjoyed talking to them so much. They're very inviting and warm, and just make you feel like they want you to be there. The rooms are just the right size, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the cute decorations and architecture. This is actually one of the (or maybe THE) oldest standing hotels in NY, but it definitely has a cute modern twist. The walls are brick in the lobby, which gives it a great feel. The atmosphere is just perfect and cute. I absolutely loved walking through the lobby everyday, and I'm actually on my laptop right now at 4:30 a.m. because I love how it feels here. The beds are made nicely every single day, and they even clean up your things for you so you don't have to walk through all your stuff on the floor. The linens are clean, the blankets are fluffy, the bathroom is very clean, and there's cable with a nice tv! The negatives, which I will only add as disclaimers- from the outside, this place does not look glamorous. Also, when you open the door, you may be overwhelmed by the steep flight of stairs that lead to the lobby. PLEASE don't be turned off by either of these things. As for the look on the outside, I love how it's discreet. It fits the quaint and cute personality of it, and who cares what it looks on the outside when it's amazing on the inside. Also, the employees are always helpful in bringing your stuff up, and you won't break your back walking those stairs. By the 2nd day, I was used to them and didn't mind at all. These are the 2 things that made me skeptical about how great this hotel is when I first arrived, but you will easily forget these things when you realize how great of an experience you're getting. SUMMARY: SoHotel is an AMAZING and PERFECT place to stay in New York, especially for an extended stay and especially if you want to see the city for all the wonder it is. It's great to do the tourist things, but this is the way to truly, deeply, and madly fall in love with New York. I have SoHotel to thank for contributing to my phenomenal New York spring break trip.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201csharon and maria love sohotel\u201d", "Author": "sharon811642", "ReviewID": "UR126133262", "Content": "We stayed in January at this Hotel..

It was my first time in NYC and his second. We both wanted some time in NYC, and decided to book a hotel for 9 nights. That hotel was the Sohotel. It was recommended to me by a fellow New Yorker, and it did not disappoint . The staff were fantastic, and your trip will not be complete without meeting Singh or Junior, amongst others. The location is phenomenal. You are situated in Little Italy/Chinatown. Take a walk and some of the scenery is straight out a movie. Walk a few blocks to Mulberry where you will find a bar of the same name. The Sopranos and many other movies have been shot here. Our room was clean, big enough for our needs (sleeping and washing) and had cable TV and an iPod docking station so you could play your music, nice touch. The rooms were always cleaned and the staff were not intrusive at all. If you want some criticisms, well here they are but they are tiny. I am a very light sleeper, and find it incredibly hard to sleep when there is noise. The windows are very thin and you can hear the traffic at times including the fire sirens and police sirens, but it honestly didn't affect my sleep at all, I slept very well for my entire 9 days, as did my friend, and I kind of liked the noise, as it reminded me of all my favourite movies. That said the original Ghostbusters building from the 1984 film is really close by, and is situated right next to a superb little diner called the square diner. The Pancakes were amazing. Sorry, I am going off on a tangent. You will occasionally hear a bit of noise from some revellers, but hey they are on holiday to, so as long as they are not to loud, I am fine with that. So to conclude, My experience at the hotel was fantastic, and it is worth noting that they have only recently refurbished a lot of their rooms, and it shows. Going in February was always going to be quieter, but I really can't fault this hotel, and I hope you give it a shot to as it is very affordable and in a great location.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDowntowns Best Kept Secret\u201d", "Author": "Ron P", "ReviewID": "UR124322475", "Content": "My wife and I have traveled to Manhattan many times over the last 15 years and have stayed in a number of places.

I don't know if they cut it off in the winter. But I was extremely uncomfortable. The ceiling fan helped a bit but it didn't help nearly enough. (I wasn't the only person experiencing this problem. Overheard other guests at the counter telling the staff about the problem and they seemed to dismiss it as if it shouldn't be an issue because it is cold outside. They didn't seem willing to address the problem and meet guests' needs.) Also, I'm pretty sure that someone came into my room after I exited the hotel to sightsee. I checked in and got settled then headed out and when I returned, there were noticeable differences about my room that weren't there before. Things moved around on the dresser.

We arrived quite early at 9am and the staff were SOOOO nice and let us check in Early...as we had just flown in early from Las Vegas, I can not tell you just how grateful we were to be allowed to get into the room so early! So a big thanks to the lovely Receptionists! The location of this hotel is just AMAZING it is a 5 minute walk to the nearest Metro Station and is right beside Mulberry Street (little Italy) Which is full of gorgeous restaurants so you are spoilt for choice if looking for a nice place to eat. One night we did walk to Times Square and it only took around 15minutes. There are no elevators in this hotel, but we never found this to be a problem (even though we each had about 3 MASSIVE suitcases full of shopping) as there was always a Porter waiting by the stairs ready to help you with your luggage. Every Porter we encountered was extremely pleasant, smiling and Helpful. There is free WIFI in the Hotel, which we had a little bit of trouble connecting to, but when we did it worked fine. Our room was lovely and clean, with Air Conditioning and a Flat Screen TV....the only downside was that it was VERY noisy. Our room was on the 1st Floor and Faced out onto Broome Street which is quite a busy Street.....now each of us girls are heavy sleepers so the noise never bothered us, but if you are a light sleeper, then maybe request a room facing away from the Street. The beds were lovely and comfy too! The Bathroom was very small and I must say the Shower was horrendous! As a group of 4 girls shower-time is a very important part of our 'getting ready' routine......after one shower there was hardly ever hot water and the pressure wasn't great...now I was OK to put up with it as it is New York and our hotel room price was so cheap....But I know my friends were quite annoyed and put out by just how bad the shower was!

Room size is not this hotel's problem... At all. It is, however, everything else. The website advertises \"cheap\" as a hallmark, to which I will personally attest-- an undoubtedly and unfortunate Freudian slip, dooming our stay from the get-go. Though the hotel is located along the lighting supply retail hub of SoHo, the owners/designer have missed the mark in lighting design in the lobby. I have read reviews describing it as bordello-esque. I see it as kitschy Village-wannabe New Jersey trash: too many themes to even be considered designer chic or eclectic. Note to the management: cute chairs, cute lighting, awful paint palette, ALWAYS REMOVE THE PLASTIC FROM YOUR LAMPSHADES... What are you- Fran Drescher's family from 'The Nanny?' The check-in process was streamlined, though please keep in mind: you pay in FULL at check-in. Buyer beware. They have you by the cojones should you encounter an irreconcilable difference (the plastic covering the lampshades JUST about did it). Staff are helpful enough and a solitary, hard-working bellman will help you with your bags to the best his slim frame can muster. Note: this hotel requires stair climbing (read: no elevators), which is also not a deal breaker for us. Good exercise and easy staircases to climb. Let's discuss the god awful rug runners down the hallways. Management- you've covered your poorly laid laminate floors with the most awful and poorly laid oriental rugs in Chinatown. And you've apparently left them there for 10 years with not so much as one shampoo!?!?! The horror! Folks. If this is SoHo chic, you will find me in the Upper East Side next visit. Moving to the room. Small quantifies size appropriately in most rooms here but not bothersomely so. What bugs me is the management will upgrade you to a room with more beds than you need for free so you're \"more comfortable.\" Actually, no. I'm not more comfortable. You've put me in the same size room crammed with more beds. We sleep together, we are not amoebas, we do not divide into more guests, therefore more beds with less room WILL NOT be convenient. The rooms are bland, poorly designed (as in no esthetics), and unrefined for a self-proclaimed boutique hotel. The television wires hand from the wall as tackily [sic] as the plastic covered chandelier in the lobby. The furniture looks as if it is trying to be antique eclectic (God, I hope) but fails miserably. It's dinged and it's plywood and it's awful looking. That seedy hostel I stayed in in Germany was furnished better. The A/C, bless its heart, rattled worse than my grandmother's dentures. The artwork was hung on a fabulous exposed brick wall. The paintings were hideous and likely from Wal-Mart. It was a disservice and slap in the face to that gorgeous brick wall. The brick wall was glazed to prevent crumbling mortar (I assume). Well, the mortar crumbled... On my bed... Under the bed sheets. Either housekeeping didn't take note of this when they made the bed or they simply didn't care to brush off the abrasive pumice treatment before I got into bed. P.S. The beds are divitted neatly where previous bodies have lain. Management: invest in nicer pillow top mattresses or change out your el-cheapos more often. The bathroom was well appointed and marbled, well, mostly. My problem with the bathroom: nasty dust bunnies clogging the exhaust fan and grout that was in bad need of a toothbrush scrubbing or regrouting all together. Call me a prude, but boutique hotels are known for using neat, obscure toiletries for guests. Not here... As hohum as the artwork. On a bright note, morning coffee was killer. Nicely roasted and great temperature. I'll forgive the cheesy micromini styrofoam cups. They dim in comparison to the plastic lamp shade covers surrounding the coffee service. We didn't get mugged. We didn't get bed bugs. We didn't have to shower with cold water. Some might say this was a success in NY, NY. Pshaw. I know great boutique hotels are out there.

We do a pretty extensive search for hotel's before we book and look for the smaller more boutique and interesting propertie's. We originally had book a suite at a hotel on Madison Ave for what would have been twice what it cost to stay here. The SoHotel is on the lower east side blocks from Little Italy, Chinatown, The Bowery, and Bleecker St. This is a very cool area and has so much charm and great little restaurants and shops. You could easily stay here and never leave the area.The Hotel has about 4 floors and is decorated very nicely. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I felt a little bad for the guy luggin our suitcases up the 4 floors to our room, but he is use to it. The room is small but nice and clean. Our view was nothing great, a wall, but we did not spend much time in the room. Heating, air, ceiling fan, nice lighting, chair, tight space around the bed. If you are looking to have a lot of walk around room, this is not for you. It is adequate and comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size and had a tub/shower combination, hair dryer, and enough towels. The mirror could have been a little bigger for my wife, but it is again adequate. The rooms are not the quietest, but it was jsut mainly the staff talking in the halls while cleaning. Nothing bad or too loud. The rooms have no phone or coffe makers. We did not miss them, they have coffee in the lobby each morning and anyway with all the restaurants and little coffe shops close by, who cares? Subway stations are nearby to get you to the upper east side and Manhattan, but except for a few things we wanted to do up their we could have stayed in this are the whole time. The Village area is just so much more real and interesting. No loud noise from the outside. The SoHotel is a a great property with a great location and convenient to everything either by walking or train, bus, or taxi. The price for New York was reasonable and we would definately recommend and stay here again, but would probably try somehwere new next time just because we like to try new places and not be creatures of habit.

No ice. discovered the next morning that the ice machine is off of the lobby on the 1st floor, next to the soda vending machine and half empty snack machine. Window unit A/C was barely adequate - oh, and the halls and stairways aren't air conditioned - just the room itself. Place WAS very quiet and I slept well. Convinced myself that was all that mattered - all I use my room for in New York is to sleep. Got up in the am and took a shower - cold water cut off completely part way through the shower. Got scalded. Then couldn't get cold or hot water from the sink to brush my teeth. Went to dry my hair and there was no hairdryer (even though all the ads said there were). Had to go downstairs to lobby to ask for one. Walked back upstairs and discovered that there was no electrical outlet at all in the bathroom. One plug in room for lamp - another for the alarm clock. Unplugged the alarm clock and plugged in the dryer. 3 minutes later the fuse blew - now no lights, no A/C (it was 85 degrees outside), and wet hair. Checked out immediately. They refunded my deposit for the second night. Got a room at the W mid-town that only cost $50 more than this hell hole. You are better off camping out - and it's much cheaper.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cMy New Spot in LES\u201d", "Author": "samsmyth", "ReviewID": "UR115264150", "Content": "We came to NY with a crew of 7 guys.

It was our first time in NY, for both of us. I spent hours on the Internet looking for an affordable and decent hotel in the city, without bed bugs... Quite complicated ! The Sohotel seemed good and decided to went there. That was a great choice ! It is very well located. Note however that it is not in Soho (even though its name would make you think it is), but between Chinatown and Little Italy (more in the latter). You can access easily three different subway lines which will get you in uptown or downtown very quickly. You can go by foot in Little Italy and Chinatown of course, but also Soho and the Financial District which are quite close. It is true, the rooms are small, the bathroom as well. But the bed is of excellent quality, extremely comfortable (we slept like babies) and you have a nice TV with HD screen and lots of channels. The service is very good, the staff is always happy to help. The only thing that could have been a problem is the noise. We were located on the ground floor, and there is a pub which plays loud music at night. We were so tired when we went back at night that we didn't have any problem with that, but you may need earplugs othewise. I guess if you have a room upstairs it's less a problem.

I hired a phone from the hotel and there were a few teething problems with it and the hotel staff went out of their way to help me and were really professional about it all.

The bathrooms could have done with a lick of paint and a few repairs but the bed was really comfortable and the room was really clean and much bigger than I was led to believe from other comments I'd read online. There was free tea/coffee/hot chocolate available in the lobby every morning as there were no facilities in the rooms. There were a couple of drinks/snack dispensers in reception as well.

We received help with our luggage, advice on where to go (even for a manicure!) and hello's from all. 2) Stylish rooms and decor. Our room was not as tiny as people have mentioned on here. We had a twin room, which size wise was fine for the two of us who only wanted to sleep there anyway. Oh & the bed was super comfy!!! People on here had mentioned some sort of plastic covering on the mattress. True, we did have a cover on the mattress but it was not plastic and in fact we saw these sold in shops as bed bug protectors. 3) Great location. This is probably the best thing and much more important than we estimated. Having Little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, Broadway and a couple of Subways on your doorstep & within a 10 minute walk is outstanding!!! We only ever needed to get the subway when travelling to the really tourist spots, like Times Sq. We felt safe here - even at night & were more than spoilt for choice for food. Quite young & trendy with a few late opening bars too. 4) Tea & coffee - the complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings is a nice touch. On New Years Day they made it available all day & with biscuits, choccies & cereal bars! The bad - 1) The noisy water pipe. In our room we had a noisy water pipe with made noises night and day and was very hot to the touch. We did mention this to reception, who politely offered to change our rooms. However with it being the Xmas season we had little choice left & our options we a windowless room or a room next to the lobby. Considering these we stayed put. By the end of our stay we were used to the noise, however my friend did complain that the pipe had begun to smell. 2) All the stairs. The hotel would obviously benefit from an elevator. The stairs were also quite steep and I doubt I would have been able to carry my luggage down the two flights had the bellboy not have been on hand. 3) The cleaning. The hotel and room were cleaned every day however it appeared that our floor was not swept at all during our stay. I personally would rather my floor be swept than towels changed daily. Dust did begin to gather in large clumps and with hair balls too. We were also left without toilet roll on one of the days after having mentioned this to the cleaning staff. 4) The 'wardobe'. The clothing rack in our twin room only had 6 hangers, which for two girls left us hanging several items per hanger. The very ample (perhaps 8 drawer) chest was too big for the room and we would have rathered further hanging storage instead.

Good shower room and storage for clothes and although there was no wardrobe there was a hanging rack with coat hangers which was plenty. We didnt have an issue with this arrangement but some people may have wanted a wardrobe. No safes in the room which is a key feature for the traveler in my opinion but they did offer a safe box to put valubles in which was kept behind reception and the desk was manned 24/7 which was great. There was a choice of when you had your sheets changed which was a nice option for the eco warrior in you.

I'm not the biggest person on the planet, I'm an avarage size, but I practically had to squeeze myself between the bathroom and the wall to get to the toilet. The door opens in to the bathroom so you can't get to the shower without squeezing yourself between wall and sink first to close the door. Two people in the bathroom is simple impossible. Some rooms do have a different bathroom set-up though wich looked an itsybitsy more practicaL. If you are a bit bigger than avarage, don't even think of booking a room here! Luckily, bags and suitcases can be stowed under the bed, otherwise we wouldn't have known were to put them.. there simply is no room at all (one coat rack and one chest of drawers and 30 cm between bed and wall). The hairdryer stopped after 10 seconds.. (overheated? that fast?) but when the frontdesk saw my 'coupe' they immediately gave me a replacement hairdryer from under the desk (so this must happen all the time). This was also the first hotel were we had 4 towels (for the 4 of us) and din't have to ask for extras.. not that important, but a nice touch (as are the bathroom amenities which are really cool-looking.. hey, i'm a girl, I like those details) The room itself was modern and very nice-looking with the brick walls and good bedlinens. The beds were extremely comfortable although quite warm (and it was nearly freezing outside), we only noticed during the second night that there was an extra hidden blanket :) There was some noise from the street (garbage truck, car alarms..) but hey, that's New York. When we returned on the evening of halloween housekeeping had left us a small candybag on the nighttable. Nice little gesture!

The free WiFi was incredibly slow and apparently lots of people with kids stayed in the hotel (although it doesn't really come across as an hotel to stay with children.

Well, the little gem on the \u201cLittle Italy/Chinatown\u201d edge of Soho, just steps away from the newly gentrified Bowery, the sohotel, thesohotel.com has pulled it off. If their recent green renovation where they officially sought a green focus, with a sleek look and low price becomes a trend in the hotel industry, the environment and our budgets will all give a sigh of relief and there won\u2019t be any bedbugs hitching a ride home on our rollaboards! How do they do it? 1. The lobby is sleek and cool, yet fun due to designer lamps, wi-fi and a big flatscreen. Minimal, hip furnishings on the first and second floors are embellished with a few of what I call \u201cthe latest candy magazines\u201d (the tabloids). The candy dish at check-in is full of European hard sweets and in addition, there is \u201ceye candy\u201d, a stream of young, continental, European (ah-hem) hard bodies checking in. Oh, the sohotel owners are European. That explains some of the following touches. 2. Just off the lobby is a charming vine-bedecked outdoor smoking deck with a cool bench. Complimentary coffee and tea is served each morning in the lobby and there is an ice machine. 3. There is no elevator for the four-story building, but we need to start thinking of this as a PLUS. . . Lots of exercise for guests and staff, yet no carbons were burned by a huge cage needless lifting us. The bellmen are cheerful and helpful. Unfortunate caveat, those with walking limitations will need to stay elsewhere. 3. The rooms are appointed minimally and thoughtfully to prevent our country\u2019s recent explosion in the bedbug population from considering the sohotel as a tempting trophy house. The sohotel purposefully chose wooden blinds instead of draperies, hip yet minimal bed frames without dust skirts, and bamboo flooring instead of carpets. How great to step out of bed without interfacing with creepy carpeting. Each bed has a fluffy, spotless white Swiss duvet instead of a bedspread. These and their white towels and sheets are each washed on the premises in a special eco-laundry room after each check-out. 4. For your convenience, there are in-room appointments including a satellite-enabled flatscreen TV, alarm clock, hair dryer, a bathroom shelf and Italian travel-sized toiletries (including toothpaste, which is a rare hotel inclusion) bottled water, more candy, extra hooks in the bathroom for wet towels, an ice bucket and did you notice that no phone is mentioned? What a cool way to reduce costs and clutter. We have our cell phones along, anyway. 5. The rooms\u2019 windows actually open and there is a ceiling fan in most of the rooms, so it was a lovely treat to have the option of sleeping with the A/C off. Caveat. . . on the 4th floor, this is not the case. There are skylight windows instead of fans and these and the other windows do not open. 6. For a great dinner, no fuel surcharge or carbon offsets required! Rather than taking a cab somewhere, just go left out the front door and you are steps from Little Italy\u2019s Mulberry Street which is full of authentic Italian eateries, most of them with tables spilling onto the street in which cars are forbidden. Or, turn right to head over to the Bowery (Keanu Reeves recently spotted there by yours truly) where Daniel Boulud\u2019s beautiful, affordable, delicious DBGB Kitchen and Bar will tantalize many of your senses. If it\u2019s beautiful people that you crave, walk north to Soho and get in line for the Cuban ears of corn at Habana on Prince Street (or try Habana in Malibu when you\u2019re on the left coast). I\u2019ll admit it, I stumbled upon the sohotel when I had a last minute change of plans during a trip to Paris last month and rerouted through New York during, d\u2019oh!, Fashion Week, where there were not many rooms to be had elsewhere in Manhattan without doing serious damage to the budget. As you can see, I duly fell in love and will return often to the sohotel. If you decide to stay there, enjoy the warm welcome by the staff and direct any of your concerns to the delightful marketing manager, Alain Derderian.

We would have stayed for our last two nights as well, but unfortunately they were all booked up. I think most of the people writing bad reviews on here are either competitors or just extremely nitpicky, because our stay and experience at the hotel was great. I'll start with the negatives of which there were only a few: Our electric went out a few times in the room; they fixed it quickly, but it went off a few more times over the next few hours whenever we plugged something in. Luckily, we saw the fuse box the staff member used to get it back on, and we just did it ourselves the next few times. Hopefully, they have since fixed the problem. The only other \"bad\" thing was the coffee. It just wasn't that good at all. Now for the good! Location is amazing. You are literally a 5 minute walk from all the best neighborhoods in lower Manhattan. Little Italy: 2 blocks, Chinatown: 1/2 a block, Lower East Side / East Village: 3-4 blocks, Broadway and shopping: 4 blocks, the Village 5-10 blocks--- everything is right there!!! We loved the location, and was one of the main reasons we booked here in the first place. The customer service was outstanding. Frank and Ali (hopefully got the names right)were awesome and more than ready to help with our baggage or anything else we needed. I can't think of thier names, but we dealt with the same 2 or 3 ladies at the front desk for our whole stay, and they were extremely friendly and helpful with everything... Like I said before, we would have stayed longer, but they were totally booked up. Another great thing about this hotel was the price. Compared to the neighboring hotels, they are priced very well. When I was walking around looking for another hotel on our last day, the cheapest thing I could find in Soho was running about $500-600 a night! For the location, they really do have the best prices in the area- and this is coming from someone who researches his trips extensively. One more thing----- the rooms are small. But, really- aren't you going to be out doing stuff all day anyway? Who cares if it's small? The bed was extremely comfortable as well. The only other thing I might recommend is that they get a fold-down ironing board behind the door or something. The big one from the front desk barely fits in the room once your bags and everything is set down, but we made it work. Let me state again- we had a great experience at the Sohotel, and are already looking at staying there again in December. The staff, price and location cannot be beat!

The beds were the best part--super comfy mattress and top quality linens! There was plenty of hot water, good water pressure, and adequate towels provided and tolietries (extra toilet paper, tooth paste, soap, shampoo, mints, bottled water--though the tap water was good to drink). We stayed five in a room (two queen beds and one twin). There was a half bath just down the hall, which was helpful for our group.

We were on the fourth floor and there's no elevator so you have to carry your bags up a staircase. No problem, but when we got to the room, we discovered that our radiator wasn't turned on, and it was literally freezing outside. There's no in-room phone to call the desk, so down four flights we went. Desk clerk was apologetic, got the radiator working remotely, and after 45 minutes we could take off our coats in our room without shivering. Later that night when we returned from an evening out at a smokey club we were eager to shower. No hot water, no matter what tricks I tried. I was too exhausted from y day-and-night on the town to get dressed and trek down the stairs. (The shower was working in the morning, for the record.) My bed was snugged up directly against the radiator. The building is very old, and the radiator made such loud noises all night that I honestly laughed at loud at the ridiculousness volume. It felt like we were in a hidden camera show. It was THAT loud. (Imagine the sound of banging a wrench on a metal pipe as hard as you can. I've lived in building with steam hear before, and this was no normal level radiator sound.) Though the noise wasn't constant, it occurred often enough to ensure that we never slept more that a half hour uninterrupted. The top of the bed was burning HOT to the touch; I couldn't safely rest my head there. (I was honestly worried the pillows might combust.) Also, the steam from the radiator formed a huge puddle under the bed and on the edge of my bed. It makes you appreciate the little luxuries like a phone in the room to call the desk, when you have to go down and up four flights to tell the desk that there's a lake of scalding hot water underneath the bed. They apologized and gave us five extra towels to soak up the puddle. The downside of the lively neighborhood is that on a Saturday night you can count on screaming drunk revelers living it up on the streets directly below. We were on the fourth floor, and, at 2 a.m., I could still make out conversations with the window closed. I love NY and the SoHotel's location so much that I might even consider staying there again --probably not though. The lobby was charming. The staff were nice.

If what you hear in the room is noisy for you, this means you are from a suburban area, or sleep lightly, and might be disturbed here.

The room had a few inches of space on each side of the bed (at the foot of the bed this was filled by a dresser, so the best way to traverse the room was by crossing the bed). The bathroom was small but functional, though some plaster was looking worse for wear. When I returned from an evening out I found the room was uncomfortably hot, and the radiator was letting off steam loudly. I couldn't control the heat, so I opened the window a crack, which certainly cooled the room (and made it noisy). Trouble was that I was then unable to re-close the window.

You won\u2019t get a wink at this Sohotel as there seem to be some fundamental problems with the design/conversion of this hotel: 1. The heating system is incredibly noisy (we tried three rooms-all very bad) it makes a loud gargling noise. In one room we tried it would occasionally make a very loud clang too for good measure. 2. The hot water for heating system runs through each room via a pipe in the corner. Because of this you can't control the heat so it's always too hot. We stayed in January and the temp outside was bellow freezing. With the heating switched off at the radiator it's still too hot to sleep even with just a sheet and the ceiling fan on. 3. Rooms on the left of the building face over a pool club that play their music SO LOUD it vibrates things in your room. To sum up: We changed rooms 3 times in two nights, they were some of the worst nights sleep I have ever had. I had booked for three nights but I managed to get my money back for the third. I'm not going to mention any other budget hotels in Manhattan incase anyone thinks this is a fake review but there are much better places for less money. If all this sounds a bit unbelievable, try it out for yourself. There should be a lot more negative reviews on trip advisor about this place (we read the others before booking).

Everything else that has been written on this site is true: check-in and anything else related to the reception desk takes 30+ minutes, even when you are the only person in the lobby. Our logic of booking the hotel was that it was in a great location and we wouldn't spend much time actually at the hotel, but we both managed to come down with stomach bugs, so we spent whole days cooped up in the tiny room.

We were on a very tight budget but knew we wanted to stay in Manhattan, knew we wanted our own private bathroom, and knew we wanted to be near a subway station. This limited our options so the Sohotel seemed like the best choice. In spite of the numerous bad reviews on tripadvisor, we booked it. I went expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised. The Sohotel is never going to be considered a beautiful, luxurious hotel, but that's not what it's there for. It's great value for money in a great location, and you'd be hard pressed to find en-suite rooms in Manhattan for anything cheaper. Trust me, we looked. There were bad aspects - scaffolding is still up so we had builders right outside our window (blinds stayed shut the entire trip - don't expect a room with a view!), who were noisy from 7.30am-5pm. The walls of the hotel are also paper thin so you hear people coming back late at night. However, I came armed with ear-plugs so after the first night (when I was so jetlagged I forgot to use them!), this didn't bother me. The 'decor' of the room wasn't stunning, but then why would it be at what we were paying? The good points outweighed this though. 1. Room size - for three girls in one room, we were a bit concerned, however we had 2 double beds, a bathroom, and some space to spare, which was pretty decent. 2. Location - absolutely fantastic. Walk to the right of the hotel, and it's a little bit dodgy, however, walk to the left and the further down the road you go, the nicer it gets. 5-10 minutes walk to the left and you're hitting designer shops, and nice restaurants and bars. A great area to eat out in, and to shop. It's also near lots of different subway stations. If you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes, you can connect to pretty much any line. You can get uptown in about 15-20 minutes. Absolutely ideal. 3. Cleanliness - this was fine. They cleaned the rooms and bathrooms daily, and were constantly changing our towels, which was much better than I was expecting. 4. The staff were also fairly helpful. They offered to carry our bags for us, were quite quick to deal with complaints, and also gave us leaflets about certain touristy things we were interested in, and booked our taxi to the airport. Best for young, budget travellers. All in all, for what you're paying, the Sohotel is great.

They also seemed to be quite drunk or otherwise. There was definitely a vomit smell coming from various areas. Our room was up 4 or 5 flights of dark, narrow stairs. No elevators. I am not against taking the stairs, but we had a lot of heavy luggage since this was a business trip/presentation.

They turn the volume down...oh let's say 2 notches, still very loud and then someone decided to go take a shower.......the noise of the running water kept us up for an hour, until everyone decided to shut up, stop taking showers and then only we could finally get some sleep. The next horrible experience we had was being woken up at 8:00 AM!!!!! on Monday morning. The hotel decided to do contruction in the room next to ours without giving us any notice or warning. It was not fun being woken up by saws, hammers, drills and every other power tool imaginable thinking the hotel was gonna collapse on us. When we went to complain, we just got a door slammed in our face from the contruction crew. Someone should teach them some manners. The other bad thing, was the toilets clogged easily, needless to say, that was very yuckyyyyyyy and there were stains on the toilet seats.

The rooms are hostel like, my partners was leaking water from the radiator and mine had clanking heating so not much sleep there. Not that we minded that much, who sleeps when they go to New York anyway!! Those of you who are going to NY shopping for gadgets here's a top tip - the camera / gadgets shops in Time Square have to pay a fortune for renting the shops there so, yes you guessed it they try and pass those costs onto their customers. If you're willing to walk a couple of blocks go to 370 West 51st Street (bet 8th & 9th Ave) and check out a little shop called E.P Electronics. You'll get all the gadgets you need at a fraction of the cost, and not have to go through the hassle of pushey salesmen who get very rude when you don't want to pay for something that you can cheaper over here in their shops.

My sleep would have been infinitely more disturbed by traipsing around in the middle of the night to demand a new room! And other than the music, our stay at the Sohotel was GREAT! Our room which was long and narrow, had high ceilings, wood floors and an exposed brick wall that added to the charm. Furnishings were at a minimum, due to the narrowness of the room, but it easily accomodated 4 women and a weekends worth of shopping and luggage. We had no problem with heat or water pressure. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, even going out to buy us a bag of ice, since they do not have an ice machine. Actually, that would be my biggest complaint about the hotel, but again, that surely didn't ruin our experience. There was a large flat screen TV in the room, and the small bathroom as well as our room were very clean.

So if you are looking for a BUDGET hotel,around $200 a night in NYC, for a room that would actually sleep 5 people, with 2 doubles and a twin, I don't know how you could beat the Sohotel. You just need to go with the flow a bit, and have some fun! One word of warnng though. Get a signed quote on your parking ticket from the garage the hotel uses for parking.

The next morning, I tried to take a shower- no water pressure. The water literally trickled down the wall. There were 2 temperatures, scalding or freezing.

We each paid for a night with a different credit card. First, we walked into our room (2 double beds and 1 twin) to discover the beds had no blankets on them. Fine. We will let them do their thing and we will just grab a bite to eat and come back. Came back, the room had bee heavily sprayed with some scent and we noticed a roach had been smooshed on the ceiling above one of the beds. Gross! Next morning we discovered that the shower ran intervals where it was extremely cold and extremely hot. Not the most pleasurable experience. We also woke to discover that one girl had been bitten by what we thought were fleas (bc we could see them) all over her neck and torso! We discussed this with the front desk and they immediately changed us to two rooms with a single double bed and gave a refund for that night stay. Next morning, in room #1 they woke up to a freezing cold room and no way to turn on the heater. They then went to take a shower and NEVER got hot warm water. They times it for 20 minutes! Room 2, couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn on the heat. Shower took about 5 minutes to heat up (not the problem) and then the water pressure became less and less until there was absolutely NO water coming out of the showerhead! Not only was it freezing in the room but now I was wet with conditioner to rinse out of my hair! Come to find out minutes later, the girl who got bit had an allergic reaction and had to pay to rebook her flight so that she could go home to go to the doctor. (So, room 1 girls check out and now we are down to one single room) We are then refunded for the second night because of the problems. We have ONE more night to stay and have received a refund for the first two nights. The last girl and I return to our later that day to discover that the heat is mysteriously turned on in our room...the freezer had just became an unbearable sauna and we still couldn\u2019t figure out how to adjust the heat. So, of course, we go to the front deck to ask for some help. They are all already so pissed at us they all give us attitude and exclaim that there is a knob on the heater.

That\u2019s what we had been telling the front desk! So he goes in another room, brings the knob in and turns off the heat. Then he goes to the front desk to tell them about the knob, comes back up, and tells us that we cant keep the knob because someone else is going to be checking into the other room and then if we want the heat back on we have to go back to the front desk and ask them to turn it on. Lets think about this for a minute...they want us to go down in the middle of the night when we are cold, half asleep, and in our pajamas so that we can wait until their ready to turn on our heat!?!?!? Wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to just reassign the other people to another room! Of course, we couldn\u2019t speak to a manager about this until morning. So we told him what happened and then preceded to tell him that we wanted the difference back from the price of the big room that we had paid for already and the smaller room we had been transferred to because of the fleas. Well, the manager blew up at me! Yelling that we are taking advantage of the situation, he was not going to give us a refund, and that he is the victim here! BS!!

After we had struggled up the staircase with the heavy suitcases, he reluctantly brought up 2 small ones, and asked me if I couldn't carry more. Some reception! Then we came to the room \u2013 we had requested a quiet room which we were assured that it was. Apart from the fact that the window was stuck and needed a Herculean effort to open it, it opened onto several air conditioning outlets from adjacent buildings, and below our \u2018quiet\u2019 room was one of Soho\u2019s hottest nightclubs with the \u201cdoof-doof\u201d thump of the amplified music vibrating through the bed from 10pm to 4am. If the bed had been comfortable, we may just have dropped off to sleep after 4am, but the mattress was rubber hospital style, with a waterproof covering, complete with wrinkles. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, there was no telephone, save a payphone in the lobby, no elevator for 5 floors, bare floor, and bare brick walls in the room, completing the dismal effect of a cell. There was one redeeming feature: we were provided with two half-pint bottles of spring water each day. Accommodation in NYC is scarce and expensive, but for the same price as we were paying at Sohotel, we were able to find a hotel in the same area with a decent mattress, no nightclub below, an elevator, and with professional and friendly staff.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad for the Price\u201d", "Author": "robbo1963", "ReviewID": "UR10051065", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights - the hotel is ideally located, we walked everywhere and was easy to find.The room itself was very small - we were on the 3rd floor - very clean though small.... very noisy with people walking down the corridor- alot of noise comes thru the door so we were woken with late revellers returning to the hotel.

My 17 year old daughter and I (a female) stayed at the Sohotel for two nights and we were not disappointed. Our room was more than adequate; exactly what I had expected based on comments I'd read online that seemed measured and fair. We felt completely safe, were two blocks from charming Little Italy, and we found the staff very helpful. They will even hold your luggage for you after check out so that you can maximize your time in the city. Make sure you ask where to park your car if you have one, as they have an arrangement with one of the garages nearby. I was unaware of this fact, and when one of the hotel employees heard the outrageous amount of money I was being charged for my car ($50/night!), he insisted on walking to the garage with us, carrying my luggage the 2-3 blocks I must add, to make sure that it was understood that we were staying at the hotel and entitled to the reduced price. This fine young man, walked back to the hotel to stamp my parking stub with the hotel stamp, and stayed with me until he felt certain that all had been worked out. As a huge, and unfortunate, word of caution...the second that he left, the parking attendent tried to charge me the original price suspecting, I suppose, that I was caught between a rock and a hard place seeing as he was holding my car hostage. Make sure that you have the stomach to stick to your guns, or don't come with a car...I had more than one difficulty with parking people... But again, I was so terribly grateful to that young man who did something for me that he certainly did not have to do and what most people surely would not have done.

It's a 40floor walkup in the Lighting district, and is itself above an old lighting store. It is not much to look at, and offers even less in the service department. It is, however, awesome. Although it is not advertised as such, the SoHotel is the oldest hotel in New York City. It's in a part of SoHo that allows for a 5 min walk to old Little Italy, Chinatown, and the aforementioned CBGB site or Joey Ramone place. Broome is not that far south of Houston, and therefore offers a short walk to a NYC Must-see, Katz's Deli (where Harry met Sally, for those of you interested in such things.) The entire neighbourhood around SoHotel is bustling with little shops, diners, patessieries, nightspots, and upscale restaurants (especially Little Italy, which is literally 2 blocks West of the hotel). Subway stations are short walks in any direction...you can get on the brown or the green very easily. The hotel itself is, as I said, not much to look at, but the historical aspect makes it all worth it. It is not only very clean (not a single bug was seen during our 4-days stay), but recent renovations have given it a very old-New-York style. All the inside rooms (vs. the outside rooms, which have windows) have an exposed brick wall that is part of the original building and sports a skylight, to make up for the lack of windows. The dividing walls are paper-thin and the rooms themselves are about 250 sq. feet (if that), but unlike other hostel-style hotels, this one has a private bathroom in every room and full maid service daily. The rooms are nicely appointed with a full bureau and closet, and the beds are comfortable. There is a TV in evcery room, many of them fat-panel LCDs. Finally, I have to mention the front desk service. New York is a city in which service institutions live and die on word-of-mouth, and the SoHotel is obviously wll aware of this and takes every step to ensure your stay is a comfortable one. When we arrived (the 4 of us) with the intention of staying in on e room with 2 double beds, the discovered that they had made a mistake and given us a single. Rather than move us into another room, the Concierge was kind enough to provide us with a SECOND room, completely of his own accord. I can't recommend the SoHotel highly enough; the location, the history, the price and the service all made it a very comfortable place to stay and added to our overall enjoyment of our NYC visit.

The staff is not helpful. The day before we were to leave I asked if they had an alarm I could borrow-since there are no phones in the room a wake up call was not an option. They said 'no', they didn't have one. But, they could give a wake-up knock on the door. I scheduled one for 5:00am. Luckily I woke up on my own at 4:45 (not difficult as the constant sirens and traffic that you hear throughout the night make it difficult to sleep in the first place) because they never came to for the wake-up knock. When I went downstairs to check out no one was there. The phone was ringing, I called out 'hello' but no answer. I waited 15 minutes in the lobby before a man came out from a room behind the front desk rubbing sleep from his eyes. When I asked him about the wake up knock he said, 'I don't see no wake up knock here'. So, then I said to him, we also scheduled a ride to the airport yesterday for 5:30 am to the airport (something they offer for $45. Oh, he didn't have that written down either. Luckily there was another sleeping man that woke up and came out so he was able to drive us for the $45. 2. The place is dingy. The walls are dirty and EVERYTHING squeeks, I guess they've never heard of WD40. The blinds are dirty and broken. 3. The bed is one of the most uncomfortable beds I've ever slept on. And, it is a full, not even a queen. It has a plastic sheet underneath the the sheet-I guess they are worried about guests wetting the bed??? You can feel the springs. 4. It is very noisy. 5. The room is TINY. Barely enough room to walk around. Sink is in bedroom since there is no room in the bathroom for it. The bathroom is so small that you can touch elbow to elbow in the shower, and when you get out of the shower you practically step in the toilet. 6.

I had a layover and Detroit and after waiting 4 hours (due to delays) for my connection to New York, I found out the airport was shut down and all flights were canceled. I had to stay in Detroit so I called the Sohotel and they said that would be fine. When I paid for the hotel they charged me for one night since I arrived on the 11th and left on the 12th. I checked my credit card statement and they charged me twice. When I called, they said it's because of their cancellation policy and that was that.

No assistance is offered by staff to take your luggage to the upper floors. The website gives the impression of moderm rooms with ample space. In some places you had to walk sideways around the room. Our bathroom was designed more for `hobbits' not human beings. Although most staff were very helpful we had to describe to 3 different people that we had an extra night booked. This had been agreed before we left the UK.. Its stressful being told 3 times you have no room booked for your last night. If you want a quiet hotel DO NOT stay here. There is no double glazing in the rooms and hence road traffic is very audible, even at the back of the hotel on floors 2 and 3 (we tried several during our stay). At least the traffic noise drowned out the heating pipes playing an irritating tune all night long. We had to listen to the Guy's TV in the next room blaring at full volume til 5.30 am. He checked out and we thought yes some sleep. We returned the next night hopeful of a few hours sleep to find on Thurs-Sat our room was directly above a bar/club. The floor actually vibrated to the thud thud of the music until at least 3-4am, and no soundproofing seemed to be in place. What is even more annoying is the Staff were fully aware this was common practice but failed to draw it to our attention. Asking $180 dollars a night is a disgrace for such a room.

Shower was strong and hot. Staff - all v helpful and courteous. Happy to provide extra towels, adjust the TV, book cabs etc. Available 24hours. One night the people in the room next to us were having some sort of drunken party. The night staff were quick to keep them in check when we complained. Price - excellent value. Decor - clean, modern and functional. Safe - staff were available at all times and the entrance was well lit. CONS: Small rooms - no wardrobe, although a hanging rail is provided and plenty of drawer space. Noise - not a place to go for peace and quiet (but then again, where is in central New York?!!). We stayed in room 220. Noise from the bar/ club below was audible but didn't bother us too much with the windows closed and the air con on. TV - aerial didn't work well so poor reception and few channels available. No lift and the stairs are steep.

I was given a tiny room - which was fine as I wasn't planning on spending much time in it. Although I must say I was a bit surprised that the room didn't even have a telephone! While I was trying to sleep, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye moving. I turned on the light to find a small reddish bug. The hotel is old and a few bugs is to be expected. I got some kleenex and picked it up. Before jumping back into bed however, I pulled the covers back to make sure there wasn't any more. What I discovered was horrifying!! There were a couple dozen bugs crawing under the covers and along the rim of the bed/mattress. I panicked and immediately packed my stuff and went down to the front desk and told the staff who looked absolutely shocked and surprised at my discovery. After the other reviews on this board, it is clear they were putting on a \"good show\" of disbelief! They moved me to another room that I picked apart from top to bottom. While I didn't find any bugs, I didn't sleep either. I kept the light on because I researched bed bugs on my laptop and it said they don't come out when its light. Not immediately, but two days later, red bumps appeared on my arms, hands, neck and feet - the areas that were exposed during the night. They itched like crazy and stayed on me for well over two weeks. I advise anyone who is \"sitting on the fence\" on this hotel to really heed the reviews of this board as they are indeed accurate and truthful. I understand that the price of this hotel is appealing when it is so hard to find any others in Manhattan that come close.

The hot water was always hot/warm depending on what time you took a shower, my top tip is to have one before 830. My only complaint was that the room did not have any windows which ment it felt a bit like a prision cell and you had to make a trip to the window at the end of the hall to have a look at the weather for the day. The hotel was in a good location excellent for resturants and bars and also for shopping and for seeeing the sights of lower manhatten. It also had good transport links with three easy to reach stations. If you are coming from JFK, then you should really get of at Bowery street and not Grand street as the hotel recomends as this station is closer.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I was worried about encountering the unpleasantries I read online - namely loud noise from disco on first floor, roaches under bed, stained and paper-thin towels, and unreliable hot shower. None of these happened to us. We (my partner joined me later in the night after he rushed down from a conference in another state of USA) stayed on the second floor but there was no loud music throughout the 5nights we stayed there. The hygiene level was superb. Room was spic and span. No roaches, or any crawlies, throughout our stay. And that's not just the room, even the lobby and corridor (on the second floor where we stayed) was clean and well-sanitised (every night when I stepped into the hotel and walked up the stairs, I could \"smell dettol\" instantly) And towels were clean, fresh-smelled and decent. Not paper-thin. Only upon my scrutiny did I notice one towel with faint tiny stains; but it was clearly a well-washed, clean towel. And the room attendant was so generous with the towels: we had 4pieces of towel on the first night, she removed 2 used ones the next day and issued another 4 clean peices to us. At the end of our stay, there was a heap of clean towels in our room. Hot showers was a no-issue too. It was end Nov (cold) and getting hot showers was important to me. So particular and paronoid was I over what I read online (unreliable hot showers) that I specifically tested the shower the moment I checked into the room. As it was an old building, it wasn't an electric heater hence would take a while for the hot water to flow out. I didn't get hot waters out at first try, so I went to the reception counter to enquire and after returning back to my room, within minutes, they got a \"technical\" young chap knocking on my door to check it. It was fine, we got nice warm showers throughout our stay. One warning to those who intend to book through travelocity though. We booked 5 nights through travelocity, the booking was confirmed but upon checking-in at the hotel, it was discovered that the hotel's system registered my booking as 1 night stay. All thanks to Marco's (think he is the manager or boss) quick problem-solving on the spot, he got some bookings resorted and found a room available on the 5 nights we were in NY. Jose, who attended to me, was nice and gave me assurance that they'd get the arrangement iron out when he realised the discrepancy in records. From his exclamation \"oh no, it's happening again\", I took it that the hotel's system and travelocity's system do not \"talk to each other\" in sync.

We were down the street from all the great eateries in Little Italy, close Chinatown, near cute shops in Soho, and near the subway. My friend and I stayed in a room on the third floor with 2 double beds and private bathroom. The room was medium sized, and had a dresser, nightstands, and coat rack to hang our clothes on. The furniture and bathroom fixtures all looked pretty new and were actually quite cute. Overall, the room seemed clean, although I might recommend BYOP- Bring Your Own Pillowcase...there were a couple of stray hairs on mine. Nothing too major, just pulled them off and turned the pillow over, but not too appealing either. The bedding wasn't five star or anything, but it was good enough, and we slept fine. The front desk staff were polite and helpful. Shame on the judgmental reviewer who said they looked like drug addicts- young with tattoos is hip nowadays, you know. Although I will say the hotel could probably pick out more stylish uniforms- the janitors garbs aren't too fashionable. Anyways, I really appreciated the help of the front desk, the staff there gave me good directions to the subway and genuinely seemed to be looking out for my well-being. Check-in and check-out didn't take too long, and my credit card was billed correctly. The only other thing I would mention is that there is some noise because the walls are not particularly thick. We slept in until about 10am and heard folks shutting their doors and walking down the halls to the lobby, but it wasn't a big deal to us. If you like a lot of quiet or are a light sleeper, earplugs would probably solve this problem.

I've stayed in numerous hotels throughout New York that haven't been budget in the past, so i was very dubious, but we were both pleasantly surprised. The room was big and spacious. The sheets and towels were changed everyday. Really it was better than you would expect all round and the location is fantastic. The only problem was that you have to either have a boiling hot or freezing cold shower, and the bathroom is tiny - but really who cares, and what do you expect for the price?

Once we arrived at the hotel we were impressed with the value for the money. I was travelling with three other friends and was delighted to see that there were three beds in the room and they made no fuss over visitors or additional guests in the room. We were put on the second floor which was the first floor of the hotel. There was a bar directly below us. We went out for the evenings living up the NYC nightlife and returned to our room nightly around 3am. We weren't aware of a nightclub directly below us prior to checking in, but the bass coming through the floor was so loud that we felt like we were in the club. I'm actually a bass lover, have subwoofers in my car and love going to loud nightclubs, but this bass was boooming, no exaggeration at all. For me and my friends we didn't really care since we weren't sleeping until after the club closed anyways, but for other travellers you will find it virtually impossible to sleep from the bass alone. If your a fan of house music, maybe it'll be paradise for you. I was impressed with the hotel overall for value but I agree with the last reviewer's review, only stay there if you are planning to go out late at night. They should probably adjust the housekeeping times to at least noon to account for people not being able to sleep through the bass. We had to tell housekeeping to go away. We missed our checkout time by about 3 hours, but blamed it on the nightclub below and they didn't charge us any extra. For us it was a good experience but be forewarned about the bass, it's insane!! I only recommend this to people who are only looking for a bed to crash in late at night after hitting up a club. One of my friends thought of the brilliant idea of buying booze for our hotel room, and going back and forth from our room to the club to drink.
