The combination of older furniture and original elements combined with new colorful and tasteful ecclectic design makes it good option for people who are bored with ubiquitous corporate or outdated hotels. The rooms are somewhat small, but that's normal for Paris. There is a small desk next to the bed, but it can barely hold more than a laptop. The bathroom was quite spacious and like the rest of the hotel in very good condition. Wifi was also free (request access codes at the reception). Other facilities are quite limited (no coffee maker in the room and such), but that is to be expected for this type of hotel in Paris. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel (but I almost never do in hotels). Service was at least adequate and sometimes was quite good. We requested a room with a bath through e-mail and received it without any problems and getting tea, plates and cups late in the evening was no problem at all. The location is one of the main reasons I picked the hotel. Metro/RER stops are a few minutes away, everything is relatively close by. Although the direct area isn't that exciting (but safe and nice), you have enough great options for whatever you want to do within 10-15 minutes by foot. One of the only real faults I could find was the lack of a luggage storage room and the way the hotel (at least the person at the desk at the time) manages that fact. Suitcases left in storage at the hotel are lined up next to the reception desk. When we asked if they couldn't be stored in a secure location, the response (given with typical Parisian attitude) was \"I'll be here all the time, our guests can be trusted and you can always take your suitcase with you if you aren't satisfied\". All in all we were quite happy with our stay and I am definitely willing to return here if the price is right (I was able to get a discount, the normal prices might be a tad steep if you aren't used to hotel prices in Paris).", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a nice area\u201d", "Author": "SmaRt1904", "ReviewID": "UR125642183", "Content": "We had a superb stay.

Breakfast (NOT included in the room rate) was very expensive, overpriced at 14 euros per person for just a couple of breads, 2 types of cheese and boiled eggs. I booked a room for 3 people and got a very big and spacious room in the ground floor. My first concern with this room was the big sky window that didn't have any curtains. Surprisingly, this was the smallest problem of the room. This room was right across the room from the elevator, so people stopped to chat while waiting for the elevator all night long, making it impossible for me to get any sleep. The other problem is that this room was adapted for disabled people (which we weren't), so it had a shower with no curtains and a bath with no shower. Next day we asked to be transferred to another room. The new room was on the first floor, and much smaller, although we paid the same price. Again, it was very beautiful and well decorated. Bathroom was nicer, it had a closed shower, although it didn't have a bath. But it barely fitted the extra-bed (we were in 3 people) and it was conjugated to another room, so we could hear every single word they said in the next room. Of course it didn't help they were very loud Italians with a small baby that cried most of the time. Location, as I said, was good, but not great. It's very well and centrally located between Luxembourg Garden and Sorbonne University, Notre Damme Cathedral, but the nearest subway station was about 3-4 blocks away. I know it doesn't sound bad, but I've stayed in other cheaper hotels in Paris where you had a subway station just around the corner, so this one was a little disappointing.

The room was the basic double and it was an excellent size - big enough for us not to trip over our 2 large suitcases and the bathroom was enormous by European standards!

This is quite unfortunate as to access the corridor you have to open a door which closes quite loudly and then to go into the housekeepers room there is another door which closes loudly as well. This all started about 8:30 every morning and never failed to wake us up and keep waking us up. It also sounded as if someone was trying to come into our room because the closing of those doors would shake our door as if someone was trying to get in. The elevator is also TINY - you can fit one person and 1 piece of luggage in it -- we just took the stairs but to get the bags in and out of the room we had to take a few trips. The rooms are quite basic, even the Junior Suites don't have a mini-refrigerator. There is a bar size refrigerator in the kitchen downstairs which guests have access to along with plates, cutlery, glasses, wine bottle openers, etc. We really liked this neighborhood. There were lots of restaurants very close by, the Jardin de Luxembourg was across the street and you could walk to all the sites from here. Having such a large landmark close by made it easy to get back if we ever took a taxi.
