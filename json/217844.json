Hallways are bright and clean. Go downstairs and the hotel personnel are friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant off the lobby. Orchard is located half-way up Nob Hill, very close to Union Square, an excellent location. The walk is a bit of a climb back up to the hotel, but not worth complaining about. I feel at home here!

The room was superb with a great view onto Bush Street. You could hear the cable cars running on the Mason-Powell Line / Mason-Hyde Line ... but it was not loud enough to be a bother and they shut down later in the evening. Bed was good, room was clean and house keeping did a great job as did the doorman / conceirage with friendly chat and advice. We did not use the restaurant, but there are a number of cafe's and restaurants in the area.

The location is good -- just up the hill from Union Square (although, to be fair, it's a big hill!). The only downside - the hotel restaurant was empty the entire four days that I was there, and thus I didn't eat there.

First, it's very easy to pull up in front of the hotel as they have a loading zone with their valet standing by. Even if you are not using their valet parking, you can stop and unload your car. BTW, there are a couple of parking lots on Bush within close proximity if you don't want to spend $40/24 hours for their valet parking. We did use their parking however, and it was quite convenient. I have to say that Cornell, the valet this morning, already had our car waiting for us before we even called... pretty cool. We found that everyone who worked for the hotel (the ones we encountered) were all very nice and could not do enough to help. Okay, so you expect employees at a good hotel to show good manners, but there was nothing forced -- Ariel and the rest all seem to like their jobs, their customers and the hotel, and they show it. As I mentioned, our room was larger than we expected, and well decorated, clean and inviting. The bathroom was also quite large, well lit and fitted up with excellent towels and products. Their robes were a treat and the bed was very comfortable. There was equipment for making coffee and a mini bar (which we did not use, so I cannot comment on the rate.)

It was clean and the bed was very comfortable, and it had an in-room safety box which was easy to use. A big plus was the free wireless internet. We found this to be immensely useful because we could use our laptop to look up places to visit and find places to eat. And there are plenty near this hotel.

It also has a cable car stop right outside the door on Powell Street.

Our room overlooked the front of the hotel on busy Bush Street with the cable cars rumbling up and down Powell Street nearby. We initially thought it might be noisy.

Not once did we feel threatened or even uncomfortable. Can't say the same for some other parts of SF. And lastly, we want to thank the staff. They were great. Attentive but not overpowering. They were there when we needed them and answered all our questions. The front desk staff were nice and friendly, the concierge was very helpful (get him to organise the car to go to the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was great) and the maid service was very quick and thorough. Did we have any grumbles? Yes, but they were minor. The windows were dirty (big city grime?) and there was no way to boil water other than for coffee (we drink tea and water boiled in a coffee maker tastes like coffee no matter how much you rinse it). And their TV was a bit ancient - a flat screen would be nice (although there is so much to do in SF that watching TV is not top of mind). We thought their breakfast was average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they could do better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we only tried it once. There are lots of other places to eat nearby.

Please keep in mind, our review is based off how we travel: we just are after a nice, basic hotel and primarily need a bed, hot shower and bathroom. We don't spend much awake time in a hotel while on vacation. Our room was clean (no bed bugs after inspection), king bed, eletronic safe (that passed the 0000 and 1234 test) and decent sized bathroom. There was no fan in the bathroom and the shower was a tub-based shower with curtain. The grout/caulking was in need for a good scrubbing. Not a deal breaker by any means. The hotel loves to market itself as a 'green or eco' hotel, however the room had no much areas to place plastic bottles, newspapers seperate from the standard trash. Housekeeping may do this, but we made it a point to have those items on the desk with a note asking them to do so. TV was a CRT or non flat screen. Not a big deal for us. The front desk had a DVD collection you could borrow. Oh, no real lobby area if you like to read, drink tea, relax, etc. The room also had a 'sleep CD.' USE IT! Very relaxing and assisted with catching some REM sleep. Speaking of which, this hotel is in a major U.S. city, if you are expecting complete silence, you picked the wrong city to visit. Expect police and fire sirens to happen once or twice a night. Chinatown is two blocks down on Bush. After dropping about $40 (for two) at a nearby diner on morning one, I walked and got a pork steamed bun at a Chinese bakery for $1.10 on morning two. Score. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant.

Cable car stop is around the corner, Chinatown gate is 5 mins away, and Union Square is just two blocks away. SFMOMA, ferry building, BART, and countless restaurants are in walking distance.

Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Here are some tips which can protect your knees in San Francisco: 1. If you wanna go to Fishermen's Wharf, DO NOT take cable car, TAKE F LINE! It's faster, not so crowded, and it has stops for each pier. 2. If you stay in downtown hotels and wanna head to Lombard St., DO NOT take cable car. You should take Line 45 on the Stockton St. and get off at Union & Hyde. Walk along the Hyde and you will find that you are right on the top of Lombard St.. You can take cable car (Powell-Mason line) at the intersection of Columbus & Mason (walk down to the slope, about 300 yards away) back to downtown or for Fishermen's Wharf. Powell-Mason is not crowded but has same fun. 3.

Location Location Location- you're walking minutes away from Union Square, Chinatown and the Westfield shopping centre. The cable car stops right at the intersection of Bush and Powell, so access to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf is easy. My wife and I took a day trip to Sonoma/Napa Valley and the Avis location to pick up a car was just a few blocks from the hotel. Although parking at any hotel is very expensive in San Francisco, this was offset by parking just a block away at the Stockton garage. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We requested via e-mail a high room and away from Powell Street. We were very pleasantly surprised upon check-in that not only did they acknowledge the request, but that that they were able to accommodate it as well. The bathroom was huge and clean. There is a mini-fridge in the room as well. Also, wi-fi is available in the room, which was important to us as we have a phone that is wi-fi enabled but without a data plan, meaning that we have access to internet and e-mail only via free wi-fi. The front staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The cleaning staff did a fantastic job every day. The doorman, Cornell, was exceptionally professional, courteous and full of great suggestions as to what bus to take, where to eat and where to visit. One of the best things we did while planning our trip to SF was to buy a CityPass. It gave us unlimited use of Muni & Cable Car for 7 days plus admission to the California Academy of Sciences, Blue & Gold Fleet Bay Cruise, Aquarium of the Bay at Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and the de Young Museum (which we chose over the Exploratorium). The CityPass is well worth the $69, but a really good tip for you is that if you purchase it directly from alcatrazcruises.com, for the same price you can exchange the Blue & Gold Fleet Bay Cruise for an actual tour of Alcatraz prison. Also, if you want to visit Alcatraz, book it in advance as you will probably not be able to get a ticket if you just show up to the ticket counter. It can sell out several weeks in advance.

Aside from a few minor annoyances (noted below), we had a great time staying here. Pros: Location location - you're blocks away from Union Square and Westfield shopping centre, and there's a street car stop literally outside the hotel. Another bonus for us was the Walgreens a block away, as well as the Starbucks across the street from it. Convenience is a huge plus Staff - all very nice. Front desk clerk cleared up an error that was made with my room rate on my reservation. We were always greeted with a smile and a hello whenever we got out of the elevator, and never had any issues or problems with anyone who worked there. Comfort - rooms were big and spacious, the bed and sheets/pillows were very comfy (many naps were taken after shopping trips) and the bathroom was clean and definitely large enough for both of us to get ready. Cons: Noise - Walls seemed kind of thin, we could hear noises from the room beside ours. Also, there was this strange beeping noise that would constantly go off in the middle of the night. Definitely didn't come from our electronics, seemed like it was the walls or ceilings. Lots of street noise as well, even though we requested a quiet room.

The hotel is really well located, just a minute's walk from Union Square, where everything seems to happen from (you get the tour buses here, the big shopping stores are here and it's a cool place to chill out and people watch etc.). It's also very close to a few good eateries and cafes, Market Street as well as the start of Chinatown. However, if you have mobility problems, it may not be the best for you as it is quite a steep hill to come back up from Market Street/Union Square. The hotel staff were friendly enough and the rooms were a decent size. The King size bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in (including my own at home!) and the big TV worked well. Had a coffee maker in the room (you can to use this to make tea) and the bathroom was nice and big and well stocked with eco-friendly products. Also, unlike many hotels in SF, it has a little laptop in reception for you to check emails etc. for free. The breakfast room doubles for a restaurant and bar, neither of which we utilised as it was a bit lacking in ambience. Now to the few negative points. Firstly, you cannot open the windows, although the air con works fine.....just makes you feel a tad claustrophobic on the odd occassion. The second point was that when we booked, we were to receive breakfast included in the cost of the room. When we arrived we got some vouchers to use each morning, but they were only for 2 pastries and 1 cup of tea or coffee each (although 'pastries' included some rather delicious home made scones and muffins). The breakfast staff seemed a bit miffed when we said that's all we wanted as it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning and we just had brunch later on when we got hungry. Just double check that if your room includes breakfast, what type of breakfast it is! However, probably the most annoying thing on our entire trip to America was the Chinese cleaner lady. For some unknown reason, she felt it necessary to try to clean our room at 8 o'clock every morning while we were either still in bed or in a state of undress! When I told her we didn't want our room cleaned, she still came back later in the day and was very persistent.....even when I put the do not disturb sign out! Got a bit annoying after a day or two. I really don't know why hotels don't offer discounts on your room if you don't want it cleaned while you're there. I was trying to save them money changing towels etc. which for an eco-friendly hotel, I'd have thought they'd appreciate!

Very comfortable beds and relatively quiet room, even though we were facing busy Bush Street and the Cable Car line. The breakfast in the morning was good, as was the room service dinner we had delivered. All in all it was a very good experience and we would definitely stay here again. Note** - if you are considering a room there with 2 over-sized twin beds, make sure you check that the bathroom shower is adequate for your needs.

I have been traveling to San Fran for almost a decade and have always stayed at the Maderin Oriental. But after the last several years I had noticed a drastic decline in the level of service at the Manderin, so I decided to try the Orchard. What a great change... I wish I had done it sooner. The reception and service were excellent. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable (I had a larger room with king bed.... there are apparently two sizes of 'regular' rooms, and I would suggest the larger). And the location could not be beat, with easy access to nob hill, union square, chinatown, and many others. Even the immediate surrounding of the hotel was perfect, with great restaurants and bars within feet of the place. The hotel bar was nice, low key, and rarely crowded at all.... with friendly bartenders eager to engage. The overall value of the room was unbeatable for San Fran. There was one rather minor, but annoying, 'con'..... the food. Particularly breakfast. They provide a continental breakfast buffet which was seriously lacking. Stale sliced bread, bland bagels, some limited fruit, and maybe some muffins and scones. It's what you'd expect from one of those horrible Best Western 'free' breakfast, not a nice boutique hotel in San Fran. And while my breakfast was included as part of a promotional deal, I overheard another table complaining that they were charged $14 per person for this \"buffet\". The hotel was even going to charge me for a coffee only (instead they just made my included breakfast). It's those type of meaningless annoying charges things that really turn me off (just raise your room rates by $3/night and give me the coffee for free... it's a huge appearance plus). So breakfast was a disappointment... and I'm not even a big breakfast eater! That being said, I will still return with pleasure to the Orchard Hotel. I look forward to returning in fact. It is a truly exceptional hotel in a great location. I hope they fix the breakfast, which would require little effort. But even if they don't its an easy to walk to one of many nearby restaurants and coffee places open in the morning, so that one failure will not keep me from returning. It's a great hotel with all pluses and just that one 'con'.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cSurprised how genuinely comfortable and friendly it was, especially for the price!\u201d", "Author": "kgia", "ReviewID": "UR101168156", "Content": "Well located, right at Bush & Powell cable car, but the room was quiet with a lovely comfy big bed.

The room had an older tube TV, minibar prices were reasonable, robes nice. The bathroom was a nice combination of original and updated. Now for the two irritants. one small, one not so small. The in room coffee maker was set up for one person. A single cup. So you got one cup of decaf, one of regular. The big irritant was the WiFi. Just awful. Slow, dropped connections, rude customer service. It was a third party vendor called \"The WiFi Guys\" and their business was to sell you an upgrade to their \"free\" service by making the \"free\" service as unusable as possible. In my opinion, WiFi is either free or it isn't. No sort of free. This was free, but terrible service and presumably better service, if you paid to \"upgrade\".

Shortly afer my review was posted I was contacted by Damien Keller, the hotel's director of sales and marketing. Damien apologized for the room I was given and offered a special rate for my next trip to San Francisco, which I accepted since I was heading back in November. Not only did I get a nice rate for my November stay but I was also given a mini-suite, which was terrific and much appreciated for this hectic business trip. In an era when most American businesses seem to have little concern--and often no clue---about customer service (e.g., Dell Computers, AT&T), I was hugely impressed with the kind and professional response of Damien, my upgraded room, and the way everything was handled by the hotel staff.

I decided on 3 afer all the years we have stayed here, brought a family reunion once to this hotel and suggested it to other travelers. First off, we have stayed at The Orchard every Thanksgiving and a few other times over the past 8-9 years. The pluses have been the location, the room price (minus the expensive valet), size of rooms and seeing Cornell, a long time exceptional employee every year. The cons we noticed this year were the same furnishings that have been in the rooms for all these years. I think it's time for some replacement pieces do to wear and tear. The bed is long over do for replacement. I have a neurological condition and the springs poking through sent me into a massive flare. I have never had this problem with other hotel beds. There's a staff member operating the breakfast area who could care less he was even employed (I see this mentioned in another review as well). Although the price of the hotel is attractive, they make-up a good portion on parking. I would suggest literally going around the corner and parking for almost 1/2 the price. On our last night, a water pipe broke on our floor around 11pm and it caused massive flooding. The entry way into our room and past the bathroom was soaking wet. I'm sure this was nothing compared to the other damage in the hotel. It looked like there was a good 1\" in the hallway and we were told it flowed from the 9th to the 5th floor. Disasters happen and I feel bad the hotel had to deal with this mess. What was unacceptable was the way they did deal with it. I completely understand the need to get the water up ASAP and make an attempt to dry it before mold infests and mitigate further damage, but the people operating the machines were yelling the entire night. As we layed awake listening to them, they weren't just yelling about the job at hand...they were also yelling idle chit-chat without any regard to the guests in the rooms. Sometime around 7am, I heard one of them yell..\"Well it's time for these people to wake-up.\" I don't think anyone ever slept! If I was the manager of this hotel, I would have bent over backwards to apologize and provide service above and beyond. If I was in charge, I would have provided free coffee to all the guests in the lobby and maybe opened their Continental Breakfast to everyone in the hotel as a way of showing good faith at minimal cost. After our 4 night stay at check-out, we were charged for the last night. Really? You must be kidding? After some negotiation, we were offered a discount on our next stay. NO! Then, it went to 20% off. NO! Then, it went to 50% off. NO! Then finally, the Manager removed the charge for our very long, sleepless night. From the beginning, there should have been NO question that the night would not be charged, not only for us, but for all the guests that endured the brunt of it. The hotel has to have insurance to cover these disasters and loss of revenue, so from a financial standpoint, the charge was senseless. My only hope is they got the place miracously dried out and maybe it will light a fire for some refurbishing.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cThis is the best hotel I have stayed in in years!

Beware Rooms That Face Alley\u201d", "Author": "RonboNJ", "ReviewID": "UR86834679", "Content": "Normally I stay at brand hotels that offer loyalty programs whose points quickly add up with the amount of business travel that I do. The fact that I ended up at The Orchard in San Francisco was mainly due to the fact that the company that brought me out here was footing the bill. Prior to arriving I read the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and was excited that I had been booked into a hotel that had received a wealth of positive reviews. To be rated #7 of 243 hotels is no easy feat. I am very happy to report that the hotel exceeded my expectations which is rare. Upon arrival I was warmly greeted by the front desk staff. My check-In was quick and I was given a room on the 3rd floor facing an alley. Normally I would have preferred a street view room but since I was there for two nights on business I didn't think it would be a big deal. The problem was, I was awoken on both consecutive nights between 10:30-11:30pm by an extremely loud clanging noise coming from below my window in the alley. What I believe it to be was a garbage truck or compactor. The noise was quite loud and it went on for about 15 minutes. The fact that it happened two nights in a row around the same time tells me that this will be of great concern to anyone that gets a room facing the alley. I don't fault the hotel for this problem and really, there is nothing that they are capable of doing about it. The room was quite beautiful and cozy. Some of the amenities include free Internet access, coffee maker, DVD player and playstation for the television. The bed was extremely comfortable and if not for the noise below I would have had a completely restful sleep. Problems? Two that come to mind. The service at their restaurant Daffodils, is pretty bad. The first evening there a group of us met for drinks and though we were the only people in the restaurant it took forever for the confused waiter to serve us. At breakfast, the whole operation seemed to be run by one woman. She was awfully, awfully friendly but everything kind of ran in slow motion. Their buffet breakfast is a bit on the expensive side when you consider there is no hot food to be had. You can get a hot breakfast but it comes outside of the buffet price. Again, these are problems that are probably out of the hotel's fault. The second problem concerned a wake-up call. I scheduled one for early morning and it never came. Thank goodness the alarm clock in the room worked. When I came down to the front desk the clerk asked if I got my call. When I told him no, he was very surprised since he said I was scheduled for it. So, my advice is not to depend on their wake-up call service. The hotel is fairly easy to get to from BART. You take BART to Powell Station, go up escalator and then follow the cable car track up the hill to Bush Street where you make a right and there you are. Be advised that the hotel is a short 7 minute walk, but the last two blocks are an extremely steep uphill climb. With luggage in tow I was panting by the time I walked into the lobby. It's an experience worth doing if you are up to it. The other option is to simply take the cable car. There is a stop right on the corner of Bush street. The only negative side to the cable car is the amount of time it takes to buy a ticket, wait for a car to arrive and then climb the hill. You may be able to walk it faster. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.

The city, and Napa are both really unbelievable! The location of this hotel is fantastic as well, being in the heart of downtown S.F.: close to Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach, the Fisherman's Wharf, etc.! With that being said, there are a few things I would like to tell future travelers to this hotel so they know, before they go: 1) We arrived early in the morning, because of our flight schedule, and while I understand the hotel room was most likely not going to be ready, the reception we received, upon arrival was disappointing. They took my husband's cell phone number and promised to call as soon as our room was available. Hours later, after touring the city on our own, and arriving back to the hotel around 7 PM, and still no phone call from the hotel, the lady at the front desk proceeded to talk over my husband while he tried to find out why a phone call was never made to us. We took that as a sign that they prefer not to answer any questions about their service, but rather talk over us instead. That was just the beginning of the mediocre service of this hotel. 2) Upon entering our room to freshen up, from our morning travels and day excursions in the city, I found the toilet to be in not working order. Luckily, it was a simple matter of lifting the cover of the tank, moving things around the inner workings of the tank, and making the toilet work, that we did not need to call for further hotel assistance-thanks to my husband's knowledge of how toilets function, because if it were just myself in the room, I would have been calling downstairs, requesting help in a heartbeat! 3) While I applaud the efforts that this is a \"green\" hotel, and part of the L.E.E.D hotel chains, they really need to decide what they want you to enjoy, as far as basic amenities are concerned. For example, I would consider myself a fast shower-taker, as well as my husband, and yet, in the morning (or even in the evening for that matter), we would find ourselves with no hot water to take a shower. While, on occasion, he or I (depending on who went in first) would find that turning the handle to the extreme hot side would, on a whim, give the 1st person lukewarm water for the first 15-30 seconds of a 3-minute long shower (that's even a little too quick for either of us, but trust me, you wouldn't want to stay in there any longer than necessary either). I gave up on even hoping for warm water by the 3rd and final morning we were there, and just dealt with taking an ice-cold shower. While some people may enjoy an invigoratingly cold shower, I am not one of those people. 4) On the 2nd night of our stay, we decided to stop into the hotel's restaurant, Daffodil's, and grab a dessert to eat in our room, after enjoying a nice dinner in the city. Much to our further disappointment, my husband's flour-less chocolate cake was not only extremely dry, but tasted as if they had made it a week prior, and were still trying to pass it off as if it were made fresh that morning. The \"homemade\" trio of ice cream (caramel, strawberry and oatmeal cookie-a strange combination, in my opinion, but the caramel flavor was really and truly the only enjoyable and seemingly fresh tasting one of the 3) were scooped out with a tiny melon baller, to which the hotel had the nerve to charge $8 for each lousy dessert. 5) We decided it was unfair to give the hotel restaurant only 1 shot at proving themselves to be a good restaurant, so we went down for breakfast the following morning. When the waiter finally came over to ask if we would like anything to drink, we both ordered coffee, and when they came, the waiter did not bring any milk for the coffee, which seems like a standard in most places, but OK, a small oversight, no big deal. They have a small \"buffet\" for $14/person, or you can order a la carte from their somewhat limited breakfast menu. If you're expecting eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc., included in the buffet-style breakfast, you'll have to rethink your idea of a breakfast buffet. I will admit, they did have eggs on the table, but they were hard-boiled and cold-no scrambled eggs in sight! Also no pancakes or waffles either. They had 3 different types of mini bagels with a selection of plain or chive cream cheese, butter, and 2 different types of jam. They also had 1 type of mini scone and croissant, as well as a choice of white or wheat bread. They had a small selection of pre-sliced fruits that did not look appetizing, at all, and a choice of granola or another dry cereal, accompanied with plain yogurt or milk. There were also no plates anywhere in sight. There were only large and small bowls. I guess the hotel seems to think people enjoy eating bagels in a bowl! We were there to witness more people come in for breakfast, and plates were never placed on the table. But that's just a knit-picky observation of mine. To me, it was more of a continental style breakfast, but I ordered the \"buffet\" anyway, and asked for 2 eggs over medium, at an additional a la carte price of $2. They did manage to bring my eggs on a plate (if you could call it that)-a super thin oval-shaped plate, that barely had room for my 2 eggs, and an orange slice, for decoration, but in a conscious effort to be green and not have to clean big plates in the wash, I can appreciate the gesture. What I can't overlook is the fact that the waiter only came back once to check and see if we needed a coffee refill, which we did, but also I had been needing a glass of ice water, but never had the opportunity to get his attention to request a glass, until he finally showed back up to our table, towards the end of our meal, to ask about the coffee. But, in the end, he did manage to bring both of us a glass of water, and our coffee refills, so I can't say that our needs were NEVER met, they were just not met in a timely manner. 6) I really don't like writing so many negatives without also giving the positives, and truly there were 2 REALLY great things about this hotel: First, the location. Hands down, incredible!! We could walk everywhere and see and do so many different things all within a 30-minute (max) walk! And secondly, the beds. We slept like babies every night! The hotel was in a quiet area, and the beds were extremely comfortable! Well done with the mattress, pillow, and comforter selections. :o) All-in-all, while this may seem like a negative review, I simply want everyone to understand that if you want a fantastic location and a great night's sleep, this is your hotel! While I don't know how much it cost, since it was a birthday present from my husband, for your money, I would consider looking up reviews for other hotels in the area and comparing other peoples thoughts and recommendations about the service and quality of another hotel. I am very big about quality of service and I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth about the quality of the front desk staff, as well as, in the restaurant. There was a very helpful and friendly doorman/concierge man who, unfortunately I never got his name, but he was great and I hope the hotel recognizes what a great employee they have in him. He recommended places to go eat, arranged our airport shuttle for us, and even accompanied me, and helped me learn the tricks-of-the-trade with the ice machine on our floor that was giving me difficulty earlier in the day. That reminds me: another tip for the hotel, if you plan to go to Napa and by white wines and want to chill them in your room, they only have ice machines on levels 3, 6 and 9 (of a 10-floor hotel). So if you don't mind going on the elevator to another floor to get ice, don't worry about what floor you'll be on. :o) Also make sure to ask ahead what kind of room view you'll have. Unfortunately we were on the inner side of the hotel, facing another hotel, with no city view in sight. Again, I don't know the price of the hotel, and I'm sure there are cheaper and more expensive hotels around the same area, but the location was perfect, and even a lack of quality service couldn't ruin our weekend in San Francisco, because being there with my husband made the trip absolutely perfect anyway! :o)", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat loacation, Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "iva_van", "ReviewID": "UR74239173", "Content": "We stayed for two nights.

Only had problem with one person who directed us to walk to the Francis Hotel down the block to flag a taxi, instead of calling one or getting doorman to do so. (said taxis would not respond to calls); we had no problem booking one ourselves for next-day pick-up over the phone. Ended walking all the way to the Orpheum, since it was difficult to flag one on the street. The experience made us realize, that if you have enough time and energy, you pretty much can walk all of SFO. The room was clean and well-appointed. Ample enough for two in twin beds. Bathroom was impecable, with plenty of towels and toiletry. Staff was non-obtrusive. I enjoyed the bed. Thought is was quite comfortable and had a great night sleep. My companion found it too soft for a bad back. Only issue I had related to the locked controls for the AC. Was set at 75F, and I prefer thermostat around 70F. We called and they offered to send a maintenance person, but it was night-time, and we declined. The system was unlocked two days later, during our absence from the room. I would not book with breakfast included. Expensive if you want a hearty breakfast. Not very good quality products, and service is rather poor. \"Honey, Honey\" on Post Street has good prices, variety, and excellent quality. To get there walk down Powell towards Union Square, turn right on Post; restaurant is on left side corner, a few blocks away - no hills to climb. If you are travelling by car, be aware that SFO square footage is high dollar. The hotel had Valet parking for $40 + tax (I assumed it was per day). Saw parking in nearby places at $9/hour.

We decided not to go for one of the usual hotels (Hilton, Fairmont), but with the Orchard Hotel because of its rating on TripAdvisor. The Hilton would have been even cheaper. We stayed two nights, arrived late on the first day and left very early on the last day. The room was nice, but nothing special. It was on a high floor up, and quiet. It took us some time get our door open, since something was wrong with the magnetic cards. It took me three elevator rides down to front desk and back up again to get this fixed together with another guest who had the same problem. Nothing major, but annoying if you just got off a 12 hour flight and all you want to do is sleep. A huge plus is the free DVD library. They have great movies. Breakfast was nothing special again, but we didn't regret it at. Great if you can get it for cheap with your initial booking. We only explored the neighborhood during the day: tram station close by, shopping opportunities and lots of restaurants just around the corner. The walk from the BART station up the hill is troublesome especially with luggage in the rain - we'd take a taxi the next time. Hotel organized us an affordable airport shuttle, which was on time and reliable. Overall, this stay was nice and there is nothing bad or horrible to report about.

First off I must note that this is a three star hotel. We stayed here because of the reviews on Trip Advisor which have never let us down, until now. This hotel ranked as number 3? Check in was simple and easy but the 3:00 pm check in is strictly enforced. We asked for a high floor that was quiet. We were given room 906 which is high but NOT quiet. There were garbage trucks dumping bins three nights at 2:30 am loud and clear along with slamming doors at all hours of the night. We had to ask for a portable fan to run all night to try and cover up the noise. I realize that all hotels have some noise but this is #3 on Trip Advisor and is not expected. It takes very little money to have soft closures installed on all the room doors to stop the SLAM at all hours of the night and this is not dependant on the star rating in any way. Three days there was no hot water for the second person who wanted to shower. We stay in hotels in India that have more hot water than this one. We went to eat at the restaurant at 8:30 pm on Sunday and were told the kitchen was closing at 9:00 pm and besides, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were out of most things anyway\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we finally did try this restaurant the wine glasses were very dirty and even the ones they brought to us after we complained, were dirty. Is this not #3 on Trip Advisor. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gym\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is as mentioned previously by other reviewers, has three machines which are very low cost machines. Our home machines are better quality than the ones on offer. To make up for this the hotel offers guests a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on a nearby fitness centre for only $15 each a day!!! The good points: The staff was very good! All were classy and professional. Temperature control in the room worked well and the room itself was clean and well kept. As well the bed was quite comfortable. We asked quite a few people who work and live in the area what the best food was and were told it is a must to eat at Uncle Vito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pizza. We did and it was average pizza. Location is good if you want to shop. The homeless are all around and are very aggressive. They swear, yell and follow you if you turn them down. The famed Tenderloin is only four blocks away so it is not hard to see why the homeless are plentiful. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stress this point enough. 20-30 people a day will ask you for money and 50% of them will cuss at you if you refuse. In summary this area is not a nice place to visit. We were told by many people not to go too far this way or that due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153danger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in all directions at night. Even in the daytime the beggars are nasty! The wharf is a nice place to go as the beggars are a little fewer there but beware late at night. We closed a blues club around midnight and it was very doggy trying to get to the tram. It actually reminded us of Mexico City at night! Perhaps we are just used to a better class of hotel but there were deficiencies in the Orchard that are not acceptable in any star rating!

The rooms are huge, amenities are just the same as other equivalent hotels I've stayed in, and I suspect most of their eco-friendly qualifications relate to their back-office processes.

The shampoos that they give you now are not quite to par, there now is only 1 soap given (hello, needs for hands and body!). The plush bathrobes are still in the closet - yay!

Also, the wireless Internet connection in any part of the hotel (including the lobby) is either Low or Very Low. This has been consistent over the past few years. Ask for the cable to plug into the wall at your desk if you're going to be using your laptop. Also ask for a high level room or one in the back of the hotel. The hotel is located at Bush and Powell which means you are hearing the cable cars until midnight and stating early in the morning. Overnight parking is $40 - not to be surprised at since this is San Francisco. Union Square is within walking distance - do not underestimate the big hill on the way back (going uphill when returning from Union Square).

I have to say the hilly location didn't bother us at all. Happily recommend it. Other notes about San Fran: If you plan on using the public transport you can buy 1 day ($13) and 3 day ($20) passes. Considering a single journey on the cable car is $5, then this is worthwhile. It is also valid on the metro, buses etc. You can buy these passes from Walgreens which is just round the corner from the hotel. If the weather is nice a bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge is fab. We used Blazing Saddles - not impressed with their bikes so maybe shop around before you choose.

If you stay there and like good sushi, I recommend Maru, which is half a block down Powell Street.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat little boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "turnleftpreferred", "ReviewID": "UR57033406", "Content": "Small lobby area but very welcoming friendly desk staff.

This was our second visit (the first was about a year ago) and we'll definitely be back next year for our annual mother-daughter trip to SF. So the details in no particular order: - The hotel is 20 minute BART ride from the SF airport and then a quick 5 minute cab ride up Powell (and I do mean up...the hill near the hotel is much too steep for pulling on luggage). Don't make the mistake of taking the cable car up to the hotel because the line is too long and the ride is crowded, especially with luggage (but do ride the cable car at least once on your trip...it's fun). - It's a smallish hotel, so check-in was quick and easy. - Space is a premium in most of SF, so they provide two oversized twin (\"three-quarter\") beds in the double rooms instead of two full- or queen-sized beds. We honestly didn't notice much difference because they were VERY comfortable and still quite roomy. - We were given one of the wheelchair accessible rooms again, which had its pros (better view of the city from a larger room in the corner) and one con (awkward hand-held shower with low water pressure). - Unlike our first visit, we had some difficulty setting up the free wi-fi this time around, but a somewhat lengthy and involved call to the help desk got us up and running. - We didn't order room service or eat at the lovely-looking restaurant, but there are decent enough restaurants within walking distance in Chinatown and the Financial District. -The hotel doesn't have a vending machine, but there is a slightly overpriced neighborhood convenience store about a half block away if you crave snacks (the minibar in the room was locked and we didin't request the key). - On our last night, some guest(s) starting smoking somewhere near our room (it's a non-smoking hotel), and the smell came into our room through the vent. I guess other guests also noticed this because when I called to complain, the front desk said they were aware of the problem and that security was working to catch whoever it was. It was definitely a mar to an otherwise nice stay, but the smell dissipated within about an hour and we were able to fall back asleep. - The doormen were super friendly and helpful, giving good restaurant recommendations, getting cabs for us, helping with luggage, etc. - Cabs sometimes confused The Orchard Hotel with The Orchard Garden Hotel, so be sure that you know the address or intersection.

On arrival we were told that some guests had not booked out of their rooms and there was no availability for us, and as a result they had arranged for us to stay one night at the Club Quarters and they would refund us the cost of one night's stay in compensation for the inconvenience. There was not a lot that could be done about the situation although it was fairly annoying as we had chosen the Orchard for its proximity to Union Square and Club Quarters is in the Financial District. Upon checking in to the Club Quarters we were given a tiny room with a queen bed, - apparently CQ does not have rooms with two beds or so they claim. This was certainly the smallest hotel room I have stayed in and the bathroom was similarly minute. The following day around 2.30 pm we duly turned up at the Orchard to check in, to be told that rooms were still being made up. When eventually we got a room, the wireless internet did not work. After spending half an hour talking to the wireless service provider without any solution, I then found that the issue was due to our room being too far from the wireless node for a strong enough signal to be detected by the laptop. Some time later another network was set up which worked. On checking out of the hotel, I enquired as to how the refund for the first night's stay was going to be made as I had booked through a travel web site and pre-paid. I was then told that no refund would be forthcoming as I had booked online and that was that. Needless to say I was less than amused that they had reneged on their word. We also had a maid come barging in to our room despite there being a Do Not Disturb sign hung on the doorknob. She wanted to check the minibar fridge and when I said we had not used anything she then left, grumbling away in her dialect. Putting all those issues aside, I would say that the staff are not overly friendly, the service (what little we saw of it) was average, the room, furnishings, TV and bathroom were dated.

The only negative thing we found was that if taking a shower in the morning we had to leave it running for several minutes to get hot water though it was fine at other times of the day and we got hot water straight away at the sink. Reception, the concierge and housekeeping were all very friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything or when we just passed them going in and out.

With the streetcar located literally 10 seconds away from the hotel entrance you have easy access to the city. I would definitely stay here again.

Breakfast room music was beautiful, however some mornings it was \"covered\" by TV over the bar, turned on by the staff. Free internet was greatly appreciated, although the wireless did not work. Room service was fast, food was OK and reasonably priced. Location is very convenient, but if you walk, it is a bit steep (can't imagine climbing up Powell street carrying luggage). Check out took 10 minutes, and luggage was properly stored for late departure. Mariliza at the reception desk is a sweetheart, great asset to the hotel!!

The hotel has valet parking but we parked at the car park on Stockton street which was a lot cheaper and didn't have any problems. The hotel does do an express breakfast for $5 which includes either toast, bagel or croissant and tea/coffee. However we went to Loris Diner which was just down the road and was great. I would definitly recommend staying at this hotel and would advise anyone to book online as they seemed to have various special offers. The DVD's they have for you to borrow at reception is pretty vast and they had quite a few new releases which was nice. We loved going back to chill at to the hotel after a hectic day sightseeing round San Fran before heading out for dinner.

The housekeeping and the front desk staff is very polite and always greet you with a smile. The toilets are large and the rooms have a well stocked minibar with a coffee maker, iron and ironing board. They have a nice restaurant which I never tried though. The hotel seems perfect for a single business traveller like me, being in the heart of downtown San Francisco and most of the places were walking distance. I did not find any serious flaws with the hotel. Having said these things a few things did disturb me about the hotel. -The wi-fi reception is not at all good in the rooms and you have to request for a USB cable. The hotel staff did not do much to help on this but forwarded me the phone no. of the wi-fi company, Those guys were really helpful but the wi-fi hardly worked and I had to depend on the cable. -I had an extra guest for a night and when I asked the hotel to accomodate him in my room they said they cannot as the rooms were not equipped to do so. They don't mention this on their confirmation and infact mention that they charge $25 for an extra person. But, they did not allow me to have an extra person and I had to arrange for alternate accomodation for my guest. -I never ate the restaurant as I felt it was over-priced and as it was not a 5 star hotel i dont think they should have such high rates. I would have liked a microwave in the room which would have been of a great help as I was there for a week.

I would not stay at another hotel in San Francisco--the value at the Orchard cannot be beat. The rooms are a nice size compared to many boutique hotels in the area, with quite a large bathroom--plenty of counterspace for a lady to spread out her necessities! The down comforter, crisp linens, and fluffy pile of pillows make for a wonderful night's sleep, as does the individually-controlled air conditioning--another item missing from many SF hotels in this range of quality. Lovely robes, nice toiletries, and plenty of room to pack away your things all add up to an incredibly comfortable stay. Free internet adds to the allure, as does the excellent room service provided by the restaurant downstairs. Food is really good and always arrives promptly and at the right temperature--best of all, The O is thoughtful in providing the appropriate condiments and utensils--things you may not have thought about yourself! The daily maid service is unobtrusive and consistent--I have never failed to have exactly what I need or requested provided promptly. And best of all, the service and attitude of the staff are just amazing. They respond with friendly professionalism and never fail to offer a smile along with their excellent service! And all of this at an excellent value in a truly convenient location. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend this hotel to people who want to feel comfortable and welcomed and prefer a quiet, traditional-style hotel to the newer \"hip\" hotels full of sleek, minimalist decor. The Orchard is, admittedly, showing a wee bit of wear, but like the grand dame she is, her put-you-at-ease personality is like your favorite aging aunt--you love her all the more for her little cosmetic flaws. Everything is spotlessly clean and fresh, and all you will find are a few worn spots on the edges of furniture or carpet--certainly nothing that will spoil the experience.

The room was great, we had views out onto Bush street and down to the financial district, a separate living room to the bedroom and a wonderful bathroom with both a good size bath and a large shower cubical. My only criticism of the room is that I was expecting a more modern look to the rooms, although the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was not to my personal opinion of a boutique hotel it was still new, clean and comfortable. We had 2 televisions in the room (one in the bedroom and one the living room) although these were old CRT screens when I would have expected flatscreen technology.

Free wi-fi was also included in the stay, which came in very handy with checking back home and when booking some tickets during our stay.

Going downhill on Bush street the you will pass the entrance to Chinatown within minutes. Chinafood? Check out the Great Eastern restaurant, great food! The hotel needs an update, its a bit boring compared to its twin sister, The Orchard Garden. What was really dissapointing was the not-so-clean bathroom. There was hair on the doorframe and the walls, and the ceiling was quite discusting. When taking a hot shower there will always be small particles of fat from the skin that stick to the vapour. The fat will deposit on the ceiling and create spots. I informed the front desk about the problem but the problem remained when we left the hotel. The lights on both sides of the mirror were also full of dust. I think it was not solved due to lack of cleaning standards. The person responsible for cleaning the bathroom obviously did not understand the nature of the problem and could not choose the appropriate solution. My point is this; when there is a complaint about the cleanliness of a bathroom, the responsible manager should take immediate action and take a look in detail. A dirty bathroom is a no-no in this business. Othervise, I would recommend the hotel.

There were safes and coffee makers in the rooms, along with DVD players and surround sound systems. You could check-out DVDs from a number that were available at the front desk. The wireless internet access was reasonably snappy, though the service provider's access control mechanism was clunky. In addition, the service provider (Wi-Fi Guys) would periodically inject ads into your web surfing, which was more than annoying. The room could be a bit dark at night, but lamps were generally placed where they were needed. For some mysterious reason, one of the lamps was hooked into a switch that also controlled the light directly over the entrance door. That meant leaving a light on where it wasn't needed if I wanted the light turned on elsewhere in the room.

The position of the hotel is good being close to Union Square. We stayed in one of the King suites which had a lounge and separate bedroom. The room was comfortable and clean with plenty of room for us all. We had a few glitches on our arrival which got things off to a less than ideal start but nothing too dramatic. As we had a 2 year old, we requested a cot (or crib or \"play-pen\" as they call them in the States) to be in our room. Unfortunately, on our arrival (after a 12 hour flight) our now asleep baby had no cot. The first that arrived was broken but the 2nd worked fine. Then we couldn't get into the fridge because it had a lock on it! I have never stayed in hotel with a lock on the fridge.. it seemed a little odd. The lock was broken and the fridge could not be opened. This was fixed quickly which was good because my needed to keep her insulin cool. Then when we tried to use the coffee machine in the room, it belched out rotten smelling hot water with chunks of God knows what in it and eventually got a replacement (after staff intially telling us that was normal for those machines!). However, all the above was minor and not that much of a big deal and I only mention it here as all the other hotels we stayed in during our 1 month away had cots ready in the rooms, usable fridges and clean tea/coffee making fascilities. The biggest disappointment about our stay was at breakfast. We paid for a \"breakfast included\" package and for the most part the breakfast itself was ok... nothing startling (again compared to our other hotels) but good enough. We effectively served ourselves with little help from the two fairly sour looking staff on each morning. In fact, the male staff member serving made us feel quite unwelcome and seemed reluctant to be there or help. Now, tipping is not the custom in our country although i do understand it is big in the States and for the most part we follow that custom when in the USA . However, I expect good and pleasant service before forking out extra cash for a tip and if staff are off-hand, rude or make you fell generally unwelcome, then I don't think a tip is deserved. Due to the sour service received, we did not leave a tip on the first two mornings and one that second morning the male staff member gave me a lecture about tipping him. This was a surpirse and extremely rude. Although we had already paid for breakfast for the next two mornings, we did not eat at the hotel as I did not wish to feel pressured to pay extra (i.e. tip) for poor service or risk some form of retribution if we did not tip him from then on. In summary, the hotel was a pretty nice and convenient place to stay (with a few glitches intially but not too big a deal). However, definitely do not pre-pay for breakfast.

I wanted a small hotel with the flavor of old San Francisco, not a generic national chain hotel. I spotted the Orchard on the internet but was unable to book it my first week. I ended up at one of the many older, small hotels that populate the area and the very first night challenged my preconceptions. I got a dinky room that looked into a 6 foot wide alleyway separating my hotel from the next building; the restroom was so small, I had to go outside to turn around; my air conditioner was an open window. I had already booked the following week at the Orchard and decided to pay an inspection visit just in case I needed to revisit the chain hotel option. I was delighted by the large rooms, new furniture, huge bathrooms, and comfy pillow-top beds. Each room is equipped with a DVD system and the front desk maintains a DVD library. The hotel building is new with all the safety features and amenities that includes; the visual elevation, however, is designed to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood. I immediately booked several more weeks and now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m finishing up twenty weeks at the Orchard. The on-site restaurant, Daffodil, is first rate so on-site dining is rewarding if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in the mood to go out. The staff is great: friendly and knowledgeable about the area; attentive to my routine. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pleased with my decision to stay at the Orchard from a comfort, safety, and cultural standpoint. The Orchard has just the flavor to complement that special San Francisco \u00e2\u20ac\u0153je ne sais quoi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd without cramping my need for modern accommodations. Located on Bush Street, the Orchard is two blocks away from Union Square. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located in a city residential area that has both fine and everyday restaurants, stores, salons, an art school, Cathedral, and the like. The Orchard is just steps away from the cable-car line on cross-street Powell. Union Square, just down Powell, is bustling with all the well known shopping, eateries, and hotels competing for your attention. Chinatown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pine Street parallels Bush just one block further away from Union Square, while the main entrance on Grant Street is just two blocks down Bush. The location is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153IDEAL.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Plenty of attractions and amenities are within an easy walk, but the noise and congestion of the commercial area isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in your lap. Transportation to the wharf, Market Street, North Beach, and the rest that San Francisco offers is at your door. Put it this way, after twenty-one weeks, the Orchard remains my hotel-of-choice in San Francisco. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy with my choice and I will be back.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ulsan, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel!!!

Just off Union Square, this boutique property has all of the amenities (and then some) of the larger properties just up the hill (i.e. Fairmont, Mark Hopkins) without the price tag and snooty staff. The lobby is tiny but nice and upon check-in, the staff was phenomenally kind. While the room was a tad small, it's not much smaller than a standard SF room elsewhere and as there were only 2 of us, it's not like we needed a suite! The bed and pillows were wonderful and the beds had DUVETS (which I'm an enormous fan of -- DOWN with those gross bacteria-filled coverlets!). There were spa robes in the closet for each of us (tho, one of them was starting to come apart a little at the belt loop) and the bathroom was extremely spacious and well-appointed with Aveda products and fluffy towels. The hotel provides DVDs for in-room use and has a pretty expansive library of new releases and classics. The staff is so helpful that when my boyfriend and I rolled in at around 1 a.m. in NEED of some late-night food, we were directed immediately to a diner up the street which satisfied our cravings. The location is fantastic and you can walk to everything (Chinatown, shopping, restaurants, bars). North Beach was a minimal $5 cab ride away.

The valet service that was included in my room price I thought would be great, except that the valet was nowhere to be found when I arrived. My car had to be double parked on the street for about 15 minutes while the front desk checked me in - very slow. I finally convinced someone to call the valet to come and park the car and was then told that the hotel was very busy for the evening and the next day and that for the unlimited \"in and out\" service that I paid for I would need to be sure to give them at least 1/2 hour each time.

The car came in less than 10 minutes in most cases. they were very child friendly and got us a crib ($10) right away without even asking after they saw our 4 month old. we came in late after a very long day traveling with kids on a plane from LA and ordered room service. i could have eaten a shoe by that time, but it was EXCELLENT. my wife's spinach side was the best she ever had she said. the room is ample and not too frou frou but clean and good. not cool and sexy like a W like i like but that's so overplayed its nice to go the other direction. their hallways are small so you have nowhere to get lost. the elevator is quick. the visitors are mostly German for some reason. their bar later was great too. lots of small batch scotches and good stuff like that. the location cant be beat. you are literally 1.5 blocks from Macy's Union Square, Levi store, Cheesecake, Barney's and Neimans. Try the Neiman's bar - they rock too. Chinatown is just 2.5 blocks away and starbucks is right there at the entrance of Chinatown. what i dont like is their coffee setup in the room. too cumbersome and no way to not spill water on the counter. the shower has a plastic curtan too which is not great. it wasnt nasty, but they could do a nice tericloth and just wash it more and people would feel like its cleaner. also, it flooded our bath floor on both occasions. they have free dvd rental downstairs which is cool if you like that. all in all, another great find thanks to tripadvisor. btw, i am a big city guy doing reviews here. my buddy says all you tripadvisor reviewers are midwesterners -- not true. real travelers use this site exclusively and i am one of them. my only tip is to book at the HOTEL'S website only.

I really enjoyed my stay until I later saw on my credit card statement that the hotel had overcharged my stay. I contacted the hotel immediately, and an Orchard hotel staff member indicated that I had a mini-bar charge, which was not true. The hotel staff member assured me that they will take care of it and refund the overcharge within 5 business days. As I found out a week and a half after the call, the hotel had not process my refund. I contacted the hotel a second time, and they informed me that nothing has been processed and they will take care of it. I asked the hotel to call me when they processed the refund. The Orchard staff promised that one of their finance members will call me within 48 hours. Surprise, surprise, the hotel did not call me back. However, I gave them a couple of days to see if perhaps they processed my refund but somehow forgot to return my call. Not only did the hotel not return my call, but they did not refund the overcharge. I contacted the hotel for the third time, and the lady told me that she could NOT help me because she was NOT the people that I spoke to earlier. I informed her that I had spoken to two different people and that both gave me the same spiel about 'how they will take care of it' but neither followed through. I told her that ''Why in the world would I want to talk to those individuals again when they couldn't follow through their promises to their customers? Hence, the reason that I want to talk to someone else.' She then told me that she 'will take care of it'. I informed her that I will keep calling the hotel until I get this resolved. Within an hour, the hotel called me back and told me the refund has been processed. Honestly, the Orchard hotel should not have taken nearly four weeks to process my refund. Furthermore, why did the hotel immediately processed my refund ONLY after I stated that I will keep calling the hotel until this situation gets resolved? All the positive things that I had planned to write on Tripadvisor.com about this hotel were trumped by the hotel staff members' lack of credibility and professionalism.

The reviews were right! This hotel is well-located, close to Union Square shopping but on a quieter street part way up to Nob Hill. We didn't notice traffic noise at night. We had several requests -- early check-in, lower floor, facing the street instead of the alley, not close to elevator, and mattress pad. (a previous reveiwer wrote about hard mattresses but with the pad the bed was fine) They were all accommodated easily, and we were able to check in a couple of hours early. We were on the 2nd floor which is where the very little exercise room is but few people use it so it wasn't disturbing. The standard rooms are a generous size. The complimentary breakfast is good, with cut up fruit (including strawberries!) as well as the usual toast, croissants etc. Servers bring juice and coffee so we tipped $5/day. Tomato slices were a nice touch. High-speed internet access is free and they will provide a cable if you forget one. There is also a free DVD library with an excellent selection. Aveda toiletries were really nice. This is a newer hotel, all non-smoking which is great. It's not \"high-end\" or luxurious but perfectly adequate and very good value for money. We booked the AAA rate off the internet and seemed to get a decent rate, as we were there for Fleet Week and many hotels were full. Staff were all helpful and friendly, and the doorman even walked to the corner to get us a cab once. There's also a house car to take people to the airport, $45 flat rate plus tip which is a nice alternative to a regular cab. Because the windows don't open the air can be dry. This was partly negated by the fact that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it got a bit steamy after a shower. As the bathroom was quite large, it wasn't too much of a problem.

Efficient use of space in the common areas, so it doesn't strike you as grand-looking when you enter the hotel. Great location, great location, great location. Near Union Square, very convenient and accessible for shopping, several good restaurants within 5-15 minutes by foot (e.g. Masa's, Farallon, etc). Walgreens (pick up some diapers!) just one block South along Powell Street. There's a Powell St Cable Car stop just 20 paces from the hotel entrance, which could take you to Hyde or to Fisherman's Wharf depending on which Car you take. A cab to the Ferry Building at Embarcadero costs under $10. Friendly counter staff (e.g. Grace), knowledgeable and helpful concierge/valet/doormen (e.g. Cornell, Art).

Location is superb, only 2 blocks from Union Square & 20 yards from the Powell St cable car (although this was nearly always full whilst we were there). Noise for us wasn't an issue at all. Buffet breakfast was included and sufficient, and it was good to eat before heading off for the day. The restaurant & bar weren't open for dinner whilst we were there which was a pity, as it would have been nice to return for a drink after dinner.

There's no need for any of that in the morning as the complimentary breakfast is excellent, with ample choices. My only complaint there is that you don't have the option of bringing your breakfast back to the room. My room was fine. No view, but clean!

Then we returned the rental car to the rental company and relied on public transportation the rest of our trip. (On a side note give yourself extra time to get around on the streetcar and and the F trolley- very crowded). Upon checkout I noticed charges for multiple days of parking. I mentioned to the desk clerk that we only stayed one night. She rolled her eyes and said \"Let me see\" and called over the Doorman. He stated he would have to call the garage. The Desk clerk then said very cocky \"Did you TELL anyone that you weren't brining the car back\" I said I wasn't aware I had to, she then rolled her eyes again laughed at me and said \"well how are we supposed to know you aren't bringing the car back unless you tell the front desk.\" I assumed they checked cars in and out as they are brought in and out. The doorman said it was probably a mistake because it showed our car as currently checked in and it wasn't there. The desk clerk begrudgingly reversed the charge and told me next time to tell the correct people about the car. She said it was not the doormans job to charge us it was the front desk. It was sad to end a nice stay this way. Also, I was never told of any breakfast option that was offered, upon reading other reviews I noticed people mentioning it, so you may have to ask.

We had one regular room with a kind bed, and a suite which had a king bed in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the living room for our children. The location is excellent for tourists in San Francisco. We went to see Golden Gate Bridge and Muir Woods before checking into the hotel so we could drive there. The hotel has valet parking as the only real option ($ 34 per day). Parking is very difficult in San Francisco, so valet is reasonable here. After leaving the car with the valet, we did the rest of the sites by walking or taking the cable cars. This hotel is located very close to Union Square (lots of shopping and restaurants), Westfield Centre (very large high end mall), and China town. These were easy to walk to. There are some hills, but that is part of what you expect to see in San Francisco as a tourist. The cable car stop is at the intersection of Bush and Powell, within a few yards of the hotel, where 2 cable car lines stop. You can get an all day pass for the cable cars (and buses) for $11 per day at Walgreens (located one block from hotel). I recommend this option because otherwise it is $5 per ride. You can take the Mason-Powell cable car north to the end of the line, and then walk a few blocks to pier 33 for Alcatraz tours. You can take the Hyde-Powell cable car north to see the crooked part of Lombard St. It is a lot more fun to take cable cars rather than cabs. We like the Union Square area much better for our hotel instead of Fisherman's wharf area (were we stayed in the past). The hotel gives out a great map of San Francisco (including the transit system) and a \"San Francisco Visitors Guide\", which has great maps of the Downtown/Union Square area (including names and locations of stores and restaurants).

The best thing about The Orchard is it's location. It basically sits in the Nob Hill/Union Square area on the corner of Powell and Bush Streets which is 3-4 blocks from Union Square and 2-3 blocks from the main gate to China Town. The Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde cable cars lines are literally 20 steps from the hotel front door. Both will take you to Union Square and the Powell Street BART station and either to Fishermans Wharf or North Beach depending on which cable car you hop on. But if you aren't into the cable cars or feel like getting some exercise then Union Square is a quick 5 minute walk straight down Powell Street and China Town is also a 5 minute walk straight down Bush Street. If you are renting a car the closest and best place is on O'Farrell Street in the heart of Union Square about 4 blocks from the hotel. There are 4-5 major rental car companies and the mid week rates are relatively cheap. We rented a four door Economy for $28 per day. And here's a little secret........if you have to keep your car overnight but don't want to pay the $30+ for overnight parking at the hotel then you can park for $15 (late night special) in the same garage as where you first picked it up for as long as you arrive after 7pm and leave the garage before 9am. The Orchard is a great value because your room rate includes free continental breakfast every morning, free internet and a free shuttle to the financial district. We stayed there a few weeks ago and averaged approximately $175 per night. Other larger chain hotels in the immediate area were $250+ per night and didn't include breakfast or internet access. The rooms are very nice and in great condition with updated features including comfortable beds, nice furniture and a stocked \"honor\" bar including cold drinks, snacks etc. Our bathroom was larger than average and very nice with a marble floor, high quality toiletries and a very nice sink / vanity.

She had never been to SF and I was returning after 20 years. The location is absolutely the best and must be figured in with every other deciding factor. We had a wonderful time, easily walking from the hotel through Chinatown, North End (Italian) and then finishing up at and immediately turning back from the touristy Wharf. It was interesting, almost disheartening, for her to see that there are \"repeat performances\" at all tourists areas throughout the world (d.j.s, fast painting, same restauraunt chains, same hustle) and that it is important to find the unique aspects (sourdough bread) in each city. SO, back to the hotel. We arrived with a rental car which we eventually returned early . Parking was a total drag. The hotel admonished us to watch out for towing, asking us to remember to fill the meters up until after ticket time, etc. and always segued by encouraging us to use their extremeley expensive valet service. Well, this can be taken both ways I expect and they were just trying to (in my most optimistic mood) keep us from getting towed, but I do live in a major city, know how to read meters and so on. Bottom line is a happy one: you don't really need a car if you are staying in SF! We actually drove to and from Santa Clara, returned the car to the airport, took the BART train back in to town and used BART again to get back to the airport. Further to the hotel, as promised..The bed was remarkably comfortable. We had no view but it did not matter. Daughter liked the Aveda products. Our tub did not drain well (7th floor) and water was nigh calf high after the two of us took back to back and not excessively long showers. Admittedly, I neglected to mention this until our last day, however this issue is rarely encountered at even the most budget oriented hotels. I was not able get online (directed to an 800 number for which I had not the energy to deal) so instead used the very accessibly computer right at the reception desk. Was able to print out boarding passes, quickly check email, etc. We were too tired to use the movies, but it was a nice idea. As to breakfast, and having read the earlier reviews, I really cannot imagine what else on earth one could want unless it is total table service with warm food being served by request. No, there is no Devonshire cream, made to order pancakes, soft boiled eggs on toast crusts. Isn't that the \"not included\" breakfast concept where we get to order a specific breakfast? We were thrilled with the choices: fresh (not sugared!) yogurt, fresh fruit (lots of it ) toast, and so on. There were numerous choices, in our opinion.

The experience from start to finish was excellent. While being priced similarly to other boutique hotels, the Orchard featured so many little touches that just made your stay so much more pleasant. For example: - Large room, with king-size bed, and more pillows than anyone could ever use - Free (wired) internet access (wireless only on first 2 floors, due to range of the signal) - Large TV, with combined DVD/CD/Surround-sound system - with even (surprisingly) a bass speaker, that made watching any of the extensive range of complementary, up-to-date DVDs from the hotel reception a real cinematic experience - A 'calm' book and music CD on the table for those who have trouble sleeping - Amazing 'natural flow' taps in the bathroom, that, cheesy as it may sound, reminded me of a mountain stream! - Walk-in shower - A (quite stylish) laptop for guest use just by reception, with printer, on which I printed my Alcatraz tour tickets, and boarding passes for my onward flight The staff were also very well turned out, professional, and always friendly. The overall experience was such as to make it impossible to leave the hotel feeling anything but positive. The location is also great - two blocks uphill from Union Square, and 20 paces from a Cable Car stop, which goes to Market Street in one direction (major 'real' shopping street / thoroughfare), and Fisherman's Wharf in the other (extremely touristy area). The only two hiccups: the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, while complementary, is pretty limited in size, range and quality; I'd simply ignore it unless you really don't want to go out. The other was the Valet parking charges; the rate was advertised at $34 per 24hrs, which seemed just about reasonable - however, the valet's services are added on-top, as is tax - leading to just under $100 for two nights' parking, and taking the car out once in-between! This was as much as a week's car rental - and there is no other option. Parking in SF *is* expensive, but the price is $10 higher than at the local car parks, so the additional valet charges (I tipped as well) were unexpected. Overall, however, it's a wonderful hotel.

Junior suite (#501) with view of Bush St. was roomy and, although right next to the elevator, was very quiet. Bathroom, big and spotless. King bed and ,surprisingly, pull-out queen sleeper were comfortable. Room was clean and modern. (I like new and big vs. old and small). Front staff couldn't have been better.

Arrived Sat., found a parking place on the street and found the meter is 25 cents for 5 minutes of parking. But after 6 pm, is free until Mon. am. Monday we parked a couple of blocks down Bush at the Sutter/Stockton garage. All in all, an excellent stay except for a minor hassle. Sun. a.m. went to the front desk for additional coffee packets for in room coffee maker and the person at front desk indicated ther was also coffe in the restaurant (run by another entity and not by the hotel). Went in, got two small cups to go, no charge (or I could pay $1.00 each for a large cup). Came back down and had continental breakfast. Mon. again went to the restaurant for coffee (half asleep) and was told by Jose that if I take coffee to go, this will be considered my continental breakfast or I can pay $1.50 per cup if I wanted coffee to go. Explained to him about Sun. He would not budge. Talked to Beth at front desk about this. We went back to talk to Jose and I could see Beth was surprised at his response and she asked when this change took place. He gave some lame excuse and refused her plea .

The small lobby is attractively finished, but there is no room to hang out and people watch. The hotel is located on the southslope of Nob Hill, 2 blocks from Union Square. Easy walking to many restaurants and dozens of shops, and if you don't mind a steep or longer (15 minute walk), in range of Nob Hill, Japantown, SOMA, the Ferry Building and even North Beach. Mass transit is easy: a north-south (Powell-Hyde) and an east-west (California St.) streetcar line are within 2 blocks, as is a bus route. Taxis are hailable within minutes in this part of the city. My wife and I walked or used mass transit most of the time, including after midnight and never felt unsafe, although the Union Square area is thick with pandhandlers, especially during the day. (On nice weekend days, the streetcars can be insanely crowded with tourists and may necessitate finding other transportation.) Our room was on the 8th floor with a view of a couple of blocks of the city. The room was medium-size, which for San Francisco is supposedly larger-than-average. While there were a couple of small stains on the carpet, in general the room was in good condition and decorated better than a Holiday Inn but not as nice as a Hilton perhaps. We had a reading chair in one corner and a desk in another, with complimentary ethernet broadband which was fairly fast. (There is wifi in the hotel, but it only works on the 2nd floor.) An armoire held a 27\" TV with DVD and CD player. The hotel has a large DVD library that you can use for free. The bed was a king, which seemed to be like a futon on top of a platform. It was overly firm: my wife didn't mind it as much as I did, but both of us slept well anyway. The minibar fridge had room to put a few of our own perishables in it, and the closet was stocked with robes, slippers and a safe. Fairly large bathroom nicely finished in polished tile with fantastic water pressure. Housecleaning was thorough and prompt everyday. The hotel works with a babysitting company (licensed and bonded) if you need to escape for an evening while they watch the kids in the room. Expensive-but-standard rate around town for hotel sitters: $100 for 4-hour minimum. Complimentary \"European\" breakfast consisted of a light continental breakfast with slices of ham and swiss as well. Barely sustainable for us and very average quality.

Great comfy robes with linings and slippers were very much appreciated. It was also well lit, which is a complaint of mine. More and more hotels seem to leave you in the dark with 25 watt bulbs.

Check-in was fast and easy and the doorman was really friendly and helpful. Our room was nice looking. Since the hotel is only a couple of years old, its fresh and clean. The room did not have a microwave, but it did have a mini refrigerator. The refrigerator was part of the mini bar, so you had to get a key from the front desk to use it. That was a pain. The room had a nice large TV with a DVD player. The sound system was decent. There was a speaker built into the ceiling right above the bed, and there was also a subwoofer. I thought that was a nice touch, even though we didn't watch much TV. The bathroom was OK. There was no tub, just a huge shower stall. I didn't like the shower stall that much because it didn't have a shelf to put my shampoo and soap on. The Aveda cosmetics didn't really excite me at all. I don't understand why other reviewers are going nuts over these average (at best) cosmetics. There was nothing wrong with them, but I just don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The breakfast sucked. Why did the breakfast suck? Let me count the ways. Primarily, lack of selection. They had some fruit and a few pieces of bread, and boiled eggs. They had two very plain and boring cereals. They made a big to-do over it, and tried to act all stuffy over it. Instead of just letting people come in and sit down, they had one of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please Wait to be Seated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs. The worst part is that there was no one there to seat anyone! We wound up just walking in and sitting down after a nice customer told us we should. For some reason, they were using white linen tablecloths. There were no disposable cups or plates, which meant we could not take food to our room, or take a cup of coffee to go on the way out in the morning. Of course none of that mattered since there was nothing worth taking. The breakfast scared us away from ever ordering anything from room service. I know hotel continental breakfasts are just supposed to be a light meal to get your day started, but I also know that the breakfasts I have had at chains like Hampton Inn were a thousand times better than this garbage. All in all, I would say The Orchard Hotel is really overrated on TripAdvisor. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really agree with the reviews. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the people who wrote them get out too often. The place was perfectly acceptable, but not amazing by any stretch of the imagination.

We ate breakfast at the hotel, which was reasonably good, and lunch and dinner out on the town. One early evening the room next to us was playing music extremely loudly, and we complained to the front desk.

The same can be said for the room. The room and bathroom weren't expansive but were bright and pleasant. Furniture included several chairs as well as a writing desk/desk lamp. The dining room was also attractive. DVDs could be obtained, at no extra charge, from the front desk. The doorman was expecially helpful. Good location within easy walk from Union Square and fine restaurants.

After our long cross-country flight, we were greeted promptly by a very friendly doorman/bellhop named Juan. Juan unloaded our bags and and waited for us to check-in and then proceeded to help us to our room. The room was gorgeous! About the bed: My husband commented that the bed in our room was almost more comfortable than the one at home!! We got a king-size bed in our room, and the linens were REALLY nice (not sure what the thread count was, but it was pristine). We each had two full-sized goosedown feather pillows to ourselves, which was a treat considering we usually get three at a hotel where we reserve a king-size bed and have to call down to ask for another. Instead of the usual bedspread (which, frankly, give me the creeps in hotel rooms and is the first thing to go on the floor), ours had an impeccably plush (and clean) down comforter. The bathroom was large, with a stand-up shower and the best part...Aveda products! Aveda soap, moisturizing lotion, shampoo and conditioner...this is good stuff! The Orchard offers valet parking for $34 a day with in-and-out privileges; it proved to be worthwhile. Parking in SF is a pain in the behind, and it was handy to be able to call down to the front desk and have your car waiting for you in 15-20 minutes. A complimentary European continental breakfast was included with our stay. The items included delicious pumpkin and other sweet tasting breads, yummy croissants, fruits, juices, teas and coffee. During our first morning there, we had the great pleasure of meeting the owner of the hotel, Mrs. Huong. She was really sweet, and you could tell she takes great pride in how her hotel is run and, more importantly, how her guests are treated. This type of customer service is a rarity these days.

This was my first trip to SF, but with any luck, it won't be my last! What a wonderful town! The weather was fantastic--I listened to the various postings and brought a light jacket and NO SHORTS--it was perfect. Temperatures ranged from 68-72 during the day, and once the AM fog was gone, the sun shone brightly all week. Evenings were cooler, I think it may have dipped to the upper 50's one night. Several establishments chose to forego the air conditioning in favor of open windows to take advantage of the breezes. The Orchard is well situated between Union Square, Chinatown, and Nob Hill. The staff couldn't be more helpful. The room was spacious and clean. Following the advice of previous posts, we requested a room in the front, to avoid the alley and trash pickup. Some people had said that, being in the front, they were bothered by the cable cars--they stop about a half block away, we hardly heard them at all. The daily \"European-style\" continental breakfast saved us from having to run around in the morning to find a place to eat----fresh fruits, cold cereal, coffee, tea, juices, and a lovely assortment of European breads and mini scones was an adequate, if not extravagant, start to each day. We booked our Alcatraz tour in advance, again following the posting advice that trips sell out, which, in fact, was good advice, as they had. Took a tour of Muir Woods and Sausilito--loved the woods, didn't get much time in Sauilito, so we took the ferry over again later in the week. Also took a tour with SF Tours of the wine country--a combination of Napa and Sonoma wineries. Next time, I would rent a car and spend a couple of days--it was a nice introduction, but I definately would have liked to do some more exploring. For a fun evening, don't miss \"Beach Blanket Babylon\". Have dinner before hand at Trattoria Cantadina, just a block away. We also had a great dinner at Julius' Castle--the food and the views were both top notch. Plan to be there for sunset. We also took a dinner cruise on the Hornblower--pricey, but good food, spectacular views, and live music. An aside about the cable cars---don't look to them as a reliable means of transporation--take them instead for the novelty of it, when you aren't in a hurry to get to where you are going. Unless you wait in line at either end point of the route (which can be up to an hour wait) your chances of getting on along the way are slim to none, as the crowded cars will not stop to pick up more passengers, and routinely pass by the stops with would-be passengers. Buses run frequently and are easy to navigate. As an \"easterner\" I found San Francisco to be a city of friendly, happy people. No trace of the harried, hurried pace found across the country.

The room was quiet and clean, the bed was comfy. If anything, this hotel is standard. If the prices came down, it might be really good. BUT, it will never be great. Oh, and the staff at the front desk were not friendly either, in fact upon check-out I gave the young lady the wrong room number and she rolled her eyes at me, then looked at her fellow employee like \"Can you believe this?\". Great send off, huh? I would recommend the Prescott, Monaco, Pan Pacific, or any other well known boutique closer to Union Square.

THE GOOD The Orchard is still a fairly new hotel, VERY clean and well-kept with tasteful, serene decor, large room & bath, and a mostly helpful (sometimes aloof??) staff. Door persons get honorable mention here for being especially efficient. But you get free use of a laptop in the lobby (good for printing boarding passes or checking e-mail although there is a small per-page fee for printing), free newspaper, large TV with surround sound, and free DVD checkout (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use but is a good option for a rainy day). Room also comes equipped with a refrigerator and a good-sized closet. There are only a handful of rooms on each floor and the twice/day maid service is excellent and discreet--we never saw them come and go. THE NOT-SO-GOOD I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not-so-good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here because nothing at the Orchard was really \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd First off, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the continental breakfast was anything special. We stayed in four different places along the California coast on our trip--all with free continental breakfast--and of the four, I thought the Orchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering here was the most lacking in variety. And the atmosphere in the breakfast room was a little formal and stiff; my partner and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle \"formal\" so well first thing in the morning! In fact, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but wonder if the entire hotel might be perhaps a little TOO quiet (dead??) for those younger folk who may be seeking something a bit more hip on their visit to this bustling city. The hotel also is a rather grueling walk up a steep hill if you're heading from the Bart and mini metro stations; I would not recommend hauling armloads of luggage from those stations to the Orchard. In fact, I might go so far as to recommend something a bit closer to Market Street if you anticipate using the trains much at all while in town. And although the surround sound in the rooms is nice, this also encourages your neighbors to test these systems out--which our neighbor seemed to want to do at 7 a.m. every morning. There was a little too much noise emanating from the hallways at times, mostly from heavy room doors that were almost impossible to shut without slamming them. And finally, I found the bed to be a little too firm to my liking, and what's with not having a sheet between your body and the comforter? Overall, though, I would recommend the Orchard. Having a large, clean room in and of itself makes the stay worth it. I think it's a good, solid choice that would be perfect for any first-time visitor to San Francisco--just don't expect anything too risque here.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA gem found right in the heart of San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3617504", "Content": "The Orchard Hotel is a delightful hotel located in the heart of San Francisco.

We were put in Room #601, a lovely suite with great bay window views of Bush & Powell Streets and all the way down to Kearny Street. You could even see the Grant Street gate leading into Chinatown. It was on the sixth floor right next to the elevator. We were concerned by this for all of about one minute, as we discovered immediately that you couldn't hear a THING outside the room once the door was closed - not even the icemaker next door! Street noise was barely audible as well. If the wonderful sound of clanging bells of cable cars aggravates you, I don't suggest staying elsewhere - I suggest not staying in San Francisco at all! It's an endearing feature of this great city! The room was absolutely spotless. Floors, carpeting, furniture and walls were all spic and span. The bathroom was scrubbed clean and everything smelled very fresh. It had both a tub and a large shower and was well-stocked with big fluffy towels and Aveda bath products, which I really enjoyed using up. The furniture was all lovely and in great shape and the bed super comfortable. I do recommend watching your shins on the corners of the bed, as has been noted here before - since the beds are on a platform there are sharp corners at shin-height just waiting to make contact with your legs if you aren't careful. The duvet was soooo thick and comfortable, and there were extra pillows in the closet along with two great big cozy robes. The minibar and snack drawer were packed with a great assortment of drinks and snacks. The televisions in both rooms were large Sonys with great sound. We honestly could not find ONE thing to speak critically of, and as often as we travel we usually do find something not to our liking wherever we go - but The Orchard successfully stumped us and left us both feeling very pampered and happy during our far-too-short stay. The entire staff was polite and friendly and James had great recommendations for places to dine out. Cornell brought our car around within a few minutes upon check-out on Sunday afternoon and even offered to pack the trunk for us. My one regret is not remembering the name of the front desk clerk who checked us in on Saturday - she was polite and efficient all at once and I feel bad I cannot name her by name here. We both enjoyed The Orchard Hotel so much that we are already looking for excuses to stay over in early March when friends from London come to visit. They had a reservation at another Union Square hotel but will be canceling it in favor of staying at the Orchard now, thanks to the wonderful service we received from this first-class establishment. The Orchard Hotel is a world-class hotel disguised as a smaller boutique property. Take my word as well as the hundreds of other satisfied guests here. Book your stay here and you won't regret it.

The room was nicely decorated and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. One quibble about hotels in general --- use fitted sheets! I HATE it when the bottom sheets slips off, exposing you to the bare mattress. Ugh. This happens at the Westin too. Internet connectivity/DSL was free. The hotel also had complimentary DVDs -- from suspense to comedy, kids' fare to drama -- and very current titles. The suite also came with a CD player -- you have to bring your own music -- and two TVs. The mini bar was amply stocked as was a drawer filled with necessities you could buy. We paid $259 USD for the suite and it's well worth every penny when you're travelling with a child. The average room cost, I believe, is about $159 USD. In terms of location, it was perfect. The hotel was on the corner of Bush and Powell, minutes from Union Square, Chinatown and right on the cable car line. Breakfast was included -- European style. The concierges and the front desk staff were wonderful and went out of their way to help us out. This is definitely our home away from home in San Francisco. We loved it! One last thing -- we found a great little Italian restaurant on lower Columbus Avenue (15 Columbus) called La Gondola. The phone number is ---------. The food was delicious. Also, if you're in the mood for some quick Mexican, there's a little hole in the wall restaurant -- only four tables -- just up the street from the Orchard on the same side of Bush. The food was fab.

The bad news is that the Orchard is not a Hyatt. Let me point out that I enjoyed my stay at the Orchard (12/4/04-12/6/04) and plan to stay there again. But I will do so fully aware of the hotel's quirks. The hotel has the intimate feel of a boutique hotel without the tiny claustrophobic European-style rooms so commonly found in such hotels. And I enjoyed the many features one would not likely find at a deluxe chain such as a Hyatt or an Intercontinental. For example, the staff was exceptionally friendly (though not particularly professional, see below), and the continental breakfast was a bonus (with one caveat). I also enjoyed the large TV, full array of cable channels, and full in-room stereo (including subwoofer) that one would not likely find at a large chain. But we also had a few minor negative experiences that I would not expect at a deluxe chain. On checking in my wife and I were given a room with two small full sized beds instead of the king bed I reserved and paid for last August. The first desk clerk indicated that it was all she had even though the hotel was not full. Only upon moving up the food chain and discussing the situation with a more senior clerk/manager was an appropriate room found, albeit one next to the elevator and absent a bathtub (shower only). While the bed was comfortable, the two tiny pillows were inadequate and the sharp bed frame corners mentioned by other reviewers were found repeatedly by my wife. I was most disturbed by the lack of adequate soundproofing in the windows. From our room at the back of the hotel every early-morning-dumpster-emptying in the alley we faced reverberated thoughout the room. There was no need for this as proper windows would have alleviated the problem. Further regarding the service, on our second morning the restaurant server attempted to seat us at the first table just inside the doorway. We were reluctantly allowed to sit at a table farther back in the less than half-full room. This annoyance may be the reason our server never returned with the only thing we ordered from her (juice). And the one cup of coffee we were served at seating must have been our entire ration as well. Curiously, the only time our server did return was with a check for $0.00 with a line for a tip on it. Finally, on our second night most of the towels disappeared from our bathroom. Even though we had hung up our towels for reuse (California water shortage), all but two of our towels were taken and not replaced. Upon questioning the desk clerk on checkout we were told that there was a towel shortage that day. Very strange. The bottom line is that I liked The Orchard and I'll stay there again. On balance I liked it better that the larger SF hotels I've tried.

For me, the hotel is in a perfect location. Right next to the Powell/Market cable line which brings you to Fisherman's Wharf (the only reason to take it down there really is to go to Alcatraz). But, Market Street is well within walking distance (just 5 blocks away) and from there you can catch a bus or subway to anywhere in the city. So, location is excellent. As far as the homeless than some mention, yes, you will see a few from time to time, however, I was never once approached by any of them. Listen, this is San Francisco, and, sadly, homelessness is part of the scene no matter where you go in the City. If you go into Haight/Ashbury you'll really see what homelessness is all about - and I loved the Haight/Ashbury area. They are people like everyone else. They don't bother you. Enough about that. Union Square is literally just two blocks away. The Sunday morning I was there they had an art festival/exhibit. It was great. Lots of local artists. There are also a vast variety of restaurants/bars in very close proximity to The Orchard. OK. The hotel itself was great. Very courteous front desk staff and doormen. I had a room on the 8th floor overlooking the corner of Powell and Bush Streets. What more could you ask for? I could watch the cable cars run through the intersection every few minutes. Ask for a higher floor on Bush Street and you won't be disappointed (no street-level noise and great views). I thought the bed was very comfortable, but you know, everybody has their own opinion on what a comfortable bed is based on firmness. I will warn you, however, be prepared to ask for at least 2 additional pillows. They provide 4 pillows (for a king size) and they are tiny and flat. That is really my biggest complaint, but not really a complaint since they promptly provided me with the additional pillows, which ended up being enough for me to sleep comfortably. An additional note about the bed. The matresses lie upon a wood frame. Because of the configuration of the room, I banged my shin on the corner of the wood frame (nearest the desk) at least 5 times. (I wouldn't have been a good subject for Pavlov - LOL). My right shin was black and blue, but I finally started being careful on the second day and didn't do anymore damage! The room was very clean. The bathroom in perfect working order and very clean. And free high speed internet access (just ask the front desk for an ethernet cable if you don't bring one with you... they are free of charge as long as you return them when you leave)... what more could you ask for? This was my first trip to SF in 20 years. I will be going back in a couple of months and I will be staying at The Orchard again. If you are looking for turn-down service, kiss-your-*** service, mints on your pillow and stuff like that go to the Ritz.

What's the big deal? Yes, the rooms were decent, but no better than many other hotels I've seen. In fact, the first room they put me in was on the 3rd floor with a wonderful view of a building wall across the street and dumpsters on the street. (Of course, in SF it's hard to tell whether you're looking at garbage bins or just the normal street trash; this is one of the dirtiest cities this side of New Orleans.) Getting back to the hotel itself, I arrived around 7:00 pm -- not particularly late -- and was greeted by the doorman. Checked in and asked about a restaurant recommendation, and was told I could call the \"concierge\" when I got to my room. I did, but all buttons on the phone lead to the front desk, no matter which department you think you're calling. The front desk person said the \"concierge\" was on a break and would call me back in 5 minutes. I did get a call back in 5 minutes, but the \"concierge\" sounded suspiciously like the doorman who had carried my bag into the hotel. When I asked for a recommendation of a Thai restaurant, he said \"Oh, you want Asian food?\" No, Thai food. He couldn't think of a Thai restaurant in the area. So I gave him the list I'd printed out from the Internet. He wasn't familiar with any of them. I ended up finding a nice Thai place just three blocks away that this \"concierge/doorman\" apparently had never noticed. As for cleanliness, I used the tag to indicate that I wanted them to change the bed linens, but it was clear that they had not done so when I returned. In fact, when I checked the bathroom, they hadn't cleaned the toilet, either. So I can't give the maid service high marks, either. Decent hotel, quiet, good location, but I certainly did not feel pampered or feel that they had their act together on guest services. I'd like a concierge who is more familiar with the restaurants in the area than I am, and a maid service that actually cleans my room thoroughly.

The Hotel is extremely well kept; this may have to do with the fact that the owner keeps a close eye on the place at all times. Yes! the elderly Chinese lady you see every morning in the restaurant is indeed the owner of the place. I forgot her name but you will not miss her, she is always there. I am only sorry that I found out about her on our last day there, I would have loved to compliment her in person. The rooms are immaculately clean and nicely decorated. Bathroom, although not huge, was bigger than some hotel rooms I have stayed in in NYC. Bed was very comfortable also. Breakfast is included in the price and though not hearty it is fine for an early morning start. Who needs a huge breakfast when you have so much to do and see anyway? All in all great EXPERIENCE !! My only regret is that I did not get as good a deal price wise as others who have written; the average seems to be $150.00; we paid $180.00 which I still find reasonable for the accomodations though.

But hey, for free, it was definitely worth it :) I also thought it was nice to have DVD players in all the rooms and the ability to borrow DVDs for free from the front desk. The walk from the Powell Bart station was a bit of an uphill climb (you have to walk about 6 blocks, the last two blocks being a bit steep (that is the only reason I do not give this hotel a 5/5, since access to the BART was necessary for this trip.

Workers were banging pots and pans 24 hours a day in front of 17 hotels but not at the Orchard! Even the best of hotels were striking. Although we did feel bad for the strikers we were happy to find out that the Orchard is not Union! We had peace and quiet in the night and happy employees there. It is such a wonderful location- and in the center of everthing but quiet. Can't beat the price at 149.00 a night with a great breakfast included and wonderful service! Beautiful clean room and big bathroom. King bed was hard though- I'm used to soft. Free internet access in your room. One suggestion though- we rented a car and never used it- parking down at pier 9 is only $14.00 a day- we paid 30.00/day plus tips so if you want to save its worth it.

We chose to try Orchard because of the good reviews we've read and affordable room rate. Overall, we had a good stay. To start out, the hotel has pre-assigned our room and left a red wine bottle and 4-piece box of chocolate on the top of the bar counter which was a thougthful touch. Though it didn't feel personalized like some top hotels with your names in a card signed and welcomed by the manager, which was all right. Didn't experience the turn-down service as listed in the inclusives. Pros: Like the other previous tripadvisor reviewers have mentioned: Sometimes you could get very affordable rates, good location in walking distance minutes to the foot of Chinatown and Union Square and other downtown areas, but the location is less noisy than those areas. The famed Masa's restaurant is across the street. Many inclusives like free internet access, DVD player with free DVD rental at the front desk. It really felt like home because we found out the in-room Sony TV is similar to ours at home and used the same remote control; lots of TV channels including free HBO. The room & bathroom are of medium comfortable sizes, not small like other city hotels. The hotel claims all rooms are of the same sizes. The booking agent was friendly and helpful, so were the front desk staffs and bellmen. And the mattress was one of the most comfortable ones we've ever experienced in hotel beds. It sit on a solid wood plateform bed frame. We had a good rest. Cons: We used tripadvisor hoping to find a good rate and it was all sold out and also checked the hotel's own website which listed very desirable valuable packages. But I couldn't book on line so I called the hotel directly only to be told that those packages weren't available because it was a conference week and few rooms were left -- Demand and supply. I'd recommend the hotel to get the Specials page off if that's the case. Thin door: You could hear the noises from the hallway. Thin-walled restrooms: You could hear next door's turning on/off the facet. Parking fee is $30 plus tax that runs up to $34.00.

We booked through the Orchard's website and paid $149.00 per night (AAA rate) for a king deluxe room and this included valet parking for two nights & free breakfast. I requested a high floor as far from the street as possible with a street view, in case of noise. We received a floor on the 9th floor (there are only 10 floors) with street view and it was nice and quiet. Our car was always brought around within 20 minutes of our calling down for it. The room was clean, large and nicely furnished. The two feather pillows provided were awful and far too small for the king bed so after the first night, I called housekeeping for better pillows and 5 minutes later I was brought three larger (much better) pillows and we slept so much better that night. The surround sound system was sort of a waste since all the speakers were crowded on a shelf together above the TV. The bathroom was large by S.F. standards and the quartz(?) countertops & marble tile inlay in the ceramic tile floor was a nice touch. The blowdryer was fairly worthless to me, however, so consider bringing your own if you want to dry your hair in less than an hour's time.

I will definitely stay here whenever I visit San Francisco again. I found the best rates for this hotel on its own website ($129 per night including continental breakfast). The rooms do not look quite like the photos on the website (which seem more \"atmospheric\" than the actual thing). The doormen were really friendly and helpful though, as has also been mentioned in a number of the reviews. The free DVD library was also great. Although we were in full tourist mode - trying to see everything we could in the 4 days we stayed - it was nice to come back to the room and put on a DVD and watch it at our leisure over a couple of days. Aveda products in the bathroom were a very nice touch. In terms of location, this is excellent. Just near Union Square with all the shops and the cable car stop is literally on the hotel's doorstep. You can easily walk the distance from Powell Street although the last block is quite steep. A couple of warnings, both relating to food. I really enjoyed the breakfast here. It was continental - cereals, fruit, hard boiled eggs, cold cut meats, cute little mini-muffins and bagels and the like - so don't expect the frieds eggs and bacon. I was there for four nights and the breakfasts, although good, did start to get boring as they were exactly the same every morning. I actually heard one guest ask if the breakfast ever changed. The hotel waiter said it did relatively often, at which time the guest retorted that he had stayed there 5 nights so far and not a single thing had changed! A small blemish though. The other thing has nothing to do with this hotel, but more to do with San Francisco generally. In London, I am used to being able to get get dinner whenever I want it. On a couple of occasions, we tried to go out for dinner after 9pm only to have pretty much every good restaurant be closed. It was admittedly during the week, but I was shocked that I could not dine at that time of night. At many of the top restaurants in London, a 10pm sitting is not at all unusual. Thankfully, if you are caught in a similar situation, there is a little Italian pizza/pasta place on the opposite corner to the hotel, that did seem to serve food until after 11pm.

Very conveniently located near Union Square. We had our car parked on arrival and relied on taxis to get around town. So much more relaxing in the city when you don't have to drive to an unfamiliar address and fight traffic and the consistently unavailable parking. The front door attendant was extremely helpful in getting us a taxi in a very busy area on a very busy night. The rooms are stocked with tons of goodies in the honor bar and at what I thought were reasonable prices. We did enjoy our half bottle of quaffable Champagne for only $20. The only part that left me a little disappointed was the free breakfast. They told us that a free breakfast was included with the room, but it was no big deal, it was just a continental breakfast. When they left out the part about it being continental, I had grand visions of choice omelets and French toast smothered in powder sugar and real maple syrup. No such luck. Oh well. Over all I thought that the accommodations were nice and reasonably priced. The rooms were adequately sized with a huge bathroom. It would be nice to have a spa tub for this price, but the water was hot, the pressure was good and the soaps smelled great, so the shower was enough.

First off the location is GREAT! Close to Chinatown, and Union Square, if you want, take a short 10-15 minute cable car ride, which stops right outside the hotel, to North Beach, the Wharf or many of the other neighborhoods in the area. A cab ride to the Wharf runs about $10 with tip, so if it's cold or your in a hurry to get somewhere, hop in a cab and your on your way. The property is close walking distance to Chinatown, Macy's, Neimans, and all the great shopping in Union Square. My wife having forgotten an item found it very fortuante to have such great shops available to complete her outfit for the night, we hustled down to Macy's got what she needed, giggled all the way back up the hill and rewarded ourselves with a Margarita on the walk back to the hotel. Though the neighborhood at first glance seems crusty, it is all part of the quiet and charming part of San Francisco, you become just part of the neighborhood. The hotel is fine, but nothing to shout about, it's all about charm, quick elevators, easy access to the many neighborhoods, the helpful staff, comfortable rooms, simple breakfast, Again, location is what we were looking for, when you're trying to cram as much as you can into 2 1/2 days this is a great choice.

The cable car stops at the corner. BART is just down the street. The exterior is pleasant enough. The lobby is small but it does have a great sculpture in it. The rooms.. well, let's just say they are great for a 3 star hotel. They do not remotely compare to a 5 star hotel. I had a small suite. Small. You open the door and there's a small entryway. Yellow and white striped wallpaper. A rather stained neutral patterned carpet. The living area of my suite was tiny. The furniture was nice but a tad worn for a relatively new hotel. The large TV and DVD/CD player with surround sound were nice touches. There was also a wet bar with the mini bar built in. But did I mention the area was small? The bedroom was larger than the living area but there were a few annoying things. Only a couple of pillows on a not-very-comfortable bed. A nightstand with a lamp on one side. A side table with no lamp on the other. No waste basket. Again, the DVD/CD player was a nice touch. Bathroom. Large.. big bathtub.. separate shower.. lots of space. But I'm picky and the grout was showing a little too much mildew for my taste. I also thought to myselt.. too much wasted space in the bathroom. On the other hand, the Aveda products were great. Overall.. the entire suite was maybe 500 feet? And yes, I could hear the cable cars. Now I give the staff a lot of credit. Everyone was friendly.. helpful.. chatty. When I asked for a banana at breakfast, someone from the kitchen staff went and found me one. Speaking of the breakfast.. coffee awful.. juice great.

We (family of 4 incl. 2 teens) checked into the Orchard around 9PM a coupel of days before Labor Day weekend. It's very conveniently located a block and a half up the hill from Union Square. We had booked our room on the internet and received a email reply confirmation that, at the rate we requested, our family would be accommodated in a standard room. When we checked in, the Orchard's print-out of our reservation only showed two adults for the room, which as it turned out is all a standard room can accommodate. We had no choice but to upgrade to a full one bedroom suite which was all that was left that could accommodate 4 persons. Needless to say, we didn't really budget for another $60 per night for the larger room. That was the bad part. I'm not sure where the fault originated from. Best to confirm internet bookings with a follow up call direct with the hotel. That having been said, the one bedroom suite was marvelous and huge with everything very well appointed (the Orchard gave us a very reasonable break on the rack rate they would normally charge). As I am an architect, and a pretty discerning one at that, I would say the appointments, interior design, materials, furnishings and overall quality are all very well done and that's something I very rarely say. It's not Four Seasons level, but it's very close at less than half the price. This quality is not just limited to the rooms, but includes the Lobby, elevator cab and Dining Room as well. The front desk staff are very friendly and are well groomed. The Dining Room, where we only had the complimentary breakfasts (afterall you're in San Francisco!) is very comfortable and spacious. The food at breakfast, while not outstanding in terms of the menu and degree of preparation required to put it on, was of good quality, fresh and with enough variety to keep anybody happy (although more varieties of fresh fruit for me would have been the icing on the cake). If you rent a car, parking is a killer at $30 per night, but then you're in S. F. which is not car friendly in the downtown area. Assuming our initial reservation problems were not the fault of the hotel, the Orchard rates 5 out of 5 for value, presentation and quality.

It is central to all the public transportation. We took the BART from SFO Int'l right to Market and then walked up to Bush. Be aware that the walk up from Market is not for the faint of heart. It is a substantial incline if you are out of shape :-) We crammed in as much sight seeing as possible and the Orchard's location made it easy to get to all of the major attractions and then some. The DVD library was a very pleasant perk. The collection is quite good and we never had a problem borrowing a movie. The continental breakfast was also convenient, especially if you're looking for a quick bite to eat before you hit the road. For a quick change and a full breakfast, try Lori's on Powell (2 locations). I wouldn't recommend Roxanne's (on the corner of Bush and Powell) ... it's overpriced and smells funny.
