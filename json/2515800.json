The first floor is for pets only. If you want a restful time, you may want to ask for a room that does not face the pool. It can get a bit noisy depending. Pool area is very nice and clean, spa is roomy and well maintained. Be aware that between Aug 3-Aug 13 this hotel is upgrading all the rooms to have flat screen t.v's, so maintenance workers may knock on the door or need to get in to do the work. Pet peeve is that hotels don't post the dates of these projects on their websites so guests will know ahead of time. It will be nice when they get all the flat screens in, but it may be a bit of a hassle if you don't want to be interrupted (they say it will take 30-40 min. per room to do the t.v. installation). I agree with the other poster about the closet door type bathroom door - never seen that before, bit of a nuisance. No big deal, but would prefer a standard door. Bathroom was well maintained, clean. Rooms on the other side facing the freeway may pick up some noise, depending on room location. In later evening hours, traffic noise dies out so it may or may not be an issue for you. Complimentary breakfast was the standard things(available 6am to 9 am), consisted of waffle maker, cornflakes, some pre-packaged muffins (Otis Spunkmeyer, banana nut and chocolate, okay stuff for this type of place), the dining area is sunny and pleasant. When I was there mid-week, not many people there, so difficult to know how quiet or noisy might be over a weekend. Located in a new business park area with a hospital nearby, feels safe and is away from the Strip. A computer down in the lobby area was not working, so wasn't sure if they were upgrading to provide it or it had gone off.- the had a sign tacked to it. But if/when it works, will be another convenient area of the hotel to check a quick email if you dont have your computer with you. Rooms have free wifi (didn't use it so can't say whether it was fast, slow, etc.) A/C was fairly quiet and put out a ton of cold air on a very very hot day (106). Beds fairly comfy. Complimentary newspaper for guests. Overall if you are looking for a pet friendly hotel that is also in a quiet, safe and clean area of L.Vegas, this may be a good choice. The pet room was clean, a few spots on the rug but nothing that you might not find anywhere else. Again, the hotel wasn't very busy that night, so not sure how noisy the first floor might be with barking, etc. but most pet owners these days are fairly responsible if they are traveling with their pet, so hopefully it would not be a problem. No major pluses or minuses on this hotel, and depending on what you want, it could that suits your needs.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cOverall O.K.\u201d", "Author": "thewanderingewe", "ReviewID": "UR99350156", "Content": "`Nice Staff, BUT it's a one-man show.

Main reason was to escape the high room rates of the strip hotels. It was a pleasant stay, the bedroom was clean and tidy as was the bathroom. The public areas needed attention, for instance the carpet in the lift hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner for days and the carpet around the lobby area needed a vacuum. The continental breakfast which was included in the room rate was poor. The milk tasted sour and you could have broken a tooth on the raisin bran cereal it was so hard, obviously not Kelloggs!! The fresh fruit wasn't very nice either. Coffee tasted like dishwater and the toaster took 15 minutes to toast a slice of bread!! Putting the breakfast experience aside, we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay again some time in the future, but would skip the breakfast in favour of the IHOP down the road!!", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cJust ok\u201d", "Author": "durango", "ReviewID": "UR3389906", "Content": "Nice hotel but the price is a little steep for the rooms.

Booked a \"suite\" because we have 2 toddlers and like the extra room and the extra sofa bed. I booked our room 2 months before our arrival, when we got to the hotel we were told that there were no suites available, and that the last suite had just been rented out. I asked how this was possible considering that I had reserved a suite 2 months before. I was told that a reservation does not guarantee a room!?!? What? I was then told that we could have two rooms side by side for the suite price, with 2 toddlers this was not an option. The desk clerk then called the woman she had just rented the \"last\" suite to and asked her if she would move! Are they crazy! The clerk then told me that they had a suite that was empty but wouldn't \"open up\" until tomorow, if we wanted it we'd have to pay $199 a night (I booked the suite online for $129)! I again asked the desk clerk to explain to me how on earth we did not get the room we reserved and why it was now going to cost us $199 for the room, after arguing for about 20 minutes I gave up took our regular room key and went upstairs. Just as I finished unpacking the bags there is a knock on our door, it's the desk clerk, she said she \"found\" a suite for us (must have started feeling guilty) and that her manager would just have to be \"mad at her\"! What?????? I seriously felt like they were trying to get more money out of us, they wouldn't give us the suite for the $129 we reserved it for, but if we wanted to pay $199 we could have it, they are crooks! Needless to say we got the suite for $129 a night. It was small and musty but on such short notice we had no where else to go, the Hampton Inn next door is much nicer, but was completely booked. Breakfast buffet in the morning was nice. Once we arrived home I contacted LaQuinta Corporate and explained to them what had happened to us, our entire stay was refunded, we were mailed 2 free room certificates, and the manager from the Las Vegas La Quinta called us to appologize personally and stated that our next stay at his La Quinta would also be complementary. Hopefully the shady dealings are over, i'm sure corporate will make sure of that !", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Suprised with the La Quinta\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2306573", "Content": "We stayed at the La Quinta in Summerlin.
