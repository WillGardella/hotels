The main draw of this hotel is its proximity to LAX. This is my first time staying at custom hotel and absolutely fell in love with this place. Service/check in/check out: Checked in a little early with now hassle. I wish the front desk receptionist was a little more pleasant and smiled more. After a long flight you definitely want to see you pleasant face greet you upon your arrival. Be prepared for high hold fees on your card. We booked our stay online and paid in advance and wasn't expecting a $50/day holding fee. Other hotels usually don't charge that much holding fees for a prepaid stay. Valet parking is a little pricey too. Other hotels in the area Charges 15/over night stay. Wish there was an option for paid self park at their parking structure but it wasn't too bad to valet. The valet attendants were really nice and gave good directions on getting around town. And it doesn't hurt that they're very easy on they eyes ;) Breakfast buffet isn't worth it! At $11 there was very little options! All they had was bacon, eggs, oatmeal, potatoes, and pancakes. At their price point they should over a lot more options. May more Pasties? Just more choices! Room: The room was very neat. I myself admire the minimalist design aesthetic and this definitely suited my taste. The rooms are a little on the small side but it doesn't really matter. You get great views, a cool mood light and a flat screen tv, and of course free wifi! We stayed on the 2nd floor and was awaken Sunday morning by loud music, cheering and singing! A church event was going on next door to us in their conference room. It wasn't a good way to wake up to such loud music, wish their conference rooms were sound proof or they should address the sound due to the proximity of the rooms to the conference hall. Pool/outdoor/deck 33: Spent sometime out here and find it just divine! It's a great spot to kick back, grab a drink and just unwind after a long day of touring the city. Wish they hosted parties or some sort of activities during the weekend to make it much more lively. Maybe they do during summer? Location: Perfect location! Located on a less busy street and definitely avoids all the traffic in the seemingly congested century blvd with all the other lax area hotels. It's also close to stores and restaurants at this condo building next door! Overall: Had a great stay at custom hotel and would definitely return and recommend this place to friends and family visiting LA! They're not just an ordinary hotel but they have raised the standard of hotels around lax! Definitely can compete with the big name chain hotels!", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Punta del Este, Uruguay", "Title": "\u201cExcellant LAX Hotel\u201d", "Author": "go2mike", "ReviewID": "UR129197255", "Content": "This is the first time I stayed here and really like the hotel, the room was modern and very spacious, with state of the art flat screen TV and free wireless internet.

Check in was very friendly and efficient and I had no problems checking in early which was great. Hotel is next to a supermarket so you can buy good food for the room but they also have very tempting specials advertised on food and drink. There was no refrigerator in the room or my favorite item a kettle for tea but these were the only downside issues and also no self parking just valet.

Around 1:30 am I was woken up by loud voices on my floor. I heard what I thought was arguing and yelling between a male and female; and what sounded like police officers and radios. I'm not sure what was going on but I did want to open my door and ask them to be quiet. After being woken up, it took a couple hours for me to fall back asleep knowing there was an incident just outside of my room door. I would have appreciated if they moved the situation to the lobby or somewhere else as to not disturb the guests. In addition, the air conditioning/heat didn't work when I arrived and they sent someone up within minutes and he got the air condition to work. The next day it didn't work again, they sent someone else up and he got the air conditioning to work. Needless to say, it now works if you want cool air but the heat doesn't work and it has been cold in LA. I have been at the hotel for 2 weeks, extending my stay twice. I was asked to check-out and check back in for my first extension. At that time I was asked about charges to my room and there were charges that did not belong to me, including dinner at Deck 33 and 2 breakfast charges from that very morning. It concerns me as to how these charges could have been charged to my room as I had been sick and in bed since the day I arrived. Also, I was told during my last extension that they would be putting a hold on my credit card for 3 days (at $50 per day) though my extension was for 7 days. I was notified by my credit card that a hold was placed for $300 or 6 days worth. I'm not sure how you can hold $50 per day of the length of stay when the room is paid in full prior to check-in. So be prepared for a large hold if you stay here for more than a couple days. Lastly, the staff I met in the elevators or in housekeeping was very friendly. The room was clean and comfortable, very minimal. If you moved the curtain in the room that covers the wall, it exposes large cracks in the wall. And if you're a fan of room service like I am, you will be disappointed, NO room service available. This was a problem for me as a I was sick with the flu for a week and still had to go out to look for food. The fitness rooms are small and crowded most of the time. The free wifi is great if you don't plan on watching movies online as it is slow and they do offer a faster wifi network for a fee. The dark hallways and dark paint in the room gave a \"basement\" feel to the hotel but the amenities and friendly staff did make up for the decor. Overall, its a good hotel for the price and convenience to LAX with shuttle service. And the few good restaurants in the area and a small Ralph's supermarket right next door makes the hotel very convenient.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood spot near LAX\u201d", "Author": "CoreenM", "ReviewID": "UR126990330", "Content": "Enjoyed my spacious room with views over the airport.

There were no extra blankets anywhere and I turned on the heat in the middle of the night but it took a long time to heat up the room (downside to the large minimal design I suppose.) I also woke up at 6 am to the nasty smell of cigarette smoke. This is a nonsmoking hotel, but that must not stop people.

We booked shuttle 3 days prior to the trip (like the homepage said we could). We called, spoke to the front desk and sent en e-mail. When we arrived to LAX there was no shuttle there. Wohoo first time in US.. where to go? We had to call them again for them to pick us up. The explanation was that they had no booking from us. Come on! We are grown ups. Why even offer \"the book before\" service if it doesn't work? 2. No coffee until 7 am. I mean people are jet lagged, they need coffee whenever during the day/night. Airport hotel means guests form all over the world. A coffee machine in the lobby could save lives. Luckily there was a coffee shop and food store where one can get coffee 5.30 during weekdays. I've had few other guests expressing the same issue and asking me where they could get coffee. 3. The smoking area outside of the hotel is horrible. The hotel is a non smoking facility but guests arrive from all over the world. They do smoke. Give them some space where they could take their coffee and cigarette (outside the hotel of course). A place to sit and a table? Even other co-smokers thought it was a joke.

The 5th Floor had a weight room & other floors had different activities (e.g, art gallery, game room, vending room, etc). The rooms are clean and all have an aviation theme. The hotel bar is separate from the hotel. Very chill and offered $5 martinis when we were there. Despite the positives, we didn't like the $20/night valet parking. It essentially adds $20 on to your hotel bill as I do not think you can self-park. Each time you get your car you should tip the valet so this has the potential to add up. That being said, $20 for valet parking in LA might be cheap as another hotel we stayed in charged $38. Overall a very cool hotel. We'll be back!!!

Next door to the hotel there is a Ralph's supermarket, which sells, sandwiches, breakfast items and all sorts of essentials you may need, a pet shop and a Diner. The hotel is surrounded by local restaurants inc Italian and Chinese and world famous fast food outlets. Right across from the hotel lobby is a bus stop for those who don't have a car. It is just a 20 minute trip to Santa Monica which also is the main transport hub to the greater Los Angeles area. On that note the hotel also provide a free shuttle to the nearby LAX airport.

Second, it was a place one would seek to eat and to relax independent of whether one were staying there. The restaurant was well-styled and the food great. The selection was relatively small, but notwithstanding, only an overly-finicky person wouldn't have found something interesting to eat. The pool-side deck and evening bar were hip and able to accommodate the array of potential guests. I appreciate the sincerity of the wait staff (I elected to eat all my meals at the hotel, in large part due to a positive breakfast experience on the first day). Last, I enjoyed the new and creative way by which they oriented me to the hotel's amenities (e.g., an ink-blotter on the desk/end table conceived as an airline emergency procedures trifold). The staff was very accommodating, and with their efforts was able to conduct some business, but I think a more robust and accessible business room or similar room (e.g., with printing, scanning, faxing) would be helpful to attract more business folks. Likewise, the electrical system is not prepared for the 21st century's need for several plugs to charge/use several devices. My last (minor) critique is that the interactive TV isn't terribly interactive, and I gave up after a while, as it became too difficult to simply watch a baseball game. On the whole, were I on business travel in and out of L.A., this place would come instantly to mind, and I'd enjoy the stay.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cullowhee, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat place but parking is a hassle\u201d", "Author": "zack9999999999999999", "ReviewID": "UR119407186", "Content": "Neat botique hotel that is reasobale priced.

The hotel was a great value 3 star property however I thought it could have been a little cleaner - the amenities in my bathroom had been used and the packaging was dirty, it was a little dusty and the fridge door would not close. Saying that, my overall impresion was of a great value property within a few minutes of LAX and a minute's walk from the Big Blue Bus stop which goes to Santa Monica in about 30 minutes for $1. Excellent!! I phoned the hotel after clearing customs and waited about 15 minutes for the car to arrive. It was driven by one of the friendly hotel staff, was clean and comfortable. My key was ready for me at the hotel on arrival and I was greated warmly, advised that the bar and restaurant were open until 10pm and the log in details for the free wifi and shown to my room. The room was compact but the bed was very comfortable (despite being a bit soft) and there was an iHome sound dock. I looked out over the airport, which was a bit of a boring view, but the rooms were well soundproofed and I didn't hear a single plane (or car) all night. The bathroom was also small but the shower had decent water pressure and the amenities (shower gel, shampoo etc) were quite lovely. After settling in I went in search of the restaurant. There was no information pack in my room or in the lift so it was impossible to know where the gym/restaurant/bar etc was unless you went to reception to enquire. Once I did that the bar was easy to find. To the right of the lobby there is a large outdoor pool area with cabanas, a fire pit and plenty of sun loungers. The restaurant and bar overlook the pool from a mezzanine level. I sat in the bar on a comfortable sofa next to a heat lamp - it was cool in the evening - with my book and waited about 10 minutes for the bar man to come over and offer me both the bar and restaurant menu. I ordered what turned out to be one of the best margaritas I have ever had (the Custom Margarita with orange and chipotle - delicious) as well as the Yellowtail Crudo which was a sashimi style dish with avocado and ponzu sauce. The quality was superb and far exceeded my expectations from an \"airport\" hotel. I also ate breakfast in the restaurant the next morning. It was a beautiful sun trap and the food and coffee were again of wonderful quality, particularly for the price which I thought was very reasonable. Overall I thought this was a great place to stay. As long as you remember that it is a 3 star, not a 5 star, then you should be pleasantly surprised. I found the service to be excellent (except for one of the bell boys who I thought could let the team down), the location was good, and the bar and restaurant better than I could have hoped for.

Bad Points - Our stay started and ended poor - would not recommend staying here. Firstly, it states on the hotels site that there is a shuttle service from airport - it does not say that you have to phone to book this. After finding the number and several phone calls later the shuttle service was not where it said it would be. After waiting and getting sunburned for over 2 and half hours we finally found the small unmarked mini van with driver still in it making no attempt to call our names out. On arrival to the hotel the receptionist Maile was very apologetic and provided a compensation credit to our room which we were thankful for, she also put us in a room that did not have an airport view. Apparently the 'new' shuttles have not yet received new permits so they cannot pull in where all the other shuttles do. Secondly, there was an issue with using the pool area, it was very disappointing on not only one but two of our days out of our 4 day stay there that we could not use the pool area due to it being let out to an external business and a group for a pool party. This was really disppointing as the nearest beach in Santa Monica was 40 minutes way by bus. Also we were printing out our boarding pass in the lobby, a fight spilled over from the party and a woman was arrested right behind us. A very unpleasant thing to witness at 10pm on vacation.

JDV is pretty reputable and rarely disappoints, but unfortunately Custom Hotel, at the time of my stay, was DEFINITELY not up to JDV standard. I'll start with the good: the location, very near LAX, was convenient, and being right next door to a grocery store was nice. A coffee shop is right down the street, and there are a few restaurants within walking distance as well. The staff is very kind, and they will send a courtesy car to pick you up from the airport or rental car stations. Valet parking is mandatory and expensive, but this is true for almost all LA hotels. The lobby looks nice, and although I didn't spend much time at the lobby bar it appeared to be functional and I saw other patrons there. That's where the good ends, sadly. The rooms are far less \"boutiquey\" and far more \"hostel\". The carpet in room is a blueish indoor/outdoor blend, which is not at all nice to look at or to feel on bare feet. There is a very small desk bolted to the wall with only an ottoman to sit on...not terribly comfortable or relaxing. No closet, just a wooden bar attached to the wall. The bed is very low to the ground and doesn't appear modern as much as \"mattress on the floor\". There is a flat screen TV, but it is bolted to the concrete wall opposite the bed that is draped in chiffon. The bathroom seemed fine to me - there is a bathtub/shower combo and the sink was large and everything functioned just fine. The WiFi is free, but good luck getting a signal - apparently the signal boosters have not been put to use and since the hotel is a bit of a metal box, the signal is VERY weak. Same goes for your cell phone while in room. I definitely realize that we could all use a break from technology overhaul, but while on a business trip, I need reliable internet and cell use, and it was very frustrating to struggle with this at Custom. The hotel is pet-friendly, which I love - would have loved to bring my dogs if I was not on a business trip - but I found a tick in my room. I understand that animals have fleas and ticks from time to time, but if you are going to be a pet-friendly hotel, you MUST make sure that your cleaning staff goes above and beyond to remove parasites for unsuspecting (and pet-free) guests. The workout room is a complete joke - I can only hope that it has not yet been addressed in the renovation. There are a few cardio machines, none of which work well, and the \"personal TVs\", if they work at all, only get 3 channels. Most did not function or even turn on. There are some cool and \"hipster\" elements to this hotel - a vending machine with all sorts of random items for sale (radish seeds, fishnet hose) and a strobe light in each room...but in Custom Hotel's attempt to be \"cool\" they are forgetting about basic comforts. My advice is to wait until the renovation is complete, look for some good reviews, and THEN maybe give this property a try. Until then, it is not even remotely luxury or boutique.

A low platform bed with just a mattress that is lumpy and uncomfortable. The pillows were just as worse and lumpy. Total joke. The entire place is dark and drab. The color scheme going on is trying to hard to be hip. The buildings dark grey walls make it feel like a prison of some type. The bar/lounge area is very plain and drab with no TV's or anything to speak of. Trying to go for a nightclub atmosphere it fails horribly in my opinion. Customer service was okay. As I checked in I was greeted by nice employees who spoke to me like I was going to have a beer with them. Okay for me, other business travelers might not appreciate that. After receiving my keys, I make my way up to the room and the keys don't work. I'm carrying 3 bags of gear and have to go back down to get another key. No apology, nothing, just \"it's a little sticky sometimes\". Great. I get another key and it works. Also, there's valet parking only. $15. As I came down in the morning I had to wait several minutes before I even saw a valet to retrieve my car. The topper on the pile of this excuse for a hotel is my credit card was charged an additional $86 for no reason. I received no receipt for the room or any of these additional charges. After speaking with customer service I was told I would receive a refund in a few days. Again, no reason for the charge. Very unprofessional in my opinion. This Hotel tries to be hip and cool but fails miserably. It feels like it just hired a designer right out of the Art Institute of California.

But staying there last week, we found that it's \"been sold\" and not only is the \"Beware of Dog\" ambiance (pencils, dog-pictured duvets, and other inexplicable references) gone, but so, alas, is The Sheep from the Lobby (ask, please). We're told the \"Bistrotek\" restaurant is closed permanently, and the minibars are gone, leaving sadly empty refrigerators in the rooms which remain nice, but no longer edgy. Yet the Desk Staff was incredibly helpful and eager, and assured us that the transformation was going to be even better (if sheep-less) than before, in merely a few months. So we'll be back. For now, it's a very affordable and cute place, and I think the club remains an interesting venue. Parking is $20, yet proximity to a Ralph's next door and a fun bowling alley (with extreme bowling!) adjacent make it possible to still be a little bit twisted for a weekend. The lack of coffee maker in the room is regrettable, and the amenities are slim, except for excellent (and free) Wi-Fi. There appears to be an airport shuttle, as well, so it gets some convenience points, too.

It had the best bed I have ever slept on. Unfortunately they make you pay to park your car for $10 a night and they make you use their valet. It takes forever to get your car from them and if you call down they will have it ready, but they leave it running. One day I went down my car was waiting there, but there was no employees in sight. Anyone could have taken it. Also coming back one night a big party was going on with people everywhere and the valet people just told me to leave my car and they would take care of it. I stood by it for 20 minutes until they decided to park it. As for the hotel itself I went there for action sporting events which started early in the day. My last to night at the hotel I couldn\u2019t sleep because of people partying next door. I called down to the desk twice and they DID send security up each time, and they told them to knock it off, but they started right back up again a few minutes later. I called back down a few more times, but they wouldn\u2019t answer the phone for me anymore. They allowed them to party until it calmed down around 6am. Also one day I came back and my room door was wide open. The maid didn\u2019t close it. Upon checking out I was asked how things where and when I told the manager he just looked at me like I was crazy for saying anything other then fine.

Nevermind the fact that I informed the hotel well in advanced that I would arriving at 10:45pm and that the cut-off time was 11:00pm. When I got to the hotel, I found the staff to be equally as frustrating and uninviting. Furthermore, the breakfast bar and the hotel restaurant staff were rude as well.

The building has a nice, large red neon sign, making it easy enough to find. However, we couldn't find the lobby entrance for quite a while - it's in the rear, along an alley. Valet parking is mandatory, which I didn't like but was too tired to go out hunting for a parking meter late at night. The desk clerk was having a telephone conversation that lasted about ten minutes before she condescendingly checked us in. The \"bell hop\" who took our luggage upstairs also seemed to be the janitor. The halls are dark gray and foreboding. \"Twilight Zone\" best describes the hallway experience. Our room was on the 10th floor, and a sign near the elevators informed me that the ice machine was on the 9th floor. Said ice machine on the 9th floor didn't work, so I picked up a courtesy phone and was instructed to check the ice machine on the 8th floor. Finally, I got some ice. When I got back to the room, my wife told me that there was no heat in the room - and it was about 45 degrees F outside. The desk clerk sent up a space heater, but we couldn't get the room much above 60 degrees F until we stuffed a vent in the bathroom with tissue paper so the cold draft would stop filling our room with arctic air. The bathroom once had a heat lamp in the ceiling, but it had been replaced with a back-yard flood light that had been carelessly painted red. There was no coffee in the room, but expensive bottled water was available for purchase on top of an in-room refrigerator. The hotel does have a very dark and dreary restaurant that is very, very expensive. The appearance of the restaurant reminded me of a loading dock in the back of a big box department store. We did not eat there. In the morning, I called valet parking and asked them to bring my car to the front desk area. The front desk clerk was talking on the phone and never said a word to us, so I tossed our room keys on the desk and left. We waited about 15 minutes for the car before I decided to go outside and investigate. I spotted our car a short distance up the alley, but there were no keys in it. I finally got the desk clerk to get off the phone long enough to point me in the direction of the valet office at the other end of the alley. A valet got my keys but wouldn't give them to me. He obviously was seeking a tip because he asked if I had any luggage to load and if I was going to go out and come back in. I told him I would never return and demanded my keys. We drove off feeling that we had just escaped from a concentration camp. My room reservation was for $85 - but added taxes and fees (including $22 for parking my car in the alley) brought my final cost to $149. We could have stayed at a nicer hotel for a lot less money.

This is my least favorite hotel. There is no closet in the rooms, only a rack to hang your clothes IF you are lucky to have hangers, mine did not. There are vending machines only on the 6th floor and the time that I went there they did not have sodas or snacks available only two vending machines selling weird toys. The hallways are painted a depressing dark gray with matching carpet for an extra gloomy dungeon feel. The bathroom was very small and my shower curtain had mold, and on top of that the shower head was not properly working. The bathroom door does not shut, only slides so not much privacy there anyone can just walk on in. The valet parking seems totally unnecessary as the valet parks your car in a lot that is literally 50 feet away from the entrance of the hotel. It should be self parking and it should be free.

The pool is TINY (I saw a woman swimming \"laps\" and it took her 8 strokes to get across the pool, 9 if she went diagonally from corner to corner. The pool is more of a place to hang out and be seen than a place to take a dip and cool down. The room was nice, though I found the placement of the bed smack in the center of the room to be a bit odd. And I had never been in a hotel without a dresser in the room before. There was a free safe, which was nice, and it was big enough to hold my netbook computer, iPod, jewelry, and BlackBerry with plenty of room to spare. The bathroom was very sparse but again, if you're using the hotel room as I did--a place to sleep and keep my belongings while I spent time out and about with friends--it was perfectly adequate. Valet parking was $22 per day and they took good care of my rental car. There is no self-park option, which was a bit disappointing, but the valet service was prompt and never delayed me from getting to where I needed to be. There is a grocery store right next door and if you tell them you are staying in the hotel they will give you one of their discount club cards to use during your stay. There are several coffee shops and restaurants in easy walking distance as well as a Bank of America. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel--and the reason I wouldn't recommend it for families--is that there is a poolside bar that gets VERY loud and stays open very late at night. The first night I was there was a Wednesday night in the summer and the only thing that allowed me to sleep (I had one window that faced the pool) was that I was jetlagged from my flight.
