The street was pretty loud but turning on the a/c or the tv pretty much drowns it out. The desk staff all spoke fantastic English and were very helpful. The breakfast was very expensive (9-16 euros) for a mediocre plate of eggs and a croissant.

And I can honestly say I have never been a fan of any hotel before. Literally right around the corner from the Eiffel Tower. 750 meters. All a beautiful walk along the Seine. I won't mislead, it is a small, cozy little room. Which is par for most hotels in Paris, as I understand. But for the price, I thought I got a great deal. The staff is beyond measure. They speak English very well. They went above and beyond getting us everything we needed and offered the best in advice. It is off the beaten path, but amazingly accessible by 2 metro stations. One was outside my window, but I never heard it once during my stay. For a busling neighborhood, it was quite quiet. The decor was modern. It was a nice difference from much of Paris. It is surrounded by resturants and cafes. The corner take out place has amazing crepes. I never ate there (breakfast served only). When I emailed them about details, most came back within a day. They were so incredably helpful. If I had to go back ever again, I wouldn't hesitate to go back there.

They were clean, with a mini bar / fridge which was surprisingly reasonably priced - coffee and tea facilities & a TV - which needed some English channels. We were on the 1st floor right opposite the Metro - this sounds like a bad thing but despite being light sleepers there was hardly any noise.

Even though the front of the hotel is opposite the railway and we had a street facing window on the fourth floor we did not notice the trains at any time during the stay. We could even open the window for fresh air, not something you normally get in hotels. The location was what caught our eye when looking for somewhere to base ourselves in Paris. It is only an easy ten minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, and fifteen to the Trocadaro area. There is a cafe and restaurant next door, both serve good food with many other food places down Grenelle Bld. There is an ATM on the next corner and grocery shop too. The free wifi worked perfectly from our room and was even strong enough to hold Skype calls home to the kids. The people on the desk spoke very good English and helped any way they could.

The Hotel Eiffel Seine is a lovely 3-star boutique hotel situated on the Blvd de Grennelle, directly opposite the Bir Hakeim metro station (Line 6), and a stone's throw from the Champs Mars Tour Eiffel RER station (yellow line C). We travelled by Eurostar from St Pancras to Gare du Nord, where we found it incredibly easy to get to our hotel - take the RER B line (dark blue) south 2 stops to St Michel Notre Dame, then change and get the RER C line (yellow) west for 4 stops and alight at the aforementioned Champs Mars Tours Eiffel. Follow the directions for the exit Blvd de Grennelle. We were met by a very lovely english speaking lady (in fact, all the staff were fabulous, and very friendly and helpful). Check-in was quick and easy, and our room was on the 1st floor (so not far to take our luggage!). We had booked a Club room which was nice and spacious, with a very comfortable King sized bed, and a very clean and well-stocked bath/shower room. The shower was very nice, constant hot water! The only gripe/complaint we would have was about the location of the room - we were facing the main road, and the metro station, which proved to be a problem at night due to the noisy traffic and building work taking place just below us. We could also here the toilet flushing and the shower in neighbouring rooms which meant disrupted sleeps unfortunately. For the price of a Club room, I would've expected a room at the back of the hotel. I would also say the price of breakfast , at 16 euros each, is too much. There are a couple of cafes just down from the hotel which do breakfast for chepaer, or, if you want a lite breakfast, you can get a croissant or pain au chocolat and an orange juice for 4 euros in the restaurant on the corner of the same road. The location of the hotel is perfect - a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower (would recommend going on a weekday, early in the morning about 09.00 as the queue is small), and a particular treat at night is that on the hour, when the tower is lit up, the whole tower sparkles for 5 mins - truly amazing and romantic. You can do a vareity of open top bus tours - we took the green open top bus tour, which is a hop on hop off service consisting of 4 lines which take you round various parts of Paris - cost is 29 euros for 1 day which is a definitely worth it! We would recommend taking a stroll along the Seine to the Place de la Concorde and a walk through the gardens to the Louvre is not to be missed! A would also say that the hotel is an excellent base for a day out at eurodisney - you can take the metro from Bir Hakeim (Line 6) north to Charles de Gaulle Etoile (you can visit the Arc de Triomphe from this station too), and then change onto the RER line A (red line) towards Marne - La - Vallee (a 30-45mins trip). Trains are very regular! All in all, our trip was amazing and the hotel very clean and comfortable. Our one recommendation would be to check if your room is facing the road or is at the rear of the hotel.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port-Bail", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely nothing to criticize\u201d", "Author": "kdfbug70", "ReviewID": "UR123204625", "Content": "We were warmly received by English-speaking staff and were made to feel welcome.

Very convenient location, Eiffel Tower 5 min walk. We didn't book a restaurant for New Year's Eve in advance as the cheapest offers were 250 Euro. We went along with advise from other reviews to deal with it on the spot as normally a lot of places are open-and it's true.

We didn't find the French people rude or disregarding you as an English speaker-on the contrary-the hotel staff and everywhere we needed service people were very attentive and polite.

I was there around noon, and saw room keys galore -- each sorted in the proper place, and they still wouldn't release the room until \"after 2pm.\" Secondly, when one checks out, the hotel keeps your credit card number. they refuse to destroy it, even after they have had suficient time to check the room for damages. this goes against international practice where hotels will tear up the credit card guarantee authorizations when you check out.

In all fairness, he did reply NO (or a very begrudging yes) to most requests so i was never sure whether they held the credit card number out of policy or just because the receptionist was obstinate.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our first Paris experience!\u201d", "Author": "mcadams76", "ReviewID": "UR119410405", "Content": "My husband and I visited Paris October 11-13, as a side trip during a vacation to visit family in Germany. It was helpful to do some research in advance, since we took the train from Germany to the Paris Gare de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Est station. Hotel Eiffel Seine was very easy to access via the metro, since it is right across from the Bir-Hakeim (Tour Eiffel) stop. Our room was ready when we checked in around 2:00, and the hotel staff was pleasant and welcoming. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending nearby restaurants for lunch. Our French language skills were limited, but the staff were accommodating in speaking English, as well as recommending high quality restaurants that were patient with customers with limited French proficiency. Hotel staff also helped us to discover restaurants that were not so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touristy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but had excellent food for a reasonable price. Our room was on the second floor, in a nice quiet corner away from the elevator. Although the elevator was small, we rarely had to wait and easily took the stairs at times. We found that the room and bathroom were just right, comparable to some boutique hotels in New York City. The room overlooked a quiet courtyard, and it was refreshing to open the windows in the morning. We did not mind leaving the key with the front desk each time we left the hotel; in fact, each time we returned to pick up the key, we enjoyed nice conversation with the hotel staff and learned something new or interesting about the area. On our second night, there were delicious croissants and coffee available in the lobby. We had late evening tickets for the Eiffel Tower on our second night also, so we especially appreciated the close walk from the hotel. There were a few restaurants around the corner from the hotel that remained open late, which was also convenient. Overall, we had no complaints during our stay.

Make sure you buy a glass of champagne at the top it will be the best 10 euros you ever spend!

The staff at the desk basically embarrased us in front of other guests and made us feel like criminals. We ended up getting billed for an additional $260 US Dollars so we paid $480, so absolutely not worth it. We are travel agency owners in the US and have never had an experience like this before in our lives. Truthfully we wish we would have left Paris off itinerary all together. When we went to leave the hotel, the desk staff was unable to obtain a taxi or car service for us and told us that taking the metro would be risky since service would be unreliable. We walked to two different metro stations with all of our luggage before we were finally able to figure out the train to get us back to the airport (the stations near the hotel do not provide connecting information and no one available at window).

We did some research on hotels in Paris for less than $300 and decided on the Eiffel Seine Hotel.

The rooms are slightly larger than typical European size and seemed clean. The lobby is nice, and when you check in they have tea/coffee/biscuits for you. The hotel is located in a decent area (felt safe and clean) right next to two subway lines, which is convenient, and about 3 blocks from the Eiffel tower. A taxi to almost all downtown locations is less than 15 euros. Best best thing about this hotel was the staff. Especially the woman who works during the day was incredibly nice and helpful with suggestions. She has worked at the hotel for 5 years, and seems to really like her job.

We booked through the conference and received a rate that included the full continental breakfast at 11 euros (vs 16 euros at the hotel). The hotel manager graciously extended the conference rate to us for our extra 4 nights when we asked. The hotel has been renovated and all the common areas and rooms are decorated in an Art Deco style which is quite modern and pleasing. The rooms are small by North American standards but very clean and well appointed. The only things we missed were a clock radio and a facecloth. The staff was courteous and helpful and most spoke English quite well. The manager in particular made some recommendations for meals and even did internet searches for us. There is a computer for your use in the lobby as well and the staff will print your boarding passes for you if you email them to the hotel address. The lobby doubles as a bar and there is a nice seating area as well as an outdoor courtyard. There are lots of touristy restaurants in the area but they serve pretty standard fare. They were fine for a quick bite or a snack, but I would recommend going a bit further a field if you want more traditional food. We had great success in the Latin Quarter - Le Petit Zinc for a true Parisien experience - live jazz, great food, good but slow service. It's a little pricier but won't break the bank. There are also tons of bars and small cafes that have a set menu at a reasonable price. We also loved the Hollywood Savoy in the Bourse region. They have a French/Hollywood decor with a typical French menu - lots of pate, fish and more. The fun part is that they have a live house band that is very interactive with the wait staff and clients. By the end of the night everyone is singing a mixture of English and French songs. The restaurant opens at 7:30 and a few locals will stop by for a glass of wine. Nothing gets going until 9:30 or so, but what a fun night! We also made it to L'As Un Falafel and it was worth the trip. And it was the only place in town where we found soft drinks at a reasonable price - 3 Euros for a 250 ml can vs 7-8. We found it quite easy to get around Paris once we figured out how to read the metro map. The hotel location was great as it is near a main line and close to many connections. We enjoyed the proximity to the Eiffel Tower and our night time pictures are spectacular. We enjoyed walking along the river. Also Rue Cler, a short street of food merchants and cafes, was close by and made for a nice evening. We ate at the Cafe due Marche which was quite good and was a great spot to people watch. Finally, we had the famous Glace Berthillion (ice cream on Ile St Louis) and don't know what the big deal was. It was good but I have had better. Maybe it was my flavour selection, but I was not blown away by my expensive and very small ice cream. However the tiny island and it's shops were delightful and charming. P.S. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. Paris in the spring is definitely as romantic and beautiful as they say.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "wrldtrvlr5", "ReviewID": "UR109942540", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights and were very pleased with our stay.

We were celebrating our 10 anniversary that week and our annual vacation. Reviews on this hotel were rated very high so I trusted the comments and booked our room for a week in May. Prior to our arrival, I called the hotel to make sure that the room would not be facing the street because I am a very light sleeper. I spoke with the hotel's manager and she was very nice and moved our room to the interior (garden view). We arrived late on Saturday after flying over 10 hours. We were very tired and were so glad to easily check into our room. We found the room to be very small (as previously rated), but clean and comfortable. There isn't any room for the suitecases, we had to line them up by the door leading to the garden view. By the way, there is not a garden to be seen, but it was very quiet. Constructions was being done on a large building complext two doors down and I did not hear anything at all during our stay. The walls are thin and if your neighbor is loud, you will hear what is being said. We had a problem one night around 10:30. The people in the room next to us loudly came in and were speaking in a tone that woke us up. I phoned the front desk to complain and within seconds we heard their phone ring. After that they toned down their voices and we were able to go back to sleep. We had to rise early the next day to catch a train to another city, so we really appreciated the staff's prompt help. We were very happy to have the room made up very well everyday with clean towels and supplies. The room has a little coffee maker and individual coffee supplies were given every day. All in all, I would recommend this hotel, but make sure you are aware of how small it is. We would have upgraded our room to a larger one, but were told they were sold out until the end of the month.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beverly Hills, California", "Title": "\u201cI really wanted to love it...but I'm just not into this hotel\u201d", "Author": "ellebud", "ReviewID": "UR109491296", "Content": "We booked two rooms based on our friends who stayed at the Eiffel Seine last year. (Yes, we still love them.) The booking was done through Orbitz who included our requirements for connecting rooms. I also contacted the Eiffel Seine with our request for connecting rooms and the possibility of an early check in for one of the rooms. Upon arrival there was no early check in available (I understand that this can be a problem), but no offer of a bathroom where we could freshen up. I reiterated our need for and request for connecting rooms which was summarily rejected despite correspondence to and from the hotel. Later that day, prior to check in we were moved by a manager to connecting rooms. This was a REALLY good thing because the rooms are so small as to be claustrophobic. The room was kept spotless by the housekeeper. Yes, the hotel is Metro close. In fact that is all you see when you look out the window. Twice, during the night, we heard a fight/screaming/police sirens outside in the Metro. Also LOVED the vomit in the Metro station in the morning. Obviously this is not the fault of the hotel, but it is the fault of the neighborhood. On the other side of the Eiffel Tower it is far nicer and quieter...and the restaurants far better. In general the people who worked at the desk were efficient and some were very helpful. However the running joke in our family became if certain people who worked the desk didn't know a restaurant, it was a good thing. With one exception we never had one staff member go out of their way for us, despite a long(er) stay, daughters who speak French, and except for the connecting rooms we made no requests.

There was very little noise at night though there was construction work going on nearby and we had a room facing a busy street. The walls are thin though and we could hear the neighboring rooms during the day. The rooms were very clean and were made up every day, the maids weren't pushy either, we left the do not disturb sign out each night and were never disturbed. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were late for our return transfer and called the hotel and they kindly informed the driver we wouldn't be long. One disappointing thing is the hotel has a cat, it didn't bother us as we were rarely in the hotel but had we have had breakfast or spent more time in the hotel it could of been a concern as neither of us like cats, and it could be a problem for people with cat allergies. Location wise you couldn't get much better, just across the street is a metro station and a short walk away is the Eiffel tower. There are many cafes around and pricing is reasonable.

The rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable, nice TV, coffee and tea making and fresh towels every day, and to be honest this was all we needed, but it was possibly the smallest double room we have ever stayed in. The staff were friendly, the breakfast adeqate and fresh, and the reception area clean and well fitted. with free cakes and coffee in the afternoon, a nice touch. Here is the BUT. There are building works going on next door, and the drilling starts at 07.56 on the dot!! It really spoilt the stay because we were on holiday and didn't appreciate the incredible noise caused and the early wake up. They were even hammering on the walls late into the night, but we were so tired by then it didn't matter. We also had a street light directly outside our window, and the curtains did'nt quite make it, add this to the noise from the road outside and the metro 40ft away and that all adds up to lack of sleep. I don't suppose the building work will go on for very long, but when booking I would check first and book a room that is as far away from the works as possible, oh, and the road. This is a really nice little Hotel only spoilt for us by the local works, but once this is over you should book with confidence, don't forget, traffic and car horns are everywhere in Paris so I guess the road noise goes with the territory.

We requested a room on a high floor with a view over the river seine. The hotel gave us this which we were really grateful for. Our only negative comment about the room was the size of it. Although we had a kingsize bed the actually room felt very small and cramped and was quite tricky when there are two of you trying to get ready. Also the bathroom door is sliding with no lock so you have to be really comfortable with each others toilet activties!! lol.

It was just right. I had reserved a triple room (one bed with fold-out chair for child). It was not ready when we arrived early, so they upgraded us to a floor/courtyard room with a small extra room including an extra chair/bed. The room was larger than we had reserved. The room I had booked would have been too small to fit the three of us with the chair open into a bed. This room - room 14 - Klimt - is located with two other rooms in the inner courtyard just on the other side of the lobby. It does open to the open air (but we didn't have rain so it was ok). The courtyard location made for a quiet peaceful location with no wait for the elevator and instant access to the front desk. The beds were comfortable and extra pillows were brought quickly when requested. The shower had power and hot water. Yes, it splashes out on the floor - oh well. The bathroom was huge with lots of shelf space for your toiletries. Bath towels are huge. The mini bar was well stocked with prices cheaper than the cafe next door. The cokes were 2.60 Euros, which was actually the best price I found anywhere in Paris! The staff at the front desk were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. The only comment I have is that they are not prepared to make recommendations about restaurants in the neighborhood. I used TA and found several good ones nearby. The Metro is literally directly across the narrow street for great convenience. As you leave the hotel and turn the corner, you can immediately see the Eiffel Tower.

That said, I have found that the best hotels for me are the quiet and clean ones located closest to a Metro line with a direct connection to the major underground Metro hubs. (located immediately across the street from the No. 6 line which connects to all other lines and the RER train with a direct 20 minute ride to Versaille). The Eiffel Seine is the best of class in this regard. Plus, all of their front desk and concierge staff are not only extremely knowlegable, they also take great pride in going the extra distance to help their guests find what ever it is you may be looking for. The rooms are very comfortable and extrfeemly clean. The neighborhood is very safe and just a short walk to both the river and the tower. While I normally stay in 4 or 5 star hotels, ES is any ranked a 3 which is hard to understand when you add up the sum of the parts. Nonetheless, is it priced accordingly and in my view is one of the best values to be found.

The hotel is perfectly located, being close to numerous metro stations, within walking distance of the trocadero and the eiffel tower! In the opposite direction to these, you can walk to les invalides and there are more than enough bars/cafes/shops to satisfy everyone! The bus tour also goes from the eiffel tower so its great for getting your bearings! All in all, the hotel is fab and great value for money.

It is an excellent boutique hotel very near the Eiffel Tower (5 min walk away) which was great for us as the first day we went, the Tower was closed due to the weather and we could easily just walk there the next morning to see if they were opened. The walk along the Seine was also quite beautiful although since it is winter it was too cold for us. The hotel is situated directed opposite the Bir Hakiem station and is next to Subway and 3 other restaurants. We ate at both italian restaurants and recommend the one next to Subway. The supermarket is about a 5 minutes walk to the left of the hotel entrance and we usually pick up some Evian and a bottle of wine before heading back to the hotel. There is also a laundromat about 10min walk after the supermarket in a quiet residential area although it cost us Euro9 for a load and about the same amount for the dryer. The lift is absolutely tiny. It fits only 2 persons and we had to contort our bodies to fit in our 2 luggages. The room was tastefully done with a comfortable bed, tea & coffee making facilities and a mini bar. The TV is quite small but we hardly watched any as there was only BBC available (on all 4 nights we were there the CNN was not available). I thought the bathroom (with a bath) was a reasonable size and very very clean. It was the nicest toilet that I came across having stayed in 6 hotels in this trip (of course 3 of which were the Ibis chain). There were nice touches such as the good quality soap & shampoo provided. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel as it is next to a station and easily accessible, had decent restaurants just next to the hotel and if you want to walk along the romantic Seine at night or to the Eiffel Tower, this is the best hotel to stay in.

It tended to be around lunchtime which coincided with my sons nap time so most days we had to try and negotiate for the maids to come back later which was difficult as their english wasn't good and neither is our french. The location is good for the eiffel tower and the metro stop and thats all. We had to catch the metro constantly to get to the major sites. But it is only a short ride to Charles de Gaulle Etoile so that was a plus. The restaurants close by are pricey but then so is all of Paris. The only other bad thing was that the hotel staff booked our car service to the airport and they booked it for only 3 hours before our plane departed when we specifically stated that we needed to be AT the airport 3 hours before to ensure we got the bulkhead seats with a bassinet for my son.

The location is fantastic with a metro stop across the street and steps from the Eiffel tower. The hotel staff were friendly and spoke excellent English which was helpful to us as we speak no French at all. We had a room on the 5th floor. The hotel's elevator is, without a doubt, the smallest I've ever seen. The two of us could not both fit inside when we had our bags with us. The hallways were also tight and manuevering bags was tricky, but we managed. This isn't really a complaint though, I just found it interesting! I loved that the lighting in the hallways is on a motion sensor so the lights come on as you move through the halls. No need to waste electricity on empty halls! Anyway, our room was pretty cozy but I was expecting that. We couldn't both have our bags open at the same time (unless it was on the bed) so there was a lot of rearranging and climbing over things during our stay, but again, such a minor complaint when in PARIS! The room was very clean and stylishly decorated. I loved the full size tub and large, plush bath towels. It was wonderful having windows that would open as the temperature in the room always seemed to be too warm for us, even though we did not run the heat at all. Our room overlooked the train station so it was quite noisy with the windows open, but when closed, it was quiet enough that we could sleep easily. Our TV remote never seemed to work, but we never even bothered to mention it to the hotel staff since we were in PARIS! The mini-bar was nicely stocked and replenished daily. The bed was sufficiently comfortable and I appreciated the extra pillows. The hotel's breakfast was included in our rate and was fine. At about 14 euro a person, it would be nice to have had more hot items (instead of just hard boiled eggs and some bland sausages) but the pastries and breads were very delicious and there was always hot coffee, which is more than good enough for me. Unfortunately, we left the hotel in a terrible mood because the shuttle that the hotel arranged for us ended up being 1/2 an hour late. We made our flight, but with no time to spare! Not sure what that was about as no one bothered to explain or apologize for it. So just make sure you allow enough time for late drivers if you arrange your transportation through the hotel!

I'm no big complainer, but we're 64&65 years young, paying good money, celebrating our 40th anniversary, first time in Paris, all that romantic stuff, etc. Any classy hotel would offer a credit, a change of rooms,etc. but nothing of the sort was forthcoming from the front desk.

I mean any hotel can have an unforseen problem, but unfortunately, that's not an excuse for badly mishandling the situation, which the people at this hotel did. When we checked out, I told them, for their own good, their next clients might not be as tolerant as we were.

We found it extremely suitable for our visit -- we were able to take the RER from Charles De Gaulle airport practically to the front door (but beware of all of the steps up and down to the platforms if you are rolling heavy luggage --and none of the occasional escalators or elevators that we encountered were working). The Metro station across the street made it quite easy to get around, It was a pleasant short walk to walk along the Seine, or to the Eiffel Tower, which made it easy to visit around 10 p.m. when it was all lit up. The nicely decorated room was small, as expected in Paris. So was the bathroom -- I kept hitting my elbow on the glass shower door when I tried to do my hair or makeup in front of the mirror. The shower was lovely, with good water pressure, but oddly enough had no place to put the soap. The king sized bed was comfortable, with extra pillows available. There was a flat screen TV, safe, refrigerator, hair dryer and free WiFi. The room was very warm at night and we had to keep opening the window to stay comfortable (the HVAC system did not seem to be working). Since the outside temperatures were in the 40's, we were going from one extreme to the other. The room overlooked a courtyard and was quiet except for noise from the adjacent room -- it sounded as if their closet was behind our headboard, and when they would remove articles of clothing the wooden hangers would swing and bang against the wall. The walls did not seem terribly well insulated, but that's Paris! The staff was very helpful and friendly. A Parisienne woman walking her dog led us to her recommendation for French cooking, and we had a fantastic order of Boeuf Bourguignon (served right in the copper saucepan), accompanied by rice, polenta, mashed potatoes, wine and bread at Le Volant, a short walk away. (I was delighted to see the restaurant and dish recommended on Trip Advisor!) The next night, another local sent us a few blocks up Boulevard de Grenelle, where we discovered a bunch of local restaurants and a department store. We chose Le Bouquet de Grenelle on the corner. We were offered a quiet table in the back room where we ate quiche Lorraine, green salad, and apple tart accompanied by the requisite bread and a bottle of wine. We had a delightful time communicating with our waiter and going with his recommendations. There are lots of shops nearby, including florists, butchers, groceries, and bakeries that will have you overwhelmed by the smell of the freshly baked breads and baguettes and the choices of pastries. We picked up a couple of apple pastries in the morning (alas the pastry shops don't sell coffee, only soda), planning to walk over to the Eiffel Tower for a morning picnic, but as we were walking we discovered a street market open below the elevated Metro tracks in the center of Boulevard de Grenelle, and paid it a visit. We were awestruck by the selections presented by the fishmongers and butchers, and the fruits and vegetables, spices, clothes and accessories available. Apparently the market is only open on Wednesdays and Sundays, and it's where the locals shop.

Overall, I thought it was a very good hotel for the money and location. Standing outside, you can see the Eiffel Tower, which is maybe a 5-minute walk away. Although it is not right next to the other main tourist attractions, they are just a train ride or two away. The Bir-Hakeim metro stop is literally directly across the street from the hotel, so getting around is extremely easy. In addition, there are lots of restaurants in the area (many w/ English-speaking staff) and street vendors selling crepes at midnight. The staff was mostly friendly and courteous, but be careful with the night staff, who may not be able to properly explain things. We learned the hard way that during evening hours/night you cannot have guests in your room (the staff could not provide a specific time when pressed for this info but estimated no guests after 8 or 9 pm). It's not like you'd be able to have a party up there anyway, because while the room itself was clean, it was also TINY, which I suppose is to be expected. A few things they don't tell you on the website: - You must leave your room key with the front desk upon departure (each time you leave) - If you want to iron, it must be done in the basement (no iron + board in room, and no, they will not bring you one) - The elevator is a pint-sized box that will not fit two people and their luggage (maybe one person and his/her luggage or two or three people w/o luggage) Regardless, it was a nice hotel with good staff and clean rooms.

We stayed here because there was a good deal in combination with the Eurostar. At first we were not sure because of the 3 stars but because the location was great and when we came in, the hotel had a very friendly athmosphere. The room was not ready at first but we could have a sit in the very comfortable chairs in the lounge and waited for 5 minutes. The hotel is situated near the Eiffel Tower and the metro station is also around the corner. The great thing we discovered while being there is the balcony. You can open the doors and look over the city on your own little balcony. This was great, the beds are ok, they are quite hard, some like it, some not. The room is small and it does not have a kettle. For additional services, like tea and coffee, you have to go down and order it. Also the breakfast is quite expensive. While staying here, we had breakfast but not so much and in our eyes, this was quite overpriced. So if you want to stay here, please have a look around, there are lots of little corner restaurants/ cafe's where you can have a nice coffee and a croissant. The service was great! This was definately a plus. The people were very friendly and helped us with reserving some restaurants, which they were happy to do so. Everyone smiled and said hello. the language was sometimes a barrier. As soon as you are going away from the front desk, the level of English decreases dramatically, but nevertheless they stay friendly and very patient.

Not to mention the fact that you are only a 5 minute walk away from the base of the Eiffel Tower. The multi-lingual staff are very friendly and nice and although the hotel is small, we found it very welcoming and cosy. We had a room facing the street which was sometimes loud with the French seemingly being in love with their car horns. However the windows were good and after 11.30, when the last Metro had gone by, things quietened down and you could easily get some sleep in the very large, comfortable beds. In the morning there was a nice big en-suite shower for us to use which was great. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as they did not serve a full English and we were not prepared to pay 14 euros each for a continental breakfast. The few minor problems I had with this hotel are as follows:. The receptionist is also the concierge, and whilst I had no issue with them from a receptionist point of view, the concierge part of the role left a lot to be desired. We only asked them two questions; one about Disneyland closing times and the other about whether or not the Metro strikes would effect the Eurostar trains. I'm sorry to say they got both questions wrong. We were told Disneyland closed at 11pm when in actual fact it closed at 7pm which ruined that part of the trip for us. We were also told that Eurostar trains might be cancelled so we should leave early just in case. However when we got to the Eurostar station we were told there was never any intention of cancelling any trains so we needn't have worried. Another slight issue we had is that you have to leave your key with the receptionist every time you leave the hotel and ask for it back on your return. This sounds fine, however we were never once asked for ID when we asked for our room key back, leading us to worry that whilst we were out, anyone could have walked in and taken our key. But those small issues aside this is still a great hotel and the location is perfect.

I'm not a big person, 5'2\" and 120lbs (curvy but not big) and I hated the bathroom in our room, the toilet was just a few steps away from the bed and you have a pocket door to close it off but it's a bit uncomfortable when you know your husband is on the bed and can hear everything you're doing in there! There's no fan either to mask noises! The shower was tiny and not great for shaving your legs, there's no where to put your shower products and no where to put your foot up to shave which I don't like. It seemed like the water temperature was inconsistent too, I kept having to change the temperature during one shower, it would go from burning hot to mild back to burning...maybe from other people in the hotel flushing their toilets or something? Other than that the room was ok, would have been nice to have a little bit bigger safe. What was weird was the power button doesn't turn on the tv, you have to push 1 on the remote and they don't tell you that, I told the front desk our tv was broken and then they told me you have to press 1. Our room was on the second floor and facing the metro, we did get quite a bit of street noise, heard lots of sirens. The elevator is a joke, 2 people max so I was glad we were on the 2nd floor and easily could take the stairs. The day staff was amazing though, I thought they were so nice and spoke English really well, we still greeted them and said thank you in French and they told us how to say a few words which we butchered but they were very patient with us. We bought a bottle of wine and some food at the super market down the street (the mini fridge is big enough to stock with your own food which was great) and the girl at the front desk gave us a corkscrew and wine glasses. There was a transportation strike while we were there and they posted signs around the hotel to inform everyone about it which was nice too. The guy manning the desk at night however was not so nice. The strike just so happened to be on a day we had scheduled to take a train to Carentan for a D-Day tour so we got up early and the night staff guy was still at the desk, I asked him to call us a cab since the metro was running like 1 out of 5 trains an hour and got lectured by him on why didn't I schedule the cab the night before and that was stupid of me...and my husband left while I was doing that to go to the ATM and the night guy yelled at me that he needed to get back in the lobby to wait for the cab and I should tell him but I couldn't leave to go get him and my husband was back within a couple of minutes anyway. Then what's super inconvenient was the entrance to the hotel locks after a certain time, they tell you it's open 24hrs but what they don't tell you is you have to ring a bell and wait for the night guy to open the door for you. One night we got there and it wasn't that late and a couple had been waiting for a while outside the door and we waited with them for about 5 minutes, they were pissed. Then one night my husband was sick and stayed in the room while I went and got him something to eat and I was only gone for 2 minutes but had to ring the bell to be let in and I could see the night guy sitting at the desk not doing anything but he still took his time letting me it. I don't know, maybe he just had it out for us but I don't think we were being particularly difficult. We never ate breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on that, there are too many good cafes near by and a guy selling delicious crepes next door! The best part of this hotel is the location the Bir-Hikiem metro stop is across the street and the metro is the best, so easy to navigate! The Eiffel Tower is a 5 minute walk and although a bit away from the rest of Paris it's a great marker if you happen to get lost. Also Rue Cler is near by, a great little Parisian street full of great little shops. I don't think we'd stay here again, if we did we'd probably upgrade the room.

The Metro (Line 6) is directly opposite the hotel and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great system, so easy to get everywhere! The Eiffel Tower is around the corner.

The Eiffel Seine provided us with all of that - and more. Thank you fellow TripAdvisors - you've come up trumps again! The hotel is immediately opposite the Bir Hakeim Metro station, and about two minutes walk from Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel RER station (you come out of the station, cross the main road, and you're practically at the hotel). Upon our arrival at the hotel, the charming receptionist (who spoke excellent English) gave us some information about the hotel, and advised us our room would be ready in three minutes - it was ready in even less than that! We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320 for two nights in a classic room, so were delighted to be given a complimentary upgrade to a club room as we were on our honeymoon - totally unexpected, and very much appreciated! We had room 405, which was on the 4th floor, and overlooked the road and metro line. We had no noise at all from the Metro, and the road was only a little noisy during the day. Who spends all their time in their room in Paris during the day anyway?! The room was spacious compared to what we had been expecting, and had modern Art Deco style decor. The bathroom was also very modern and had an amazingly powerful shower. The only negative comment I could make about our room was that the handle for the shower was a bit loose, as was the door handle to the bathroom, and there was a small stain on the carpet next to the bed. None of these things caused a major problem nor ruined our trip - just something we noticed. We couldn't comment on the food in the hotel as we didn't eat there, nor did we drink in the bar. We asked the receptionist where we could go for nice evening meals, and she directed us to the Latin Quarter / Notre Dame area (about 10 minutes away on the RER). In that area, you can find some really good value restaurants (as well as the expensive ones) that provide good quality French cuisine. On our first night, we had a two course meal each, a pichet of wine and a bottle of water for about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40 which we thought was very reasonable. A three-course meal in the Latin Quarter again with the same drinks was about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45. Definitely have some French onion soup if you can! For breakfast, we were looking for pastries and hot drinks. If you turn left out of the hotel and walk for 7-8 minutes along Boulevard de Grenelle, you will come across Stephane Secco's bakery / patisserie which is on the left hand side of the road. We had two pastries each and a hot drink each which set us back about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.50 - and they were delicious too. There is a supermarket right near to the hotel, which is great for buying bottled water and other essentials, and there are several cash machines between the hotel and the bakery, too. We had booked a couple of excursions before we went to Paris. We paid approx \u00c2\u00a3190 for a Paris Illuminations tour by coach, followed the late performance of Moulin Rouge with champagne. The coach tour (run by Paris Vision, and we booked through Expedia) was very informative and lasted about 90 minutes, taking you past all the major sights and many more. Moulin Rouge was OK - though we had no room to move in our seats, we queued for ages to get in, and there were boobs out the entire time. I'd say if you're desperate to see it, then do, but if you're toying between that and something else at the same price - go for the other option! We also went on a lunch cruise with Bateaux Parisiens which starts from near the Eiffel Tower and lasts for about 2 hours. We had the middle class of service, so were sat next to a window. We had booked directly with Bateaux Parisiens, and were thrilled to be given our own table - we were expecting to be on a table of 4 - and subsequently a bottle of wine to share. Our three course meal was absolutely brilliant - the iced nougat was to die for - and we really enjoyed the musical entertainment whilst on board. Worth every penny. So to conclude, if you're looking for a hotel in Paris that is near to all of the major sights, has a comfortable bed, and has amazing staff that will do everything they can to help make your stay fantastic - then book this hotel!

Real pleasure. Also, hotel neighbourhood felt pretty safe and felt very comfortable during the night also. Room was a bit small but nothing that would cause any problem. If you're having trouble with a room size in Paris, then you must ask yourself why did you come to Paris? Staying in room or enjoying the city? Perfectly clean, toilette too. Bed was extremely comfortable. Linen perfectly clean. Almost nothing wrong, except rooms were a bit overheated during night and wifi signal wasn't the best, probably because of the rooms distance from router but nothing that could cause trouble.

There are cafes next door which are cheaper and in the surrounding streets. You need to really shop around when it comes to eating out though, with the exchange rate so poor, it is truly extortionate at the moment. My only gripe was the tea and coffee in the room. We specifically asked for milk as it was not provided, and we were left one mini carton for 2 of us. Each day there were just 2 sachets of coffee and I asked for more to be left when we went out and there was none when we returned. The man on night duty said he had no access to it at night, so we had to go without. It just seemed a bit penny pinching to me, and a hotel should be able to access such basic requests 24 hrs a day.

The decor is wonderful, very interesting and homely. There are many places to eat nearby along with supermarkets and bank link machines on the street. I loved the little shop with the fruit outside it, it was always open late so if we needed something to snack on instead of raiding the mini bar we would head down there instead. Now the cons of the trip, the lack of soundproofing in the hotel drove us mad! We could hear the people in the room beside ours talking and they weren't exactly shouting. When they got up at 8am one morning, the noise of them talking and opening and closing the wardrobe and bathroom doors woke my partner who then could not get back to sleep (i'd taken a sleeping tablet so didn't notice :-} ).

Fabulous Location\u201d", "Author": "Leopardstars", "ReviewID": "UR53065913", "Content": "This is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Paris. My husband and I stayed here from 9/26/09 - 10/3/09. We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and courteous. There are a few interesting things about the hotel. 1. In order to operate the lights in your room, you must have the key card in the slot by the door. 2. You must give your \"key\" to the front desk whenever you leave the hotel. Entry to the room itself is keyless (think of keyless entry for cars - it's the same for the room). Since this would be expense to replace if lost and the fact that the hotel name and your room number is on the \"key card\". I didn't mind handing it in. One less thing to lose. Fortunately, we only had to wait for the front desk attendant to come back once. 3. The elevator REALLY is small. We had quite a few bags since we were travelling to Europe for two weeks. So my husband went up with two bags and then I went up for the other two. If you are on the lower floors, I would just use the stairs. Since we were on the 6th, we tended to use the elevator. Rooms - DO NOT book anything smaller than a club room as these are small rooms. I was expecting this because of the reviews on this site, but was still surprised. I believe my university dorm room was larger. Despite this, we still managed to fit both of us and all our bags into the room without tripping over anything or each other. To get the king size bed, the hotel pushes two doubles together - a standard practice in Europe. However, I didn't even notice this until the third night. The bathroom was great though and it was nice to have an actual shower Location - This hotel is in a fabulous location. The Eiffel Tower is no more than a 10 minute walk away. This is perfect for those who want to visit it during the day and see it lit up at night. NOTE - the light show starts on the hour. By the Eiffel Tower is also a stop for one of the sightseeing bus companies. We purchased a two day pass and a river tour. This served as our transportation for two of the days we were in Paris. Les Invalides (home of Napoleon's tomb) is approximately a 20 minute walk. Right across the street from the hotel is the Bir-Hakeim Metro stop and the Champ de Mars RER stop. Using these stations you can see all the Paris sights including the Palace of Versailles (use the RER). My best advice is to purchase a carnet of tickets for the Metro as they are good for Metro and the RER. My husband and I only ate breakfast at the hotel once as we felt 7 euros for coffee, juice and a pastry was overpriced. If you go down the street (away from the Seine) there is agrocery store where you can purchase two croissants for 1.5 euros. We also enjoyed several crepes from the crepe stand that is on the corner. We did eat at both the restaurants by the hotel and while the meals were good, we felt that it wasn't anything we couldn't find at home, especially the Italian place. However, go down the street (away from the Seine) and you can find a number of authentic French restaurants. If you go for their special, you can get a good meal at a decent price. However, these restaurants do not start serving supper until 7pm, so if you can't wait this long, go to the restaurants near the hotel as they serve throughout the day. All in all, we would definitely return to this hotel if we were to visit Paris again. Pros - location (near the Eiffel Tower and the Metro, great river views.

Front desk staff is very fluent in English, didn't really pick their brains too much as I had done a good deal of research before arriving. The breakfast was around 15 euro a day, never did it as its possible to eat breakfast very cheaply in the surrounding neighborhood. Walk down Blvd Grenelle (away from the river) and you'll hit 3 bakeries before hitting the next metro station. There's a grocery store, Monoprix, one block down thats a good place to buy meats, cheese, and they have really good values on wine. As far as sit down meals, we found a nice little pocket of restaurants within walking distance by the Charles Michel Metro stop. Only other things to keep in mind, we got a lot of rain during our visit in Early Dec (obviously not the hotel's fault) Also, if you like to walk, the walks to the big Paris sites just seem a little too far from this hotel, but the Metro/RER will get you there cheaply and quickly", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "newtownabbey", "Title": "\u201cdelightful hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "rixichik", "ReviewID": "UR50813080", "Content": "I would definitely recommend this hotel, the room was small but perfectly formed and not at all cramped.

We didn't bother with the restaurant or bar in the hotel since there was so much variety within walking distance. We had a room on the 4th floor facing the station but it was surprisingly quiet when the windows were closed. There were a fair amount of cafes and small stores nearby. Further down the road there is a corner that has a bakery, a cheese shop and a cooked meats shop. We made a fun picnic out of it. Some small problems were that the TV was pretty weird, it wouldn't turn on all the time. Also, if you are used to American hotels, I'm sure you've noticed the lack of alarm clocks in European hotels. The TV served as the alarm clock, but since it wouldn't always turn on, I never trusted it. The room was also very hot (we visited in November). We turned down the heat, and even turned it off completely, but we would always have to open the window sometime in the middle of the night.

Prior to the trip I spent many many hours researching all the hotels trying to find one that could accommodate 3 to a room, was available, had good ratings and would not break the bank. Came across the Eiffel Seine and took a chance. In the end the chance paid off and had a wonderful stay at a great hotel. Pluses: * Location - Just down the street from the Eiffel Tower. Across the street was a subway entrance. Grocery store just down the street (the best route to go to try to avoid the insane Paris restaurant prices). * Hotel Itself - Clean and nice. The hotel is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. * Service - Excellent. No problems with English. Very helpful and friendly. * Room - Small, but very suitable. Clean. Good bed. Small fridge in room. No complaints. * Price - not cheap, but when you consider what you would pay elsewhere was well worth it. Side note: would definitely recommend staying in the heart of Paris and not in the suburbs. The hotel prices are cheaper in the suburbs, but you will end up paying a fortune in transportation costs and will end up wasting huge amounts of time with extra travel... * Negatives - We came in from London via the Eurostar train. We followed the directions provided by the hotel to find our way. Worked great up until we came out of the subway station (there are 2 close to the hotel - the RER and the Metro. Metro is across the street - RER is about a block away) - couldn't see signs, not sure where we were etc. Another words - we got lost for about 5 minutes and then all was good. * Only very small little things - didn't like the shower, had a few problems hooking up to the hotel wireless internet, the bathroom vanity had a few chips of wood stain out of it - that's about it... I have had the pleasure/displeasure of traveling quite a bit on business so have experienced some of the best and worst in terms of hotel experiences.

The prices were quite expensive and with the exception of a couple of waitresses, the staff were not very welcoming at any of these touristy cafes.

We booked a double room many months in advance directly with the hotel and I called the week before we left to confirm. When we checked in we were given a room on the 6th floor (no view) and told to turn in our key to the hotel clerk for security reasons whenever we left the room. The elevator was about 3 feet square so it took 2 trips to get up there. The room was unbelievably small. Since we were traveling for almost 4 weeks we had 3 suitcases (2medium and 1 carry-on size) and nowhere to put them. I also felt like I was staying in a firetrap being that high up. We immediately asked for another room. We were told there wouldn't be one available until the next day and it was a \"Superior Room\" which would cost 40 Euros a night more. We agreed, so the next morning we hauled our suitcases back down and they stored them until we returned late the next night. The new \"superior\" room was adequate in size (altho the bathroom was very small) and clean. Again, no view, altho a \"Superior\" room. The TV didn't work. The clerk from the lobby couldn't make it work either and promised to send someone the next day. It didn't work the next night either. It wasn't that important to us since we were hardly in the room but when you are paying for something you should be able to use it. There was adequate hot water with decent water pressure. No mini-fridge or coffee maker. The room was quiet, bed comfortable enough, and we slept well. Since the room was on the 3rd floor we were able to avoid using the elevator, which made me feel safer. The staff spoke very good English and they were polite. There are several restaurants and a convenience store near the hotel where the food was reasonably priced for Paris. Coffee though, is extremely expensive! We shared one cup in the morning since it was over 4 Euros with no refills! There were 2 metro stations across from the hotel, which was very convenient, but the Eiffel Tower location isn't the best. There are dozens and dozens of men who are constantly in your face trying to sell junk trinkets all around the Eiffel Tower area. (These men are also at Sacre Coeur and one even grabbed my husband by the hand!) The French police make a big show by blowing whistles and riding their bikes after them about once an hour. The men all scatter, then 60 seconds later, they all come back laughing. The Paris Police are useless.

The neighborhood of the 15th arrondissement also offered us an opportunity to see real Parisian life as we walked the streets, ate at the bistros, shopped in the stores and enjoyed the people of Paris. If you want a chain hotel and are satisfied to see the tourist attractions but not really see Paris, this is not the hotel for you. But if you want to experience Paris, ride the metro each day and live within a community with the citizens of this beautiful city, you will be more than satisfied. The staff is goes out of their way to be courteous and helpful. The service is excellent, and the price compares competitively with other hotels in the area. Walk to the Eiffel Tower each night, use the metro across the street, ride the RER at Champ du Mars and stay at this hotel. We certainly will be staying there again.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cSweet hotel, great location, friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "Eurotrip2009", "ReviewID": "UR29905310", "Content": "We stayed here for the 2nd leg of our European adventure and were pleasantly surprised.

The hotel is right next to a train station, so you could hear the groups of people screaming outside the window. Suprisingly, the trains are very quiet, but the constant car horns were a problem. Finally, the walls are very thin, so we had the privy of listening to arguments, televisions and door slams from the other rooms. The location is fantastic.

It's also just across the road from the Champ de Mars station (which has better links across Paris). It's also on the riverfront and there are a couple of guided boat tours available just across the road (for 7 Euro per adult which is great- this was probably the best touristy thing we did on the weekend).

The room was really nice and comfortable and above all CLEAN! with a HUGE bigger than double bed. There's a flat screen TV (French channels only) and the bathroom is lovely and well-designed. The shower for example was HUGE. The weather was awful (windy, cold, rainy) so we actually spent quite a bit of time (especially in the mornings) at the hotel and it was comfortable. A great base to explore Paris from but equally a nice place to chill out and enjoy yourself. The staff were friendly and very helpful (not to mention tri-lingual!). Only downside is that breakfast (available as a buffet in the dining room downstairs or in your room) is 16 Euro.

The man on reception was very efficient and polite, gave us all the information we required about our stay in perfect English. Oh, and the hotel is across the road from the Bir Hakim metro station so it is perfectly placed for exploring Paris. The Eiffel Tower is 5 minutes walk away. The lift was a little snug, could be a problem for people with a lot of luggage or mobility issues ie. a wheelchair or mobility aid. The hotel was tastefully decorated and clean. Our room was small but was perfectly acceptable for our needs. The beds were comfortable and bathroom well equipped and clean. The room looked out onto an inner courtyard and so was very peaceful, we were not aware of any noise during our stay. We could even see the top of the Eiffel Tower from the window which was a bonus especially when it was illuminted each night. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in Paris.

The rooms are well equipped with good bathrooms (good shower/lots of hot water) a tv and air con, although we couldn't reduce the temperature because it was set for winter and our rooms were a little stuffy at night. This wasn't a huge issue though and rather that than being freezing! We booked a Club room and it was an ok size, I couldn't have coped with anything smaller to be honest. The bed was huge though which was great and unlike other reviews I found the bed really comfortable. We booked on a room only basis because the breakfast was 16 euro per person which I find fairly staggering, especially when there is an abundance of fantastic patisseries on the walk down bvd. de grenelle towards the metro. We crammed a lot into our two/three days so we found it better to eat and walk at the same time and spend the money saved on breakfast on some well earned afternoon beers!

But, having spoken with others whilst in Paris this seems to be the norm, especially for European cities. Although small, the rooms have everything you need including extremely comfy beds, which were just what was needed after a long day sightseeing. The room and bathroom are very clean, facilities included fridge, safe and a hairdyer in the bathroom. No tea or coffee making facilities though, we like a nice wee cup of tea of a morning!! Breakfast was included in our room price and was good. It was light and got you started. Eating all the time in cafes is expensive, so we limited ourselves to once a day. There is a small supermarket just down the road from the hotel, we used this quite a lot. The staff were very nice, always pleasant and willing to help.

On this note, just be aware of the scams that unfortunately seem to plague tourists, the guys with the string bracelets at the funicular at Sacre Coeur, the female beggars at the Eiffel Tower and the woman who I got, who pretended to pick up a gold ring, which she claimed to have just found and when she established it was not mine, she tried to sell it to me!! Unfortuately for her, she was not that good an actress and I'm a canny Scot. Paris is a wonderful city, with interesting places to visit and beautiful gardens to sit in. Mum loved the tower, I don't like heights, but went away and her trips on the Seine. I loved Notre Dame and the Lourve. We both loved the laid back atmosphere. Finally, we would not hesitate to recommend the Eiffel Seine to anyone thinking of visiting Paris, it has everything you would need to make make your stay a pleasant one. And it is was a nice feeling when other people on our shuttle bus to the airport commented that our hotel looked lovely!!", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this Place\u201d", "Author": "JonhSP", "ReviewID": "UR19464898", "Content": "My experience at this hotel is not similar to the other rewiers.

The main thing though is that whilst you can't expect a hotel necessarily to upgrade you or give you anything for free, I had thought that when I'd told them I would be proposing that night that they would at the very least have thought to put some flowers in the room, or a little bottle of champagne, or offered complimentary breakfast - something, anyway.

It is `small but perfectly formed (puke!!!) and is very comfortable to put your head down at the end of a very busy day (take VERY comfortable shoes!!!!!) As you have previously read the Eiffel Tower is more or less just round the corner and is a short walk away. The twinkling lights come on @ 10 and 11pm (don`t know about any other times) and last for 15 minutes. Don`t miss them, it is truly spectacular, go over the road away from it, it`s a better view.

The tiny but efficient lift delivered us to our third-floor room which was equally stylish.

The double bed was large and comfortable, although with the air-conditioning switched off the duvet was a bit too warm.

The whole hotel is decorated in the style of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, with many reproductions of Gustav Klimt paintings from the same period. Combined with the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff this made for a relaxing environment and a pleasant contrast with the busy-ness of the city. Which however is easily reached. The Eiffel tower with its throngs of tourists, and the comparative calm of the Champ du Mars at its feet, is less than five minutes' walk away. Bir Hakeim metro station is immediately opposite, while the RER line C (when it is fully reopened) is also close by. River cruises (including the useful Batobus hop-on-hop-off service) are five minutes away.

The hotel is lovely and staff very friendly - all English speaking. The room was small but too be honest this was no problem what so ever, you had enough space to walk around and get ready. Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and big. There was a tv in the room (although only one English channel) and a well stocked fridge (with room for a couple of your own items although it wasn't overly expensive anyway). The hotel staff were very helpful and recommended a lovely French restaurant the one evening. Location wise, it couldn't be better - after a long day sight seeing it was great to get off the metro right outside the hotel, and it was lovely seeing the Eiffel tower every day and evening!! Also, if you turn left when leaving the hotel you will find a few bars, cafes, supermarket, restaurants and shops - we headed in that direct each morning and evening and find some lovely restuartants. The italian restaurant next to the hotel is also very nice. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but the restaurant there did look very nice, instead we went to a cafe/bar further up the same road each morning and had coffee, OJ, croissant and french bread for 8 euros each- lovely! It was also nice to walk along the River Seine which is right across the road. So to conclude - this was a great holiday and we would certainly stay at the Eiffel Seine again.

The en-suite was modern & very, very clean. Blackout curtains ensured a superb nights sleep. The iron & ironing board were located in the basement of the hotel, not \"in room\" as described, but were available to use immediately when requested. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, a clean, quiet dining room with plenty of food options. The hotel was happy to look after our luggage after check-out so that we could enjoy our day in Paris without heavy bags to carry.

I had booked a \"triple room\" that according to my booking had twin beds. Instead, I was taken to a room with only one bed. It was also on the ground floor and very dark with only one very small window beside the door. This was a bad design, because the door had a full glass in it and you had to pull drapes across the small window to cover the glass door to have privacy, so the room was then like a cave. I asked to be moved to an upper floor where the room would have some light. The lady kindly told me that she would see what else was available. Well, after waiting much time, she did not return, so I took my luggage and went back to the front desk to find that she was welcoming other folks and taking care of their needs leaving me to wait. I had prepaid when I made the reservation, so expected that my concern was not a priority. Finally, she said that she had only one other room with a window in it. She then led me to another ground floor room with the extra window. Since it was all she had, I took it. At least when I pulled the drapes over the full glass door, I still had a seperate window in the room that allowed in some outside light, which was nice. I had problems getting the A/C & Heat to work despite my best efforts. I could never get it to work, so I usually just opened the door to let some air in during the day, but then at night, the room got very cool and it would have been nice to have had heat. The room had a flatscreen TV in it, that sometime worked and sometime not. The lamp on my desk (sofa table) didn't work. As mentioned by someone in an earlier review, the walls (and ceiling) are thin because I was even awakened one morning by the sounds of the room above me. The small courtyard outside my ground floor room was nice, except that is where everyone would come to smoke and since I don't smoke, that was unpleasant to me. OK, that is the negative, but there are positives. As others have said, the location is convenient to the Seine River and just a few blocks away from the Eiffel Tower and there are a variety of cafes within an easy walking distance. I didn't use the train, but yes, the train is close by. Should you choose to give this hotel a try, I would suggest calling the hotel directly to make your reservation and perhaps on arrival, you will get the room you thought you were going to get. You might also want to request a high floor since the few rooms on the bottom floor are very dark and if you don't like smoke, and people milling about outside your room in the courtyard, you don't want the ground floor rooms. Oh, you might think this a silly thing to mention, but if you stay here, you will know what I am talking about. There is a trick to locking your door, so allow yourself some extra time and patience when you are leaving your room or entering your room and need to lock the door.

The hotel reception is very modernly decorated with a nice area to sit and a bar area. The staff are all very friendly. They will also store your luggage for you if you arrive before the 2am check in time or leave after the 11am check out time. We arrived about 11am on the Friday and they stored our luggage for us until we checked in. We weren't leaving Paris until 4pm in the afternoon on the Monday and again, they happily stored our luggage for us until then. Free use of the laptop at the bar was also a great little touch as we were able to look things up we wanted to know about Paris on the internet whilst there. Our room was on the top floor and we had a nice little balcony. The room was very clean and we have absolutely no complaints about it at all. A nice clean bathroom with toiletries provided, enough towels, etc. The hotel was also in a great location. Just a short walk away from the Eiffel tower and the metro and RER line is right across the street from the hotel. We couldn't have asked for a better location. Breakfast wasn't included in our stay, but we would have a short walk along the road in the morning and find a nice little cafe to sit outside and people watch with a croissant and hot chocolate. Lots of the cafes have seats outside and heaters too, which was nice. It was also a handy location for watching the Olympic torch through the city which happened to fall the weekend we were there (although it wasn't very successful!) The River Seine and the boat trips were also near by. The metro and RER is very handy and being so close to a stop was great. We bought a 3 day travel pass and definitely think we got out use out of it as we used the metro alot and also used a lot of buses when we travelled around so that we could see more of the city rather than travelling underground all the time. Don't be afraid to use the RER or the underground to get to and from the airport! It's very simple. From CDG (which is a horrible airport!) we got on the blue RER, line C, towards Saint-Remy and got off at Saint-Michel Notre Dame and changed onto the yellow RER, line C towards Versailles and got off at Champ de Mars Tour Eiffel. At first it can all seem confusing but after a few trips you get the hang of it and by the end of the weekend we were experts with the busses and underground!

They offered had hard boiled eggs, sausage, toast, cold cereal, fruits, cheese, salami, crossiants, pastries, coffee, tea, juice etc. It was plentiful and we enjoyed the variety. The dining are was elegant and we felt like we were in a restaurant. The location of the hotel was especially ideal due to the train strike. We loved walking everywhere, which we felt was the best way to really see Paris. I would say appromiately the following: Eiffel Tower (10min), Musee De Lourve (35 minutes), Arc De Triomphe (20 min) . Accross from the Eiffel Tower is a working Carousel and you can purchase River boat cruises on the Seine accross as well. We recommend that you arrive early in the morning to purchase the Eiffel Towere Tour Tickets. The line can take hours, we arrived by 8:30am and already a small line was starting. Keep in mind that once the ticket is purchased it must be used that same day while waiting on line. The price to the top, if I recall correctly is about $14 Euro, but well worth it. The view from the Tower is amazing. There are snack stands,souvenir shops and restrooms located on levels 1 and 2. After arriving from sightseeing we came back to a very clean and lovely room. We are especially grateful to the Housekeeping Staff for their loyalty during the train strike because our room was maintained so well during this difficult time for them. A couple of other things we found helpful about the Hotel is free use of the laptop of the laptop located in the lobby. We were able to email family, get directions and information on many of the sightseeing places. They also offer a shuttle for a fee that will bring you back to airport for a fee. However, be sure to book this upon your arrival since it can get filled quickly. The hotel is located on De Grenelle street and it was convenient for us to find a place to eat. You can walk down this street and within 10-15 minutes you will find many restaurant choices. There is a small grocery store that you can buy water and bring back snacks. Overall, we again highly recommned this Hotel. They made our stay a memorable one and we are thankful for their friendliness towards us.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambs, England", "Title": "\u201cBest thing about this Hotel is it's Location.\u201d", "Author": "PoppyTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR11268022", "Content": "I chose this Hotel from the reviews that I had read on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed with what we received.

It is directly opposite the Bir Hakkiem Metro Station (line 6) which at the time of our visit was as previously mentioned being refurbished (I believe it is due to re-open in the early spring of 2008 - either of the other 2 nearest metro stations are only 300-400 metres away). The Hotel is clean and well appointed. We had a Club Room which was adequate for our stay but may be considered small by other visitors (pay a bit more for a larger room if you are bothered). An early start is advised since breakfast can be congested in a somewhat small breakfast room. Food selection was adequate but not extensive (no cold meats). My only negative point was that we had the room directly over the entrance (room no. 105) which can be noisy of you are a light sleeper. Overall we would definitely recommend the Hotel, its location makes it perfect to see all of Paris.

I was very satisfied with my accomodation...I choose not to take my breakfeast at the hotel...to expensive for the choice of food., but there is a cafe right next door, and plenty of bakeries around where you can get a croissant or a \"pain au chocolat\" and a coffee for cheaper. This hotel location is very convenient...the Eiffel Tower is 3-minutes walk but you do not feel that you are in a very \"touristy\" place. It is calm and quiet...you can ask for a \"view to the Seine\", but it is not worth it...Better get out of your room and walk directly the little \"promenade\" along the river...(By the way, it is where I took my best pictures of the Eiffel tower illuminated by flickering lights at night...Impressive!)

We arrived at the hotel at 11am and luckily our room was vacant. The agent was very kind and provided us with maps, brochues and guides as part of her checkin conversation. Loved that! We know that our room would be small and were prepared for this and it was... very tiny but so well decorated and modern that we really did not mind. Plus we barely were in the room- we were out and about in Paris! We had Room 409. The bed had very comfortable pillows and bedding- all white and crisp. The bathroom was brand new, modern and fresh and as mentioned in other reviews- the towels were large bath towels... loved them. Good blowdryer too. The room had a small flat screen TV, a small closet, safe, telephone and internet capabilities. What I really liked is that they offered you a 800 number to make international calls without incurring hotel fees yet via your own credit card. The lobby was a small one with a sitting area, small bar yet with a laptop where one could use the internet for free. Very kind. Our room rate did not include Breakfast so I cannot comment on this.

But if you're claustrophobic (and fit) the stairs are right next to it. Once you're out of there, it's into the hallway, lit by a series of fairy lights in the ceiling that evoke the night sky, and another bunch of stronger halogen lamps that turn on as you approach. The rooms are not that big, but very tastefully furnished. Mine had a sideways view of the Seine, plus an excellent view of the Metro crossing the river into Bir Hakeim station. Trainspotters would love it. Fortunately the window is either double glazed, or the glass is thick enough to keep the street and Metro noise out at night. Another room I saw had a view into a courtyard. No street noise problems there. But there wasn't a need to keep the window open all the time as the rooms were air conditioned. A very pleasant surprise after coming from a four star London hotel with no obvious ventilation, let alone windows that open. After showering in the morning, another bonus... full sized bath towels! Not the usual sandpaper-like postage stamps you find in most hotels. The bathroom was well lit and clutter free. I only detected one broken tile. The breakfast room was well set up. Clean and well stocked. The price for breakfast is a little steep. But you can go in there and tell them you're only having a croissant and coffee. Okay, maybe a couple of croissants. And a pain-au-chocalat or two. They're delicious. Everyone's remarked on the location. It goes without saying that it's superb, both for getting around and its proximity to Paris's major tourist attraction. Just a couple of things would make the experience complete. One would be providing coffee and tea making facilities within the room. Going next door to the restaurant for a cafe creme isn't always practical.

With our Paris pass in hand (which I recomend to everyone who stays more than a couple of days), the Bir-Hakem is your connection to almost every major tourist attraction in the Paris Metro area and is also linked to the Versailles train. Although the Hotel does not have it's own restaurant (it does have a breakfast room), the two restaurants right next door offer great food at very reasonable prices. There are so many great restaurants and cafe's all over Paris finding places to eat is easy. Also just down the road from the Hotel is a supermarket which sells everything including alcohol and takeaway hot nibblies. The most unforgetable part of our trip would be just wandering around in the warm spring sunshine through beautiful streets and stopping in some wonderful cafe's for coffee or a cold beer, and the balmy warm spring nights lend themselves to strolling the boulevards and avenues and outdoor dining.

I did allot of research before booking to get the most out of my money and not have to spend much time on travel from each of the things I wanted to see, so I thought this was the perfect hotel for my wife and I. The greatest thing about this hotel is it's location. The eiffel tower is just around the corner and you can catch a bateux mouche for a seine river cruise just across from the eiffel tower. It is also literally right across the street from the Metro (line 6), which was a site for sore eyes after carrying your luggage and baby stroller around metro stations (needless to say Paris is not a wheelchair/handicapped friendly city so if you can't handle stairs just take a shuttle or taxi from place to place). Line 6 takes you right to the Arc de triumphe and easy to get to the louvre. It is also just about 2 blocks from RER line C which takes you right to Versailles( which is beautiful). I have trusted trip advisor before and they didn't let me down on this one either. However, some have said this isn't a good place to go if you have children but I thought it was fine for me, my wife, and one year old son. They had a baby crib in the room waiting for us despite saying the room was too small for it. The room was small but fit the crib and all of our luggage just fine. I thought our room was very clean and linens and towels were changed everyday. The bathroom is in a modern style so there are some quirky things to it, like not having a place to hold the hand soap around the sink, but overall just fine. There's a nice restaurant right next to the hotel that has a small take out stand/creperie if you want a late night snack, although I would stay away from the crepes there as they're pre-maid and not as good as fresh one's (per my French wife). There's a nice supermarket with a bakery in front which we ate breakfast from everyday and is allot cheaper than the hotels breakfast which we never ate.

All in all the Eiffel Seine is a LOVELY hotel. Everything is small compared to our U.S-grand scale, but for Paris standards, the room was quite spacious. Ask for a large room on the first floor , and request to face the courtyard. (The rooms facing the front face the metro station, which is literally right outside the hotel). Beware of the elevator - it's slow and tiny -- I'm clausterphobic and wouldn't even look inside it! Sara and the rest of the staff are absolutely lovely -- we voted Sara our Favorite Person in Paris -- she made reservations galore and gave us directions, all while being extremely friendly and patient with us. Spring for the extra few Euros and get the breakfast which is included - very nice little restaurant downstairs! Other good points: it's located just a few blocks from the Eiffel tower, there's an ATM right across the street, and a nice little market down the road where you can get basics for your stay. (We opted to save money buy eating food from the market for lunches and going out for nice dinners). There is also a funny little guy who makes delicious crepes on the corner right outside the hotel -- they're open quite late.
