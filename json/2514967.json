We witnessed the employees being very patient with nervous older guests who did not speak French and were strident about not being able to use the Metro, etc. I so enjoyed being greeted by everyone I encountered with a vigorous, cheerful, \"Bonjour, Madame!\" I really enjoyed the wake up calls. Sexy David woke me up with a mellifluous \"Bonjour, Madame, This is your wake up call. Have a wonderful day.\" Did this old lady a world of good. No robo calls at Hotel Le Littre.

When it was first suggested that we try Le Littre my first reaction was: who wants to be all the way out there. In the middle of nowhere! Do you know how long it would take to get back to Saint Germain or the Musee D\u2019Orsay? Well, it is not in the middle of no- where; it is in the midst of a vibrant part of Paris that used to be home to Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Satre, Chagall, Picasso and Man Ray. Nestled on a small street steps from teeming Blvd. Montparnasse and the Montparnasse train station; surrounded by many great bistros and brasseries, and convenient to stops of the 4 Paris-Metro lines this is a Parisian keeper. It is about a 20 minute walk from the heart of Saint Germain and half that from the Luxembourg Gardens The rooms for Paris are big; it was converted after WW II to house U.S. Air force staff. The staff is friendly, the service good, the breakfast included and plentiful, but it is the terraces and view of the Eiffel tower on the top two floor of the hotel that make this place so very special. We stayed in 801, which is access by a special key to the elevator, making the eighth floor feel safe and secluded. The suite had big rooms, fireplaces and a big terrace that could be accessed from both the living room and the bed room. The furnishings were would one would expect from a hotel in Paris of this class but sitting on the terrace, any time of day or night gazing at the Eiffel Tower, beautiful in the day and exquisite with its new lighting at night made this hotel and this suite one of special memories. Totally there are about 8 rooms with views and terraces. After 3 nights we moved to the elegant Georges V with its superb appointments and service, but frankly despite all the fabulous food, d\u00e9cor and service we missed the Le Littre and its view and bustling surroundings.

He always responded immediately to our email requests and went the extra mile in terms of service. On arrival, Thomas had pre-checked us in as far as he was able, and allowed us to complete and return the registration form in our own time. This meant we were checking in to our rooms within a couple of minutes of arrival. This typically Parisian hotel is superbly located: 2 mins walk from Montparnasse RER/Metro and all the bars and many restaurants/bistros that line the Boulevard du Montparnasse and St Germain de Pres. 10 mins walk from the charming bohemian Latin Quarter, the Sorbonne and Notre Dame Cathedral. Bus stops at the top of the road which will take you to all the sights in Paris. Because the hotel is situated at the bottom end of a very quiet one way street, there was no noise at all during the evening and night. You would not think that you were in the middle of a city bustling with activity 24/7. We reserved Superior Rooms with external balconies ( well worth the extra money) which overlooked the rooftops of Paris, with a bird's eye view of the Eiffel Tower - stunning when lit up with thousands of twinkling lights when dusk falls. The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated and the bathroom large and well maintained and equipped with toiletries. We ordered continental breakfast in the room, which arrived within 10 minutes, and was served on our balcony in the glorious sunshine - what a treat! We also experienced breakfast in the restaurant where they served everything you could want : bacon sausage eggs etc ; variety of breads; yoghurt; fresh fruit; deli meats and cheeses, juices and choice of hot drinks. The waiters ( Mahommed and his colleagues) were constantly cracking jokes with customers and were eager to serve you. The bar man was also very polite and accommodating to our party.

We loved that the window's french doors opened for fresh air. Because we were facing a courtyard, there was very little street noise. Every maginable service was nearby. A tiny grocery was 3 doors away where we purchased fruit, bottled water, snacks, wine & beer. There were at least 3 bakeries, a bank & ATM, a post office, local buses, the tourist hop-on hop-off bus, the metro, several bars and restaurants all within 2-3 blocks. We ate at a different restaurant every night. We travelled all over Paris and had no trouble getting back to the hotel in a reasonable time & low cost. Even taxis shared between 3 or more people are very reasonable. Shopping options were too numerous to mention. On our first night , the Solstice Music Festival was on and you could hear the combined voices of singing groups and the sound of strolling musicians well into the night. It was quite magical. The singing ended when rain started to fall in earnest . I imagine that they all just stolled into whatever restaurant they happened to be near and continued...there are certainly dozens of bars & bistros nearby to choose from. The hotel front desk staff were friendly and helpful; most spoke reasonably good English. We received excellent advise about what to see and how best to get there. The hotel provides a helpful events calendar for the week which is produced in several language. Bus/metro tickets were available for purchase at the desk and we were also able to book tours, taxi's and airport transfers. The maids kept everything spotless in the rooms & common areas of hotel. If you want extra towels, glasses etc, it helps to know a little French. When booking the triple room, we were required to purchase a very expensive buffet breakfast option. At first I was a little annoyed but it turned out to be ideal for us. We were out all day site-seeing and really needed a hearty breakfast. Also, two of us are diabetic & having a balanced meal (not too high in refined carbs which seems to be the French norm) is essential. When I looked at the cost of the room (divided by 3) and added the cost of breakfast, I realized that I still paying a very reasonable price for a well located, lovely accommodation in Paris. The breakfast room is on the lower level and serves both hot & cold options. The food choices were basic. eg Eggs, sausage, potatoes, cereal, fruit juice, fruit salad, whole fruit, yogurt, dried fruit & nuts, great local cheeses, sliced meats, baggette, brioche, whole grain bread ( a rarity in Paris), pastries...it really was a more than adequate selection. Plus, we were able to take a piece of fruit or a little sandwich for mid-morning (a diabetic necessity). What I loved was the large individual pots of hot, strong coffee and seperate pots of hot milk (which they would refill). I felt well fed and well-caffeinated to face the day. If you are not a big breakfast eater and have a room that doesn't require you to pay for breakfast, there are numerous bakeries withiin a couple of blocks, a Starbucks, even a McDonalds....so you can definitely eat cheaper at breakfast time.

Breakfast in the mornings was lovely also and had a wide variety to choose from. Wifi was available down in the lobby and with McDonalds just down the st and the metro, this hotel was in the perfect location. The Rue De Rennes was the street beside which, when followed and take a left on the St Germain de Pres was just a 20 min walk and you were at the Louvre, we walked this often and were in the centre of paris in no time! Finally one thing that i found particularly helpful was booking taxis to the airport. We had to reconfirm our holiday taxi booking, as i couldn't speak great french it was difficult, so i simply asked at reception and they arranged everything while i was away and left the reconfirmation on our bed! This was soo helpful, otherwise we would have probably tried to take the metro to the airport and leave our already paid for taxi! Note: be careful when you put the \"Do Not Disturb\" Sign on the door the maids don't neccessarily pay any heed to this, your bed will be made and towels changed. Also if your in the room they may also come on in. We were ok with it, but at home when you put the do not disturb sign on the door, the room is left.

I know it was a crazy thing to take a lot of women to Paris but I just look for a peaceful life. Earplugs were found to be very useful on this occasion. We were very happy with the Littre during both visits. Breakfast was excellent with a wide range of food to choose from although a word of warning.

On the other hand and unlike a lot of hotels, the bar prices were reasonable and we were more than happy to take advantage. The location of the hotel is within an easy five minute walk from Montparnasse Metro station which allowed us to visit a wide range of sites in Paris. The Littre\u2019s staff were very helpful and our rooms (at the front of the hotel in 2004 and at the back of the hotel in 2010) were more than acceptable for those people who look for a bit of quality without paying prices that make your eyes water and your wallet scream. On both occasions, our rooms were quiet and we slept the sleep of the contented. There are also a number of excellent restaurants to choose from within easy walking distance of the hotel.

The front desk staff were somewhat aloof, but who cares when there is all of paris to explore and the hotel is so well situtated. The metro took us everywhere we wanted to go, and there was a metro station right around the corner. The hotel is located in Mont Parnasse which is full of cafes, restaurants, boutiques and even a cinema. There's also a shopping plaza with lafayette galleries that's a 2 minute walk. We always felt comfortable walking around at night because the streets were always alive with people. Make sure you walk around the area because there are 2 street nearby that seem devoted to restaurants that serve crepes. we indulged one evening with dinner and dessert crepes and it was a gastronomical highlight. One tip - if the front desk folks tell you that breakfast is included be careful, especially if you did not book a room and breakfast ahead of time. It's included all right - but you pay extra (a princely sum of 40 euros a day). And if they insist on telling you it is included then make sure to ask if its included in the price you booked at.

We made it only with one minute to spare, and then only by running up stairs with heavy bags (the escalator was broken).

We had the standard room #610 which was located opposite the main street. It was quiet compared to the incredible street noise known in Paris. Even though it was right beside the elevator, we were never bothered by hallway noise etc. PROS: Close walk to Metro, cafe's and great shopping. Prices were cheaper in this area and increased as you got closer to the busier more popular intersections. We walked to the Latin Quarter and the Seine River almost daily, but the 1.70 Euro it costs to take the metro is worth it if you don't want all the walking. The room itself was clean, bathroom looked renovated within the year, with lots of hot water and excellent water pressure. Toiletries were provided and replenished daily, as was the towels. The room was very large compared to European standards, with open Juliette windows , small tv, mini bar, bath robes, safe etc. We used the mini bar to keep our cheese and snacks in. The day staff were very pleasant and helpful but the night staff were not as friendly. I have to give them credit, this was a surprise trip from my husband, and the hotel left cookies, a tote bag and a bottle of Evian in our room as a gift for our anniversary. That was a lovely surprise! CONS: The mattresses. When you are paying to stay in a hotel, you're really paying for a clean, comfortable place to sleep. The mattresses were old and we kept waking up with our arms numb. Not the best scenario when on holidays. I hope this is their next step in renovations because I'd love to go back once they change the beds. Internet: It costs 5.00 Euro a day to use the internet. A little steep we thought. There is an internet cafe across the street for about 1.50 Euro's. The hotel has two computers only and if someone else is on, you could have a very long wait. OTHER INFO: When traveling from the airport, forget about booking a shuttle through the hotel, its so expensive. We found Paris Shuttle on line and went for it. You call a toll free number from the terminal-while waiting for luggage- and it only cost us 18 Euro per person for one way. When we came out to find him, he was already there! When we tried to book our return trip to the airport (CDG), they were booked up. I'd definitely go with them again. I've also used Grey Shuttle, but they're more expensive, but also reliable. There is a breakfast at the hotel for 20 Euros per person. We never went because we loved walking to the surrounding cafe's. You can find eggs and whatever for around 4.00/6.00 Euro's in most cafe's. Totally worth the fun adventuring. The big cafe's are sometimes more pricey, but you can find coffee for 3.00 Euro's on one side of the street and it will be 6.00 Euro's directly across the street! BTW the coffee is out of this world! Evenings: go buy a bottle of wine, some cheese etc and take your picnic to the Seine in the evenings. People sit down all along the river and freely eat and drink and watch the sun go down. This was one of the most memorable and fun things we did as a couple. Belgium is only a 1 hour 20 min ride on the Thalys train. We found some good deals on the internet and spent a day in Brussels. We enjoyed Belgium waffles, amazing shopping and chocolates. Cost us about 130 Euro's return fare. Totally worth it! Ladies: try checking out the French lingerie stores! The prices are at least 35-45% less then the brand name, luxury items in the west. Also, the shoe shopping is great because all the shoes are leather and the prices were reasonable. Try Bocage for designer shoes at 100 Euros or less!

Bathroom was spotless, it looked very new. Good size bath tub with flat bottom, (easy to shower in). Bed linen crisp and luxurious. Our room had a large balcony with table and chairs and had good views over the area and of the Eifell Tower. It is a side street so were not bothered by noise. There was a fruit shop, bakery, small pub/bar, mini supermarket, and a couple of cafes all within a few metres. Just around the corner loads of cafes and restaurants. Very convienient and lots of choices. The breakfast was buffet style and was included in our room rate, mainly continental but satisfying. Staff were great, friendly and spoke good english. Helped us with choosing a few tours and organized transfer to airport. Free wireless internet in the lobby and also a computers available for internet use in their internet room if you do not have your own. As with most of Paris, parking was a issue in the area, we took up their parking option for 1 night until we returned our hire car the next day. You do not need a car in this area...just a few metres from main road with metro and buslines. It took us months of checking and researching before settling on this hotel.

The hotel is situated on a quiet street but close (5 minute walk) to a major metro station (Montparnasse-Bienvenue) which means you can go anywhere in Paris in a cinch.

OK, you won't get creches or children's play activities (although the hotel can arrange baby-sitting for you) but we found it perfect for our needs. The room (508) was enormous, one of the biggest I've ever stayed in. The air-conditioning was working perfectly (hooray!) and was quiet (hooray again!). There was no cot in the room for the baby, but one was brought immediately upon request (a proper wooden one, as well) and there was still tons of space in the room. My 5-year-old was delighted to have a huge sofa bed all to himself, and our bed was very big too. The decor could use a little sprucing up, yes, but I don't judge a room just on its style. The main thing is that it was clean and so was the excellent bathroom. Only one criticism: the shower had a small head and an inadequate screen. The boys were delighted that they could have a bath, but I could have done with more shower space. The multilingual staff were extremely helpful (one concierge insisted on speaking to me in English even while I was talking to him in French!). The breakfast staff varied from charming to aloof (but I think the aloof ones were just shy), and the buffet was almost as good as a Scandinavian hotel (and that's high praise). Yes, it's expensive but get there early and fill up for the morning. The street is mostly quiet (the bin collection is daily before 7am, and it will wake you - so it's a good job breakfast starts at seven!). The metro is literally around the corner (the metro station is Montparnasse-Bienvenue - the exit nearest the hotel is exit 8 (Rennes) - if you can't find it, head for exit 5 and follow the signs). Rue du Cherche Midi on one side is good for bistros, and rue de Rennes on the other side is great for shopping.

The beds weren't very comfortable, and the pillows were flat.. But honestly, after a long day of walking around Paris, I couldn't care less. WATCH OUT FOR THE BREAKFAST BUFFET. It appears complimentary, because you literally just walk up and sit down. Someone eventually casually walks by and asks for your room number, and the next thing you know, 20EUROS per guest gets added to your bill. There's no notice, no warning, no sign.. The breakfast WAS good, though. But just be AWARE that you're paying for it. Considering breakfast AKA petit dejeuner is about 8EUROS for a coffee, orange juice and a measly croissant at nearby bistros, I suppose paying 20EUROS for all you can eat is worth it. They had a spread with bacon, eggs, fruit, cereal, cheeses, meats.. All good things. The location was GREAT. Montparnasse metro can be confusing, so just make sure you exit the right way. DEFINITELY get a Navigo pass. SO useful. The Littre bakery next door is AMAZING. We showed up a few minutes before closing to pick up crossaints, and when we got back to the hotel we noticed that they tossed in TONS of extra goodies, including chocolatines. Mmmm! Also the Brioche Doree right at the corner has these killer Mango Lemon Granitas.. I consumed many. What else, what else.. The internet situation was definitely NOT ideal. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby (or as they say, le wiffy), which is decent. You can sit on the sofa or chairs and plan your next day in Paris. The internet available to the rooms is 20EUROS per day and you have to give them 50EUROS for a cable.. Don't bother trying to mooch Wi-Fi from surrounding networks, I tried the entire trip. If you didn't bring a laptop, don't even bother. The computers available to guests are ancient, they are DELLs, and they are ridiculously slow. Also, Europeans have a different keyboard layout, which makes it difficult to use. The TV is small, but you didn't (hopefully) come to Paris to watch TV, so who cares? There's only a handful of french channels, which I found surprising, and one english channel which was CNN. Overall, it's a decent hotel. The staff was friendly, but sometimes a little snooty.

The staff was very nice and very accomodating. In terms of food, we never at at the Hotel but there was a great bistro at the corner and we loved 1900 Montparnasse which was our absolute favorite restaurant in Paris.

Numerous ratings I read suggested this hotel had many issues which could taint our visit. While I realize reviews can be tainted based on a negative experience, I am happy to report our stay with the Littre was A+. Allow me to expand.... Pro's: - Wakeup calls 3/3 - Great cleanliness of room - Large bathrooms - Comfortable Queen Bed (medium to firm) - Flatscreen TV with several English News Channels (for the rainy days) - Helpfulness of the staff (contacting and setting up: Tours, Paris Shuttle Service, answering Q&A's) - Location of the Hotel is a bonus (McDonalds at end of block, Metro close, Lafayette Mall, many restaurants close by, grocery markets) - Politeness of cleaning staff Cons: - Issue with Hot and Cold temps of shower early in morning. Check the temp of water first before stepping into shower. In wraps..... This hotel is close to everything. We walked to most attractions in 20-30min. The Metro was an added bonus for the 1-2 drizzling days we experienced, or for trips farther out. Misc Items unrelated to hotel.... Although the Eiffel tower level 3 (top) was closed for repairs, this attraction is amazing. It is also a stones throw from all other attractions. I highly suggest you take a good pair of walking shoes for the Louvre Museum. We spent 8hrs at a brisk pace and saw roughly 90% of the museum. BTW, skip the 6euro headsets unless you have loads of patience to operate the device and walk at a snails pace. Lastly, I highly recommend the D-Day Normandy trips to all those history buff's. The trip was splendid, great lunch, professional staff. This trip also allowed us to see a good portion of France's countryside in one day.

SEE it both in the day and at night. the tower sparkles for 5 minutes every hour on the hour, really pretty, and the little gift shop on quai branley to the right of the tower before going over the bridge has really good prices for souviners. check there before you buy anything from hte street guys ,so you don't kick your self for over paying.

There is a larger one on Monteparnesse. It's one stop shopping..food, wine and toiletries at a reasonable price. The staff at the hotel are excellent. We were greeted by very helpful front desk staff. Upon our arrival they gave a map so we could map out our excursions the night before. They told us how to get our train tickets. They also told us about double decker tour bus. We decided to buy the 2 day pass. It was a great way to get the lay of the land. After that we were good to go on our own. The breakfasts were great. There is something for everyone!! No excuses for starving!! it definitely fueled us up for our day outings. I suggest bringing a good pair of walking shoes. We were exhausted everynight from our excursions. The bathroom is amazing. My husband loved the shower and I loved the deep bathtub. The water pressure is excellent. I was also happy that we had a fridge in our room. We bought water and wine everyday. It was wonderful having a chilled glass of wine upon our return to our room. If you want ice..you have to go down to the bar. The only problem we could find is the main elevator. It is very tight fit. We were luckily located on the rightside of the hotel..It is a little larger and it takes you directly to the dining room. The main elevator only takes you to the main floor and you have to walk down the stairs. We were able to print off our boarding passes before leaving the hotel. All and All Paris was amazing. Most everyone speaks english. They are happy when you try to speak French..even it's a mix of English and French. It is a fantastic place to visit!!

We were a party of 9 (booked three rooms) so getting accomidations/reservations for a party this size is not always an easy task. We were very pleasantly surprised with the size and cleanliness of the rooms. Two of our rooms ended up being like a mini suite in that the hall accessing the two adjoining rooms had its own door (showing both room numbers). We frequently used it in this fashion. Bathrooms were very large. The only plumbing problem we had was that the tub in one room would not hold the water in (solved this by using a cup over the drain). Fresh towels and toilettries were brought in everyday (although had to get used to using no washclothes...I guess thats usual in Europe). Air-conditioning was a godsend especially after a long day in the city. It made sleeping at night much more tolerable. Front desk staff I found very helpful. They all are fluent in English and I'm grateful for that fact. Francois and others tolerated my feeble attempt at French. Location of the Hotel is off a very busy intersection. Though because it is on a side street one didn't hear much noise from street traffic. Metro is very close by. Also located on Rue Littre are a Boulangrie (very tasty pastries), Meat market, fruit stand and post office. We didn't find out though until 3 days before we left that a mini market (Le Marche Franprix) was located around the corner on the same block. We had previously walked to the Monoprix market a quarter of a mile away for drinks nad groceries (and one has to transverse 5 crosswalks dodging traffic to get to it). Breakfast was a nice treat that we all looked forward to every morning. The staff were very friendly. Cavatti (sp?) and Louisa were always very attentive. The cafe au lait was eagerly anticipated each morning. Along with the tasty croissants and pain du chocolate. Although I agree it got a little mundane after a week of having the same items. I went to having Granola and yogurt the last two days. Quality was always very good though. Other items to be noted: Internet is available in the computer room for a small fee per each day of use (three computers). This was nice since no laptop was brought. Laundry service is pricey...so we brought detergent to wash 1-2 days worth of clothing in the tub/sink. There is a coin op Lavarie about a 10 minute walk away. 1e for 9 min dry time.

Way too much milk and a bit undercooked. The front desk was quite helpful in recommending local restaurants and transit to the major attractions. However, they did lack some knowledge when I inquired on where to buy the RER/Versailles combo pass that I read about in Rick Steve's travel book. The rooms were quite clean and odourless even though I was in a smoking room. However, sometimes I could smell smoke coming in through some of the vents. The only other complaint I had is the shower. It was very very slow to drain. I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well. The hotel is definitely not handicap/people with limited mobility friendly but then again neither is Paris.

Why we chose this location? We wanted a centralized location so we could walk to the sites and after looking at a ton of hotels, this one looked the best and one where we could get a decent deal with through our travel agent. Hotel is down a very quaint street and we always felt safe walking around no matter what time of day it was. Check-in was very painless and the people behind the front desk were ALWAYS nice and very helpful!! We apparently got upgraded for some reason, but who was I to argue. We took the lift to our room, 510. I believe it was 510 it was right off of the elevator to the left. I was worried being so close to the elevator, but this hotel was always so quiet. Very decent size to our room and the bathroom was also very decent. Both the room and bathroom were clean. The view from our room was a courtyard \u2013 it just overlooked the other windows of the other rooms of the hotel. We figured that the ceiling of the dining area was what we saw when we looked down on the ground. It wasn\u2019t the most scenic of views, but we were out of the room during most of the daylight hours so it never truly bothered us. Safe & fridge worked. The thermostat in our room didn\u2019t work though. We never thought to call, not exactly sure why, we just didn\u2019t. We opened our window to air out the room when we were in the room and even slept with the window opened a bit as it would have gotten too warm. The outside temperature never really got that warm so I guess with the chill in the air and the warm air flowing, it was just fine. Breakfast was served each morning and it was part of our package. It was, OK. I more or less stuck to cereal or croissants with some jelly or cheese. The prepared eggs were a bit too runny for me so I opted for cheese to sustain me. There were also bread selections, yogurt, breakfast meats (sausage & bacon), juices, coffee, etc. The staff always greeted you with a smile and were quick to bring you coffee. I don\u2019t know if I would pay again for the breakfast, but it was a good clutch to have to grab something quick on your way out the door. Location \u2013 for us it was a very decent location. It was about \u00bd hour walk in one direction for the Louvre and Notre Dame and then about 30-40 minutes in the other direction for the Eiffel Tower. Plenty of restaurants right up the block and up and down the street. Thankfully the hotel was down a small side street as the main street right nearby could have been an issue with the noise. But like I said, this hotel was always very quiet, we didn\u2019t have one issue. The hotel bar was always empty and the front desk clerk would come in to serve you if you wanted something from the bar. The pictures that were hung up were of what the hotel was like \u201cback in the day\u201d, that was so cool. I cannot comment on the metro since we chose to walk everywhere. We did have one small issue - we left the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on our door. It was our last full day so my husband and I figured that we wouldn\u2019t bother with them making our bed, changing our towels, etc. When we returned later on that day we walked in to find that our room was in fact cleaned. I mentioned it to the girl at the desk and she said that she was doing housekeeping that day and called our room and since there was no answer she thought we left the sign on the door in error and came in to clean. Thankfully we didn\u2019t leave out anything of value or of importance, but to me if I put the do not disturb sign up I would want them to stay out of my room. Live and learn and maybe tell the front desk to let the staff know to not clean the room. In the end it wasn\u2019t a big deal, she apologized, and we moved on. On our last day we inquired about a taxi for our trip to the airport. They suggested a car service they work with so we opted for that thinking it was more reliable than some random taxi. We left plenty of time to get us to the airport and thank goodness since our car was about \u00bd hour late. Overall, this hotel was really great.

He booked the hotel as part of a package with Eurostar and I have to say I was very pleased! The hotel was incredibly easy to find, just one Metro ride from Gare du Nord which was good as we had our luggage with us, and when we surfaced in Montparnasse it only took a minute to get our bearings and work out where the hotel was. It was down the pretty quiet street Rue Littre which had a large post office on the corner and a couple of little eateries on the way down to the hotel. I think there was also a school at the end of the road although I can't be sure. The reception to the hotel is gorgeous and we were given an extremely warm welcome by the reception staff who checked us in quickly and also offered us a map of the city along with some brochures. We were on the 6th floor so were very pleased for a lift. Our room was lovely, a decent size, clean and very comfortable. When we unpacked we discovered a problem with the safe in that it didn't work properly but after speaking to reception we headed out for the afternoon and by the time we came back it was either fixed or replaced! While we were there my boyfriend was taken unwell so we ended up spending an entire afternoon in the hotel. I ordered some room service in the evening as I was starving but my boyfriend was not well enough to go out - the food wasn't too bad, I had a curry and he attempted some soup with little success. The bread was lovely although I was so disappointed that we weren't provided with milk for our tea and coffee. It seems in France you have to ask for milk if you want it! We also had problems with our television in that the 3 English speaking channels all froze and never seemed to come back - obviously I wasn't too bothered on the days where we were doing something but when we had to spend the afternoon in the hotel I would have liked to have something other than my book (which I finished that afternoon!).

I booked a deal through an hotel packager based in London (via the Internet) where I paid for three nights and received the fourth night free. I knew that I would get the most basic room. I had read other reviews that said that the hotel offered an upgrade if one was available. Most likely since I was getting a free night anyway, they were less willing to do that. Once I saw the basic room, I called the front desk right away to see if an upgrade was available. They offered me one for 50 additional euros a night, which I gladly paid when I saw the difference in rooms. The standard room was on the fifth floor and faced a bleak courtyard. My upgraded room was on the third floor. (I could walk upstairs to it and didn't have to use the small elevator.) The room had an entryway with a walk-in closet containing a safe to one side and on the opposite side of the entryway was a bathroom with just the toilet. Then you walk through French doors into the main living area which had a couch that folded into a bed, cocktail table, end tables, desk, bed, TV and two windows facing the street. The marble bathroom, (sink, tub) window, complete with bathrobes, was off of that. I thought this was quite a deal, because my four-for-three deal came with the 20 euro breakfast. The breakfast at the hotel is big -- about everything you could want. If you stay here, please greet the breakfast wait staff with a \"bon jour.\" They appreciate just a simple acknowledgement. I saw people come down to the breakfast room, ignore the staff and just start filling up their plates. The location of the hotel is great. The bus just at the corner will take you right to the Louvre's front door. St. Sulpice Church is only a couple of bus stops away. Really, if you get a transportation pass while you are in Paris you can go anywhere. I bought mine right away and never had to worry about coming up with money when I took a subway or a bus. This hotel is also right on a couple of major subways. It's very easy to get around. I liked the bus best. (TIP: If you attend a concert at the Musee d' Orsay, you can exit right into the museum without waiting in line or paying an extra fee.) The front desk people were very, very friendly. As mentioned, greetings are important. If you don't want to learn any French, just learn how to say \"Do you speak English?\" The French appreciate your acknowledgement that you are in a country where English is not the first language. That courtesy will get you far and make people feel good at the same time. The shops up and down the main street by the hotel have good prices, and Bon Marche is pretty close by, though I found it very expensive. If you want to stock up on things for your room (like wine and chocolate) turn right and then right again when you exit the hotel's front door and you will find a small grocery store down a couple of blocks. I would recommend this hotel highly for being friendly, clean, pleasant, safe (I was there by myself), a good value and in a great location. Probably the only thing that I didn't like was the hand-held shower device (which is pretty standard in Europe) and the hair dryer. The latter looks and acts like an attachment to a cannister vacuum cleaner! Vive le difference! When I come back to Paris, I will stay in the Marais district next time. It has so much character, you think you are on a movie set. However, Hotel Littre is in Montparnasse, the stomping grounds of the Lost Generation, and it was fun to explore this area of Paris.

I\u2019m not making a joke or inviting others to joke, but simply wishing to pass along an experience so others won\u2019t be surprised. I don\u2019t know if this condition was limited to room 605 or simply one of those Parisian oddities. What I discovered was a small vent on the floor next to the bathtub, which if I kept covered, seemed to eliminate the problem. Since the problem was inconsistent, manageable and never existed in the room itself, I never complained; really didn\u2019t want to repack in order to change rooms as I was tired after an already 10 day stay on the Right Bank. Nonetheless, a silly little experience. I did complain about all three English language stations being out, Friday 2/15 until 2/19 since I missed my daily political/news fix. I accepted the explanation that this matter rested with the provider, not the hotel. Internet available in Lobby for 5 Euro a day but they seem to be a little generous about this as it only appeared on my bill 2/6 days. Overall, I would certainly consider returning; however, if you haven\u2019t been to Paris and don\u2019t like to get about on the Metro, I would suggest something more central to the main sites on the Right Bank. A Big Tip: Allow plenty of time to get to CDG, at least two hours, three if you don\u2019t want to be fretting about missing your flight while caught in traffic. I\u2019ve never had problems until this trip, most times only an hour. Obviously I had been foolish, but lucky. Arranged transport through the hotel set fee of 59 Euro, Taxis about 50 Euro without traffic problems.

TIP - If you are travelling to Paris via a flight i would recommend using the metro as it is way cheaper than the taxi and only takes about an hour max. Taxi - approx 45 euros whereas Metro - 8 euros per person. On arrival we were welcomed with friendly receptionist staff. We were also given the option of choosing between 2 rooms - one on the 3rd floor and on the 7th. The one on the 7th floor had been recently refurbished and had a balacony you could sit on and look over to the Eiffel Tower but other than that the views were not the best. We then made our way down to the 3rd floor and although the rooms were not as modern they were more spacious. The new modern room was available but of course at a premium price of 60 euros per night. We werent going to spend a lot of time there so we decided to go for the one originally booked. The beds were comfy, the bathroom clean and there was plenty of space. The breakfast staff were very efficient and helpful but had the same buffet selection each morning. The staff were helpful when we were inquiring about some excursions. There was an open tour bus stop 5 minutes down the road which was helpful. For our trip to Disneyland we used the metro and there was a station just down the road too. Location wise you cant go too wrong - bus, metro, shops, food, cinema, bistros are all within walking distance However, we did have a few bad experiences - the cold tap in the bathroom made a funny noise when it was turned on and sounded as though the whole room was going to cave in.

The Hotel is in a good location, just far enough out of everything that it isnt packed but in good walking distance to all the sites. We didnt use the Metro or RER often and chose to walk to all the sites, we estimated we had walked approximately 10-15 miles per day but it was lovely just strolling around and taking it all in.

My wife and I stayed here for 8 days in the fall of '07 and had NO complaints whatsoever. A solid four stars. The rooms are large, well-appointed. The bathrooms are huge with strong hot shower and big deep tub. We paid a small upgrade for the second-tier of room qualities (there are some sort of suites available on the top floor which are the best rooms on the property I believe)... I would recommend this for the extra space and the separate Living Room. The only thing you should be warned about are the pictures of terraces and Eiffel Tower views- both of these are only features of the top floor suites. Every other room, as far as we could see, would look out on the tiny narrow Rue Littre, or a garden courtyard behind the hotel. (Big deal, you're in Paris, even the alleys look better than at home) Perfect Location. A three minute walk past all kinds of shops and patisseries and breakfast grabbage places to one of the best Metro stations in the city... several lines available, and you should be able to get most places in the city with No or One Transfer between Metro Lines. Be Warned... the station is a maze and you could easily spend twenty minutes trekking to your line or trying to find the best exit to the street. Everything awesome about the 6th (your neighbourhood, as all hoods are numbered in an outward spiral from the city centre) is within walking distance of this hotel. Included Breakfast was substantial and perfect for fuelling up for a long day walking the city. Staff were helpful, if a little Euro-distant, making good recommendations for restaurants, handling airport limo confirmations, even sending my wife to the right place for a billion-dollar haircut (COST a million, LOOKED like a billion). The bartender in the hotel lounge (closed at midnight) was friendly and equally helpful. Maid service was thorough and conscientious. IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK ANY FRENCH make sure you begin your conversations with the staff (and all Parisians, really) by politely asking if they speak English and if they would mind speaking with you in this language. I've seen reviews decrying the staff for rudeness, but by our observations while we were there, it is highly possible that people brought some cold or abrupt treatment on themselves by assuming that everyone they met was ready or able to speak in (North) American English. France is a courtesy culture and if you don't have any courtesy to give out, you ought not to be surprised if you don't receive any back. Internet access is available for a small charge in the lobby. Be prepared to use a french keyboard that is ALMOST but just frustratingly not quite the same as a QWERTY keyboard. A perfect, perfectly romantic place to make your homebase as you visit Paris.

They gladly made reservations for the shows we wanted to see, and gave us information on getting to Versailles, among other attractions.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cTravel Agent Approved\u201d", "Author": "PaulFoleyTravel", "ReviewID": "UR7380162", "Content": "Excellent value for the property - I was very comfortable during my stay, toured the hotel with the sales manager, and enjoyed both the bar and the breakfast buffet in the mornings with my colleagues.

We booked the trip (air + hotel) through France Vacations and their rep recommended the hotel. We liked the price for a 4-star as well as the location and we were not disappointed. We had a spacious (for Paris) room with two twin beds, the configuration we requested. We also had a spacious bathroom with a full tub, pedestal sink and lighted mirrors, and of course the usual toilet and bidet. The room had a walk-in closet with wood paneling - - it was kind of dark in there and hard to see things, but lovely none the less. The location is great. It's an easy walk to Left Bank shopping, There are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel. Breakfast in the hotel is a great buffet with lots of choices. The hotel staff were very helpful. A few weeks before our trip, I emailed the hotel a page full of restaurant reservation requests and they took care of making all the reservations for me, then emailed me back to confirm. So much easier than contacting all the restaurants myself! One small disappointment: the bar was closed the entire duration of our trip. We peeked in the windows and it looked like exactly the kind of place we would have liked to rest with a drink in the late afternoon. A small flaw, though, in an otherwise very pleasant stay. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cOK but not 4*\u201d", "Author": "Hertshopeful", "ReviewID": "UR6820840", "Content": "We booked this hotel on the basis of prior reviews. I can only give this hotel an average mark as it was disappointing. When I book 4* and pay for 4*, I expect 4*. What I got was a good 3*. If you can get a deal on the room rate, then this might be acceptable. The rooms were small but clean. The bathroom was large, clean and quite well equipped (no bathrobes as previously mentioned). The biggest problem was that despite turning off the radiator and turning up the air con, our room resembled a sauna. We slept under a sheet with the window open in February!! Also we had booked a double room (it was valentines week after all!) and we got two twin beds pushed together, but with their own bed linen. Thanks to a previous reviewer we knew about the great views from the Monparnasse Tower - which were as expected, spectacular. The area is akin to Leicester Square/Oxford Street in London, in that it is close to cinemas, restaurants that don't really mind if you don't go back and high street shops. There also seemed an amazing amount of American business people in the lounge area on their laptops at all times of the day. One day there was even a mini conference going on in an area no more than 12ft x 15ft. This lounge area is actually a euphemism - it was an area aside from the reception where you walked through to get to the bar in one direction and the lifts to the rooms in the other. Another example of the reason this hotel should not be classed as 4*. I could not really recommend this to a friend, unless they really had to be within a stone's throw of Monparnasse.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5359554", "Content": "We stayed there for three nights from June 10th through June 13th.

The bathroom is spotless. The weather was hot during our visit and the AC didn't feel like it was running sometimes.

We found the location ideal for access to the metro and one day we walked up to Rodin Museum, which wasn't too far.
