There was occasional traffic noise, and the passing emergency vehicle...and from my room I noticed a small homeless encampment. Security was pretty decent for the building, so I wasn't too worried about the location. The staff (I'm assuming that it was the owner and his wife) were polite and pleasant, if not overly friendly. The amenities were certainly adequate. The room had a micro fridge, which came in handy for me. The TV was an older tube type (with a taped-together universal remote). The towels were really basic cheapo motel style, but still liveable. The bed had a plastic mattress pad, but it wasn't uncomfortable. The complimentary \"breakfast\" consisted of a couple of cellophane-wrapped danish, a couple packs of crackers, a few pieces of fruit (all bananas one day, all apples the next), some coffee, and a sort of Tang-like drink passing off as orange juice. I agree with the comments about the smell. I noticed the curry-ish smell right away, and it would come and go at different times.

The only blemish was that the walk-in closet space door would not completely latch but it was not a problem. The fridge and microwave worked fine. The bathroom looked like it was newly renovated. The paint was in great shape, the shower (no tub) was large, and the ceramic tile job was still in excellent shape. The Wi-Fi performed fine, though, I did not try to stream video. We walked less than 10 minutes to eat on 1st Street and continued an additional 5 minutes to the Sun's game at US Airways Center. While the motel is just outside of what would look like \"downtown blocks\", we felt very safe walking back after the game. Front parking can be tight but we arrived, parked, and walked. It was a Friday night and there were no loud external noises. There is a simple breakfast in a very small area but I cannot comment on that because we did not eat there.

It is VERY close to downtown, the light rail station and the bus depot. And via the metro system, MINUTES from north Phoenix and downtown Tempe. We used it to get to the Botanic Garden, Mill Avenue, and the Phoenix Zoo while we stayed. If you don't mind walking a few blocks, it is within walking distance of the Convention Center, Chase Field, US Airways Arena, the Phoenix Art Museum, and the Heard Museum. 2. The place is impeccably kept and simply laid out. Practically everything you'd need for a few nights' stay if you're not expecting too much and brought most of your own toiletries and whatnot. The stand-up shower might be a hindrance to some, however, but we don't know if other rooms may have had bathtubs. 3. Security is very good and the caretakers keep a close eye on the place so it feels very safe. We were at first put off by the \"no visitors\" policy but after reconsidering, it is a smart policy on behalf of the other guests' security. Think of it as you would your own house: Would you want uninvited guests in your house? 4. The rooms are modest and have the basic conveniences and we were surprised that they came with a mini fridge, microwave, ironing board and iron. We thought we would have to request those! We did find it a little odd however that the hotel had signs posted that requested 'no cooking' but provided a microwave. We didn't bother to get clarification. *grin* 5. The PRICE was very helpful to us while we were budgeting our week-long trip through Arizona (which included the Grand Canyon, Sedona, and several destinations in Phoenix). If we stayed even at a Super 8 or other budget hotel we'd probably have spent $20-$30 more per night and had to contend with safety issues, a less-than-desirable location, and cleanliness issues.

Every review on here was positive so I decided to book it. It was indeed an excellent place, although I do have a few small issues. Here are the positives first: The rooms are very clean and spacious, cleaned daily and adequate for short stays. The fridge was very cold and having both fridge and microwave meant we could buy food for the week and store/cook it rather than having to eat out every day. The breakfast is very nice and coffee quite good too. Irons, ironing board and hair dryer all provided on request. Washing machine and dryer on premises of motel next door but accessible to patrons of this motel, very cheap too. Very very quiet, despite being near go a fire station. We slept with the windows open every night and there was hardly a sound the whole time. Manager's wife was lovely and really did all she could to be accommodating. Now my complaints: Despite having phoned twice before our arrival to say that we wouldn't be arriving into SkyHarbor until 8.30 and so probably wouldn't be able to check in until around 9.30pm, when we finally arrived after a long tiring journey from the UK at 10pm the manager commented on how late it was. I told him I'd stated this twice before and he just smiled but ignored this fact. He then wanted me to pay for our stay upfront, which in all my years of staying at hotels I've never been asked. On 2 other occasions during our 9-day stay he asked me when I was going to pay, claiming that he had to pay his mortgage- seriously. He wasn't offensive or overly pushy, and I told him on each occasion that I would pay the day before we left. We had one very heavy suitcase plus 2 other small ones and I asked for help carrying the heavy one. The manager then told me I should have told him this before I came! How was I supposed to know that there was no lift and no busboys or other staff to help with this? In the end he carried it up the stairs for us but I found this quite off-putting. I had booked this in part because it claimed to have high speed wireless in the rooms, so I could talk with my daughter back at home. When we got into our room I discovered that the wireless signal was very poor and the speed infuriatingly slow. I called the manager to my room but his only suggestion was that I wait until the next day when all the \"convention people\" would be gone during the day and the signal would be stronger, supposedly. In fact I had to re-arrange the furniture and moved the small table in the corner of the room over to underneath the clothes rail and set up the laptop there as the signal at least was better and more consistent there. After a few days of really frustrating and inconsistent speeds and signal, I pulled out my wireless card which was designed for top speeds of 54 MB and turned on the internal wireless adapter that my laptop has which was designed for top speeds of 11MB. Lo and behold it all went much quicker and I was able to upload videos to YouTube in a reasonable amount of time. If I hadn't had this internal adapter it would have made things very difficult. All in all however this is a decent place to stay, fantastic location very close to bus and lightrail and nice area which is very quiet. I loved Phoenix and would come back again and would stay here, I'll just be prepared. There seems to be no staff apart from the anager, his wife and cleaning staff which is again slightly impractical but not the end of the world.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new mexico", "Title": "\u201cBest value in downtown\u201d", "Author": "kitties3", "ReviewID": "UR25821494", "Content": "All the other hotels in or near downtown Phoenix cost $150.00 and up.

Just a good place to stay, really close to the convention district downtown. The new METRO, with a stop only about 4 blocks from the motel is an added plus. It will get you to and from the airport (about 4.5 miles away) for less than a couple of bucks. Just make sure to buy a ticket and have it on you when you are on the train.", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna", "Title": "\u201cCheap and confortable, with kind people\u201d", "Author": "Khagan_thebest", "ReviewID": "UR23572673", "Content": "It's in the downtown, near to the convention center where I had to go.
