We booked a deal that included 4 tickets to SeaWorld. The price was quite reasonable considering that the SeaWorld tickets are fairly expensive themselves. The hotel gives you the option of valet or self-parking. Either way there is a charge, about $13 per day for self-parking and $25 per day for valet. We opted for self-paking, which was conveniently located at the rear of the hotel and the top tier of the garage is the level of the lobby. Check in was smooth and the reception staff was friendly. Our room was immediately available. The room was nice. We had 2 queen beds and there was adequate room for all 4 of us. Our room had a view of Aquatica park. The hotel is very close to all of the major Orlando attractions and they offer shuttle service. However, we decided to drive to Sea World because the shuttle space is limited and the times were not convenient for our itinerary. The hotel pool area is spacious and lush. It did not seem crowded even with the amount of people there. The Quiet pool area was closed for a private party, but with our 2 children we stayed in the family pool anyway, Our 6 year old enjoyed the slide. There is also a water basketball court, water sprayers, two zero-depth entry areas, and a lazy river. Only staying one night, we didn't have a chance to check out the other amenities, but everything seemed very nice. The halls were quiet and the beds were comfortable so we got a good night's rest. The bathroom had a double sink and spacious shower. The hotel hosts many conferences, so I could see it getting a bit crowded at times, but it was fine while we were there.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice and Clean Hotel, Great for Travel with Family\u201d", "Author": "shashahing", "ReviewID": "UR126979904", "Content": "I spent the week at a conference during March 2012...the hotel is very nice and clean...very friendly staff.

Nice, comfortable rooms. Great beds and pillows. I like the refrigerator. In fact I find the refrigerator a necessity because the hotel food is awful (there's a grocery about 5 minutes away), but I'll get to that later. I am here for work, a 4-day conference that starts each day at 8:30 a.m. For some reason a group of people decided to party where there is a waiting area for cabs and valet and they did this with a cooler full of drinks until well past midnight yesterday. My room was close enough that it was a bother and security apparently was not effective enough to bring them under control after I called at about 10:30 p.m. I had to change rooms because of this and it took at least an hour, putting me in my new room at about 12:15 p.m. So that's one gripe. The hotel shouldn't have a lounge area in that spot or management should make sure people just sit there to wait for a cab or wait for someone to park, not to hang out and party all night. My other problem is with The Marketplace and the food in general. The Marketplace runs out of fruit and salads. The restaurants in the hotel do not serve healthy food. I'm not a vegetarian, but I like vegetables and healthy food, especially while I have to work and travel. There's not a single healthy vegetarian dish on any menu in any of the restaurants. The Bistro, which purports to be healthy and local, is horrible. I had a spinach salad that was partially rotten and topped with grilled chicken that must have been a week old because the top of it was all discolored and crusty - not to mention cold. I returned the salad only to have it replaced with a slightly less disgusting version of the same. I was not charged, but still endured eating it since I was in a hurry. David's is OK. The ahi tuna tacos were tasty and the Cesar salad was edible, but not very good (too much dressing and they give you half a romaine head that you have to cut yourself, making it difficult to keep from smearing the dressing everywhere). Everything else on the menu did not seem healthy, except maybe the mussels, minus the fries. Spencer's was also just OK and ridiculously overpriced. I had diver scallops, and while the scallops themselves were pretty good, the cauliflower-cheddar puree with pesto was so salty that it overwhelmed the scallop and masked the flavor of the pesto. It tasted like mashed potatoes that were too salty and too runny - no flavor of cheddar, no flavor of cauliflower - just salt. Plus, I got three medium-sized sea scallops, just a tad larger than a quarter in diameter, for $27.50. If it was fantastic, fine, but that's a bit of a rip-off for a mediocre meal. Further, it seems like these restaurants (especially The Bistro) are advertising that they feature local treats. I saw nothing of the sort. On a positive note, service was good at all places (except maybe Spencer's since I was never asked whether I liked the meal).", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice in Orlando!!!\u201d", "Author": "LovetotravelSt.Louis", "ReviewID": "UR126776025", "Content": "Love this place....Hilton Bonnett Creek is a close second but this pool is a little better...love how the lazy river is separate and the pool bar n grill has great food...loved the bbq chicken pizza and strawberry pina coladas...the rooms are beautiful, bed comfy and they will do a courtesy extend on the checkout time to 1 pm if you ask....also very close to InternationalDrive which has tons of restaurants, shops, activities and a great outlet mall at the end of I drive...my new favorite hotel in Orlando.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay for a family\u201d", "Author": "SDS112384", "ReviewID": "UR126750728", "Content": "My husband and I brought our 2 year old to stay here for a weekend get a way.

The hotel itself is very nice. The room was well sized, and well apportioned. Mine was nice a quiet, which I always appreciate.

There is nothing to walk to (except the convention center - whoo-hoo!), so if you want to eat anywhere except the hotel restaurants you have to drive, take a taxi or walk about a mile. I guess that's pretty typical for this area though. The Starbucks in the lobby is great, and the steak house was also nice, but who wants do that every day?

While I believe this law is still in effect, the Hilton Orlando does it's best to destroy it. For starters, you have to pay for internet. This fact continues to befuddle me. McDonald's has free internet, but a room at almost $600 a night you'd think something as easy as internet would be included. After all, the electricity is included, and today internet is getting as important as electricity! However, this trip was as a family vacation, and I promised at least the first three days of internet free me. We upgraded our room, and didn't know what to expect of the upgrade request. The suite was better than the suites I'd gotten used to while staying at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Central America. I'd say it was close to 800 square feet. Being on the 9th floor, I was expecting the water pressure to be lacking, and was presently surprised.We had two bathrooms, a living room, dinning room with big dinning table, office area, refrigerator, great coffee pots, and two queen beds. This was a nice upgrade from the two queen room we reserved (get your Hilton Honors Card!). Some folks have discussed having to pay for parking, but I swiped my room key card, and didn't pay for parking. We didn't stay at this hotel as a jump off to any theme parks. I'm not a big fan of theme parks. We did just want to hang out and relax as we got over jet lag. This hotel is perfect for just hanging out and relaxing. The gym is huge (if this fits under relaxation!), the spa is pricey but available, the fire pit was great to roast marshmallows, the lazy river was great to lounge in on a tube, the pool is more of a water park than a pool, the quiet pool is nice for those who don't appreciate kids and the water slide was impressive even for this big kid. Anytime you order a drink from the pool side bar, it will be expensive...so just expect it. We spent two whole days just at the pool. Very relaxing. It was close to great restaurants, all the amusement parks, and shopping. This said, I would never stay at this hotel as a launch point for parks. I would rather stay on the Disney campus for the Disney thing and drive from there for the other parks. If you are looking for a relaxing few days outside of theme park entertainment, business trips, conferences or things like this; the Hilton Orlando is it. We loved our time at this hotel.

This hotel is not bad, and I am sure great for business travel, but in our experience there are much better places to stay for a family vacation. Here is how we break down where to stay and how this Hilton stacks up using a 1-10 scale with 1 being the lowest. LOCATION (4) Good location for Universal Studios (though if you actually stay at a Universal hotel you get into the park an hour earlier than everyone else) as you can drive the back way and stay off of I-4. This took us 15 minutes. Great location for Sea World/Discovery Cove as you can almost walk there. Bad location for all of Disney World. While technically only a short distance from Disney by car you have to take I-4 and it is always (even at night) bumper to bumper and difficult to navigate and determine the proper lane for your exit once you figure out which one to take. I regularly drive in Manhattan which is easy compared to I-4. We eventually decided to just get off of at the first Disney exit and then navigate through their road system as it was less hectic. No matter what park you are going to it is going to be a half hour due to traffic and that can make an early morning even earlier which does not lend itself to a relaxing start to your day. If you plan on spending more than one day at Disney World this hotel is not the best choice. There are many other non-Disney hotels much closer. HYATT REGENCY, HILTON BONNET CREEK AND BUENA VISTA PALACE ARE ALL BETTER OPTIONS. POOL (7) The pool is important to us because both my son and wife love to swim. The Hilton pool is a very nice medium to large pool with a water slide, good size lazy river and a hot tub. I would have given it a better rating but for two issues. 1 - It could have been a bit warmer as it was somewhat cool at times even though it was in the low 80's during our visit. 2- (and this is the biggest reason for a lower rating) SMOKING EVERYWHERE. While the pool was often almost empty when we were using it the seating areas around the pool and poolside bar were full of people traveling on business many of them smoking and surprisingly a good deal of cigar smoking. At other hotels we have stayed at there has been smoking sections by the pool so it is easy to position yourself away from it if you desire. At the Hilton there are not restrictions so you can not avoid the smell of cigarettes and cigars. We even had to get out of the lazy river because three men were floating around on tubes smoking big cigars. THE SWAN & DOLPHIN AND THE HYATT REGENCY HAVE BETTER POOLS FOOD (2) We did not eat at the resort as the prices were much higher than any other place we have stayed. My wife travels three months out of the year on business and she commented that this is often the case with hotels that cater to business travelers because they are using expense accounts instead of their own money. There are some okay places nearby but if you don't want to eat at Denny's or the like you have to get in your car and drive somewhere. ALL OF THE ABOVE HOTELS HAVE BETTER AND ARE NEAR BETTER FOOD. IF YOU STAY NEAR DISNEY'S BOARDWALK THERE ARE GREAT RESTAURANTS THERE. VACATION FEEL (1) When we travel on vacation we like to feel like we are on vacation. Unfortunately (for family vacationers) this hotel's connection to the convention center and airport fill it with business travelers. We rarely saw other families. The hotel itself is clean, you can park fairly close to the lobby and the elevator to the pool lets you bypass common areas and just step outside to the pool but the view from the hotel is of parking lots, garages and other buildings. Not much greenery or landscaping except by the pool. All in all it is a bit sterile and most of the people we talked with were on the elevator in business attire and weary of traveling. This hotel is not designed with kids in mind. ANY DISNEY HOTEL EVEN THE LOW BUDGET ONES HAVE A BETTER VACATION FEEL AS DO THE HOTELS NEAR DOWNTOWN DISNEY. RESERVATIONS & HOUSEKEEPING (1) We reserved a room with a king size bed and our reservation confirmed it's availability. We called two days before we arrived and were again told yes we have a room with a king size bed. When we checked in we were told they only had a room with two queens. We pointed out that we were staying for eight days but they said there was nothing they could do. I have an allergy to down. Everything in the room was down (pillows and comforters). We asked to have some non-down items brought to the room. They brought pillows and some very thin blankets but only enough for one of the beds and then never returned. They do have hypoallergenic rooms so they must have other comforters but we were told they did not. I don't care that much about housekeeping as I can make my own bed but if I did they would not have scored well as it was sporadic and on one occasion they took the thin blankets off of the bed and put them in the closet leaving the bed with only sheets. THIS REMINDED ME OF THE OLD DAYS OF CAR RENTALS WHERE YOU WOULD RESERVE A CAR AND THEN THEY WOULD SAY THEY RAN OUT. HOTELS NEED TO JOIN THE REST OF US IN THIS CENTURY. OVERALL (4) It never really felt like we were on vacation when we were at the Hilton for all of the reasons I have stated above. The hotel is clean. The staff we dealt with were friendly but we always felt like we were almost where we wanted to be but stopped just shy of it. I often found myself walking in a hallway surround by business suits while I was in my swim gear and felt like I was skipping school. They charge for parking and internet. Do not be fooled we have stayed at plenty of hotels in Orlando that do not charge for these things so shop around. I would say this is a good hotel for business but not a good choice for a vacation.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay.\u201d", "Author": "Sneakurs55", "ReviewID": "UR126259802", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights, it was a little hometown vacation.

The suite room had full-size couch/sleeper, 52-inch HDTV, desk, two easy chairs and a large dining table. Suite had small frig, no frig in regular room. No robes in room but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll provide upon request. Ate twice at David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very good food and service. The mussels and Wagyu burgers were yummy and if you like a Reuben, try the pork belly Reuben. CONS: No major complaints. It is a giant hotel that caters to business/convention travelers so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect personalized service. I mentioned it was my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and not a peep. Son became violently ill one night and the room was not cleaned until after 5 pm next day when they knew we had to strip linens and use most of the towels to clean up. No follow up from staff. Housekeeping will not change your sheets unless you remember to put a card on your pillow. The same goes for towels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have to put on floor or they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change out. Easy self-parking ($) back side of hotel but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let us use their luggage carts so we had to carry everything in ourselves. The breakfast buffet was average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no cook-to-order stations. They said the lack of fresh items was due to low occupancy.

Its a good central location too for all that Orlando has to offer., Second the rooms and facilities are superb - better than anything Disney resorts offer and the staff are just as nice !! Nothing is too much trouble, and they have a wonderful helpful/friendly attitude towards their guests - especially the front desk and the lady from the spa. We thoroughly enjoyed the fabulous pools/lazy river, the gym and the jacuzzi. My only (small) gripe would be, having to pay extra for the WiFi & pitch & put golf. We stayed in an executive room which I would 100% recommend due to its access to the executive lounge - well worth the additional expense, and significantly added to our overall enjoyment of the hotel. Only one word of warning if self parking - Just watch out for the concrete posts in the parking lot - my husband forgot he'd parked in front of one and drove into it as we left the hotel ! - so again, we were very glad we were so near to MCO, as we had to return to get the hire car replaced before continuing our journey !

I didn't love that the hotel charged for many things I thought should be included with the base amount for a room reservation, like: parking, internet, and breakfast. I still recommend spending the additional money to book your room with breakfast, otherwise, you'll spend much more when you get there. The breakfast, although not included with our reservation, was very generous and offered great selection. The employee making omelettes happens to be the best I've seen. She services the station and cooks 5 omelettes at a time -- all while greeting each guest with a smile. Very much enjoyed the omelette she made all three mornings of my stay. In general, the staff was exceptionally friendly, helpful and courteous. My husband and I greatly appreciated all of their help in planning out our days. The location is approximately 20 minutes from Disney, so it's not a bad ride. The shuttle buses seemed to be few and far between though, so if you're staying here and planning to go to Disney, I suggest renting a car. Otherwise, stay at a closer hotel. Although I didn't use the pool area, it looked very nice. There's too much to do in Orlando to want to spend a day by the pool, in my opinion, but if you disagree, then this hotel definitely offers a lot of bang for your buck. The pool area is very similar to any resort area hotel with a much lower price tag for this hotel.

There were several VIPs there, yet the guests were (or appeared to be) oblivious. Each guest is treated as if they were the most important person in the hotel. You can't get that attentiveness anywhere else. The Executive Lounge staff calls you by name, as does everyone else. The lounge is always clean and well stocked. The expresso machine is a great touch. The continental breakfast is just enough to hold you until lunch. Recently they added home made cinnamon buns to the offerings. I also noted an upgrade in the evening snacks. On Friday they had pot stickers and Asian shrimp. The fire pits on the pool deck are so inviting. I love sitting out there at night with a glass of wine and enjoying the night air. We ate at Davids and they have some very interesting new menu items. One of the stand outs was the pumpkin ravioli. The side salads are crisp and the bleu cheese dressing was outstanding. The beds are so comfortable and sparkling clean. Also, I enjoy the glass shower in the king room. My parlor suite was big enough to have a meeting for 10-12 without feeling crowded. The location is great for conventions as well as entertainment on International Drive. I know it is strange to talk about elevators, but these are so fast, and always available. You never have to wait more than 30 seconds to get one.

I was greeted by every staff member during our meeting, whether it was grabbing a bottle of water or eating breakfast. Wonderful. There is a UPS Store onsite, as well as a Starbucks Market. I loved the market, but I have to say the service in the coffee shop was so-so. Example: After ordering my coffee, I had to wait until the \"barista\" was done texting before he started my drink. Then, my drink sat there a little bit longer while he sent another text. Conveniently, a manager walked in and that cell phone magically disappeared. This happened 3 times throughout the week.

It is right across the street from Downtown Disney, has some of the best shuttle services to the Disney parks outside of the Disney hotels themselves, and one of the only hotels that offer the special magic hours at the parks. Consider this: are you in Orlando for the hotel, or the parks? If you choose the latter, then you want the best services you can get that will not only get you to the parks ASAP, but also provide those special extras like early entry or after-hours stays - and this hotel provides those services. If you need to have a quality room and choice of food and drink, then this hotel is a great choice. We are hotel snobs, always prefer Hilton to any other chain hotel, and are seldom disappointed. The room: our room was quite nice, clean and comfortable. We traveled with our then 16-year-old daughter and shared the room with her. There was plenty of room for us and it was always fresh and clean. Outside of our room there were private areas for sitting where she was able to sit and talk to her friends via her cell phone that were plush and comfortable. The shuttle: the shuttle service to the Disney parks (as with them all) provided transportation to Epcot, the hub of the area where you find buses to all other parks. Service was provided roughly every two hours, making it extremely convenient for us as one of us was attending a conference and could then hop a shuttle to meet the rest at the parks. The shuttles ran early and late and were comfortable with friendly staff. We purchased our tickets in the hotel at discount. We were able to get coffee and a quick breakfast easily inside the hotel, or sit and eat a nice spread for a more relaxed breakfast. Great way to start the day. Overall it is the best price and place around within the Disney band - check out the other Hiltons, the one on Palm Parkway is an atrocity to the Hilton name and is more expensive.

I noticed that all over Orlando you can run into this odor near drains on streets and in malls - not sure why but it must have to do with the temperature and the way they plan their sewage systems in the city. So it was unpleasant but you also passed it quickly enough. The spa and gym are great as well. The hotel staff were very accommodating and arranged to have the NHL playoffs shown on TVs in the lounge which was great given that the NBA playoffs are on at the same time and Orlando is not an NHL city.

So far I have never had to wait be the time I arrived to get my car. They also offer self parking, but there is a charge. Go for the valet parking.

Several other large events were underway at the same time, though the hotel held all of them without any issues. The fitness center was a welcome surprise and was closer to a heath club than the typical hotel fitness center, with most all of the major weight and cardio machines.

The workers were very friendly. We loved Gayle, our morning waitress from Scotland. She was great every day. We went to Disney parks every day almost and had no trouble getting there and back. You can see Sea World out your window and Universal Studios isn't far away either. There is a charge for parking which hurts a little because staying off site from Disney forces you to pay $13 /day for parking at the hotel and then you have to pay another $14 a day to pay at Disney, so it's one fee for your daily parking and another for night time parking. A week of that adds up tacked on to the car rental fee as well. However, that has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel. Very nice place. A little more pricey than some other places, but it was very clean, well attended, great perks with the HHonors executive level status. Again, we would stay here again.

We stayed for a week for the American Academy of Ophthalmology conference. For a hotel to achieve excellence and blend both business travelers and families is telling. The employees exude a pride so rare these days. From a welcoming check-in after traveling across the country with two small children (18 months and 5 1/2 years) to hailing cabs with carseats to asking housekeeping to clean our room at a certain time each day to the smiles from everyone we encountered. The hotel is connected to the Orange County Conference Center and is a walkable distance but the bus pick-up and drop-off for the meetings is conveniently located just outside the coffee house in the lobby. The coffee house is basically a Starbucks with packaged candy and a few drinks, nuts, milk and cookies for sale. The lines moved quickly. The Bistro near the pool area is excellent for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast buffet is convenient and good as are the selections off the menu. Service is terrific here. The steak house offers delicious, upscale dining with local, organic fare. Service was impeccable. The gastro pub was large, club-like with a bar, lounge areas with televisions to watch the World Series, and a large dining area with comfortable chairs and dim lighting. The food is outstanding. One can choose healthy items (salad with shrimp I ate every night there) or the burger with breaded and fried bacon. Blue chips on the side are potato chips smothered with melted blue cheese and drizzled with balsamic. We were seated promptly and blended with business travelers and other small families. The burgers by the pool looked delicious although we did not eat there. For families needing snacks for their children, we walked to Walgreens nearby for baby cereal and other items. The gift shop carries toiletries, fun jewelry, tasteful clothing and souvenirs. Very nicely done. The beds are very comfortable. We all slept peacefully. Not once did we hear neighbor noise. No stomping from the floor above us, no hallway noise. Room size is decent, decor is modern. The cleanliness is impeccable. It was comfortable enough for the four of us with two queen beds and one crib. The business center is convenient and allows you to print boarding passes for the flight home. The other raves about the pool area and fire pits are spot on. We enjoyed s'mores in the evening and the pools by day. The lazy river was fun although the baby was very unhappy about being sprayed in the face by the one faucet we couldn't avoid going by so we never went again. Would love to go back when we can enjoy it because it sure looked like fun. Our little girl enjoyed the shallow end of the pool. It was doable with both children by myself. Plenty of lounge chairs and space. There were also plenty of towels handed to us as we entered. I was able to run for an hour on the treadmill in the fitness center early in the mornings. It is roomy, there are plenty of treadmills for everyone and overall a very nice center. It was too dark to enjoy the outdoor running track. Visited the hair salon for a baby haircut that was decent and they got us in the same day. The concierge was very helpful in securing recommendations and reservations at a couple of wonderful restaurants off property. Matteo's Italian was outstanding, as was Oceanaire. We took the very confusing but charming trolleys to and from, although we caught a Metro bus on the way home from Matteo's, which was a longer distance away. The trolley stop was not clearly marked. We took a 15-minute cab ride to Disney World for half a day one day and another to Sea World the next day. We also enjoyed a special meeting night at Universal Studios. We found all three to be heavily commercialized but worth taking the little ones out for some fun and magic. Again, we appreciated being able to walk to the hotel lobby and hail cabs and shuttles with car seats. And the driver installed them for us. How nice to travel without lugging them ourselves. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for business travelers and families alike. The entire staff goes above and beyond the call of duty for everything that is asked of them. With a smile, no less. I really appreciate how they all treated our children with such patience, kindess and respect. They took the time to talk to them in a manner that fosters politeness and teaches them how to comfortably engage with adults. Our wake-up call, bell person and shuttle with a carseat were all dependable for our very early a.m. airport departure.

On both occasions I was very impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency of this hotel. The staff is friendly, the grounds are nice, and the rooms are clean. For conventions/business people, the convention space of the hotel is more than adequate to hold moderate sized conventions. For larger conventions, there is a covered walkway that connects the hotel to the Orlando Convention Center. For families/those having fun, the hotel grounds feature a large pool w/slide, lazy river, tennis court, jogging trail, fire pits, putting greens, basketball court and well appointed fitness center. The property is about 20 minutes from Walt Disney World. My family had no issues with the daily commute from the hotel to the various Disney Parks - it was a breeze! For a family vacation, I found this resort to be a great value for the money (we got the $119 kids eat free rate). As a Hilton Gold Member, I was able to use the executive lounge on the 19th floor for continental breakfast in the morning and appetizers in the afternoon. The evening appetizers were a great money saver. We didn't have to resort to eating at fast food establishments, table-service restaurants or expensive theme park food. I've also stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando (adjacent to the Bonnett Creek Hilton) which is another solid property. This hotel is very similar in layout and style to the Bonnett Creek Hilton. Overall, I'd say between the Waldorf, Hilton Bonnett Creek, and Hilton Orlando, there are some great Hilton properties in Orlando!

The difference in hotels comes down to only one thing- the staff. Do they take a personal interest in each and every guest? Are the needs of the guest not only met, but anticipated? There is no better staff than the one at the Hilton Orlando. It seems to be almost impossible to satisfy the business traveler, the conventioneer and the vacationing family. Add in the romantic weekend couple and that makes it an incredible task. I travel under all of these lables every year and this is the only hotel that brings me back time and time again. On a recent stay, I left my cosmetic bag. The day I checked out, I got a call from security telling me about the oversight. They hold all lost and found items for 90 days. I retrieved it from the helpful and friendly security guard on this trip. I have forgotten items at other hotel chains and never been contacted to retrieve them. Great personal service is this Hilton's trademark. There is a convenient walkway to the Orlando Convention Center. One of the best steakhouses in the country is Spencers. The deli makes great sandwich combos for the \"grab and go set.\" The roast beef was very tasty and served on a fresh roll. My favorite restaurant is the poolside bar. The really big burgers and daily flatbread specials are my favorite. The staff in the Executive staff prepares for your arrival with a pre-arrival contact by phone and email. It is easy and convenient to check in at the executive desk. The continental breakfast is just enough to get you going. If you are in the mood for a full American breakfast, the Bistro has a great breakfast buffet, with an omlette station. the lazy river pool is a great way to relax. For even more relaxation, I retreat to the quiet pool hot tub. Romantic evenings start with a glass of wine by the blazing firepits. It just doesn't get much better with these surroundings and the incredible staff. Every person has a smile- all the time. No matter what the question, the staff will get the answer for you. I have been a regular guest for the past 18 months and will continue to return to this great hotel. I just booked a graduation luncheon for next year and I am confident it will be outstanding. This last trip was a combination wedding anniversary and family celebration for our son's promotion at work.when we returned from dinner, we found a beautiful cake and a bottle of wine. We enjoyed it for two days. That made our special day even more so. If you spend even one night at the Hilton Orlando, you will be hooked. Thank you Doug for assembling the perfect staff.

Paid $99/per night and was extremely glad that we chose this hotel. It is beautiful, well-staffed and boasts high-end rooms/beds at a low price. The pool area is fantastic. On our visit, the hotel was not busy at all. (Note: This review might be quite different during conventions) The pool area only had about a dozen people in it and we had the hot tub and lazy river all to ourselves. There are several restaurants on-property as well as one great late-night bar with a fantastic patio. The patio has gas-fired, open-flamed heaters with seating in front of a big-screen tv. You can sit in a comfortable chair and watch Monday Night Football outside while enjoying a cocktail and smoke without bothering anyone. Perfect. My only gripe is that everything on-property is very expensive. A vodka/cranberrry will cost $10 in the hotel bar. A so-so breakfast will run about $20. Take my advice...walk out of the hotel, cross the street and enjoy a hearty IHOP meal for half the price.

Despite the horrible weather, the Hilton Orlando ended up being the perfect hotel for us on this visit. We had booked two rooms, with a request for adjoining rooms, which I was told would more than likely be accommodated. The day before we arrived I confirmed the rooms but was told we would not have adjoining rooms after all. Imagine my surprise and pleasure when at check-in late the following evening, the desk clerk quickly and easily gave us adjoining rooms -- the first hotel in Orlando that has ever accommodated this request!! The rooms were very clean and very comfortable. We required a rollaway in one room which was promptly sent up, and at no extra charge (although one was quoted prior to check-in). (Speaking of charges, this may also be the time to note that this hotel is one of VERY few I found in the Orlando area that offers a government rate for government employees.) The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. There was a \"marketplace\" near the hotel lobby where one could purchase pastries, coffee, juices, and other breakfast items, at a reasonable price -- other items were available but we only ever needed breakfast. Best of all the pool area was fabulous. We only got to use it at night but it stays open until 11pm and has a great lazy river and lots of inner tubes. We had VERY limited time to use the pool and arrived at 8:30 one night to find the water slide was not running. I asked what time it closes and the attendant replied that it closes at 9pm but she hadn't turned it on that night because no one had asked for it (bad weather, remember). She offered very cheerfully to turn it on for us until 9pm so that our kids could enjoy it on the only night they'd have a chance to, which I certainly didn't expect her to do and appreciated very much! I forgot to mention the location -- literally 5-7 minutes from Universal, straight shot down Universal Drive, and about 15 minutes from the Disney parks, in a very easy commute. Careful taking a cab back from Universal, however, as the driver may try to take you the \"scenic\" route (aka the highway) which took 20 minutes and amped up the fare!

As mentioned by another reviewer, they charge you for everything they can get out of you. I guess that is standard fro the area though. As much as the property is good and the service is fair, I will not stat again when I am in the area because of all the nickle and dime charges (actually way more than nickles and dimes). I had a package sent to me by FedEx while I was there. This was an urgent package and we had it sent first morning delivery. I did not hear from the desk by 9 am so I called to find out if it had been delivered. It took a while but they finally told me that it had been delivered and that I would have to go down to the UPS store to pick it up. Once I got to the UPS store I found that there was a charge to get my package! Additionally, they package was in storage and they had to go get it. It was 10 am by the time I got my urgent package. I stay in hotels over 75 nights per year on business and this is the reason why I only stay a handful of nights in Hilton's (only if they are the only option). I have packages sent to me on a regular basis while I am on the road. The vast majority of the time I stay in Marriott's and every time a package has been sent to me I get a call saying \"Mr. B, your FedEx has arrived, would you like to come down or should we send it up to your room?\" No charge, no sending it to someone (UPS store) that has no business handling my shipment.

SO good that Hampton Inn management hosted their convention here last week! Just returned from my 3 night stay. I was going to the Disney parks, have stayed at the Hilton WDW which I was not impressed, but decided to check this hotel out because of its overwhelmingly positive review, and I will repeat what others state, this hotel is OUTSTANDING! I am HH gold member, was issued a top floor, executive room, pool view. I asked for more room since we were a group, and was issued a Parlor Suite! This Suite is an adjacent room that includes a living room/dinning room set up! Outstanding! It has an extra full bathroom, wetbar, large flatscreen TV. Turndown service each night (includes a mint, mood lighting, curtains closed, tv turned on to smooth music. WOW!) Small details make a difference. The hotel is large, attached to the convention center and designed to have capacity for large conventions, but it does not have that stale feeling that other megahotels have. Everyone was friendly! The executive lounge is large, plenty of seating, continental breakfast till 11am, has an espresso machine that I made my best friend, dinner snacks at 5pm, desserts at 8pm. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is truly something else! The food quality was top! and it is not fried mystery meat, this was good! Also full stocked Honor Bar. Staff is super friendly and attentive, Holly assisted us at Exec L and she was super friendly. I did see a manager come in at breakfast to check up on things, so it is good that management is doing its best. The big pro this hotel has is that it is 2 years new, so everything works, all top notch, comfortable beds. I used the gym, it is large, clean, new, plenty of machines, precors have tv screen, has huge windows and tall ceilings. I also used the steam room in the spa ($15 charge, free for gold/diamond). Spa is very nice! I also used the pool, it is huge, loved lazy river! Check in was quick, friendly staff. The biggest tip I can give to people is if on vacation, even business, spend one full day in hotel just enjoying it, the pool, volleyball/basketball courts, the gym, etc.. It makes no sense to quickly get out of there to go to a water resort when the hotel has one included! The only thing I did not like is parking is extra, per day $20 valet, $13 self\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but if you self park, you drive around the hotel to the back and the entrance leads you to lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6total less than 5 minute walk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this is not like other hotels that you go into adjacent massive parking structures that you have to walk for what seems like a mile.

For about $400 we had 2 nights in a pool view room (after signing up for Hilton points), 1 Day admission for all three of us to SeaWorld (included a free second day that we did not use), 1 Day All Day Dining for the three of us and 3 front of the line passes (more on the passes below). The room was beautiful, clean and spacious (especially after 7 days in a cruise cabin!!) The beds were beyond comfortable and we had more than enough space for all our luggage. The lobby is huge and reminded me of a big Las Vegas resort type of hotel. There was a Starbucks, a store for wine and snacks, a few restaurants and a really nice looking lounge. None of which we used ;-) There are also some nice restaurants on site (according the the info). We spent our first day just hanging out by the pool. This is one of the best pool areas for a hotel, resort, all inclusive resort you name it, that we've experienced!! The temp of the pool was perfect, the lazy river was great fun = so impressed that they just provide the floating tubes, no rental required!!! The hot tubs in the evening were fantastic! We had a drink and a snack at the pool bar - fantastic food! The chicken wings were huge and soooo tasty. The chicken strips for DD were really good too - and real chicken breast, not formed nuggets!! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. The location can't be beat either - a quick drive to Disney or Seaworld or the Outlet mall!! Anything you want in Orlando is an easy drive away. So about the Quick passes...this is the one negative of our entire time at the Hilton. After checking in we were told to talk to Conceirge about obtaining all the passes and info we needed for our packed. We had printed our tickets online and DH was told that the quck queue passes would be given to us at Seaworld....hmmmm nope. When we arrived it took no less than 4 different Seaworld employees to help us out. Finally a fabulous lady in Guest Information provided us with 3 VIP passes. Turns out this happens almost daily - the hotel says we get the passes at the park and the park says we should have obtained something from the hotel. We stopped by concierge at the end of the day to let them know about the mistake and they were \"oh yeah that happens all the time... oh well\". Something needs to be done to fix the communication between these two because it is not the guests issue to fix!! I will be contacting Seaworld and Hilton on a letter in the near future to advise them again of this issue.

Management offerred to extend our stay at the weekday rate so we have cancelled our HGI reservations and will stay here through the weekend. Got an executive floor upgrade due to my Hilton Honors status and we are really enjoying the free continental breakfasts, hot hor's d'ouvres, and nighttime desserts. As an added bonus, we can clearly see the Disney fireworks from the end of our hall on the 19th floor...very cool!

The pool area is very well-staffed, and we received fabulous service from the poolside servers. The other thing I must mention about the pool areas are that they are extremely well-designed in terms of space & landscaping. There is a separate adult-only area, and we never really even saw it - which tells you they accomplish the privacy goal there.

The main clientele are business trips, with the hotel situated right next door to Orlando Convention Centre. On th first night we were unable to enjoy time in the bar due to some very loud customers literally shouting at each other in the Bar, the beach bar by the pool had already closed at 8pm so we were confined to our room with some food/drinks from the deli store. We complained to the Hotel Management the next day and were given an apology and some comlimentary drinks. The room was bright, clean and modern overlooking the Pool area, the bed and pillows were very comfy and we were happy with the room facilities.

The executive lounge that comes with the upgrade is relaxing and has great food/drinks. It was the perfect place to wind down and have a little something to eat. The cost is small, but the value of the upgrade is worth every penny. Here's another tip: The road (Destination Pkwy) didn't show up on my car's navigation system.

I called ahead, I let the front desk know I was staying for a birthday, and were there any amenities or options available? I was quickly transferred to another department (it might have been food services) I was told I could buy a cake, but when I asked for for more information and prices I was told I'd have to speak to someone when I got there. My whole point of calling ahead was to surprise him and Hilton, you basically shut me out. I'm guessing because I'm not a member of a Hilton rewards there's no obligation to impress me. That being said the only other thing I want to point out is their rooms. Its not that I did not like them, its that they didn't impress me all that. For a 4 star hotel, it was just average, nothing spectacular I've seen much nicer 4 star rooms, but I understand this is a huge corporate run hotel. The bed is comfortable, the linens are clean, everything is modern, I did enjoy the mini fridge and the arm chair and ottoman. The bathroom had a few hairs in the tub (YUCK!) but it was free of any scum and mold. Now, the property itself is WHY this is a 4 star hotel. This place is huge, massive even. I was very impressed, I loved the lazy river and the water slide was great. There is SO much to do here. You could stay here a couple of days and make a vacation out of it. I LOVED that the pool was open until 11pm. I loathe sitting in my hotel room at 9pm with nothing to do, I'm a night owl. At night there were fire pits and that was a nice touch. I can't say much about service or staff, I was barely in the hotel and the only time I spoke to any staff was during check in. Now a few things I have to rant about....$14 to park? The Double Tree down the street and MUCH closer to Sea World is only $10. A daily charge of internet access? Why are hotels still doing this? And 4 star hotels at that, all your doing is upsetting customers. Besides in this age of technology all I have to do is use my phone as a wireless router. The prices for food here are RIDICULOUS. I know I'm on vacation and should/do indulge, but $22 for some OJ and 2 muffins? The mark up on that is ludicrous. FYI, if you leave the hotel and make a right on I-drive there are TONS of places to eat. From what I've heard there's a little breakfast place in front of the Double Tree hotel (right on the other side of the highway) that is suppose to be great.

The hotel lobby is clean, modern and inviting. Check-in was a breeze. I did note the hotel offered fresh air rooms (which stuck me as a little odd) but when I walked into my non-smoking king room I understood why there was an option. The room had a definite smell of having been smoked in for years. The accessories, furniture, carpet and bedding all looked clean and new so I don't quite understand the reason for the odor but it was very noticeable indeed. I don't consider myself overly picky or sensitive, but I did find it annoying that the hotel offered a fresher \"pure allergy\" room for $20 more than the standard ns King accommodation. The beds were very comfortable, internet service was speedy, coffeemaker had \"real\" half-and-half (which was a nice surprise as I usually bring my own when I travel). The room was equipped with a nice large tv and safe as well as the usual accoutrements. There was, however, no makeup mirror in the bathroom which I found quite surprising. I had one meal at the hotel in David's Club. The meal ($40) was very nice, service was good, but the after dinner glass of house wine in the bar was $13, which I considered very pricy. The hotel did also have a spa however I found the rate of $190 far to expensive to consider. Excellent amenities in the way of a swimming pool (two of them) with plenty of lounging spots, a water slide, cabanas, hot tub, a jogging/walking path, tennis court, and even a putting green. Do see the hotel photos of the grounds, I imagine they are a great draw for families who want to wind down from a day at the local attractions. There is a relaxing pool bar and lounge, and a charming little gift shop run by a very lovely woman. There is also a Marketplace for grab-and go snacks, soda, and some Italian gelato which is made on premises.

The convention staff was nice and attentive, the restrooms were well kept, and everything was serviced very professionally. The hotel itself - the bed wasn't too bad. A bit harder than I typically enjoy, but surprisingly it was still comfortable. The rooms have all your typical needs and were well dressed and kept up with. The maid service was excellent. All the staff that we encountered were very nice, including the valet service that we used - everyone was helpful with full information offered. The pool is great, and they have large inner-tubes with handles on them that can accomodate most sizes of people for their lazy river pool. The lazy river pool isn't as in depth or nice as the one at J.W. Marriott, but we appreciate the little extra's like the inner-tubes. The \"Quiet Pool\" was also a plus, as the piped in music is a little quieter then everywhere else. The main pool was nice, as well, and we really saw very few children, probably due to the location and the fact that it does seem to host quite a few conventions (there was at least one other at the hotel during this time). The restaurants were hit and miss. Spencer's, which is the nice, high end steak house, had no openings until about 8PM due to previous reservations (not a problem), so we sat in the bar area. We told the Maitre'D that we'd be eating there (and he offered to help the three of us fit into the bar by moving a couple of patrons down a chair, but we decided to sit at one of the tables, instead). We literally received no service until one of us went to tell him we hadn't been served - and it's not like there were no waiters...several were standing around looking a bit bored (we assumed the reservations were staggered, as there were a lot of empty tables in the main dining area). Not a problem, he was gracious, and after that our service was perfect. Main complaints - this is a HIGH END steak house. Simple things were overlooked (I asked for blue cheese stuffed olives in a drink, \"if you have them\" - I received Feta stuffed with no indication; the soup wasn't very interesting, the food was overpriced and varied - for the prices they charge I expect excellent food overall). We also dined at David's Club, which was great even when swamped. It's a bar with big cushy chairs, and a friendly staff - the food was solid, not amazing, but for a bar it was a bit higher end and decent enough. The \"Marketplace\" had good food, but it was extremly overpriced in some departments, and others not so bad. Typical for a \"resort style\" hotel. On another Convention note - some of the people that I met while there were served UNDERCOOKED chicken from the dinner that was sponsored that night (not a buffet), but, everything else was fine. Overall, good hotel, I would return, and wouldn't hesitate to come for a bit of a vacation trip if there was a convention there considering the pools and services are pretty empty during the day. The location is across from the Convention Center, and there are a ton of restaurants in this area, along with other things that a family could easily enjoy.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odessa, FL", "Title": "\u201cMy FAVORITE Orlando hotel\u201d", "Author": "nolegirl811", "ReviewID": "UR117997333", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel many times.

I'm a Hilton Gold, so I received a room on the top floor and had access to the Executive Lounge there. The hotel is very new and beautiful. The room was medium-sized, but plenty large enough for the 2 of us. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet. The bathroom had a walk-in shower and granite countertop, very nice! There is both a mini-fridge and safe in the dresser drawers. I didn't know there was a safe as it is hidden in the top right drawer. The mini-fridge came in very handy for keeping drinks cold. The real draw to this hotel is the pool area. Simply put, it is amazing! The pool is very large! The water slide and lazy river were a lot of fun. There is a second, smaller pool, but we didn't visit it. We only ate in the Executive Lounge and conference, not any restaurants. The food was OK. I expected a better offering, but it was OK. We also had dinner at the conference we attended. That food was excellent! And the lunch provided at the conference was very good too! You can pay extra and get a pool-view room or a fireworks-view room. We chose to do neither. The gym was the best I have ever seen at any hotel I've stayed at! And the spa beside it was wonderful! As a Hilton Gold, I was able to get access to the spa facilities for free. I used the steam room quite a bit, and it was nice to be able to use this facility while at the pool rather than going up to our room. The other huge positive to this hotel is the amazing staff! EVERY single staff member we came across said hello with a smile. They even had staff manning the exit from the parking garage just to make sure you could get in/out OK. The young ladies in the Executive Lounge were top-notch! I could have done without the $13/day self-parking fee, but I can understand why they charge it. Valet would have been $20, but I see no reason for that as the parking garage is attached to the hotel. You can't go wrong here!

We did encounter a problem with our room, all of our request are noted on our profile, we were told upon check in that our room was feather-free; however it was not. It took (3) phone request and tips to get the room feather free. The first person that came to the room just verified what we already knew...that the duvet was not feather free and said to call and someone would come and remove and bring a blanket...this was tip #1-someone did come about (5) minutes later to remove the duvet and only leave a blanket at the foot of the bed-(tip #2) we left to eat lunch and returned to take a nap ...only to find that the pillows were feathered...another phone call and tip #3 to have the pillows removed...this gentlemen was the BEST...not only did he remove the pillows...and replace with foam pillows...but he placed the left blanket from the previous person that was laid at the foot of the bed and he placed it on the bed with along with fresh linens that had contact with the feathered duvet that was to have been removed from the bed prior to our arrival. He was great and even asked if we needed anything else...our regret-\"we did not get his name\"....so after (3) phone calls and tips we finally had a feather-free room. The very next day we informed the front desk that our room was prepared properly and that it took (3) phone calls and (3) different people to make (1) room feather free...the young lady at the front desk seemed not to care...her response...\"we're sorry\"---!!!!!-is there anything else we can help you with!!!!(in a very non-caring manner-border line -ARROGANT---(we failed to get her name from her badge, and we so regret the fact that we did not) However, Yanina Quinones-whom we only met upon our check in-(she did not check us in -someone else did) we just started a conversation briefly and she remembered us and asked how our stay was so far? We expressed going well now just a little problem on yesterday...she inquired by asking-Is there anything that I can do? so we expressed to her about the room not being feather-free and the numerous (3) attempts to get it feather free..she apologized and stated that she would give us a credit on our account for the inconvenience....wow..what a difference in her attitude and that of the young lady to whom my husband and I made the complaint to-Ms. Yanina is to be commented for great service attitude and her willingness to assist us...she has a pleasant attitude and a beautiful smile...she is DEFINITELY an asset to the Hilton Family. She exemplies good customer care skills-----she is to be commended for her service to the customers and her service as an Hilton Family member. She represents the Hilton Family very well!!!! We look forward to coming back. This is a very beautiful hotel -the food and service at Spencers was awesome, we had dinner there twice.

You can reach shopping, dining areas and theme parks in 5-15 minutes by car. Opposite side of the road (International Drive) is a McDonalds, Danny's, Walgreens, etc. We booked a room for 8 nights. 6 nights was The Great Gateway rate (included breakfast), 2 nights was standard pre-paid rate. At arrival (01.00 am) first we parked to the front entrance where we were informed if we choose the self parking (instead of the valet) we have to park to the back side parking lot. It is a good solution, there is an entrance to the hotel also, you should not wait for your car, etc. But nobody was helping us to take our luggages to our rooms. The room was with pool view, 1 king bed. The size of the room is enough for a couple. The room was really average, nothing special. I was waiting more from a new Hilton hotel (eg. a shower in the bathroom, higher quality decoration, etc.). Each day we were in the pool area which was perfect on the working day but on weekend it was extremelly crowded. We think the best part of the hotel the pool area with the lazy river and bar. There is also two other pool (one is quiet pool). And about the disappinting things: 1. We read in the reviews that the staff is very friendly. What we experienced many times that some member from the stuff do not say Hello just after we said. Some of them do not smile and do not try to help us. 2. We called the Guest Service three times. First we asked for repair of the safebox in our room. After 15 minutes we should call them again. They forgot to send anybody. Next time we asked for towels because the cleaner forgot it. After 20 minutes we should call them again when they informed us the towels will be in our room in 5 minutes. And finally we asked for late check-out because our flight was at 9 pm only. They informed us we can not get any late check-out. We have to leave our room at 12 pm latest. It was a little bit strange after we booked a room for 8 nights. 3. We asked information at the front desk about the possibility to take a shower before we leave the hotel because we wanted to be at the pool on our last day also. They informed us we have to pay 15 USD. In this case we can use the Spa lockers and shower. (Why to pay for a shower? We are your guest who paid a lot of money.) 4. The internet is 14.95 USD/24 hours in the hotel. If you go to e.g. the Danny's (or many other places) it is free (even in the parking area). 5. The assortment in the room-service is not fair. 6. As we wrote already we booked the first 6 days at the Great Gateway rate which includes breakfast buffet. But this breakfast buffet is not same as a standard breakfast buffet. The difference is not big it is why we do not understand why it is necessary. If the hotel makes a special rate with special service why it is necessary to reduce the quality.

The guest rooms are spacious, well appointed, and maintained in like-new condition. Plus, if you are a Hilton Honors member there are even more amenities that put this hotel over the top. You cannot find a better price performer in the Orlando area. Finally, the attribute that probably sets this hotel far apart from all the rest is the staff!

Although we have been to Orlando and all the theme parks several times with our children, this was our first trip alone to Florida and everything was fantastic from start to finish. Usually when visiting the theme parks we stay on Disney and/or Universal property, but since we didn't have any kids with us this time we decided to try something different. The reviews on Tripadvisor were very helpful in our final decision of where to stay and I am glad we chose the Hilton. When we arrived we pulled up to the front of the hotel and were greeted promptly. A nice young man gave us the options regarding valet parking ($20 day) or self parking ($15 a day I think) and no pressure at all to utilize valet parking. He informed us that the top parking deck connects to the main lobby area and that it was actually closer to the front desk than from where we were currently parked at the front of the hotel. Also, he told us that the valet cars were also parked on that deck. We chose self parking and it worked out just fine. Extremely easy! After we parked our car we went into the lobby and were impressed with what we saw. Very modern, clean and spacious. I will try to attach some pictures later. We were several hours early, but decided to see if we could possibly get an early check in. The girl at the front desk was very nice and immediately got on the phone to see if it would be possible for an early check in. She then informed us that because it was our 10 year anniversary we were being upgraded to a suite and the room would be available shortly. My husband and I were both very surprised, as neither of us could recall ever being upgraded for free before. Anyway, we were directed to the bell station to store our luggage and then we went to the pool area for a swim and an early lunch. We ate poolside and had a few drinks, shrimp and pizza. Very tasty, but the service was even better. The pools were immaculate and not overcrowded at all. I am assuming that in mid-summer it would be a different story, but early September was no problem at all and the weather was hot and fabulous! Percect pool area for adults and/or kids. Around 1:00 we were notified that our suite was ready. We went to get our luggage and Doug was super nice and helpful with delivering our things to our room. Gave us some good tips while visiting Orlando and how to see the SeaWorld fireworks from the hotel. Nice guy--and when I saw him throughout the week he always referred to us by name. Honestly, every staff member that we encountered was very friendly. Our room was awesome and spacious! Bed amazing. I slept soooo good every night! The decor was lovely and everything in the room was very clean and modern. The housekeeping staff was top-notch. In fact, one night my husband and I returned from a long,long day at the Disney parks and he told me one of the safes was wide open. Well, I thought he was kidding, but he wasn't. As we were thinking back, we realized that he actually forgot to close and lock it. I had a mini panic attack and was about to cry, but was absolutely shocked to discover that not one single thing was stolen!!! Believe me, there was LOTS to choose from too! I informed management, as I know people will always complain if something goes missing or isn't right, so I wanted them to know about all the positive things during my stay. I also liked that there were several elevators, so no long wait and never overcrowded. Overall, we had a wonderful time and can't wait to return!!! Oh I almost forgot; the location for us was perfect. Very central to everything we needed. Very Close to Discovery Cove, Sea World, Aquatica and Universal/Isands of Adventure. Short drive to the Disney Parks and Downtown Disney (prob 10-15 mins with traffic).

They had fresh fruit, waffles, cereal, bacon, potato's, bagels, and the best scrambled eggs you have ever tasted. They also had a beautiful Spa but did not have time to visit it. Overall we had a fantastic time. However, no stay is perfect. The things that I did not like: $13.00 for parking a day or $20.00 for valet. You have no choice if you have a car. The beds were too hard for my liking. The operator was very rude and gave me incorrect information. She did not log my wake up call. Also, she said I would have to pay $6.99 to print off my boarding passes. I've never had to pay for that service. While checking out Kit G asked about my stay and I told him about the rude operator and the $6.99 passes. He promptly printed them out and apologized for her. He informed me that was a free service to all guest. Yes, I will go back and tell anyone I know to visit there.

Modern hotel; pleasant staff; lovely pool (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use). Bad points (which I did know about before booking): parking ($21 per day valet parking; $13 per day to self park on their property (plus taxes of course)!! Internet (even some of the motels we have been to offer free internet) but the Hilton charges $15 per day. And this is fixed to one device, I could not log off from my iPhone for example and my son log on later with his. Room service is a complete rip-off. There is a $4.50 delivery charge PLUS a whopping 22% service charge (not including tip!) On top of this of course are local taxes. One burger, plus two kids burgers cost $60. There is a minibar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it is empty!! There was also a $10 supplement per night to get a pool view. The main restaurant was cloed for the duration of cour stay...

The lazy river is impressively long and the \"quiet\" pool was a nice place to use the hot tub in peace. The pool bar had typically expensive drinks and food but was tasty none the less. We enjoyed the hummus and the pizza. They also offer pitchers of specialty drinks. Plenty of lounge chairs and nice beach towels are available at the entrance of the pool area with no fussing about \"checking out\" and \"in\" of towels ... you just take what you need. The hotel is situated within just a few minutes of many, many chain restaurants on International drive ... which was very convenient for dinner. Only one of the hotel's restaurants is open late and was way over priced. We had a very late dinner and were disappointed in the over priced, small portions of food we received. The hotel room itself was clean and well kept. The bathroom appeared to be brand new and the shampoo/bath products were very nice. The bed was comfortable and the linens were high end. Two minor complaints are the lack of extra toilet tissue in the bathroom (had to ask the maid for a roll) and the AC. The room was consistently humid, no matter how low we turned the temperature. The bathroom would benefit from a fan to exhaust the shower steam. Parking is $13 per night (to self park, which is very convenient in a ramp attached to the lobby) and internet is $15 per day. Both charges are ridiculous considering the hotel is located in an area which has plenty of parking (this is not Chicago) and even McDonald's across the street has free internet. Petty charges ... which add up. The concierge and front desk staff was excellent, friendly, and offered great advice on theme parks and restaurants in the area.

We did not eat at Spencer's Grill on site as there were many other off site alternative restaurants. The hotel is about a mile to Aquatica, SeaWorld and Discovery Cove with Universal Studios and Disney about 5 miles which wasn't bad. What I also liked about the hotel's position just off International drive was the incredible choice of restaurants for every budget and only a short drive away. The hotel was extremely quiet during our stay as the convention center next door had no events on and I believe it can get busy so you might want to check into that if you book here. This was advantageous to us however as there were no noisy neighbor's at night! My children loved the pools with the slide and lazy river and used these daily, a nice treat if you want a quiet day away from the parks.

After classes ended I'd go up to my room, change to my swimsuit, grab my book and head to one of the pools. They were just beautiful and completely clean. Poolside drinks and food, ordered from the bar at the big pool, were delivered by helpful waiters and waitresses and the music played through cute rock shaped speakers was great. If I had kids, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely stay in this hotel when visiting Orlando just for the pools. One caution, the poolside lounge chairs are made from squared metal tubing and have some sharp edges. I ran my shin into one and got a deep gash. The pool bar waitress who brought me a band aid said that it happens all the time and showed me her own scars from encounters with these sharp edged chairs. The hotel is new, clean and sleek, and very \"how now brown cow\" in decoration. The light fixtures are beautiful throughout the property but a decorator was tuned into brown and splashed way too much of the color in public areas - including the downstairs restaurant which is a relentless sea of orangish brown. All hotel employees were very friendly and competent. Food at the pool bar and the restaurants was very good. I recommend the hamburger. My hotel room was clean and more than adequate for a business trip with a comfortable bed and a nice desk and chair, but nothing special as far as decoration and drab to look at with so much brown on the walls, floor and furniture. It smelled slightly mildewed. There was only one small towel rack by the sink in the bathroom for hand towels and no racks for wet bath and beach towels and swimsuits, so it was very difficult to dry my swimsuit. I think this might be a real problem for two or more people in a room using the beautiful pools every day, so be sure to pack a second swimsuit if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning on staying here. There was almost no noise from adjacent rooms and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any hall noise so I slept well throughout my stay. The maids were so nice in the halls and brought the extra towel I requested (to blot dry my swimsuit) immediately. The conference areas were clean and well staffed by friendly seniors ready to direct you to your next session. The conference food was good and the coffee was absolutely undrinkable, so buy coffee in the coffee shop upstairs. My husband joined my on the last day of my visit and we ate at Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary.

This hotel cateres more towards the travelling business person than to families. Since it is connected to the Orange Country Convention Center, this makes sense. We pulled up and someone had helped us with our baggages. However, he made sure to point out that he was the valet company and is a seperate department from the hotel's bell staff (who would be the one taking my bags up) then proceed to wait around us expecting a tip. I did give him a tip but did not like that approach at all. After check in, another bell man arrived at our door with our luggages, so I made sure I gave him a good tip too. The sleeping accoomdation was very nice, spacious and modern. They do not have a mini bar but do have some sort of refridgerator. Actually, it was more like a cooler and it took about 4 hours for a luke warm water to get cold. There is a sign stating that this is not a refridgerator and any milk or medicine would not keep. Their beds were very comfortable and the sheets had very high thread counts and were crisp. One of the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in. The highlight of this hotel was the pool. They have a very large pool with zero entry on both sides (think the beach) and the water was extremely warm. which let you stay in the water for a long periods of time. There are 2 pool basketball hoops, a water fountains, water slides, an awesome lazy river and a qiuet pool. There were plenty of umbrellas and lounge chairs all tucked into secluded places and a great outdoor bar and restuarant there. The pools opens until 11 pm but the kitchen closes at 8 pm, so don't think you can have a nice late dinner by the pool if you come after that. They also provide you with large pool towels, fooseball table and pool tables. There's even a huge circular fire pit which they lit up after dark. You can even call room service from that area and they can deliver s''mores ingredient. Adjacent to the pool is a very large fitness which lools very impressive, but I did not utltized. I had a package delivered to the hotel and they charged me a $5 handling fee. I know that some hotel charge a handling fee if you have more than 5 boxes and normally its for a meetings at the hotel, not individual guest. That cost was un-called for. They also charge an internet access fee of $14.95 per 24 hours. I stayed at 5 different hotels while in Florida, and this was the only hotel that charge for wi-fi.

We took every recommendation she made, including lobster tails with the steaks.

From the moment we arrived at the Hilton Orlando we had a negative experience. We had been travelling for 12 hours to get to the hotel so were tired on arrival and all we wanted to do was get to our room, shower and then go for some dinner! Our bags were taken from the taxi by the bell boy and after 30 minutes we still didn't have them in our bedroom, we phoned down and chased it but it turned out they had been \"lost\" we finally got our luggage after nearly 50 minutes. The toilet seat in our bathroom was broken when we arrived but this was fixed quickly so that was good. We were given a $25 resort credit to compensate the misplaced luggage. About a mile away is Orlando Point where there are several restaurants and some shops, we got a taxi there and walked back- took about 20 minutes. There are also a few restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. Our first day we went to Animal Kingdom in the morning- we got a taxi from the hotel. TIP- if you get a taxi to Disney make sure the hotel staff put you in a checker cab, (they know this but failed to do it for us!) the cost of the taxi to Animal Kingdom was about $35 but we then had to pay an extra $14 to get into the entrance area- you don't have to pay this if you are in a checker cab. We got the shuttle bus & then rail to Disney Magic Kingdom which was free and took about 10 minutes. Our 2nd night we planned on using our resort credit in Davids Club restaurant but as we sat down and ordered drinks I was asked for ID which I didn't have on me as had left everything in our room as we didn't expect to need anything other than our room key that evening! I understand they do ask in but the staff were very rude when I said I didn't have it and refused to serve me, I'm 30 so don't normally come across this! (I didn't get asked for ID anywhere else throughout our time in Florida!) We decided to go and eat elsewhere as weren't happy with how they dealt with my lack of carrying passport! We went to Red Lobster across the road which was cheap and cheerful but also happy to give me a glass of wine :-) Next day we got a taxi to Universal which was about $15, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure are quite close together- about 5 minutes walking and there are plenty of restaurants on the walk in between! On our 3rd and final night in the hotel myself and my sister were exhausted after a couple of long days walking around the theme parks so went to bed about 10.30pm, just as we were falling asleep (about 11pm) there was a banging on our door, we ignored it as thought it might have been on next doors room but it was knocked on again so my sister got up and looked through the peephole, there didn't seem to be anyone there but as she walked away someone let themselves into our bedroom. It turned out to be housekeeping bringing us clean sheets which we hadn't requested! We couldn't believe someone would let themselves in at that time of night after someone hadn't answered the door- I'm just glad we heard the knocking otherwise it would have freaked us out even more!! We had ordered room service for breakfast on our final morning so that we could use our resort credit but when it was delivered we found out we couldn't use it- just another frustration!

We stayed 4 days/3 nights and our special included free breakfast at the resort buffet resurant overlooking the pool each day. They have an Incredible omelet station and the kids were treated like royalty thanks to Jessica their own personal dietitian....2 of our children have profound food allergies and Jessica and staff oversaw all their food prep and presentation with eagle eye details that won the hearts and tummies of the whole family. Then after spending the day by the fabulous pool/waterpark our package included an awsome dinner pool deck side for all. The food at all three onsite locations were not only delicious but the selection to choose from was stupendious. We truely loved the PURE room we had, the house keeping staff are not only quick and effecient they are also extremely courteous and repectful. All the staff that we encounted, which were numerous on this trip were above and beyound even the best Hilton standards. My children loved the lazy river, the pool basketball, the zero entry pool play area and especially the water SLIDE! As you may have quessed all of our family ages 4-9 for children loved this resort. On a side note, many of our family were ill on the first portion of this stay, the staff to our amazement made arrangements to provide us with in-room service of allergy freiendly popsicles, gingerale/soda's, crakers and anything else our little ones needed to help speed their recovery free of charge. That is service that goes further than than any other resort we have ever stayed in Orlando.

What could have been a huge inconvenience was handled professionally, courteously, and pleasantly by every Hilton employee I encountered. Not only did Hilton cover the night at the Omni, they also paid for taxi service to and from the Omni, and the first night's stay at the Hilton! Every employee apologized often and sincerely and asked repeatedly if there were anything else they could do. The rooms were immaculate, well-appointed, and well-maintained and the elevators were very efficient. The pools were very clean, spacious, and diverse and included a lazy river, quiet pool, slide, and fountains. As expected, the food was generally expensive, but surprisingly reasonable and of high quality at the poolside bar/cafe.

As you may see from our previous reviews (!) we are very picky about our hotels and what we like. We had a lovely week here. We loved the quiet pool & the pool bar for lunch. We had a room on 15th floor with an emperor bed which was fine & spacious.The bed was exceptionally comfy for a hotel bed. No bathrobes when we got there but they were quickly provided after speaking to Karim in the Executive Lounge. And wasn't he a gem ... nothing was too much trouble. He even tried to locate an I-pad 2 for our son. He and the ladies in the Lounge were always friendly and accommodating and a hotel is only as good as it's staff! We had only a couple of niggles ... one that the hotel did not provide it's own transport from the airport. We used Mears as recommended by the hotel and it was not a particularly efficient service. Then, on arrival at the hotel, we showed an email that invited us to check-in at the Exec Lounge and asked at the Bell Boy desk outside if we could get our pass for the Lounge to check-in there but was told that we had to get that from the Concierge inside. No offer of taking our suitcases inside. At this point we weren't impressed. But, inside our suitcases were taken, we were given a key to the Lounge checked in there and our suitcases were in the room when we got there. Perfect. The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard, but it would have helped if there had been two easy chairs to sit on rather than just the one when relaxing in the evening.

At check in we met one of the front desk managers (Britney?) and she was fantastic she said that they had noticed we were checking in for a long stay and wanted to make sure they made it as comfortable as possible. She even gave us a discount on the daily parking since we were staying for so long (10 days). The room was more than adequate for the two of us and it had a fridge and coffee maker which were both very handy for making hot water for instant oatmeal and storing cold drinks. The pool was also another perk that had attracted me to the Hilton, we only took advantage of the lazy river but the main pool or the kiddie area never appeared to be very busy. We only ate at the bistro restaurant down by the pool and that was for breakfast, the meal was tasty and made with good quality ingredients, they also had a buffet that we tried another day which was good too. Just a short drive down International drive there are many restaurants to chose from and there is a mcdonalds an ihop and a red lobster within easy walking distance.

I thoroughly researched all the hotels within a 5 mile vicinity including the Universal property hotels. After reading all the reviews and comparing the amenities I chose the Hilton Orlando and it exceeded my expectations from the minute we stepped foot on the property. Visually it is gorgeous...everything is brand new and meticulously maintained. Valet, check-in and bell-hop service are extremely efficient and very friendly. Loved the pool bar and menu since they offered more than just cheeseburgers and fried foods. Drink specials were yummy! My son loved the family pool slide and we both enjoyed the lazy river. Even though we were there for Memorial Day weekend, we could always find tubes to float in. After our first exhausting day at the park we had a wonderful dinner at Spencers. Our server, Jackie, was very knowledgeable about the menu and accommodating when my 5 year old started to get sleepy at the table. My steak dinner was comparable to Charley's or Burns (other well-known FL steakhouses). Breakfast at Bistro's was always very good. We tried the buffet one morning and I had my guilty pleasure of Eggs Benedict another day...both meals were excellent. The marketplace had great snacks, gelato and wine to go! One evening on our way back from the hotel, my son fell asleep so I had to carry him from the valet area up to our room. A bell hop saw me carrying my son, my bag and store bags and ran over to help me. He wouldn't even take a tip when we arrived at the room (but I insisted when we saw him the next day). I don't have any real complaints but would offer my realistic opinion. We had room-service twice...fast delivery but the food was mediocre and expensive (as with any hotel I have every visited). Also since I had a young child with me, I assume I was given a room in a part of the hotel that had children too...since I could hear them when we were in the room. Not terribly annoying to me but if this would bother you, I suggest requesting a room away from the families with younger children. There is also an adult pool which is quieter and away from the family pool too. The hotel was an easy 10 minute ride to Universal. We would leave at 8:30 for the 9am opening and never had traffic despite the holiday weekend. We would also leave mid-afternoon and easily come back after dinner for a few hours to enjoy the parks at night. Everyone was so friendly throughout our stay, knowledgeable about the amenities of the property and surrounding area and seemed to genuinely put service as the priority of their job.

Could we have a microwave, especially important with young children. 3. Could we have xtra bedsheets and towels available. 4. Could we check-in early, we arrived about 130PM. I am happy to say that all 4 requests were met but that is not all. The manager went above and beyond understanding how important a week it was for our family. He provided complimentary Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on our anniversary. He also went the extra mile to get a our daughter a Mickey stuffed animal (her favorite), bracelet, and other small gifts to make her first visit to Disney a memorable one. The manager also suprised us with a huge birthday cake, professionally decorated and covered with chocolate and fruit. It was awesome and the generosity really made our trip special.

The hilton has a lazy river, and tube slide, a private pool, a bar/restarunt that will serve you at the pool, giant tower and is well maintained. In addition, there is a full basketball, volleyball courts, and a putting green for non -pool folks. My daughter loved the pool. It was a great break from the crowds at disney to go to the pool in the middle of the day when its hottest. Then we would return to Disney at night. They provide free floaties and balls and have basket you can shoot at in the pool. Hilton also has a full service concierge who can help you find great resturant nearby or if you want to find out about Downtown Disney shops. They will make reservations for you and help you obtain transportation if you need it. They were a nice resource and helped us during our stay. The hilton also has really good food in the hotel. We ate at all four resturants during our stay. I'd recommend the Bistro for breakfast (great but a little pricey), Spencers has great prime steaks, salads, and a dynamite chocolate souffle, David's is a nice bar/rst with good food, and the marketplace is pricey but will have what you need. The convienece of having good food in the hotel when we were tired from spending all day at the parks was great. My family and I will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Disney. So if you want a great room and great service and want to be away from the Disney crowds, this is an ideal place for families. Car trip to Disney 15 minutes on average. The only thing I would like to have in the hotel that you don't is FREE WIFI. But if your visiting Disney, you will not have much time to use it anyway.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAwesome pool, great restaurant, nice location\u201d", "Author": "samanne", "ReviewID": "UR109123135", "Content": "The pool area is awesome!

Our 3-night stay was very comfortable and relaxing to say the least. The hotel still looks and smells brand new. From the moment we pulled in to get our suitcases situated, the valets and bellhops were very friendly and directed me to the front desk. The parking concourse was self- sufficient and adequately spaced. Check in was a matter of seconds and being a hilton honors member, I requested an upgrade. Unfortunately, the upgrades were not available, but my 10.00 a day parking fee was waived! Our room was on the 17th floor and provided a nice view of the city. The amenities in the room included a mini-friedge, in-room safe, LCD with several channels and pay-per-view. Additionally, there was an MP3 compatible alarm clock, lounging chair, work desk, coffee maker and phone with voice mail. The bed was very comfortable with several pillows and the sheets were changed daily. The bathroom was immaculate, consisting of a large vanity mirror with a granite base. The floor and shower were lined with a beautiful tile. In short, the room itself was fresh, modern, and clean. Undoubtedly, this is a business hotel as it connects to the convention center. However, this is a great place for families and romantic getaways. During my first night, I went down to the sports bar and ordered a hamburger and fries. As a hotel guest, the charges were added to my checkout bill. I did take the time to explore the hotel and its amenities (this hotel is massive)! While I didn't get to everything, I can say: the pool is wonderful (the pictures don't do it justice). The ballroom is something to behold. The conference rooms are innumerable and well equipped. In summation, this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. This hotel can suit many needs, but the key as always is doing your homework and learning what the hotel is and what it has to offer. I made my decision to stay here in part because of tripadvisor reviews and pictures, and in part the hilton description and incredible rate I received. Some things to be aware of are the daily parking fee, the charge for wired and wireless internet, and the fact that this hotel can be very busy at times. It is in a great location off International drive, convenient to 1-4 and all the parks and outlets. Restaurants are in relative walking distance, though the hotel has plenty on-site.

She was so helpful with all of our questions and gave us great recommendations throughout our stay. She definitely added to the overall great experience we had. The standards at the hotel were very high. Within a 5-10 minute drive we found great restaurants & attractions along with Sea World / Aquatica minutes away. I would definitely stay here again.

We booked the Hilton Orlando based on Tripadvisor's good reviews and on the inviting photographs of the hotel's pool. When we arrived the lobby was full of people and we were told that there was a cheerleading competition at the nearby Convention Center and thus many teenaged girls staying at the hotel. In addition there were several other large groups holding conventions and staying there as well. I was dismayed and ready to leave imagining a long weekend of screaming teens and no sleep. Instead our room on the Executive Floor was far away from any of the choas and I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel that was quieter or where I got better sleep. The beds were comfortable, the room very clean and quiet. There was one day by the pool where there were a lot of people but since the pool area is so spaced out, it never was an issue and we had no trouble finding chairs and while there were a zillion middle school girls miling around, it was never obnoxious. As part of our Executive Floor room, we enjoyed access to the Executive Lounge, which I highly recommend. It was great to get up in the morning and head down to the lounge where we enjoyed good coffee and a continental breakfast. In the afternoon they offered snacks and an honor system bar. Though we didn't use the bar, we did like being able to have late afternoon snacks to hold us over until dinner. The hotel staff that worked the lounge were very friendly, helpful and courteous as was the front desk staff as well.

Location was great, quick access to the major roads and highway. Arrived at 7:00 pm and was quickly checked in, everyone was very nice and friendly. Asked about the local Publix and was given directions to one that was just a few minutes away. Was given room 406, with a view of the pool. Room was nice and clean, fridge was off, turned it on and put my groceries away and it quickly cooled down. Beds were very comfortable, pillows were nice and fluffy, but by the morning, they were flat, if they stayed fluffy, they would have been perfect. Access to the convention center was great. Had major thunderstorms come through and the covered walkway was wonderful! I felt bad for all those that had to cross International Drive in the rain to get to their hotel. Unfortunately due to the rains, was unable to use the pool or the lazy river, though they did look fabulous the last day of my stay, the only sunny day. Only one thing made me a little upset, I asked the concierge about the Disney Outlet stores, she didn't even let me finish and she just said - Downtown Disney. So again, I said, no, I am looking for the outlet stores, do you know which one might be better. She curtly said, there is only one. I said, oh I was not aware the other one closed. She said, go to Vineland. OK....obviously she was not having a good day, no directions or anything. So I asked, well could you tell me which outlet mall is closer? Her response - both. I knew that the one on the northern end was opened, so I went there. I never saw the young lady again, as I wanted to let her know she was giving out wrong information. Speaking of Disney, it was just a little less than 10 miles and less than 15 minutes to get to EPCOT drive if you were wondering. You could see Seaworld from the top floor of the convention center, so that was very near as well.

After a truly horrendous nights stay at a sister hotel 4 hours drive away, I rang this hotel asking if it would be possible to check in early (we'd made the reservation some weeks previously). The staff member, on hearing the reason why I was requesting an early check in was most accommodating & in her soothing tones assured us we could. The journey took longer than anticipated & we arrived approx 2.30pm. At the desk I said my name & that I'd rung requesting early check in but, as it turned out, it wasn't that early after all. The staff member said that our room wasn't ready!!! I could have wept, we were sleep deprived & feeling very emotional & I now felt a twit for believing what I'd been soothingly told over the 'phone in the morning. The check in girl apologised but reiterated that our 'room type' wasn't ready. There was nothing we could do. We went for a lunch at the outside restaurant in the shade & that revived us. At 3pm the assistant rang my cell to let me know the room was ready & she would bring the key to us. I was relieved I didn't have to traipse back to reception. When the staff member arrived, she apologised again & said that we could have a credit towards out meal for being let down. This we appreciated, thank you. It wasn't the biggest deal that our room wasn't ready, but it was an issue as I'd rung to clarify the situation - & we were so sleep deprived, which wasn't their fault. Our room was on the top floor with fabulous views & it was spotlessly clean & the bed looked so inviting. That evening,at the front desk, I paid to use the computer to complete OLCI for our flight next evening. There is free internet access but only if you have your own laptop which I didn't, also, I don't know if that only applies to executive rooms - sorry. I tried to complet OLCI but the screen came up with ' we are unable to check you in at this time, please check in as usual at the airport'. Eeek! We didn't want to be bumped from what I knew was a stacked flight. There was nothing we could do. We returned to the front desk a while later to pay to use the computer again to complete OLCI & got chatting to a really nice employee, Matthew, at the Hhonors desk. I told him why we were going to use the computer again & he said he'd try the airline on his computer, we really appreciated this kind gesture. However, no luck, we'd just have to try again in the morning. We stopped a while & chatted & we said how lovely this hotel was, from the beautifully kept fllodlit grounds to the firepits to sit by & enjoy the evening air. Then we asked if we could book a late check out. Matthew said that we could have until 1pm complimentary or 3pm for $100. We decided this was a reasonable price to pay to enjoy all that this hotel has to offer so we agreed to pay the $100. As he was starting to carry out the task we said that we were so pleased to be at this hotel after the truly horrendous stay at a sister hotel. When we explained all that had gone on, he could hardly believe wahat we were saying.( However, you couldn't make it up) He very, very kindly said he'd waive the late check out fee for the distress that we had had to endure. I could have cried (again) for his kindness. He said that it was to begin to restore our faith in the Hilton group. We were nigh on speechless. Thank you Matthew, for being a truly outstanding member of staff & representative, no, ambassador for the Hilton group. I think I stood there with my mouth open wide like a total ejit. If I did, sorry!! We finally bid goodnight to Matthew & had a wonderful nights sleep. In the morning we had a delicious breakfast in the executive lounge with the complimentary Sunday papers in a quiet area, although the lounge generally was quite busy. Having said that, there was plenty of room & lots of fresh food to eat for everyone. We went down to reception after breakfast to pay agian for computer use & the receptionist said she'd try for us, thank you. However, still no joy (all turned out ok, we'd been moved to exit row in the bubble & the airline just needed to know that we were fit enough in the event of an emergency to operate the exit doors). We lounged by the quiet pool all morning reading. We ordered lunch from one of the frequently passing staff & it was good service & an excellent lunch. We relunctantly checked out late afternoon wishing that we could have stayed a few more nights. It's very weird at first walking around the hotel in casual attire with folks in black tie passing by but after a while you think nothing of it, after all this is the USA - love it!

The pool and lazy river were one of the highlights of our trip. Both were sparkling clear and the perfect temperature. Lots of big towels and plenty of lounge chairs. Petty annoyances included a few obnoxious unsupervised schoolboys (parents nowhere to be found) and randomly placed water canons along the lazy river that blasted you with cold water (they kind of ruined the relaxing effect). Service at the poolside bar/grill was very good. They even have sno cones for the kids. There is a very nice gift shop (for last minute souvenirs) and coffee/deli type place on the lobby level.

From the concierge to the parking attendance and especially the executive lounge...top-notch people. Finally, the location is perfect.

The food served at the conference and in the executive center was very good and served by smiling staff members who were happy to assist in any way they could.

I really liked the super-rich body lotion and the silk-smooth, clean(!) duvet cover, as well as the comfortable mattress and pillows. Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the room each day and even left a hand-written thank you note for each day's tip. Rooms were quiet and parking was easily accessible.

No big deal really, though. It is a convention hotel, the regular lobby isn't very large, but there's a pretty big walk-around area towards the convention side with some shops and restaurants/bars along the way. The pool area was definitely the best part of the hotel. The lazy river looked nice (though we didn't get in) and the main pool was large and not crowded. There is an \"adult\" pool towards the side with an adjoining hot tub which was much less crowded. The hot tubs were awesome and the fire pits outside were also a nice touch. There were serving marshmallows, graham crackers and chocolate by the fire pits to make smores which I thought was a cute/cozy addition which separates it from a stuffy/business-type convention hotel feel.

The room was great and the bed very comfortable. The pool area was the best that I have seen at a hotel. The gym was very nice, as was the salon/spa (although the spa is pretty pricey). As diamond members, we were put on the executive level floor, which offered free breakfast and hors d'ouevres each night, and given free gym access (which would be $10/day) and internet access (which would be $15/day, I think). We ate at the Bistro, which was very tasty, but honestly we did most of our eating in the executive lounge, where it was free, and that food was quite good. The only kind of negative is the location. The hotel is kind of off by itself, with nothing much in walking distance. If your main goal is visiting the Disney attractions, you'd probably be better off in a Disney property, but if you're traveling for relaxation or a conference, that doesn't matter as much.

I ordered the panini of the day and received a grilled ham and cheese that wasn't even hot in the middle with no accompanying flavors to round out the salty meat. The burger place had nice atmosphere, but both app and main course were disappointing and even hard to finish. Room service breakfast, though, was excellent and at the perfect temp.

It's nearly brand new and everything about the place is gleaming and in tip top shape. The staff included. The pool is amazing. They have three pools: a \"quiet\" pool (*not* kid free though, and definitely not smoke free), a very large main \"family\" pool complete with basketball hoops and a decent water slide. And a lazy river. The lazy river is fun for kids and adults alike, seriously fun! Also, there are hundreds of lounge chairs, it's not a problem finding one. Many of them are positioned in filtered sun so this can be good or bad probably depending on the time of the year. Finding a lounger that faces full sun that's not filtered can actually take some work, and not because of overpopulation but just because so many of them are in partial shade or facing the wrong direction. There is also waiter service at the pool, though they didn't come too frequently and we found it just as easy to walk to the pool's bar/grill to get ourselves our beer and what nots. They have a bacon cheeseburger and hand cut fries at the pool grill that's good and at $13 not a bad deal. Import beer was $6/pint, not bad for a Hilton. They didn't seem to mind having beers in the lazy river even. The only thing I saw them say \"no\" to anyone about was having a glass bottle near the pool, but they put everything in plastic when they serve it to you if they know you're going to the pool. The pool area also has some other recreation activities, all free, including volleyball, miniature golf (on real grass), pool tables, and foosball. The spa facilities and gym are $10/day/person for a day pass, but HHonors gold+ members get that complimentary. Even if you're paying $10/day, if you want a gym it's totally worth it. Their gym is as nice as any high end gym I've ever seen, complete with Precor AMT machines even. The spa facilities included the typical upscale locker room and showers, and steam room (inside each locker room, none of it is shared). They have the largest steam room I've ever seen in my life, though there was no button to turn the steam on and it didn't come on too frequently. HHonors gold+ also get complimentary access to the executive lounge, of course, which gets you free breakfast and snacks at night (they had pizzas one night when we went on a weekend night, on weekdays my SO told me the food was better--beef wellington even). Rooms are very nice. Fairly typical but nice. Nice high end tile work in the bathrooms. Nice tall shower head. The in room wireless worked really well, and it was fast ($15/day, unless you're HHonors). Nightly turn down service. Parking is $12/day for self park with full in/out privileges. (The convention center's parking next door is $11/day with no in/out). The convention center is directly adjacent, connected via walkways. Even the furthest end of the convention center isn't too far and the walkway has speed-walks part of the way. If you're wanting to get off the Hilton property, \"The Pointe\" is probably a 15 minute walk where you can pick from any number of both chain and non-chain restaurants and shopping. The room rate itself was super reasonable. We actually left the nearby Rosen Plaza early because it was so gross, and the Hilton was cheaper even when you factor in the parking fee. Incredible, as the Hilton is 1000 times nicer. I'd suspect their rates are probably going to be going up if they become more popular, but for now it's highly recommended! Cons: This place nearly glamorizes over-consumption and I didn't see a single recycling bin the entire time I was there. Other neighboring hotels have in-room recycling even. The pool area is several acres, how hard would it be to install a single recycling bin somewhere outside, or inside for that matter? HHonors members definitely get more value out of staying here than someone who doesn't have HHonors status. It's a Hilton, so they nickel and dime you for everything if you're not of a certain HHonors level. But even so, at the room rate they're charging, you're still getting a good deal. It's fantastic if you are a HHonors member with status, though, you get so much more. Also, chain smokers at the pool are at times hard to avoid. This was particularly annoying at the \"quiet\" pool (which had kids in it, btw, quiet is not the same as \"kid free\" I guess). It was impossible to sit anywhere in the quiet pool and not have to smell a nearby smoker's nastiness.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Service, Amenities and Location\u201d", "Author": "Atlanta1958", "ReviewID": "UR85090910", "Content": "I had stayed one night at a competing hotel along the International Drive strip that was not up to par, so I started checking and was able to grab a room at the Hilton - and with my AAA discount, a MUCH better deal.

We had booked our trip in January so surely there could have been notice of the outbooking procedure. We were obviously extremely disappointed and very tired. We had travelled with a teenager and a baby so it was not the best situation. We did agree with the manager to split our stay and did eventually stay at this hotel.

Apart from this you have two large pools, two whirls pools and a water-slide - great for children. The food at the pool war was great and they have a great choice of drinks and several draft beers :-) Should you think of travelling to this place, you should treat yourself to an upgrade on the Executive Floor (19th floor). Apart from better rooms, complimentary breakfast and soft drinks and a goureous view you will enjoy the hospitality of Chris, who looks after the Executive Lounge and who is very friendly and helpful in all matters and arranges everything for you with a smile on his face. Make sure that you book well in advance or be flexible with you dates so that you can get a King Bed Room Executive Floor for about US$ 160.00. If you have bad luck and there is a convention going on, you will have to pay US$ 300.00 for the same room.

Our room, #1806 was directly under the foyer of the executive lounge where there are wooden floors. Every morning we where woken up by the foot steps (women high heals) walking back and forth on the wood floors. The \"view\" that we we paid extra for was very limited unless we turned our heads 45 degrees. If you reserve a room at this hotel, be sure that you do not get room 1806.

We had to rent ours $10 a day at bonnet creek. Towels are free, the hot tubs are actually hot and there is 3 pools to choose from. The quiet pool is actually kept quiet and is seperated from the main area which is rather enjoyable. - Desk staff (the staff in general) here are the nicest friendliest staff I have had the pleasure to deal with when being in a hotel this size. Everybody makes a point to ask how your day is or strike up small talk without being annoying or pushy. The desk staff accomidated our every request and actually remembered who we were during the whole stay. I know its a minor thing but hey it was noticed. - Tennis courts, exercise room etc - We actually got to use the tennis court and its nice and new and well situated. I could see and issue in the cooler months of actually getting time on there because there is only one court. Exercise room wasn't used during our stay but its free to Hilton silver level members.....though i do have an issue with being charged at all. Equipment looks all brand new and situated in a nice well lit room. - Location: Covered access walkway to the main orlando convention hall which is right across the street. Located in short driving distance to sandlake road and all of the needed restraunts and entertainment. Heck i avoided I-4 my whole stay and for people who have used I-4 before thats a big deal. Cons: - Pay to park is still dumb in my oppinion. $12 a day here which is cheaper then bonnet creek but still a pain. We're used to having to pay to park so we expect it but be warned none the less. No level of honnors gets you free parking :\\ - Pay for gym and internet..... again tad bit on the nickle and dimming side of things....When paying $100 plus a night we should be allowed to use such things at no charge, at least offer a slower version of internet for nothing, I'd be happy with that. - Noise: Walls are thinner then bonnet creek resort. not the point its unberable....we sept like logs all night. But if you have a noisier neighbor do expect to hear them a bit, also per usual the doors are heavy and tend to slam shut. - Not a major issue but i did notice the sheets still had a stain in some places on them, looked like makeup. Just saying if its visible like that on the top of the sheet housekeeping should have seen it and changed it right away, in their defense it was gone the second day so i was happy about that. -- Hilton Orlando is a great resort hotel and very enjoyable we will gladly be back and I even suggested it to a few friends and family members.

I will not be returning to the Hilton Orlando. I returned from my vacation this morning so disappointed in my personal experiences at this hotel. I am a fairly young man at 23 years of age, and decided to travel to Orlando with my significant other on a R&R trip before beginning grad school later this week. I did admit I was a bit young, but I do not find it acceptable or will not tolerate being looked down upon and mistreated because of that. The Concierge were the group of people we had problems and disputes with. KC, Laura, Mary and Kim. KC is fairly new to his job, but will try his best to help you with a smile on his face. The other 3 ladies have disregarded us, snapped at us in annoyance, hung up multiple times over the phone while trying to get some information from outside the hotel, rarely ever gave us correct information and treated us with NO respect. They acted more like clerks than a concierge team, more than willing to take our money when it came to purchasing tickets through them (Universal Studios, Disney World and shuttles), but that is all they did for us. I've dealt with a few 4-Diamond hotels in my time, and the concierge at this hotel were by far the worst. If you are from Orlando, know your way around and plan to spend most of your time within the hotel, this is a great place for you. But if you are from out of town looking for support in your stay, and would like to get the full experience of your trip... Please reconsider, because you will not find it here. -About a 15-20 dollar cab ride to Disney, Universal and Seaworld. -Restaurants are upscale and classy, visited all of them during our stay. A bit pricey, some more than others, but it was good food. -Cabana was $100 dollars to rent, worthwhile in my opinion. Complimentary drinks in mini-fridge, television, 2 pretty comfortable chairs and telephone. -Clean fitness center, was always quiet when I went at night. -Nice rooms for the price you pay. -Room service was better than expected, they were more than willing to work with the time restraints on some of the food I ordered (was able to order lunch during dinner times etc.) $4.50 delivery charge and 22% gratuity added to every order. -The Marketplace within the hotel has an excellent variety of food/snacks/drinks. Prices are a little higher than twice what you would pay at the grocery store. -Paid $14.95 a day for Wi-Fi which I feel should have been included. There are a handful of other hotels within the same area, take my advice and shop around a bit. It is not a cheap decision to make and will definitely want to make sure you get what you're paying for!", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat lazy river and pool\u201d", "Author": "micaryan62", "ReviewID": "UR75119250", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Hilton for one night after a week at the beach as we were flying through Orlando. Check in was very quick. There were a lot of people in the lobby waiting for check in, however, they were staffed up and I only had to wait a few minutes. I was lucky they had a room ready as we arrived before 4pm. Employee at check in was very nice. Only issue I had was they gave me a regular room when I had reserved a room on the Executive floor. I caught this before I left and she quickly changed my room. We spent the afternoon at the pool. It is a great pool. Huge and wonderful water slide. The lazy river was awesome. I thought I'd have to pay to rent a tube, but they were letting people use them for free. The only issue I had the entire trip was not really the fault of the hotel (although I think maybe they could have monitored the area a little better) was at the lazy; river. Some older kids would take two or three tubes and stack them up and ride around the river that way. Meanwhile, my kids and others were waiting for a tube. Also, because there were not tubes available a lot of older kids were just using it like a swimming pool and going around it with no tubes and running into my kids on the tubes. There were snowcones available poolside for $2 which was a nice treat for my kids. After spending the afternoon at the pool, we changed and went to the executive lounge. I normally don't spend the extra to stay at this level, but due to a nice special we got through Travelzoo I spent the extra. It was money well spent. The lounge was open from 5-8 pm. They had a nice assortment of food which we turned into our dinner before going to Downtown Disney. My son loved the chicken wings. They also had flatbread with some good toppings, nice vegetable tray, some sort of dessert, cheese and crackers. I am sure I am forgetting some of the other food out. Also had bottled water. We went back the next morning for breakfast and it was wonderful. Homemade oatmeal, muffins, bagels, nice assortment of dry cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt and yummy granola to name a few. Staff was very nice in this lounge and resplenishedt the food often and came to clear our plates when we went back for 2nds. The best part was they gave me a late checkout when I asked. We stayed out pretty late at Downtown Disney and when we got back around midnight I nicely asked if there was any late checkouts available. The lady checked her computer and asked if 12:30 would work? That extra 1.5 hours made a big difference as we could sleep in, eat breakfast and not feel rushed to pack up and get out.

We booked this hotel as part of a 5 day SeaWorld/Aquatica/Busch Gardens package through SeaWorld. The package included length of stay tickets to the parks and 5 nights at the hotel for $895. Which means that with hotel parking ($12 a day for self parking) our hotel cost was less than $60 a night! Check in/out: Check in was at 4:00 on Sunday 07/18/10 and every thing was perfect. We got upgraded to a pool view, and the guy at check in put us at the end of the hall next to the stairs \"blacony\" so that we could sit outside and see all of the area's nightly fireworks. Check out was smooth and everything was in order. The hotel: The hotel is really nice and self parking is very convienient. The room was a normal 2 queen room. The TV and fridge were really nice, but other than that the room was normal. Where this hotel is set apart from others is in thier friendly staff ( everyone was incredibly nice and upbeat without being over the top and insincere) and their amazing pool! The pictures do not do the pool justice!!! Hilton hit the nail on the head with this huge family pool! The lazy river is awesome (we liked it better than the one at Aquatica), zero entry on both ends is great, pool side foosball and pool tables at the pool bar, the water basketball court and slide are really cool for both kids and adults. There is also an \"adults only\" pool and hot tub which means that parents don't have to constantly tell thier children to settle down in the pool. Food: As usual on site dining and room service are extremely expensive so we opted to eat elsewhere. There are plenty of resturants close by - I wouldn't say within walking distance, however I did see some people walking. Cons:1) I called down on Sunday night to check on shuttle times for SeaWorld the next day (they offer complimentary shuttle service) and was given the wrong time so we missed the shuttle we intended to take. We ended up taking the last shuttle of the morning. 2) The beds had a line of food crumbs around them from where the vaccuum didn't clean well. 3) Internet is $15 a day - I know that most \"nicer\" hotels charge for internet, yet for the life of me I can't figure out why in this day and age... Tips: 1) If you stay here and plan on going to SeaWorld and/or Aquatica, take the shuttle in the am and a cab in the pm. A cab ride is around $10 with tip, whereas parking is $12 and with the shuttles and cab you get picked up/dropped off up front! 2) The hotel offers towels for the pool, so don't worry about bringing your own.

The executive lounge is open from 6:30 am to 10pm and is staffed by very friendly and upbeat personnel. The benefit of having access to this lounge is enormous! You have access to a continental breakfast everyday from 6:30 to 11;00. Cereal, bread, bagels, croissants, danishes, fresh fruit, very, very tasty orange juice, milk, etc. are all served here. There's a machine that serves capuccino, lattes, etc. as well. Then there's snacks after breakfast, which includes cookies, etc. My husband and I really liked the hor d'oeuvres at dinner time. At times there were ribs, wings, chicken fingers, pizza, shrimp balls, ravioli, etc. It was always hot and fresh. Then if this weren't enough, desserts were served at 8pm, which included a wide assortment of mini cakes and pastries. There's free bottled water and if you bring your laptop with you, there's free Intenet access in the lounge also. And if you stay on the executive lounge this perk is all FREE!!!!

The weights included machines, as well as free weights. We've never seen such a nice gym at any other hotel, and we've stayed at quite a few in the 12 plus countries we've travelled to.

The atmosphere at David's is pleasant and upscale and they have a decent selection of draft and microbrew bottles. The staff at the hotel are truly excellent and customer-friendly. I've been impressed with their positive attitude and willingness to help. For workouts, there is a top-notch gym with good locker room including shower and sauna facilities. Other than nickel and diming on things like in-room high-speed internet which apply to most full-service hotels, the Hilton Orlando is my hotel of choice if attending a convention or even as a base for sight-seeing as it's relatively close to Universal, Disney and Sea World.

The staff at the hotel are very accommodating and knowledgeable and will help in any way they can.

The Lobby Area also contains a snack shop/market shop with sandwiches, wine/beer/coffee and other items and all are also reasonably priced. Parking was $13. I would stay at this hotel again and feel that the comfort, convenience, and pool area alone are well worth the cost of parking!

She sat with us for approximately 20 minutes helping us plan our weekend adventure. We told her that we had planned on going to SeaWorld one day and Universal the next. She told us what the best rides were and what time we should consider doing them so as to avoid the hot sun. She even gave us maps of SeaWorld and Universal to take with us. It was very nice how much attention she gave us, she kept insisting that she wanted us to have a wonderful and relaxing time and thus we did. That evening we had dinner at Spencer's, a steak restaurant in the property, it was delicious! Our waitress was so sweet. She arranged for us to have a romantic candlelight dinner on the small terrace just for the two of us. After our dinner we had a scrumptious surprise waiting for us. Christine had arranged to have chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne sent to our room. Her note indicated that she wanted us to start our vacation with a bang!

I will say it was the most relaxing weekend I've had in a while. We arrived at 11am and there was a room was ready. The room was spotless. Bed was very very comfortable as was the leather side chair. Plenty of soft towels and pillows are provided in the room. The room also has blackout curtains which rocked. We slept in until 10am and didn't even know it. We stayed at the pool for most of our stay and it was nice. They provide beach towels down by the pool and always had clean ones ready. The drink/food service at the pool was quick and consistent. Our drinks were never empty. I was amazed at the cleanliness of the pool. There was always staff walking around straightening up chairs or picking up old towels. The hotel as a whole was very well staffed and cleaned. Elevators in the hotel were quick. At night the pool area has fire pits where you can sit and enjoy a drink. The waterslide was fun. It closes at 9pm and the rest of the pool area stays open until 11pm. During the day there were several people at the pool but it never felt crowded. The pool area is also very active at night because the bar is there and stays open late. This hotel does have a very \"conventiony/business\" feel to it which I expected. Only thing I did not like was at check out we were charged $12 to self park. A charge I was never told about. I don't think I've ever stayed somewhere where they charge guests to park. You have to show your room key every time you leave or come in the parking garage. On the day you check out you have to show parking garage security your bill proving that you're checked out in order to leave the garage, that was weird to me. I agree with the below poster that security is constantly walking around the place which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you see it.

This is a new hotel and the beds are really comfortable, the rooms spacious and TVs huge, although I never got to watch anything. The only thing I found strange was there were no glasses in the bathroom, when I inquired they said that they took them out because people were breaking them, well then put in plastic ones! After brushing your teeth you don't want to lean down and suck water out of a faucet. I also thought that the martini prices were way high at $16 dollars and they ranged from $12-$14-$16 depending on who the bartender was, that was strange. And I felt that there were way too many security people dressed in white everywhere, made me think that there was a lot of crime, it did not make me feel like I was safe as management thought after I asked them about it. I have never seen so many security people in any hotel in my travels over the last twenty years. In fact, I even stayed at the St Regis when the Ayatollah of Iran stayed there and did not see so much security. What I really liked was the seating and smoking areas in front of the hotel they were a really nice Oasis for us smokers, that was much appreciated. The majority of the staff especially bar staff were all good looking and obviously hand picked for the glamor effect. I did eat a burger the first night and appreciated that the bar served food until midnight that was nice. And I really loved the free pool at Davids and took advantage of it between meetings later in the afternoon that was fun.

The Goods.... *New hotel. Spotlessly clean. Super quiet in the hallways. Never heard another word from the rooms next to ours. The lobby, however, is a bit loud and noisy alllllll the time due to this hotel being attached to the Orange County Convention Center and catering, for the most part, to conventions. The week we were there - May 10th to the 14th, 2010 - was the same week the Department of Defense convention and two others were going-on which was apparently a \"big\" deal to the employeees *The hotel has a jogging/walking track out front. If you look at one of the pictures I posted, you can see part of it. It was being used quite regularly. *The gym was being utilized by several people every time I walked by and the view from the gym is probably fairly decent for the runners ~ because they can see all the people walking by in swimsuits going to the pool! HA *The hotel basically has a waterpark attached which is completely free and there is ALWAYS room for you to find a covered lounge chair or a seat around the bar. The \"waterpark\" area (as I refer to it) is THREE huge pools (one is adults only), a waterslide and a lazy river that is quite amazing. There is a pool bar/restaurant in the middle of all this and many people ate dinner or had hot wings and beer, etc out by the pool a lot. Very popular area but never felt crowded. The staff at the pool are fantastic. One hotel employee spent 30 minutes or so talking to my husband one evening while he was watching people in the lazy river and just helping with the rafts and such. They are \"supposed\" to close at 10pm but people were still enjoying the pool areas so they were still open at 11pm the night we left. Very nice. Also, the lady that was sitting at the top of the water slide was SUPER nice ~ I was concerned about going down because I was an adult and she said \"O! You go! You go down once, you come back 10 times!\" I laughed and went down and then practically ran up the stairs to go again. She laughed at me! She was correct!! Also, there are PLENTY of free, BIG towels for EVERYONE to use and they don't check them out to you, they aren't chintzy about it, they simply ask you if you want one or two or you can take them yourself. I have to say ~ the staff in the water area have the right attitude. It was fantastic out there whether it was 2pm or 10pm. Great job! *This hotel's location is fantastic. It is literally a 3 to 5 minute walk to I-drive and another minute to the I Ride Trolley stop. You can buy I Ride Trolley passes at the concierge desk - a week pass for unlimited rides, transfers, etc is only $8 per person. The I Ride Trolley will take you up and down I-drive anywhere you want to go and there is a map and list of places they go at every stop. The trolley is clean, quick, and super-safe. We walked to the trolley every day and went up and down I-drive to the IMAX cinema, to lots of different restaurants, to the grocery store, to the mall, etc. If you don't want to take the trolley, you can walk to IHOP, Denny's, Red Lobster, McDonald's, the gas station, and a small supermarket ~ all withiin 10 minutes away or less. SUPER easy to navigate. Once families with children learn about this hotel's location and the free waterpark, there will be more tourists here. For now, it is mainly all convention attendees. The Not~so~Goods... *The rooms are not as big as some other new Hiltons out there. We stayed at a new Hilton in Branson earlier this year (and we'll be staying there again in September) and their rooms and bathrooms, especially, are much bigger. *Room service is insanely expensive, even for a hotel. $4.50 surcharge on every order plus a 22% gratuity mandatory. I ordered a cobbler and wanted some ice cream ~sorry, you can buy a pint for $9 or none at all. Lame. *The Internet service in the rooms are not setup for wireless. There is a cable in your room for you to plug-in to your laptop and use. Then, it works great. Without this cable, you can forget it. I realize this is a semi no-big-deal BUT I like to sit on the bed and surf while my husband is sleeping. This was inconvenient because the cable is short and the plug is located on the desk. So, you have to set at the desk to use Internet. Even though the Internet specialist was nice when I called her, she actually said to me \"Who uses wireless these days anyway??\" Ummmm.... me. Our entire house is wireless. We have NOTHING wired. I didn't know people didn't use wireless. Kinda strange, I thought. The UGLY... DISCLAMIER ~ The three things below irked me, big time. It made me think I would probably not stay in this hotel again. It almost makes me wonder if we are going to keep our Hilton Honors account. Having said that... we are NEW Hilton Honors members so I'm sure we weren't treated nearly as well as Diamond members would be. However, because we travel a lot, we stayed in a Hilton in Branson we liked and we'll probably stay in a couple (maybe 3) more times this year and we thought we'd try to book Hiltons anywhere we go now. If I book another Hilton that acts like this Hilton, we won't bother. So... Ugly #1 - We booked this hotel February 16, 2010 as part of a flight package with Allegiant Air. I called the Hilton prior to pre-paying and asked about a smoking room because my husband smokes and it is MANDATORY that we get a smoking room. No problem, they said. I booked with Allegiant Air as a flight/hotel package. I called three days later and verified with Hilton that we would indeed get a SMOKING room. I also made sure I updated our Hilton Honors account with our top three preferences ~ Smoking, King Bed, and High Floor. All I really cared about was the smoking and I actually put that in the comments at the time we reserved the room. One week before we were to leave for our vacation (Sunday, May 2, 2010), I called the hotel directly to verify we were definitely being put in a SMOKING room. Yes, we were. We fly-in and go to check-in and he goes to verify our room and says \"two doubles blah blah blah\" and I say \"I don't mind how many beds we have as long as the room is smoking.\" He tells me we were not reserved for a smoking room and \"only 1% of our rooms are smoking.\" I told him I had called and verified this already. He couldn't help me because \"we have a big Department of Defense convention here this week.\" Well, that's fine but we have a smoking room reserved. No. I ask for the manager or we are leaving. (We would have left, btw, no doubt about it) The manager says they have no smoking rooms. I tell him how I had called ahead. He says he cannot help me. So, I tell him I will have to find a room elsewhere. We stepped aside and I got my phone out and I was prepared to call the Hilton Honors main number first and if that didn't help, call Allegiant and move our room to another hotel as Hilton was by far NOT the cheapest package we could have gotten. As I am starting to dial (literally) he comes over and says they have a room that we MAY get but he'll have to go check and see if it smells like smoke or not. He says it is a room next to a smoking room and if it smells like smoke, we get it. If it doesn't, we don't. Guess what?? It smelled like smoke. So, he comes down and tells us we can have the room but then he basically admonishes us with a \"shame on you\" type of attitude and tells us had the room not smelled like smoke, we would have been out of luck. I will NOT write my opinion of this BS. You get ONE chance to make a FIRST impression and this just about RUINED it for me. I am livid just thinking about that situation. Ugly #2 - If you are a tourist or you want any information about SeaWorld, Universal Studios, Airboat tours, Disney, the I Ride Trolley, etc.... forget about asking the concierge desk. Seriously. They sell tickets to everything. We actually got two tickets to Universal and two I Ride Trolley weekly passes through them ~ very convenient. But the information??? Useless. One blonde girl actually told us \"I live here. I've never been on the trolley.\" They couldn't even tell us where the trolley stop was ~ and we quickly learned (on our own) that is literally a 3 to 5 minute walk around the side of the hotel!!! We asked about the parks?? Nope. Hadn't been there. Didn't know. What was the best way to get to Universal Studios?? They didn't know. Does the trolley go to Universal?? Again, no clue. This same blonde girl says, as the guy next to her is shaking his head like he has NO CLUE, \"Even though I live here, I've never been to these places.\" Then WHY are you working at a concierge desk??????????????????? Seriously. The ONLY person that had a clue abou ANYTHING was one girl, one morning, with brown hair, and she had a tag on her shirt that said \"Lead Concierge\" and I'm thinking she was the lead because she had actually been to one of the parks. The ONLY thing the other less-than-informed concierge employees could do was point to a fancy book of places to eat and tell us they could call and make reservations for us. Seriously. I suppose these people are trained for conventions. Tourists, beware. Ugly #3 - The I Ride Trolley stops at 10:30pm every night. Husband and I got stuck at a restaurant too late one night. I-drive EMPTIES about 11:00 pm and getting a taxi is IMPOSSIBLE. I used my Iphone and called two taxi places with NO answer. I finally called the Hilton and asked if they could call us a cab. She got directions to where we were at and my phone number and said she would call right away for us. Twenty-one minutes later, with husband and I waiting outside by the curb and getting quite concerned at this late hour, Yellow Cab calls me wanting to know our exact location. I made a comment about how much longer and you know what he told me???? He said the hotel had JUST called them. JUST called them. Seriously. I looked at my Iphone to verify what time it was when this happened. We had to wait for Yellow Cab to come get us. It was an exhausting evening and I was NOT happy with Hilton for handling the cab situation this way. It was ridiculous. Again, this hotel is ill-equipped to handle a lot of things at this point. Overall, if we ever stay at another Hilton that makes this kind of mistakes, we won't stay with Hilton again. The lazy river and the fantastic staff at the pool saved our stay here.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "DUTCHANDFREE54", "ReviewID": "UR64131257", "Content": "this 1400 room relatively new hotel has a great number of services to offer.Rooms are small and appear cramped due to too much furniture, bathrooms are excellent.

My colleague and I chose the hotel based on our belief that the convention was going to be held in the East Building of the Convention Center across the street from the hotel, but our conference was held in the West Concourse creating a commute on a free shuttle bus to and from the convention center with set times for pick up and drop off. If distance is a concern, there are alternative hotels that are closer to the West Building, less expensive and within walking distance of some nice restaurants. Find out exactly which building your convention booked before you reserve your hotel rooms. We chose to rent a car to permit a more flexible schedule than the shuttle provided. Be aware that parking at the convention center is $11.00 per day. The hotel is brand new and sparkling clean. It offers the typically luxurious Hilton beds and amenities, but is not distinctive in appearance inside or out. The view from our window was of a giant parking lot and parking deck across the street and some industrial-looking buildings. In the land of Disney, the lack of any type of an interesting view or landscaping was startling. Try to request a pool view if you book your stay through this hotel. Pros: The staff are superb and most seem to genuinely like working at the hotel. There were many people who assisted us at the concierge desk and front desk, but I cannot remember their names. James, our valet parking attendant, was kind, prompt and left a thank you note in our rental car. Rorey, in David's Bar and Grill (on both occasions) was attentive, warm and entertaining. The pool area is beautiful and the lazy river provided some respite after a long day walking the conference center hallways. Lunch at David's and poolside was lovely and the food was fresh and nicely presented. Cons: The gentleman who checked us in truly did not know what he was doing and it took a long time to straighten out the room arrangements. This was the only person I met during the entire stay who was significantly below the service level of all other staff. The Executive Floor in other hotel chains typically offer additional amenities not provided to other guests. Not at this Hilton. You are charged if you want Internet access. The continental breakfast was edible, but not memorable in any way. One morning the hard boiled eggs (the only protein) were so cold that they were frozen inside. Food was not always promptly refilled (containers are small) and the tea selection, despite having a big box, was limited. There was plenty of milk for cereal in a separate area of the room, but the creamer for coffee/tea was frequently empty as well. We did not have a choice of newspapers in the morning. Yes, I know this comment is picky, but at Executive Level prices, I at least expect an option for the Wall Street Journal or the local Orlando paper and not have the only option as U.S.A. Today. Self-parking is $12.00 per day and valet parking is $20.00 per day. We opted for the valet parking and were not sorry, but many hotels in Orlando do not charge for parking at all. Air conditioning worked, but we seemed unable to chill the room sufficiently despite setting the thermostat at 66 degrees.

Spencers is average quality for a prices that you would expect from great restaurants. The food at the hotel's other restaurants is downright crap. This is a problem, because there is really nowhere else to go unless you brave some crazy interstate on foot or travel by car or cab. The hotel is also too large.

The rest of the staff was beyond friendly, accommodating and polite. We planned on going to WDW, but ended up staying the day and just enjoying the pool and the many amenities the hotel has to offer. The AMAZING pool, slide, Lazy River, outdoor dining, cabanas, adults only/no kids nooks and crannies made this hotel one of our favorites and believe me, we stay in MANY. We didn't get to try the steakhouse there, but it smelled deliciously enticing. Maybe next time we stay we can enjoy that fab looking spa and explore the hotel a bit more if we can tear ourselves away from the pool area. The gym is new and WONDERFUL. Perfect for making sure you stay in your routine. There's a FIRE PIT! just think how romantic that would be, you and your loved one, cuddling up on a warm & breezy FLA nite, palm trees rustling, soft island music playing, sipping a cool drink and munching on something delectable from the kitchen? If you have kids they're playing within view... *sigh* For families with smallish ones- the pool is AMAZING! they will not get bored- trust us! a wading area, the slide, waterfall, bright colors, lazy river- jaw dropping to them! for the teens, the pool is still where it's at! Throw in the foosball tables, ping pong tables and little nooks to get away from us \"lame\" parents (but still be within a safe distance) and you can't beat it. Many connecting rooms based on what's available @ Ck in. COMFY beds and mini fridges in every room. Spacious NEW rooms and bathrooms, flat screen TV's work area's and the gotta have it! MP3 connections. Great location with many restaurant choices near by. EZ highway access and VERY close to the parks. The convention center is right behind the hotel, so even if you MUST be on business: rest assured, if you bring the fam= they won't mind spending the day at the hotel waiting for you!

The flatscreen tv was huge. The bathroom has plenty of space and looks new.

I can get by on a pastry and a cup of joe, but the breakfast they served from the Hilton kitchen still makes my mouth water... They had the best scrambled eggs I've ever had at a hotel, the bacon was crispy, and the coffee was quite good! I recommend splurging on the valet, it's 20 bucks a day and can be charged to your room. The valet's are quick, professional, and freindly, and one even stopped in the middle of his duties to take a picture of my wife and I in front of their fountain. There are plenty of great restarurants, fast food joints, and other venues a minute or two up the road. And the Hotel is only 15 mintues from some great outlet shopping.

After reading all the reviews today (I arrived home from Orlando today), I must say that I agree with most of the negatives mentioned in them. I checked in very early in the day (approx 1:00pm) and found a very long line with very few workers to assist with checkin. It easily took 30 minutes to check in. Please add more staff (especially on the day of check-in the day before the convention starts next door). I agree with the Hilton $15 a day internet access is a turn-off. Luckily I had borrowed a Verizon card to take with me so I didn't have to pay. Like mentioned in other reviews, smaller, cheaper hotels (even Hilton brands) offer free wi-fi at their locations. For a hotel aimed at business travelers (being directly connected to the convention center), you would think that they would offer that. The hotel uses transportation service for cab service, unless you specify you want a metered cab. I even shared a cab ride to the airport and it cost us $60, instead of the $23 or so charged to my co-passenger on the way TO the hotel. Be leary of that - you ride in style, but you pay for it. And know your rate up front. OK, enough of the negatives........... I must say, they have a vast exercise facility, a wonderful open lobby, and a great outdoor pool. The rooms are big, and the BED IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SLEPT IN - I NEVER WANTED TO GET UP!!!!! But here's the highlight of my trip - after trying so hard to get all things packed up the night before, I forgot some of the extra stuff that I had carried to Orlando in my purse (stuff like office keys, checkbook, prescriptions) and took out to keep from hauling them around. I realized today when I landed back in Alabama that I had totally left those items in the top drawer of the dresser. I immediately called and talked to Security, and by 6:00pm tonight I had received an email from Security telling me that housekeeping had located the items, turned them into Security, and they are sending them to me tomorrow morning.

I am a seasoned traveler and was very pleasantly surprised by the staff, the hotel rooms and of course its amazing amenities. This is the perfect hotel for people who like to sit by the pool or relax in the spa facilities. The beds are comfortable and the room is quite spacious. The whole hotel is immaculate and housekeeping are very caring and helpful. The front desk staff are super helpful, we arrived at 2 Am and were ushered in and welcomed warmly. I stayed from Christmas to New Years and it was magical. We opted for the valet parking which was worth every penny because we returned to the hotel quite late and tired and left early. TRY to avoid the 11 am checkout rush, however, the valet staff super speedy and attentive. The Spa is amazing, I used the gym facilities which over looked the sparkling pool and the steam room and spa was truly a 7 star experience. The pools are amazing, I loved the lazy river and the beach entry pools were warm even on chilly days. I would go back to this hotel just to sit by the pool and enjoy the sun. The hotel although not so close to theme parks is about 15 minutes from Magic Kingdom and 11 minutes to Universal is ideal. Its tucked away and not on a main street which I really adore.We did all the theme parks and was not overwhelmed with the driving to and from. Its grandeur and luxury is astounding. I am trying to convince my boyfriend to come back sooner than later. Definitely worth the extra fifteen minutes of driving to the theme parks. The whole hotel is run like a luxury fancy resort. There are also plenty of fast food joints around the corner and even a 24 hour diner which is useful. I was highly impressed by service and staff, cannot wait to come back.

If you're hitting the parks it's also a handy locale between. To add some measured criticism there are some big downsides too. Don't plan to walk anywhere for a night out. Yes it's just off International Drive but the south end where you won't find a bar within a mile or so. There are a couple of average drive by restaurants close enough - Red Lobster / Denny's - and an Esso On the Run petrol station. If you like to be in the heart of the action don't stay here. For such a big hotel with mile upon mile - almost - of dedicated parking, to charge 12 dollars a day is a ripoff. Add to that 15 dollars for wifi access per day. stay in any motel for a fraction of the price and it all comes for free. Why, Hilton? Don't forget this is a convention business hotel so expect huge amounts of people checking in and checking out - it takes ages. All in all it does what it does fairly well but if you seek more entertainment close by and some fairer charging policies, try elsewhere. Not wishing to detract by a personal experience, however, our room was also not serviced at 5pm when we got back from a long day. Not even a whisper of a free drink at the bar while we waited.

Hilton Orlando is new, so everything works, the rooms are nice and have all you need. The decor is OK, the beds are really good. It is good to stay in a new hotel so everything is in a good status (I wonder how the hotel looks in 5 years...). The staff is friendly - compared to other hotels of the same category and the same rate. Negative: - Car park card does not work properly, so you need to ask front desk again and again to reload your card - Why don't they include the price of the self car parking in the room rate? Nobody comes to Orlando without a car, so everybody has to pay extra for the car park. I personally hate this, I prefer to pay more for the room and not every little detail extra...but obviously many people prefer to pay separately, otherwise they would have changed that Overall a good four star hotel, from my point of view one of the better options in Orlando.

The grounds were unbelievable for a Hilton, especially one that is geared towards business travelers (connected to a Convention Center). It went over and above my expectations. The rooms were very nice (albeit small), but the outdoor areas were phenomenal. Fire pits with hot chocolate and smores, an amazing lazy river, an adult pool, kid pool with slide, jogging track, etc etc. They also had a very wide variety of restaurants. It was the kind of place where you could go there for a week and have no reason to leave. One note, I think it would be worthwhile to pay the extra $50 or whatever it costs to stay on the executive floor. You get free breakfast, free plentiful appetizers at dinnertime (for kids this could easily be their dinner), free internet which would otherwise cost $15/computer/day - meaning that if you and your spouse both have computers, it's going to be $30/day otherwise - Plus of course you have a place to hang out. It really was worth it. Ok, for the bad part. You can very, very clearly tell that this hotel is new. It was tremendously understaffed. Some staff were great (some that come to mind were Victor from the pool- he was incredible - Jason from the pool, Joanna at check in) but most of them seemed pretty incapable of getting anything done. Any time you walked by the front desk there was a line that was at least an hour long. Ordinarily this would not be a huge deal except that THINGS KEPT GOING WRONG. One morning we woke up to a marching band practicing directly outside our bedroom window in the convention center parking lot. You can't even make this stuff up. It sounded like we had just walked into a movie it was so loud. We then had to wait in that ridiculous line, at 8 am, on our vacation, to complain. They wouldn't move our rooms despite this UNBELIEVABLE noise. The marching band was still going on at 8pm that night when some of us wanted to go to sleep (keep in mind we had two rooms) so we had to go back to the front desk (another insane wait) to figure out what our options were (at this point at least they gave us the night free, but let me tell you, between the unbelievable noise and the hours we spent in line, it wasn't worth it). It ruined our whole day. Another day we came back from the pool to find out that we were locked out of our room and had no card access. We found this out at 6pm, when we were in a huge huge rush and had to just run into the room quickly to change before we had to be somewhere, easily 40 minutes away, by 7. Long story short, we were not given access to our room until 6:30 and at that point were not even given a new key. We thought maybe we did something wrong except that in the midst of the whole debacle (they kept promising us 5 more minutes, 5 more minutes, etc) the people staying across the hall got out of the elevator and they had the exact same thing happen to them! When we got back that night, we had to wait in another ridiculous, hour long line to get the key made, only to find out that they wouldn't give me the key because my name was not under the reservation (it was my mother's name- we have the same last name). Some other complaints: -Check in took just as long with the hour wait, the valet guys didn't tell us that the hotel cabs charge double the metered cabs on the street. -If you want a fairly priced cab, you have to specifically ask for a metered cab. We were charged $25 for a hotel cab to get to Universal and $12 to get back when we just grabbed a metered cab- what a ripoff to get there. -Room service screwed up my order twice in a row -Housekeeping was terrible. On the first morning I had spilled something in bed and needed the sheets changed. I called at 8 am and they said they'd be right there. I had to keep calling and eventually they came at 12. Another day we asked them to come back and they never did. Another day they came and left our door open.. anyone could have come and taken our things. So- all in all - while the property was GREAT, they have a lot of learning to do. I'm not sure that I would stay here again unless they really took care of all of these issues.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLarge Suites for HHonors Members\u201d", "Author": "jlgd1971", "ReviewID": "UR52272972", "Content": "Great place to stay -- close to Disney and other attractions.

Hilton put out a very nice evening reception that could replace an evening meal. One night they had pizza and huge homemade meatballs. Breakfast was ok but as I told them, they need to do something about the vinegar taste in the egg yokes. I was told that they make these way ahead of time and then are stored which apparently makes them rubbery too. The mini danish and fresh fruit and berries were awesome. I save the best for last - the pool and activities. The pool is HEATED and felt wonderful. My kids loved the waterslide and the Lazy Lagoon was so much fun. In the afternoon, there was finger painting and other activities offered each hour at Cabana 1.
