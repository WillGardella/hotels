Booked a balcony room but was given a room without a window on the first night but this was changed after I threatened to check out the following morning. Balcony Room is large but views aren't that great. Bathroom was smelly through-out even with the extract fan being constantly on. Everything was corroded. Shower was hot and powerful. Had to ask for hand and bath towels every night! Breakfast was adequate - toast, corn flakes, juice, omelette made to order, melon and 2 different hot local dishes everyday. Staff were very accommodating. Hotel is centrally located for the metro, shopping malls, jewellery and other shops, restaurants etc. Would recommend - Rangoli, Sarpino's and Bhavana restaurants as they are within walking distance of hotel.

We just wanted a cheap option to experience the sights of Dubai without paying the extreme prices of hotels in the Jumeirah Beach area. The Dubai Nova Hotel was perfect for this, clean and comfortable and in a fantastic location just a few minutes walk from souks and the creek, where you can catch an Abra (traditional arabic boat) across to the Gold and Spice Souks, 1 UAE Dirham - approx \u00a30.17p. Also a stones throw from the Dubai Museum which is worth a look. The breakfast caters for the middle eastern market, if you want English food, stay in England!!!!! In the evening the area around the hotel really came to life will the locals. The mosque is nearby and the sound of the worship carries down the streets, and you know you are in the real/traditional part of the city. We pre booked a couple of excursions before we travelled and were picked up and dropped off at the hotel with no problems. The Desert Safari is a must, and the Dhow Cruise is a great way to relax with diner in the evening. A taxi to the public Jumeirah Beach will set you back about 40 UAE Dirham - approx \u00a37 each way.

The room was very large and clean, but dated. The bed was extremely hard, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping. Not much natural light in the room either. The breakfast included was ok, but don't expect anything at all flash!!! I ended up just having tea, cereal and toast! The staff were ok, but at times I felt they weren't really interested in being overly helpful. I lost my mobile phone at their hotel, and they didn't make any huge effort to look for it for me.

We were looking for something cheap and cheerful to use as a jump point to our onward journey to Europe. The hotel staff were very pleasant and all parts of the hotel were extremely clean. Our room was massive, with a separate anti room and bathroom, however we did not have a window. This was not really a problem as we simply wanted a clean place to stay and the shower was great. Lots of hot water and pressure. We were on the third floor and at the 'back' of the hotel so everything was whisper quiet. This is a budget hotel - however it suited our needs perfectly. The bonus for me was the breakfast. This hotel is in the old part of town ( Indians rather than Arabians), and breakfast reflected this. After the first morning of having hot milk on cornflakes we opted for the Indian - naan bread and three different curries. I was in heaven. My other half had an omelete each morning - individually made with fillings of his choice. Being situated in the old part of Dubai we were able to walk everywhere and were two minutes from the textile souks and a short water taxi (A$ 1) from the gold and spice souks.

We needed a budget hotel--not easy in Dubai as another reviewer mentioned-- and decided to go with the Nova because we really wanted something downtown and we wanted something clean. We loved the location (although I think we were lucky to have a room not on the main street). The staff was very friendly and helpful. Internet was available at a good rate. There are different categories of rooms. Indeed, this is not a 5 star hotel. The rooms are very big and our room was not modern. However, it was very clean and was cleaned every day. We had everything we needed. Breakfast was simple, but as we were on a budget, toast and coffee or tea was enough. Remember that there are different kinds of guests and everyone's idea of what is a good breakfast is different. If you want to just hang out at a pool at a hotel, pay the extra money and go for a more luxury hotel. You can find good deals online. Because we wanted some time to do this, we decided to pass the second half of our stay in a nicer hotel. Unfortunately, in the nicer hotel we had to pay extra for things like breakfast and couldn't just pop out to get a bottle of water or a quick snack or even just a pleasant evening walk.

Opposite the hotel is a fantastic Shawarma place. I noticed all locals and many staff eating there. I strongly advise to try the fruit cocktail (about 30p). if they sold that here I reckon about \u00a33.50. So so good and nothing artificial. Things to do - Desert driving, wadi water park, Burj Al arab tour, river cruise & meal, all aranged from tour desk in hotel by independant staff but trust worthy.
