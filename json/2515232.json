I assumed it would be a typical European hotel but was pleasantly surprised, especially for Paris. The hotel is small, make no mistake. If you're used to chain hotels, large rooms, etc. then you won't like it. But we found it to be cozy, modern and apparently recently renovated, everything worked and most important, the beds were comfy and the bathrooms fully functional and modern. The hotel has 5 or 6 floors but there is an elevator so it's not a walk-up. The service personnel were excellent. We could communicate easily in English and Spanish (and a few words of French that we knew), and they went out of their way to help in every way. Smiles, suggestions, and an attitude that denies the French \"rudeness\" that stereotypes them. The breakfast buffet is well layed out with all the typical fare, even eggs, bacon and sausage for the American/British appetite. The breakfast room is an honor bar in the afternoon/evening, where you serve yourself and let them know what you consumed at checkout. Room 101 was perfect, again pointing out that they are small European hotel rooms and not chain hotel layouts. Room 202 was a bit smaller and awkward but still comfortable. We paid 220 euro/night with breakfast included (mid-Sept. 2011) and it was well worth it. The other 2 nights of our stay were at the Concorde Lafayette just half a block away, a large hotel adjacent to the convention center, and it was horrible by comparison.

They have an honour bar (we never used, but they have a lovely tea room/breakfast area that guests are welcome to enjoy). Free wifi. Beds were hard and pillows were flat - but on par with any other European hotel I've ever stayed at, just not the same as North American hotels in the same price range. Room was tiny, with two very small double beds, but the first room we checked in to had a very small double, and they moved us with no charge to a nicer room on a higher floor. We had a beautiful view of the street with windows that swung in with a little rail so you could lean over it - very much exactly what I thought Paris should be like!!!! My eleven year old loved it, it was perfect for us. We actually spent a day in the hotel doing nothing after a couple of days of sightseeing, and it was wonderful. We had a tv that we never turned on, a safe, a closet. And the bathroom was bliss - big tub, nice new fixtures, delightful toiletries. The lights in the hotel are all on motion detectors, which was kind of creepy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again. We didn't eat the breakfast - it wasn't expensive compared to restaurants in the neighbourhood, but there were so many little cafes and bakeries to explore that we normally dined out or picnicked.

This is surprising given that it is located very near the largest congress centre in Paris (where I attended the conference while staying at the hotel).", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "hanadrew", "ReviewID": "UR48164042", "Content": "i was looking to book a week in paris as a 1st yr anniversary present for my wife so wanted something which was central to the sights, had a bit of character, and was cheap without being tacky. i was very impressed with this hotel. location: 5 min walk from porte maillot metro station, 10min walk to the arc de triumph. couple of restaurant / cafe near by, atm nearby staff: spoke very good english. i tried my best to speak french (not very good admittedly) and they were very accomodating room: not the biggest, but more than ample. double bed, 2 desks, private bathroom etc... my only gripe was there were no tea / coffee facilities in the room services: breakfast was extra at \u20ac13 - a bit steep so didnt try it. they have a courtesy bar and coffe facilities which seemed to be free?! in the lobby - they also had board games in the lobby which came in handy as the only english chanels on the tv were cnn and bbc world news - hardly exciting! the room did have free wifi overall id give this an 8 out of 10 pros - see above cons - no coffee in room, no convenience store nearby (eating out in paris is VERY expensive)", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cRomantic trip with my life lover\u201d", "Author": "DianaDMN", "ReviewID": "UR48050860", "Content": "It was the 3rd time trip to Paris, but the most romantic and in love one.

Everyone from night porter to cleaner was friendly, and the whole experience was excellent. The hotel has been recently renovated (to a high standard) from top to bottom, with wood in abundance. Very tasteful, although they could have opened the front for al fresco relaxation. The room, while compact, had what we needed: hanging space, small fridge, safe, flatscreen TV, quiet AC, hairdryer. Anyone staying for a week would easily cope. The ensuite bathroom had a fullsize bath with a shower over. I'm a big guy who often struggles in small cubicles so this was a welcome inclusion. The beds were comfortable and seemed spotlessly clean. Downstairs, they operate an honesty bar: help yourself (up to 2am) and hand your record over at the permanently-manned reception afterwards. Choice is slightly limited: 2 Cokes and 2 bottled beers cost \u20ac19. Next door and just around the corner, there are several restaurants, with French and Belgian cuisine prevalent. Not cheap but nothing is in Paris. The building work mentioned elsewhere seems to have finished. I highly recommend this hotel if you don't need to be right in the centre. Saying that, it's merely 5 minutes walk to the M1 and RER, and only a further 10 to the heart of the city. As a footnote, I foolishly left my house keys in the room.

He advised me of various things including a special offer in relation to the mini-bar. He said that for \u20ac6 (per day) I could have as many soft drinks as I wanted from the mini-bar. I don't normally touch mini-bars, however this sounded like a good offer so I went to my room, settled down and took a can of orange from the mini-bar. I also took at bottle of water and a can of coke and a couple of drinks the next morning before I left for work. I was staying for 2 nights but only used the mini bar that first day. On Wednesday morning I had decided to have breakfast and then checked out. I was somewhat concerned to note that all the individual items from the mini-bar were included on my bill (\u20ac5.20 for a can of coke!!!!). I explained to the female member of staff that I had taken up the \u20ac6 soft drinks offer that the member of staff checking me in had told me about. She said there was no such offer and that he worked in another hotel and it must be an offer there, but it was not valid here. Another member of staff appeared and said that this was not an offer at this hotel. I said that their member of staff had told me about this offer and they suggested that I should have looked at the tariff in my room and known that the offer was incorrect. I explained that I had not looked at any tariff because I had no intention of taking anything other than soft drinks, based upon this offer. They seemed uninterested in my explanation and I asked them to make sure that the member of staff in question stopped telling guests about this offer if the hotel would not be honouring it. They eventually offered to take off the charge for breakfast that morning, however I was left feeling that I had in some way inconvenienced them and that I was stupid for believing what their member of staff had brought to my attention.

With a three star you never know what you're going to get - Hotel La Villa des Ternes was a wonderful find. Rated \"very good\" for service and rooms only because it's not a \"consierge\" type hotel - the front desk staff was helpful and friendly - but you're not going to be booking tours, tickets, etc through them.

It's very close to the Palais for conferences etc. The place is well kept and the bed was awesome. Super firm, and I could have laid there for ever. Initially with just one sheet and one blanket, I was chilly, so asked for another blanket, which they provided. The next day they had substituted a big fluffy white duvet for all the above, and it was very nice. Unfortunately, I had a ridiculously nasty cold and needed bed whenever possible. I could have been much happier if there were a kettle or coffee maker in the room to get hot liquids into me, but I was miserable enough with my cold that I didn't figure out any other way to get hot tea. The shower is unusually modern and functional for Paris. There is the ubiquitous peeling wallpaper - What is it about Paris that wall paper never sticks anywhere, no matter how many stars your hotel has?! Breakfast was decent, though at 15\u20ac typically pricey. The other nitpick is that the chairs in the breakfast room are bizarrely short, like they got a deal on a set of chairs that had 15cm cut off all the legs. Probably not great if you're older and have trouble bending down. The area has a good selection of restaurants (good seafood just next store). The staff was friendly and spoke enough English to get by, though thankfully let me work on my French. You can get an Air France bus to a spot just around the corner which saves you serious cash.
