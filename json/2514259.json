The room was decent and housekeeping was very professional. Nothing spectacular about the room except it was clean. The mattress was kinda of worn but carpet and linen was of good quality. The front desk was much better at check out than check in, especially after they forced us to add money for additional person for us to get our \"guaranteed\" double bed room. They were going to move us to a King bed even though it was my brother and myself staying. Oh well, just be careful of markup. Also, ice machine/vending was not conveniently located as we expected. Lastly, we very much enjoyed the area and its convenient access to the #7 train. Being in the Chinese section of Flushings, we sincerely enjoyed the best Chinese food we ever had!!! We wish we were closer to Manhattan but its only about 35 minutes out via train.

I booked it on the phone with a Best Western representative after confirmation that the hotel I wanted was full. I knew the hotel was not as close to Manhattan as I would have liked to be but that was what was available when we booked. When we arrived we had a shock because we thought we were in a chinese city suburb. Not too many english signs around. After the initial shock, we took possession of the room and discover an excellent service and a very clean room. The personnel at the front desk was always very nice and cooperative and speak english but the working personnel on the floors did not speak english which was a not an important inconvenient. Most of the clientele is chinese from all part of the world but approching the week-end, the clientele was more diversified as they were people touring NYC for a week-end. Everyday the room was cleaned to our satisfaction. We had read about the bed bugs epidemy in NYC but this place was free of any bugs. There is a parking across the street for $15/day so the car was never far from the hotel and our sight. The area was safe as long as you would stay in the chinese area. The subway station was 5 minutes away on foot as well as the train station. 30-35 min by subway to downtown and 15-20 min by train (safer at night). Continental breakfast was OK but nothing special about it. There was one only person taking care of the breakfast room but she was not there all the time. If she had been there all the time, we would have had a better service at breakfast. There was always something missing. Interesting restaurants in the area if you like asian food. Shopping too is interesting and you can find good bargains. It is worth to have a walk in the area. It gives a flavor of the chinese world. You do not feel you are in NYC. I recommend this hotel. It is close to highways and easy to access. Easy access too to NYC downtown. If one day you do not want to go downtown, you can easily visit state beaches of Long Island.

Over the last six months I've found it necessary to be in this area several times and balked at the prices at the nearby Sheraton. The Best Western, on the next block, has proven to be good value. The rooms are reasonably sized, clean, and comfortable and, at less than $150/night, reasonably price for New York. The hotel is just a short walk to the Main Street-Roosevelt avenue stop of Subway line #7 which will get you into Manhattan in 39 minutes. This area is the new \"Chinatown\" and Asian restaurants of every type and description fill every available commercial space. Being myself of mixed Anglo-Asian descent I find it a culinary paradise. For those with different tastes or background it may be a bit daunting since there is little concession made for American tastes or English only speakers. The hotel has free WiFi and the front desk can print documents and send faxes for you. There is a small fitness center available. Beyond this there are few of the amenities one might like. The Cable TV service is very limited and, because the clientele is largely Asian many of the available channels are in Asian languages. There are two small vending machines in the basement that often seemed to malfunction. What once was a bar and grill in the hotel is closed and gives no sign of being re-opened any time soon. The breakfast provided free of additional charge is meager and served in a depressing back room facing an alley. On the other hand the staff is wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful. When a fax I sent elicited a response written in Chinese, a language I speak haltingly and read not at all, the desk clerk translated for me and helped draft an answer in Chinese. After departure on one occasion I received a phone call on my mobile from the housekeeping staff which had found a name and telephone number I had written on a slip of paper and left behind. They wanted to make sure that I hadn't lost an important piece of information. This seems to me to be service above and beyond what can normally be expected. I give the staff the very highest marks possible.

When we returned later that night the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and more than big enough for two adults and two children. We did have the free breakfast in the morning which consisted of bagels, cereal and fruit- it is free so I felt that it was more than adequate. The checkout process was very easy and without incident. The staff spoke english well enough that we didn't have a problem understanding them. In regards to the area- we knew before we booked that the hotel was outside of the city and in the middle of Flushing's China Town...we never felt that we or are children were unsafe or in any danger and actually enjoyed the area. The subway station is a little over a block from the hotel and very easy to figure out. The 7 train starts/ends at this station and starts/ends at Times Square with stops on 5th Ave and Grand Central so getting to the main sight seeing areas via stops or connections with other trains was very easy. Also- the hotel is one stop away from Citifield...a big plus for us.
