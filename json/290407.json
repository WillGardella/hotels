Breakfast was only orange juice, tea or coffee and a basket of croissants rolls and jams but set us up for the day! Croissants were nice!

We had booked it very last minute, and had found it difficult to find a hotel at this time as it bumped into the Valentines Day holiday. We booked Paris France Hotel online and arrived a few days later. The staff were very friendly and helpful, we were greeted by a lovely man who gave us a map of Paris, directions for nearby amenities and other things related to our stay. We had booked a superior room, and were not disappointed. Plenty of space and views of the Eiffel Tower - it was a perfect welcome to Paris. The location is great, a fairly short walk to the Louvre and plenty of restaurants nearby. It is also located to 2 main metro stations, as well as a large supermarket, which was helpful for grabbing something quick and easy on the way home at night. Prices were not cheap, but definitely worth what we paid. The breakfast that can be included (for an extra cost) is a croissant and bread roll with condiments, and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. We were glad we had included the breakfast, as it was always a good start to the day. A really teeny-tiny elevator made getting upstairs a little difficult with our luggage, and we only had 2 bags. Perhaps if you're travelling with more luggage a room on a lower floor would be advised.

I could walk about 12 blocks down to the clubs in Marais and not worry about taking the Metro back after hours (since it shuts down shortly after midnight or so). And, during the day, of course, the Metro couldn't be closer. The hotel is 1/2 block from the Temple Metro station and about 2 1/2 blocks from the much busier Republique Metro station (I believe at least 3 lines stopped at Republique). The Monoprix across the street (behind the hotel) was very convenient for snacks, pastries, soda, and what-not items. I never ate breakfast at the hotel since I would usually walk down to the Marais area. There is a church right next door with romantic bells that chime at the hour and 15-mins increments (but not overnight nor in early morning..thankfully).

I had planned to stay in an alternative hotel for part of my trip, but I was so impressed with this place that I stayed the whole time! They also booked a room for a friend who visited for a weekend and were exceedingly helpful. I have since stayed at this charming and conveniently located hotel for 3 other visits,both on my own and with a partner, and I've recommended countless friends who have also loved the hotel. For a 2 star establishment, this hotel exceeds all other experiences I have had. The staff, in particular the lovely Christelle and Herve are so polite and helpful, and have helped me with my poor French and sense of direction arrange everything from a day at Versailles, shopping the Grand Magasins to getting to the flea markets and booking airport shuttles. The location is great - right near the charming Marais- full of cafes, bars and shopping and an easy stroll past Hotel De Ville and along the Seine into the city centre. I prefer staying here close to Republique as the metro is right outside and it's just so convenient and easy to navigate. There is a Monoprix located right behind the hotel and a few charmante eateries (L'absinthe Cafe, the quirky Cafe Temple and La Favorite for a quick kir ) right near the hotel. It doesn't have the touristy feel that other places closer to the City Centre have had, and the other 2 star hotels I have tried that have actually been more expensive have been so disappointing in comparison to Hotel Paris France. The rooms are on the smaller side but are roomy by Paris standards ! Each room I've stayed in has been light, airy and clean - the last time I stayed the hotel had been completely refreshed and renovated so it was even better ! The wonderful staff have always given me a great deal on my booking and room. The views across Rue Turbigo are best seen from the upper floors, you can even see a hint of the Eiffel Tower from one of the attic rooms that I've stayed in previously, and the views from the bathroom window of the glorious old church next door are lovely. There is a charming petite lift, however I prefer taking the stairs to burn off the Parisian pastries and macarons and the downstairs foyer is beautifully appointed with original decorative tiled floors, sandstone walls and chandeliers. I like the simple decor of the rooms - clean crisp linen and no daggy artwork on the walls !!! It really is a great find for affordable accomodation in Paris and I look forward to my next stay in a year or so. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone planning a stay in Paris - such great value for money , a lovely ambience and great location (plus all those extra euros saved can be put to great use along the Rue St Honore !!)", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat small hotel find\u201d", "Author": "morsemoose", "ReviewID": "UR120644123", "Content": "This small hotel has wonderful staff always so nice and willing to help.

The hotel is situated very close to the Temple metro stop and a couple of minutes walk from the Republique metro stop. We stayed in a triple room on the sixth floor, facing onto the main road outside the hotel. The traffic noise was loud with the balcony doors open, but when shut, the doors kept out the noise well. There was air conditioning in the room. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. The bathroom was slightly on the small side, but did the job - only issue was with the hairdryer which kept overheating and cutting out. The room was cleaned daily and the towels replaced. Bedlinen was clean and the bed was comfy. However, the one big downside with the hotel, for me, was that the walls between the rooms are super thin - you can hear talking and television very clearly in the adjoining rooms and I am sure I heard someone on the floor above using the toilet! This did cause me a problem as I am a very light sleeper. The breakfast is basic but OK - small crusty roll, croissant, butter, honey and jam, juice and coffee or hot chocolate. You can take a breakfast tray to your room if you want. All of the staff we spoke to were pleasant and helpful. We were able to leave our bags after checkout on the last day. The lift is very small and you can just squeeze in 2 people with bags. The hotel is about a 20-25 minute walk from Notre Dame and we found it easy to get around Paris either on foot or on the metro. There are some nice places to eat within a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel and there are several little supermarkets nearby. We booked online, via the hotel's website and thought the rates were reasonable for the standard of the hotel. I would like to say I would stay in the hotel again, but unfortunately the thin walls between the rooms would put me off.

We had been there a year before and stayed in a hotel which was a lot further away, for 10 euros more than we paid this time, and we decided to book Paris France H\u00c3\u00b4tel based on the reviews we read at Trip Advisor which said it was conveniently located. I must say we were really pleased with what we found! It is a two-star hotel which could easily have two more stars for its cozy, clean and charming atmosphere. We booked a superior double room for 5 nights for 115 euros, as there were no more standard rooms available, but had the chance to take a glance at their standand rooms which were a bit smaller, but just as good. The room was spacious, with a comfortable double bed with clean bed linen, comfortable pillows and duvets, an extra single bed, plenty of space for luggage and for moving around, a two-door wardrobe, a desk with a chair, bedside tables, an LCD TV set with cable TV with some channels in English and free wifi. There was no safe or minibar in the room, but we always kept our luggage locked with our laptop and personal belongings in them and had no problems at all. The bathroom was not really modern, but it was spotlessly clean, bright and spacious, the only drawback being the fact that it did not have a shower, but a bath and a hand douche which did not hang from the wall (and here is my suggestion to the hotel manager, please find a way to hang the douche from the wall!). The rooms were cleaned every day, and the staff were pleasant, polite and willing to provide whatever information and help we needed. We only had breakfast there once, which we wouldn't have again, except for the convenience of not having to leave the hotel on the very day we departed, but there are two really nice \"brasseries\" and a supermarket close to the hotel. The Temple underground station is right outside of the hotel if you want to spare your feet to the parks and boulevards of Paris, but it is within walking distance to Centre Pompidou, H\u00c3\u00b4tel De Ville, the Notre Dame, the Louvre and many other touristic sites. It is also one block from R\u00c3\u00a9publique, where there are about a dozen nice restaurantes and caf\u00c3\u00a9s. Our room was on the 5th floor, with a view to a side alley with a beautiful church, \u00c3\u2030glise Sainte-\u00c3\u2030lisabeth, and although Rue de Turbigo is a quite busy street we were never disturbed by noise. Ok, the elevator is really tiny, and there's only space for two people, or one person plus luggage, but it is quite charming anyway.

They answered all of our questions, helped make us a reservation at a restaurant, recommended river boat tours when we asked. *Fairly clean - there seemed to be some mildew in the bathroom shower, but beyond that, we thought the room was very clean *Small - we had a standard room and it was definitely on the smaller side, but when you pay 95 euros a night, I don't think you could've found a better value *Now, having spent time in Paris, I would've rather have been in a more \"busy\" (touristy?) neighborhood - closer to Opera or Grand Boulevards. There seemed to be more just outside those stops than near this hotel - which was off the beaten path. Depends what you are looking for. *Location was, however, near 2 metro stops so that part was at least convenient. *Beds - were just okay, not super comfortable, but not super uncomfortable either. *Weather was on the cooler side while we were there, so we didn't have any issues with the air conditioning *They appear to be renovating the 7th floor??? When we left at 11am for the airport, we heard TONS of pounding/sound from the roof. Annoying for that morning, but hadn't noticed earlier in the trip because we were always out and about much earlier than that.

The hotel is very central in the northern Marais with plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants and Metro stops very close by. Temple is the nearest stop but Republique is only a few minutes walk, so don't bother changing lines if it's more convenient. There is a big Monoprix (supermarket) two minutes from the hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful and a few words of basic French helps with this. We had, for central Paris, a very spacious sixth floor room (66), basic but clean and tidy. Beds a bit soft for our taste and a quite eccentric light switch system. It was a sultry night and the air conditioning was very effective. Big double glazed windows which open wide in both the room and the bathroom which meant the room is quiet but with a low rumble of traffic during the day - this is central Paris! Great views over Parisian rooftops with glimpses of the Eiffel Tower in the distance and a huge crumbling church next door. You probably wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the room but if you do, then maybe review what you're doing in Paris. Definitely good enough for an afternoon or pre dinner nap and a good base for business or pleasure. Even has a desk for a laptop (didn't have chance to test the wifi) and a couple of chairs. Bathroom basic, clean with a decent shower and full size bath, plenty of hot water and lots of room. Couple of tiny tablets of soap so bring your own if you're staying for a longer time. Breakfast is basic at 6 Euro - croissant, bread roll, butter, jam and honey. Orange juice and coffee were standard and acceptable. Plenty of alternatives at cafes nearby but we didn't have time to try them. The Paris France is a good example of a basic ** Parisian hotel. The decor is not to everyone's taste. It's generally a bit scuffed and chipped in places but it has a good feeling of being clean and tidy. Some reviewers seem obsessed with carpet stains but one persons 'stain' can be another's 'wear and tear' or just a 'mark'. The lift is a hoot - a triumph of French engineering!

Very helpful with directions, and especially helpful after our flight back to New York was cancelled due to the volcano eruption in Iceland. We were stranded for an extra 5 days before we could fly out, tough life right ;) ... Christelle was very helpful in securing our room for the extra 4 nights we stayed. The bathroom was spotless, always had fresh towels...the only annoyance was that you had to hold the shower head because it was hand-held. But other than that no complaints. The free wi-fi was a life saver, and it was password protected so you didn't feel nervous about an unsecure connection. A few weeks before my trip, I emailed the hotel asking if we could have a room with a balcony and a nice view, and they completely delivered my request. I had read other reviews about certain rooms having balconies, so I wanted to make sure we got one. Overall, this is a great hotel if you're on a budget because the accomodations are perfect for what we needed - a clean, safe place to sleep since we would be sightseeing and taking in the city all day and night! Also, traveling as a group of three 22 year old girls, safety was a major priority and we felt extremely safe there.

The bathroom is compact, but has a large tub. The shower is a typical European design, which means you must hold the shower head while you bathe. This was not an issue for us since we have a similar design in our house. The only negative comment I can think of is the elevator was out of service for our floor. We had to take it to the floor above or below and take the stairs to our floor. The elevator is small because it fits in the center of a spiral staircase that services seven floors.

We had pre-booked the restaurant online before we went with it being NYE. I believe that a standard meal there is about 24 euros each which is pretty cheap for Paris. Its literally a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is very cool and trendy. They also do amazing cocktails there. In the three days there we manage to visit all of the standrad tourist sights without queuing too long. The longest we queued for was an hour and an half was to ice skate at the Hotel du Ville. The queue for the Louvre appears a lot longer than it is as you have to initially queue for bag checking, once past this its not too bad. The Mona Lisa is certainly worth a visit. We were suprised that the Pompediou Centre was open on New Years Day and this was a great way to spend our last day alomg with a visit to the Sacre Coeur. New Years Eve on the Champs Elysee was not as impressive as I thought it would've been as there weren't many fireworks but you have to go there for the atmosphere. The metros were hell on new years eve howver they are free. It was freezing in Paris and I would recommend taking lots of layers and confortable walking shoes. However, we were lucky enough for it to snow which made up for being so cold.I would certainly recommend spending New Years in Paris.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "Massimo1", "ReviewID": "UR20290338", "Content": "This hotel is just 100 meters from the Republique metro station and just 15 minutes walk to the Seine, the Marais, Les Halles, and the Bastille areas. It is in a lively area with cafes and shops. I booked a double room at the last minute and was fortunate to get room 16 on the first floor. The room was actually a triple, with two twin beds pushed together plus a single rollaway in another corner of the room. It sounds odd, but the room was larger than the typically small double rooms with cramped bathrooms and shower cabinet offered at this hotel. Room 16 has a full size bathroom with a tub/shower. The room iss on the side of the hotel, facing the side of St. Elizabeth's church across the alley. Every so often the lovely bells ring, which I liked. The bed (a single bed) was firm and comfortable, the room had a 32\" flat screen LCD TV, and the fabric covering the walls was a nice touch. If you stay at this hotel, ask for something on the first floor and you will have wonderful old floor-to-ceiling arched windows. Yes, it is closer to the street, but the windows in the hotel are double-glazed, so the traffic noise is quite reduced. If you listen, you can hear the rumble of the metro going under the street by the building every few minutes (not really disturbing). And yes, this hotel does have the smallest lift in Europe. Literally big enough for only 1 full-sized adult plus small suitcase.

The problem I encountered was with one of the front desk person that almost ruined my stay for the first time in paris. I knew about this hotel from a friend who's sister stayed here and recommended it to him. I was unable to book this hotel from Canada due to various circumstances. However fate had it that upon exploring the neighborhood that I had already booked, I would be walking by this hotel. So I spoke to the man @ front desk on Sunday which was my second day in Paris, he told me that he would have a room available the upcoming Wednesday till the following Sunday of my departure, took all the info and wrote down my name in his book. He also said that I should give a two day prior notice to my current hotel so I could be free of any obligations from them. Now the Tuesday prior I wanted to confirm things, but this is where the nightmare started. The new person @ front desk totally shocked me by asking me for a receipt, something that I should've asked for on the Sunday when I booked for Wednesday! Combining his incompetence and no record of the transaction by me I was about to be living on the streets of Paris. The new guy told me to come back Wednesday and speak to the man whom I originally spoke to on Sunday and I did, but again another surprise as there was a beautiful girl @ front desk and the same argument ensued, but she was quick enough to check all the books and found my info. and told me to bring over my stuff and leave them in the lobby until the room be ready. The room given was the size of a closet but immaculately renovated, however they should've changed the bed covers as they were quite old. The staff were very helpful and courteous and when ever I couldn't explain in French they would in English. The cleaning staff were superb as well and two times I left them one euro for their good service. The flat screen 19\" monitor is great with all the fantastic channels from various European countries. The Cafe across the street called \"Favorite\" has the cheapest coffee, and the \"Mono-Prix\" just around the corner has the best \"croissant almond\" and cheap. The metro which is line 3 \"Temple\" is a MINUTE walk from the hotel no exaggeration!!!!! I would definitely stay here again but will make sure about the booking. The view from room could see the top of the Eiffel, and all the beautiful buildings surrounding it. I was lucky that my neighbors were mature and had awesome sleeps at anytime.

I was also told that they are installing AC but should not be ready for us but that the rooms have fans.
