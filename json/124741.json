This place was great. The rooms are HUGE and luxurious!! The Irish pub in the hotel is the BEST place to eat if you want typical Irish pub fare. We went here two out of the three nights. The cafe is GREAT for breakfast and far more reasonable that the other restaurant in the hotel. The pool was somewhere I could have hung out all day if I had the chance and they have a menu there where you can order food if you want to spend the afternoon. The only thing I didn't like was the $10 charge for internet - its a bit ridiculous considering the price you are paying for a room. Other than that though, I would highly recommend this place. We didn't want to stay on the strip as we were travelling with our son. We had a car but they have a shuttle that you can take to and from the strip.

We have always loved it. The rooms are fantastic, luxurious bedding and towels. Rooms are large, elevators fast. Just really classy overall. The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is fantastic. We just returned home yesterday and thought I ought to make a couple of observations. We stayed in the Palms Tower on the fourth floor, mountain view. As soon as we went to our room upon arrival, we were surprised at how badly the hallways need a good vacuuming. There are bits of towel or rag shreds dotting the carpets everywhere...I mean everywhere! To the house keeping managers, I urge you to buy a good vacuum cleaner and use it everyday! We found a hook assembly to a woman's underwear on the floor just outside our door. Come on. This is a JW Marriott resort, please do not act like a dirty, cheap motel! Clean it right every day, please. We also noticed that plastic drinking cups, beer cans and trash overflow the tops of cigarette sand recepticles throughout the grounds, never to be picked up. Even litter dots the grounds, ignored by hotel staff. We stayed three nights, and the litter and garbage problem remained untouched the entire time we were there. This negative aspect of our stay was kind of icky. It was as if the hotel was trying to cut costs by not picking up litter, emptying cigarette disposal stands, and by not vacuuming floors. Normally, such neglect tells the customer the hotel is in financial stress. Our first night was filled with loud, boisterous young teen girls running and yelling up and down the halls of the 4th floor in Palm Towers. They were removing \"Do Not Disturb\" signs, which we couldn't have known. Next morning, early Sunday AM, housekeeping is trying to get into our room and ruined things for us. Thanks! I called the front desk with a very gentle, kind request if they might have someone come encourage the rowdy girls to tone it down. I was told \"no\", that the hotel does not do that sort of thing. HUH??? Maybe we stayed at this Marriott Resort Hotel while staff was having attitude issues and needed a hug? It was quite odd. The pool area has a large swimming pool and two adjacent hot tubs on opposite sides of the huge pool. One hot tub was sort of disgusting with greenish, filmy water. I hope they remedy that before we return in a couple of months. The hotel staff are generally very friendly, informed and helpful. The staff at the pool area are really stellar and deserve highest praise from Marriott corporate managers! They could not have been more kind, thoughtful and cheerful. This hotel has free parking everywhere, and no resort amenities fees....a big plus!!! Thank you Marriott. We love this property and can't wait to get back there again. I only hope they can improve their program for keeping the hallways and grounds picked up, tidy and enjoyable. Maybe they ought to consider hiring a real professional in this department. Bottom line: JW Marriott Resorts have a reputation for being among the finest in the world, but this past weekend this property fell down a bit. I am hopeful this will be resolved and not this way again when we return in coming months.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cresco, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice Experience\u201d", "Author": "SnowHillPond", "ReviewID": "UR126380187", "Content": "Stayed at the JW for a couple of nights in March 2012 on a business trip.

The suite was bigger than my first apartment out of college. One complaint: my room was about 1/4 mile from the check-in desk. It's a long way to carry a bag. 2. Location: The resort is considerably away from the Strip and so almost all of our activites were confined to the resort. Great view of the mountains. The resort has a ton of restaurants, a spa, golf, etc. 3. Meeting Facilities: The meeting rooms and banquet facilities were very adequate. The meeting rooms were great. We had some meals catered. Breakfast was fine (scrambled eggs, croissants, fresh fruit, etc.). Lunch was fine as well. No complaints. 4. Casino: Lots of slots, a betting parlor, basic table games (black jack, roulette, craps, etc.) No poker room. 5. Restaurants: We ate at the Irish Pub for lunch and Spiedini, Italian fare, for dinner. I had the fish and chips at the Pub. The chips were excellent and the fish was a little dry. I had the fish stew at Spiedini, it was salty. 6.

Though we are locals and have stayed at other Strip hotels before, this hotel actually won hands down overall. We arrived earlyfor check-in where the valet told us to find out which building we would be in. It wasn't the spa tower which is where we wanted to be since the spa and Ceres restaurant was located in here. It was the Palm tower on the first floor which we had to drive to. We had second thoughts but when we checked out the room and patio view of the water ponds, it was perfect. A simple walk through the hotel restaurants and stores got us to our couples massage reservations. It was well worth the package price of $329 that also included an excellent breakfast buffet. Our dinner at Ceres was perfect. A simple menu with wine pairing that they suggest, followed by a surprise birthday dessert dish, made the whole dinner worthwhile. Our waitress, who is from Bosnia, gave us the best service of all time. Ceres is a romantic type restaurant you have to go to and the prices are very reasonable. The room we stayed in was a junior suite which was rather large and the jacuzzi tub made for a roomy bubble bath for two. The tv speaker inside the bathroom was a neat feature. There was a second bathroom at the front door entry along with the bar area that had a frig.

I went for a spa weekend and I did not hear one single person on both sides of my room or in the hallway. There are so so food choices from sushi, Italian, pub or buffet to choose from since you are far from the strip. There is a casino which gets quite a few locals. Slots were progressive and I was \"up\" quite a bit! The only aspect of this hotel is that you do have to pay to get there from the airport if you don't rent a car.

I had read reviews beforehand, and found the critic reviews to be slanted. First off- a disclaimer, if you want action and the heat of the strip, no need to read further. The resort is located 20 minutes from the strip, near Red Rock Canyon. I have been to Vegas probably 40 times since the 80's, and personally I found the JW Marriott a nice change. The lobby is very nice, I was able to have an hour and a half conversation on a Sat night with an old friend in an almost semi private location. I loved the fact that you can get to room in 2 minutes, unlike the typical Vegas Casino which you have to walk a mile. I booked a room a week in advance on their website (got a $15 discount), and asked for an upgrade to a room with a balcony which was honored. The rooms are great, very big and had a walk in closet. The bathroom came with a large bathtub with jets, and a huge shower with a rainbow shower head. The comfort of the bed was so-so. The balcony had a view of the golf course. The grounds were excellent, the casino was a short walk from the hotel rooms. The casino has 5 restaurants. For dinner we tried the old school steak house restaurant, food was pretty good and fairly priced. The casino was a pretty dead scene for a Sat night. The following is what I didn't like: If you are flying in and have no transportation- you will get bored, you can always go to the Red Rock Casino about 2 miles away. The crowd is 50 years and older, and probably children in the warmer months. Food options for Lunch is lame.

Being that this hotel is more expensive than rooms on the strip, I can't understand why we paid to stay here vs the strip or elsewhere in Vegas off the strip. I was there for a work event as we booked out the whole hotel. I would not choose it on my own. The reason I'm writing this review though is b/c since it is off the strip, you have to think of transportation options from the airport to the hotel. Taxi would be worst option as a private car (if you book ahead) would cost you the same and then you wouldn't have to wait in the airport taxi line. The best and most fun deal though is to just rent a shuttle! If you do this through the concierge, you can book a full shuttle (it fit 20 of us!) for $136. That was a deal and kinda fun to book a bus for all back to the airport. Wish we knew of this for the way to the hotel as well. The website doesn't mention it as the web mentions the car company for private drivers but not this stellar shuttle deal. Anyways... hotel rooms are good. Casino, location, pool were not.

Starting asking the help where is everyone and they told us it was only 50% occupied- which is what I suspected but not sure why the front desk told us they were sold out. They gave us a room in the middle of a soccer team and there were doors slamming and loud talk that woke us up the first night.Then we asked again for an upgrade and cut our touring short to get back and move rooms, and although the second room was bigger it had no view, so was not worth making the change. Also, some of the basic services that you get from ALL other Marriotts did not seem to apply here....no newspaper in the morning, not greated as a platinum member....just a mention that they had my elite status on file, and no special check in for platinum members.

I completely loved this location. I am a Platinum Member for ten consecutive years so I know a lot about Marriott's. The biggest thing I will say about this place is that it has incredible ambiance and fantastic golfing. I was fortunate to stay in a upgraded junior suite which consisted of an extremely comfortable bed, large bathroom with a whirlpool tub, separate stand up shower, his and her sinks as well as a big walk-in closet in addition to a living room area. The only downside to the big room is that there was only one large flat screen television in the bedroom and living room area so you could only watch the television at one room at a time and in order to do so I had to swivel the television 180 degrees in order to watch it in the room of my choice. Amenities here are great. The views from my room are spectacular. I also got a chance to visit the spa a few times there and take advantage of their steam room and sauna. Very nice and relaxing there so I found myself spending a significant portion of time there during the visit. The gym is nice as well with a great view of one of the several outdoor pools. Speaking of pools, they have one of the most incredible views of a huge fish pond that included \"oversized goldfish\" and several pools. I was slightly inconvenienced on one day because there was a wedding that held on the property so I had to walk around that but I dont consider that a bad thing per se considering that it was for a special occasion for some lucky couple. The even bigger thing to think about here is the fact that the couple thought so highly of the location's ambiance that they chose to get married there considering \"Vegas weddings\" are not exactly a novelty. Apparently weddings are pretty commonplace there but again, it was definitely nice enough to be married there. Proximity to strip and area attractions is very good. Just a few minutes away to golf which I was able to play a around of. The Vegas strip is about a 15-20 minute drive away. There is always plenty of taxicab availability to take you there or to the airport as well. Service was exceptional. From the front desk staff to the concierge to the spa staff and room cleaning, everyone there was a delight to assist. I rated this hotel a four star stars largely because of a experience I had with the shower which at one point backed up and started to emit whatever the hell was in the drain up in towards the shower (not a pleasant experience) so I complained about that and the front desk did compensate my room charges for my breakfast very quickly for that.

We were disappointed in the number of restaurants that counted toward our daily resort credit, since all the onsite restaurants were not affiliated with the JW Marriott. The only complaint during our stay was the pool experience. The cushions on all the loungers were faded and turning brown, which was pretty disgusting . . . for a relatively small investment, the hotel should replace them and add more umbrellas, which would greatly improve the poolside experience! Also, the waiters and waitresses rarely came by, so in the end we accepted the fact that in order to to get a drink or food, we had to walk to the waterside cafe to place our orders.

Our room was spacious and comfortable though a little aged. The large bathroom had a separate shower and double Jacuzzi tub. They offer free valet service at both of their tower lobbies. The resort is very close to several outstanding golf courses and chain restaurants. Itwould be a good choice for those looking for a golf vacation.

We enjoy spending our time relaxing by the pool and enjoying the resort\u2019s amenities. That being said, this place was even too dull for our simple taste. Our package included a buffet breakfast each morning and a $50 a day resort credit. My wife planned on using the credit for a spa treatment while I went golfing. Upon checking out the spa however, it appeared that many of the spa features were closed for repair. This included their signature hydrotherapy pools and waterfall showers. There are several restaurants on site. We ended up using the credit to have dinner at Spiedini instead. The food was outstanding and the service was excellent. However, the restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday night. Like the rest of the resort, there was no buzz or excitement. The kitchen and wait staff outnumbered the diners.

However, if you are looking for nightlife, the strip isn't a long drive and the hotel offers a shuttle downtown. This property is close to a large variety of restaurants and shopping and the well-landscaped grounds always make us feel we could be anywhere but in Las Vegas. The property is designed in an L shape with two separate hotel towers on each end and the casino in the center. There are restaurants and shops in between, as well as a well-appointed spa. The Palms Tower houses the front desk, and a short walk/drive away is the Spa tower. It is particularly quiet there, as there isn't even an employee manned desk in the lobby, only the bellman out front. Most recently we stayed in the Spa tower, but have found all rooms similar in size and amenities. The rooms are generous in size, but it's the spacious bathrooms we find unique. There is a deep jetted tub and shower with a rain shower head and a double vanity with plenty of room. When traveling with our kids we have been able to get adjoining rooms without any difficulty. In the past couple of years we have expected to see remodeling taking place as the furnishings and decor are starting to show some wear, but it does all remain well maintained.

Views at night from room and balcony were spectacular - showing the glimmering lights of the city and gorgeous sunsets over the mountains and offered great photo ops. Grounds, with waterfalls and seasoned vegetation made for enjoyable garden strools. Architecture throughout the buildings and guest rooms themselves is beautifully designed/executed and remniscent of a bygone era, not unlike the Craftsman period, when there was a focus on stunning plaster and woodworking detail. If you appreciate elaborate workmanshop, you'll love this place. EVERY staff member, from arrival on, went out of their way to be helpful, friendly and accomodating. Bellmen, for instance, were personable, interested in how we were enjoying ourselves and responsive to requests for information. Housekeepers were thorough and readily solved a glitch with a table lamp and a TV remote. Our, large, two-bedroom suite (along with a 40-foot balcony) was furnished with quality furnishings, three wide-screen TV's, complementary art, two spa-type tubs and quality linens. Cleanliness, particularly of the three bathrooms and bar area, was excellent. Dining was made easy with restaurants ranging in both variety and price. We ate 5 meals there. The cafe was great for breakfast and we particularly enjoyed the ton katsu, soft crab and sashimi at the Japanese restaurant, SHIZEN. Lovers of authentic Japanese fare will feel right at home there. And those, like my wife, who enjoy opportunities for gaming will appreciate the large variety of casino games. What was the place missing? I could definitely taken advantage of something like an informal ice cream and dessert parlor - for late night snacks. I might add that the two dozen or so members of the wedding party who stayed at a popular strip resort/hotel and were subjected to the hubub and cattle-call-type hospitality of the area, were blown away by the serene surroundings and attentiveness found here. They won't make that mistake again.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern US", "Title": "\u201cPreferred Hotel in Las Vegas for Families with Young Kids\u201d", "Author": "krmik", "ReviewID": "UR113754359", "Content": "I had a conference in Las Vegas and we decided to stay here because my family came with me. We have 2 young children (ages 6 & 8) and we enjoyed this resort. It's about a 15 minutes drive without traffic from the strip. It didn't feel like we were in Las Vegas at all- it was quiet, serene, and had a tropical feel. The hotel staff was excellent- very friendly, helpful and really went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. My kids had a good time in the large resort pool. We had a suite that was spacious and clean. My only issue with the room was the furniture was chipped, worn and a bit dated. The chairs by the pool also looked worn and some were heavily stained. The only other issue I had with the hotel was the smoke from the casino. The starbucks and buffet restaurant my kids liked to eat at are right next to the casino. They inhaled a fair amount of second hand smoke when they ate there. I accept the fact it's Las Vegas where gambling and smoking go together, so we steered the kids away from that area. The other major reason we liked this hotel was location. The surrounding Summerlin area was a nice, clean, upscale suburb. There were plenty of shops, restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We didn't have to worry about our kids seeing smut. Las Vegas ads bill the strip as \"family friendly.\" No matter when you go, at any time of day it's not for young children. We thought we could take our kids to an matinee magic show and lunch in the middle of a weekday and it would ok for them. There are too many in your face smutty ads and people on the sidewalk handing out cards with naked women who work at the brothels. They're not supposed to give them to kids, but the cards are strewn all over the sidewalk where anyone can see them. Even though we tried to shield their eyes, my kids saw things that they were too young too see. After that, we just kept our kids at the JW for the rest of our trip. It's a safe family resort away from the strip.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTop Vegas Accommodations for Business/Golfer\u201d", "Author": "TheTravelProfessor", "ReviewID": "UR113582777", "Content": "Stayed here before a recent business meeting and it was all good.

Weather that time of year is ever changing even in Vegas: it was warm pool weather one day then cold and windy the next. This gave us a perfect time to enjoy the property and surrounding area in Summerlin. Room was very good but could use an update to modern colors. We were upgraded to a suite but it only had 2 windows that needed to be open to see even with the lights on. Beautiful bar area and very large bath. Property was very clean and the staff were 'bend over backwards nice' everywhere. It is in Summerlin, if you have not been there it is in the western side of the strip, butting up against the Red Rock park and an upscale neighborhood. The area is a lot mellower than Freemont St. or the Strip but refreshingly nice to not have to deal with all that. Pool area was clean, drinks & food were available. Inside there is a small casino and a variety of places to eat & drink. We especially enjoyed the martini bar during happy hour where the signature martinis were only $5 and were there a few nights. We ate only a few times in the resort and it was pretty good but did not try the high end places which looked really good. The casino was uncrowded due to the time of year and middle of the week, but very smoky. I had to leave one night, way too smoky for me. The ventilation system could have been a lot better. Surrounding area is nice, there was shopping and many restaurants. Freeway access was great and easy to navigate and avoid going through some very seedy areas just west of the Strip. The real draw is Red Rock park. It's beautiful and a great place to hike or walk.

In such a large area even when the resort is fully occupied you still have the feeling of privacy and serenity. The Resort has also the privilege of having a close full spectacular view of the mountain range.

Ultimately there was no problen with the voucher, however the entire experience was in very poor taste and an unnecessary inconvenience for what should have been a nice getaway off the strip. The hotel facilities presented a weird combination of facilities. This is a sprawling complex that has 2 main hotel buildings with public facilities cosisting of restaurants and a casino connectting the main buildings. I found the hotel buildings very nice and well maintained while the casino and restaurant areas felt like I had walked into facilities that had not been updated in decades. In the end we stayed at the hotel and enjoyed the room we were in, but we spent our evening entertainment dollars at the Suncoast casino located 5 minutes away. Suncoast had excellent offerings that entertained us well into the evening. Overall I was extremely disappointed that Marriott would put the JW Marriott name on this facility. I have never been disappointed with a JW Marriott until this stay. The staff was unhelpful, facilities are outdated, and there are much better offerrings in the area.

The poolside service was wonderful, and the food/drinks were good but typical extra high prices (10 bucks for a small margarita). That's expected at any resort. I was very pleased with our large room. Very clean, with beds that had down bedding and were SO very comfy (plus turn down service). There was a walk in closet and ceiling fan, and mini fridge (really a cooler more than a real fridge, but it got the job done). The absolute best thing that impressed me the most was the HUGE bathroom with soaking tub, steam shower, and seperate room for the toilet. Loved it. My only tiny complaint about the room was it had french doors that opened to a ledge only, and a balcony would have been awesome. Oh, and the TV is not a flat screen, but that was not a big deal for us considering how nice everything else was. The housekeepers did an outstanding job. We ate at the Italian place downstairs and it was good but again somewhat overpriced. I also utilized the Starbucks several times and we had a good breakfast in the place by the casino. Like everyone else mentioned, the casino is stinky and not that impressive. However the benefits of the hotel FAR outweighed any negatives.

We took a trip to the resort first to get a tour and check out the rooms. The desk staff and valet were super nice and despite a busy check in made a tour possible. We ended up making our reservation for the following night. Check in was smooth and we were able to check in early which was great because i wanted to sit by the pool and unwind. Our deluxe room was pretty nice, but you can see some wear and tear throughout the hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable but the best part for me was the huge bathroom and giant soaking jacuzzi tub! What a great place to unwind after a long week at a convention and staying on the LV strip! Perfect! The resort grounds were very well kept and the landscaping was beautiful. The pool area was large although the furniture was a little dated but overall very nice. The only down side to our experience was our restaurant experience. We decided to stay on the property and made a reservation for our anniversary dinner at their finer restaurant, \"Ceres.\" It wasn't overly busy so it was clear a reservation was not needed, but when we arrived at the empty hostess stand we were greeted but had to wait about 10 minutes to get our table. The plus here is that we were able to sit outside since it was a nice cool evening. Our waiter made his way finally to our table and the first thing he said was \"you'll have to be patient with me because we are swamped and short staffed tonight.\" Really? The first thing? Okay, well, my husband and I are in the hospitality business so we laughed it off and made little jokes....the rest of the service was slow but steady. We ordered their prix fixe menu but after a quick first course it took about 45 minutes to get our entrees. The atmosphere, the weather, and the food quality all made up for the service.

And I am not tired because of late night activities. I started my unsuccessful journey to peaceful REM at 9PM last night since I flew cross-country during the day. To start on the positives, this is a beautiful hotel located outside of Las Vegas. It is NOT, by any stretch IN Vegas, just to manage expectations. The common areas are bright and airy and the pool area is pretty large. The rooms are very large, the beds are very comfortable (for the little time you can sleep) and the bathrooms are very large and clean. It is attached to Rampart Casino and the hotel has out-sourced many of the basic amenities to the casino. Issues: 1 - When I reserved the room I requested foam pillows. This was confirmed at check-in and the front desk person wrote on the list (at 2PM). After dinner (~8PM) the pillows were still not in the room so I called At Your Service. She started blaming others (I could not care); there was one person ahead of me in line for service (I did not care; TMI) and she would have Housekeeping bring them to the room. They did and half were foam and half were feather, which I discovered when I got into bed at 9. 2 - My room was over the entrance and every time someone drove up they kept the music blaring and the bell people did nothing. Up and down all night. Likewise every shuttle bus and tourist bus idled outside my window, a constant droaning invaded the room. 3 - Fitness Center - This is basically two vacant rooms in the Palms Tower and suffers from severe neglect. The photos on the website ARE NOT the firness center associated with the hotel, but require a $25 per day fee per person. Totally false advertisement. BTW - you need to go through the smoke-filled casino to get to the $25 fitness center as well as the Marriott's feeble \"fitness center.\" Just what you want, lungs full of smoke on your way to exercise and then on the return. 4 - Coffee - Yes there is one cup available in the room via a coffee maker. So they have 2 Queen beds and one cup of coffee. Make sure you read and follow the directions of (a) cup; (b) coffee; (c) water; (d) plug in. One point, the coffee cup holds LESS than the coffee maker so if you fill the reservoir it will overflow into the cup. Perform task in bathroom on the sink. There is NO place to get coffee in the hotel, but there is a 24-hour restaurant if you go through the smoke-filled casino. Just what you want, lungs full of smoke on your way to get a cup of coffee first thing. When I asked the front desk if they do take-away, the response was \"some times they do and sometimes they don't.\" Are you kidding? BTW the covers do not fit the take-away cups all that well. 5 - Housekkeping - This has become a standard inadequacy in many hotels in the US. The housekeepers do NOT vacuum when you stay multiple nights. But in this case the vacuuming did not occur between guests as well. Upon arrival there was still scraps on the carpet from previous occupants. Likewise at this location housekeeping did not clean the waste bucket in the room. Just total laziness on the housekeeper's part as well as quality control by the supervisor. 6 - Minor nits - there is no switch on the lamp on the night table. You need to get out of bed to find a light switch. The lighting in the bathroom is very low. The TV can only be seen from the bed. The desk and the chair are not in the TV's line of site.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSTAY AWAY!!\u201d", "Author": "cliffrose1", "ReviewID": "UR76819861", "Content": "My mom, sister and I came to stay at the JW Mariott in Aug. 2010 for a fun girls weekend.

For $25 you can opt to take advantage of the fitness center, spa, internet, etc. So kudos for making this fee optional. And now for the bad: they 'canceled' our reservation. We had a suite reserved weeks in advance and while we were driving out to LV, we received a phone call asking if we had canceled our reserv. When we said 'no' the agent said that all the suites were now booked but she'd try to get us appropriate accommodations. We told her that we had just gone online at 10pm the night before to print out the confirmation and we had it with us. It all seemed very suspect, as when I've previously canceled reservations, no one calls to ask if I'm still coming and if I had in fact canceled. So I think that they canceled us on purpose to give the room to someone else (at a higher rate perhaps?), and then called us to 'let us know' that we would be staying in a different room/rooms. They put us in adjoining rooms instead, and they gave us a reduced rate on them, and we saved a little bit of money by doing it, but it was all very disconcerting as we had two teenagers who were really looking forward to the experience. In our bldg (there are 2 hotel towers), the areas around the elevators smelled like a sewer leak and/or mildew, depending on the day. Luckily you just pass through these areas and the rooms we had did not smell at all and were very nice, clean, and comfortable. The beds were great. The bathroom is great. Housekeeping was great. In-room coffee/coffeemaker is good. TV channel selection was good. The pool is nice. The grounds are nice. Parking is plentiful. The buffet is awful. The hostess in the buffet is the rudest hostess I've ever encountered. There are a lot of eating places within a few minutes drive of the hotel.

Ate at Spiedini and the Asian restaurant which was just ok and overpriced. The irish pub food was ok but I thought the portions were small but the price was moderate. They had a great band on Sat called Swagger, I would go back to catch them again. I did not like the size of the resort and the fact that it felt like you had to walk a million miles to get anywhere.

We were upgraded automtically, without even asking, to a 2 room suite with a HUGE patio overlooking a waterfall. The concierge was extremely helpful and room service was always timely and well done. Before the wedding we were given all access to the resorts waterfalls, landscaping, etc to take some breathtaking photos. As previously noted by other travellers, the rooms ARE HUGE by Vegas standards. The location is PERFECT for wanting to experience Vegas a day, maybe two, but still enjoy the restful portions of being on vacation. The location is great for families that don't want to subject their kids to the \"glitter\" of downtown, although might be a bit stuffy for younger crowd looking to be in the thick of things. The pool was great, waitstaff and towel attendants were polite and helpful. The drinks and food at the pool was a bit over-priced. The casino was not all that, but we arent big gamblers. The highlight of our trip was after our wedding, (mind you, NOT arranged by Marriott) we were told we had reservations at Spiedini Ristorante for our entire party, if we wanted to dine there. There were 8 of us total and we did not return from REd Rock until almost 8pm, but they made it work for us. They set us up at a private outdoor table overlooking a pool and waterfalls.

Nothing like having to see motorized wheelchairs, chain smokers, and oxygen tanks in a hotel. - Casino is on the small side and has limited variety. - Location is at least 20 minutes from the strip. - Wireless dead zone. Almost everyone in our group complained about the poor mobile reception both in the rooms and common areas. - Daily charges for internet The last two Cons really stuck me and had me angry at departure. It is pretty insane to charge anyone for internet access anymore and to charge obscene rates for phone usage. If LaQuinta can offer Internet for free, a property advertising itself as high-end can certainly do it too. Because of the poor mobile reception I was forced to use the landline and was charged an INSANE $200+ for four phone calls that averaged 10 minutes each. That's not a typo -- $200+. Unacceptable.

If you are going to stay here, I would suggest the Spa Tower, unless you have kids, then the other tower would be for you. The Room: We walked in our room and it was fabulous! At night we had a great view of the city. There were french doors that opened up to a grass/garden area. It wasn't a balcony, it was french doors that just opened up with a balcony railing right when you open the door. There were a couple sitting chairs and a coffee table that were right next to the french doors, so you can open the doors and sit in the chairs and relax. There is an ethernet cable ready for you to plug your computer into and it was free. The desk is nice sized with an office chair. The bed was really nice. Very comfortable and not too hard. There is a walk-in closet (nice-sized) with an ironing board, iron, and a safe. There is a little bar area that has a mini coffee maker. It makes single cups of coffee at a time. There is a little box where you can choose your coffee, tea, etc.. The Bathroom: The bathroom is BIG! There is a corner jacuzzi tub that can easily fit 2 people. There is a corner shower stall that has a sitting area and you can choose between a regular shower head or the waterfall shower head. Dual sinks with great ammenities. (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, q-tips, cotton nalls, etc.). The toilet is in a seperate part of the bathroom and is seperated by a door. There is a knob in the bathroom that you can turn on to listen to whatever you are watching on TV. I guess it's good if you're listening to the news while getting ready or whatever. The room includes some really nice and comfy robes. Dislike: The only thing I did not like was that there was no fridge in the room. As nice as the rooms are, there was no fridge. Kinda weird. In place of a fridge was what they consider a \"cooler\". This thing is not a cooler and you cannot change the temp of it. They have a bottle of water in there ($5 for the bottle) and it was maybe 2 degrees over room temp. Pretty pathetic cooler. There is a sign though that says that if you would like to request a fridge brought up to the room you can do so, but for only certain rooms. Again, weird. The Pool: The pool is gorgeous! Unfortunately I was unable to go there. The Spa: The Spa is awesome! A little pricey, but well worth the money. I got massages, scrubs, etc.. You get a robe and slippers, a private locker and it is just absolutely relaxing. There is a sauna and a steam room, hot and cold plunges, and a little pool inside the locker room. There is also these showers that have water plunging down on you really hard. Kinda massages your back and stuff. There are normal showers in there as well with the waterfall nozzle. They have large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel for you to use. There is also a fitness center in it, so you can work out too. I ordered lunch there which was also a little pricey for a salad but I was so relaxed I didn't care. There is a door to go outdoors to a coed pool and jacuzzi. There is also a fridge that you can have unlimited juices, water, and fruit. Restaurants: For breakfast, Ceres is best! They have a breakfast buffet that is really good! You can sit outside on the patio or you can eat indoors. Speidini's is really good too! It's an italian-type restaurant and is great for dinner. The hotel is connected to the Rampart Casino. I do not recommend eating at the Rampart Buffet for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I heard mixed reviews of that place, but after eating there, my husband and I both felt a little queezy. And we have iron stomachs! The Promenade cafe is good for lunch. There's a Starbucks there that comes in handy. The Carmel Room is a pretty good steakhouse. It's a la carte, so it can be a bit pricey. There are these secluded tables that are seperated by curtains for privacy. Pretty cool. If you eat there, just request one to the hostess. There's no extra charge for them. Checkout: Checkout was pretty easy. If you need a ride to the airport you can take their shuttle for $30 per person. The only bad thing is the shuttle only leaves at certain times and there are only 4 or 5 time slots. So you have to hope that your flight is somewhere around that. The other choice is a private vehicle for $50 that can pick you up whenever you want. Since there were me and my husband it was not only cheaper for us to take the private vehicle, but it was also more convenient (time-wise). The valet guys are really nice and very hospitable, so make sure you tip them. The only thing about the hotel is it's location. It's not on the strip and about a 15+ minute drive from the strip. It's in the Summerlin area which is on the other side of town. However, it is really nice and very relaxing. Since there's a casino attached, you can get your gamble fix in as well.

So why wasn't I thrilled. Let's start in the bathroom. It's enormous with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower. But on getting into the shower, it appeared that there was black mildew growing where the \"seat\" built into the shower met the floor. Which was creepy. On closer inspection, there was simply no grout there at all, those were unfilled gaps I was seeing. Also kind of creepy. The lighting was another issue. While there were five lights in the bedroom/living area, with all of them turned on, it was still dim. But the bathroom was the worst. The lighting was behind a cove, and even with the lighted makeup mirror, it was difficult to see well enough to even put on makeup. The hairdryer was one of those small travel-type dryers with two settings - burning hot tornado or light breeze cool. It made it really difficult to use and I very much regretted not bringing my own dryer, though in general, we stay at Marriotts and they have much higher quality dryers. Another issue was transportation to the strip. I found either on the conference brochure or their web site (can't remember which) that there was a shuttle to the strip. I am SO glad I called because this shuttle, during the week, goes 3 times a day. So you can't come and go at your leisure and if you go in the morning, you are pretty much trapped there all day unless you're willing to spend $50 (I'm told) on a cab.

I'm assuming they farmed it out as the restaurants and the casino seemed so un-Marriott like. We had the breakfast buffet at the restaurant closest to the front desk (can't remember the name right now). They had omelette station, waffle maker, and fresh pancakes. Other than that, the buffet overall was pretty disappointing as far as selection goes. We loved the gigantic pool.

It was never crowded, we had no problems getting a seat. During the busy times of the year that could be a problem. We did have a car, but the bus was so easy we took that into the city many times. Be sure to get a car to go to Red Rock Canyon, it's very close by and worth the trip. Also go the the Valley of Fire, it should not be missed for the scenery. The Hoover Dam is an easy trip, go by car. I wouldn't bother with a tour, that seems like they are herding cattle, go on your own. You can then go to Lake Mead and tour on the paddle boat, great trip. Again, go on your own, no need for a planned tour unless you do not have a car.

It's funny how new hotels pop up and suddenly your \"old\" hotel has lost its charm. That's definitely happening with the JW Marriott Las Vegas. The rooms and the common areas (hallways, dining room, even casino and bathrooms) are simply not in the same league as other 4 or 5 star properties in Las Vegas. The casino and establishments near it are also getting \"tired\". Having stayed at several JW's over the past 5 years, this one simply continues to look more and more dated as the years go by. The furnishings and decor are all very dull and uninspired. They never really tried too hard to tie in the southwestern feel of Nevada nor did they try to make it particularly luxurious which would be fine if this were a regular Marriott property rather than a JW. We did appreciate that the parking is free although the valets were busy chatting when we were struggling to get our bags out the door the morning we checked out. Housekeeping also needs to be told to \"use their inside voices\" because one yelling down the hall to the other at 8am is simply unacceptable. The breakfast staff at the main restaurant \"Ceres\" were all very good to us but we did have an issue with one man at the front desk. Breakfast for 2 was included in our room but my husband did not have any \"coupons\" with him so the waiter simply suggested he go to the front desk to get coupons. The front desk clerk was very irritated that the waiter suggested this and my husband ended up walking all the way back to our 4th floor room (which was some distance) only to find they never provided any coupons. In May we stayed at the JW Desert Ridge in Phoenix and breakfast was also included. There, you simply advise your name and room number and they take care of the rest. Here at the LV location, it's apparently like the food hall at your old college campus. This is not the way most 4/5 star resorts operate and in a hotel like this, the front desk should have been more concerned about the guest rather than their displeasure with a coworker. We chose this hotel partly because of its proximity to Red Rock Canyon - where we like to hike - but also the fact that it's not on the strip and we wanted to relax on the first leg of our trip (we returned to Vegas and stayed at The Palazzo the following week). The other reasons we chose this hotel was because of the size of the rooms in the main building and the pool area - which I still love. I do however believe there were some people at the pool who were not guests at the resort which I never care to see and I wish hotels were more vigilant about that. I just hope that Marriott can take a real hard critical look at this property and bring it back up to JW standards. I would still recommend this hotel to a friend but only if I gave them the entire picture.

We quickly realised that if we hadn't picked to stay at the JW, our experience would not have been nearly so good. The hotel has a real resort feel - it is in a peaceful location in Summerlin, maybe 20 minutes from the Strip. This was really important because in temperatures reaching 108F during the day, the wonderful water gardens, the superb pool and the golf setting was just a world away from the crowded strip. We loved going down there at night and either drove ourselves or used the free hotel shuttle but I wouldn't have wanted to stay down there. It would be great if you were just going for a weekend, or possibly in the winter when it wasn't so hot, but not in August. We spent fabulous days around the pool - it felt like a real holiday - and then lived it up down on the Strip at night. Our room was very spacious - two queen sized beds and an enormous bathroom with large spa bath and huge shower. We had a small balcony overlooking the grounds and we were in the main tower. There is a restaurant in the hotel but most of the dining options are in the casino area. We ate a lunch buffet and a dinner buffet (pretty mediocre to be honest) and had breakfast a couple of times. Wouldn't rave about any of them other than they were cheap. Valet parking was free and very speedy. The pool is beautiful with superb beds and a good little snack bar with very quick pool service. We spent a lot of time out there. The only problem was that there were not a lot of umbrellas which was strange but as the hotel wasn't crowded when we were there it was not an issue. The loungers were very comfortable. We ate out in Vegas a lot and attended shows and generally walked around admiring all the glitz and glamour. Really enjoyed the week and wouldn't hesitate to return. We visited many of the Strip hotels and whilst they were very elaborate and exciting, it would have been like staying in a theme park: so noisy, crowded, tour groups constantly moving through, the noise from the casinos which are in the lobbies. The JW is NOTHING like this and that was a blessing for us. If you want to be in the heart of the action 24 hours a day, it won't suit you.

The hotel is definitely over-sized and felt very empty in July (presume the recession had bitten) but the room we were allocated was fantastic.

The breakfast was pretty limited and not very exciting although the staff were very attentive and friendly. The revolting casino area was dreadful and in fact that entire part of the hotel, really unattractive.

I've stayed at JW Marriott properties before, including the Star Pass Resort in Tucson (my very favorite resort) and the JW in Washington DC, and have always had very positive experiences. With this visit, we were so dissatisfied, that we left the property ten minutes after checking in. The first impression was (and I KNOW this is a little thing) that the table sitting against the wall just inside the front doors was pushed to the side so that it was not centered under the mirror above it. Most people would not notice this, and most people who would notice it, would not care, but it was a sloppy first impression to me and not in line with what I have come to expect with Marriott. The hand railings and the interior doors were in need of paint, and again just surprising to see in a JW Resort. Our room was small and did not have the big nice bathroom that you see pictured on the internet. The room did have a very small balcony, which overlooked the main street. I noticed that the room charge listed on our room key holder was more than what the reservationist had told me and more than what was listed online, so I tried to call the front desk. Nobody answered the first two times I tried to call, and finally someone picked up the phone after many rings during my third attempt. They verified that my room was going to be at a higher rate and I explained that I was not impressed with my room or with the service so far and decided to check out. When I went to the front desk, the gentleman at the front desk told me that it was our fault that we got that room because we \"insisted on checking in before a nicer room was available.\" (I am NOT kidding.) We stayed at a very nice suite at the Venetian - the room was much bigger, the bathroom was much nicer, the bed was incredible, there were three TVs and curtains that closed with the touch of the remote. We were very pleased with our decision to leave the JW. The hotel would be nice for an older couple (we are in our 40's) who wants to play golf and who does not like Vegas. If you want more of what Vegas has to offer - luxury hotels, action, lights, night life, great pools, spectacular spas, etc - the luxury hotels on the Strip have so much more to offer. The hotel just didn't have the crispnesss that you would expect to see, and seemed that it needed some repair. I found the service at the front desk to be horrible.

I am very familiar with it , and received a terrific \"locals' rate\" when I booked. We checked in late in the evening; still the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Even a random bellhop we encountered in the elevator told us to have a nice visit. We were very impressed with the room at first glance: It was incredibly spacious, on the sixth (top) floor with a small balcony overlooking, well, essentially nothing, but it was a nice amenity anyway. A small mirrored bar area with a coffee maker was also featured, as was a walk-in closet with a wall safe. The bathroom is gigantic with a \"rain head\" shower (as well as a regular shower head) featuring a tiled seating area, a large jacuzzi tub, a speaker in the ceiling that allows you to hear programming from the TV in the guest room, plenty of lighting, a lighted makeup mirror, a laundry basket for towels, and an old-school telephone in the water closet. The negatives: Things could have been a bit cleaner. The vent in the water closet was visibly clogged with dust. One of the two faucets at the sink had a hole in it which shot water toward the bathroom mirror and all over the counter when it was turned on. The \"rain head\" shower head -- even when not being used -- dripped a good amount of water on you whenever the regular shower head was turned on -- rather annoying. There was visible dirt and a couple of black hairs in the bathtub, as well as a large spot of dried urine on the floor in front of the toilet. The bottle of hand lotion provided was only half full, indicating that it had not been switched out following the previous guest. There were not nearly enough towels in the bathroom (only two of each size and a bathmat). And while the bed itself was comfy, the small pillows were not and ruined what might otherwise have been a terrific sleep. The TV is a little outdated and the remote difficult to maneuver in a darkened room. Also, the ceiling fan was very noisy -- so much so we could not turn it on when we went to bed for fear it would keep us up all night.

They pitch you at the front desk to purchase a \"Resort Fee Package\" which includes 1 bucket of golf balls per day, Internet , and one pass/person to the fitness center and spa; all for $25/day. Also, if you plan on spending time on the strip and getting home late this hotel is about 12 miles driving distance from the strip and traffic from the hotel to the strip is horrendous!

In the past, the other hotels on the strip only seemed to offer $25 minimum tables. - The pool was closed for the season, but I would definitely come back to try out the pool. - Clean and classy - Overall good service from everyone we met CONS: I can't really think of any cons except that maybe the towels and pillows didn't smell fresh, but I understand some people don't like a scent in their pillows.

The desk and chair were not ergodynamic and actually incredibly uncomfortable to work at for any stretch. -The \"free\" gym may have been the worst hotel gym I have ever seen. I walked in an walked right out again. The spa gym, which is an astounding $25/day to use, was much nicer, but with low-end cardio machines and deflated workout balls (they couldn't find the pump). The individual tv's had the same problems with many of the broadcast networks. -The casino was terrible.

No big deal, but maybe this could have been handled by the concierge on her phone. Kudos to the bellhop team - those folks were great. Our room was really beautiful, with a lovely view of the eastern horizon.

Housekeeping was outstanding, making no fuss about our bikes being in room. The bathroom was beautiful and beautifully kept. The beds were dressed with soft linens and a plush mattress top. We slept very well! One problem was the noise of the air conditioner. We called for help with this, but the handyman who arrived was only able to tell us how to use it, not how to fix it (it was quite loud). We solved the problem by just leaving it off, which is probably not an option for guests during the summer months. We ate at Shizen - wow! So yummy! We also ate at an in-hotel cafe, which was good food-wise, but bad cigarette-smoke-from-the-casino-wise.

So if you check into this hotel make sure you don\u2019t receive a room near the elevators or you will hear a rumbling noise all night long. Another problem was the Spa. Do not pay extra to use the spa pools. This is a 25.00 charge. They claim in the brochure that \u201cthere are six invigorating chambers of the outdoor Hydro-circuit pool\" Ummm well, only two were working. They need matience badly at the spa pool area. Things looked worn down and in need of repair. There is no pool service at the Spa pools, which is not too good as if you wanted a drink you had to wander into the locker rooms The main pool was large and seemed to have many people enjoying themselves but a couple times time I attempted to relax by the pool it was close do to \"special events\u201d One time was a wedding, not sure about the other time, but was closed due to a special occasion, which left the majority of the guest without a pool area to enjoy. The Irish pub was nice and had wonderful fish and chips. Shizen the Japanese Steak House and Sushi Bar was out of this world, excellent service and food. Don\u2019t miss this. Breakfast buffet at Ceres in the hotel was very good, they have a nice omelet station, try the made to order waffles, excellent!! For some reason the hotel restaurants had a hard time accepting Marriott gift cards we received as gifts for our anniversary. They would say they cant accept since they are not owned by Marriott,,,but the front desk told another story and said they are accepted everywhere on the Marriott property,,,bottom line,,,BIG HASSLE...Marriott needs to get their stories straight and on the same page. Maid service was spotty at best, first two nights received room cleaning, last two nights, nothing, and they didn\u2019t show up.

The bed and the sheets were very comfortable. I happened to look at when the mattress was purchased and it was back in 1999, so maybe a refurbish would be a good idea sometime in the near future. At check out I brought up the problem of mold that was in our shower, they seemed surprised, not sure if they were surprised I brought it up, or it had mold. They made a note of it and said would have it checked out. As I said, this was our anniverery and several other reviews said they were sent, a bottle of champaign, strawberries and chocolates to their room..., no such luck here. Although my travel agent made sure to let the hotel know about the special anniversary celebration the hotel they seemed to just ignore it. The valet service was great; the guys very fast, helpful and friendly. The hotel seemed to do the bulk of their business with convention guests, and this is who they prefer to cater to, very little leisure guests and I can tell the business guest are number one here and treated so, vacationers are a after thought.

We loved it and would recommend it. It reminded us of a resort in Mexico. Here's our review: - Guest room \u2013 Great! Really large! We were in the Palm tower \u2013 must be the convention tower, but we saw no one around until the night before we left. We did not mind being a walk from the main building. - First floor patio - Relatively private (surrounding foliage) with lounge chairs, eating table and chairs. Much nicer than a room with a \u201cbalcony\u201d. - Staff - Courteous staff. Average on a scale 1-10 (10 being highest) \u2013 we would give them an 8. Some were very nice, most were nice. Housekeeper Radmilla, very nice. Front bell staff \u2013 very nice. But - Crabby bartenders in the Irish pub! - Casino \u2013 nice size (didn\u2019t win, but had fun!) - Spa - Wonderful! The best experience I have ever had! Ask for Brian (Cucumber/Melon body scrub). - Healthclub \u2013 Big, fancy healthclub in the main tower free on the days you \u201cspa\u201d. $25 on the days you don\u2019t. Other option, go to the Palm tower to a small workout room for free. (we did one day of each) No real walking trails. - Pool \u2013 very nice, not crowded at all when we were there - Amenities \u2013 we asked for a refrigerator in our room so we could keep water, snacks. There is a VONS grocery store nearby. - Distance from the strip \u2013 about 20 minutes. Worked for us \u2013 we did a lot of other sightseeing. - Onsite restaurants \u2013 Buffet \u2013 okay. Look for coupons. Caf\u00e9 \u2013 okay. Use your casino points there to get a discount. Starbucks \u2013 good for coffee every morning. What we did (beside the strip) - Liberace museum \u2013 Very kitschy, fun! Gotta see it! - Atomic Testing museum \u2013 kind of depressing, but complete historical info - Ethel M chocolates \u2013 worth it for the free samples! Yum. - Freemont street \u2013 make sure you see the light show at night - Red Rock \u2013 only 20 minutes from hotel - Red Rock casino \u2013 check it out. Pretty slick Where we ate - Nora\u2019s wine bar \u2013 YUM! Near the hotel, about $20 ala carte dinners. The Farro e Cinghiale \u2013 (Braised wild boar) is wonderful!

We got one of the large ones and it came with three tables and chairgs, and five lounges outside the cabana in an area that was private from the rest of the pool. Also the misters were a big plus in the 100 degree weather. The one negative for the hotel is that the casino is kind of lacking compared to the strip and even comparing it to the Red Rock. The good news is that the Red Rock is only about a 10 minute drive away, and you can get to the strip in about 20 minutes so if you want to be away from the craziness of the strip during the day this is a good option.

There's a Japanese restaurant with Sushi that's pretty good, the standard Vegas coffee shop and one nicer restaurant called Ceres that has a pretty good breakfast buffet.

We chose this location as we are fans of JW Marriott and we have had great experiences at our 2 visits to the Phoenix Desert Ridge JW Marriott resort. We thought it would be great to be off the Las Vegas strip but close enough. From the reviews at Trip Advisor I expected the JW Las Vegas to be at least as good as our experiences at the Phoenix resort. We chose June/July as we love the heat. The biggest advise I would give with regard to staying at any Marriott is to go back and check room prices frequently leading up to your stay. You can do this online quite easily. As I said, we booked this approximately 1 year in advance (July/August 2007). When I checked the room cost 4 months later (December 2007), it had dropped by nearly \u00bd. We called and we were given the new, discounted rate. When you\u2019re talking about 7 nights at an upscale resort, which can be a significant amount. Again, I checked the room rate 2 weeks before we were scheduled to leave and it had dropped again to the tune of $150 for the week. We called and they gave us the new rate. Keeping on this saved approx. $1000 for the week. When booking we requested a balcony room upgrade as high up as possible. We also had them document that this was our 25th anniversary in the hopes that it would impact getting a better room at check-in. We waited until almost 4pm and our room was ready. It was a beautiful, very large King room. Did we get upgraded\u2026no. But we got a great balcony room on the top floor (6th) with a great view of Red Rock Canyon just like we requested. Mid-week the hotel sent up strawberries dipped in chocolate and champagne for our anniversary. Very nice touch. When we first arrived our room was not ready so we decided to take a walk through the resort. First impressions\u2026..the place was very nice but darker and more closed in that I expected. Nearly all the restaurants and lounges at the resort were either directly attached to the casino or you needed to walk through the casino to get to anything. Apparently a common practice in Vegas. Although the resort and restaurants in Vegas are non-smoking, the casinos are all smoking\u2026.cigars and cigarettes included. There are 2 main buildings (\u201cTowers\u201d). The Spa tower and the Palms tower. The Spa tower has only 1 restaurant in the lobby area (Ceres), which is where we spent most of our time. The food was decent and the drinks were good. What we liked most was the Ceres lounge area which has couches and over stuffed chairs. The lounge is full service and you can order off both the lounge menu and the restaurant menu. Very comfortable. The Palms tower was actually more nicely decorated, but there is little going on. If at the Palms tower, however, you have easy access to the Starbucks, Woolighans Irish Pub (greasy food), Speidini Italian restaurant (high quality food but lacking in flavor), a Shizen Japanese Steak House and the Rampart Buffet without having to go through the Casino. All the restaurants and lounges are operated by Marriott except the Casino, the Promenade caf\u00e9 (literally almost IN the casino \u2013 SMOKEY), and the Buffet. The Waterside Grill by the pool has a great Mai Tai and OK food. It closes early though. I believe around 6pm. I had read a lot on the shuttle at Trip Advisor. Some said too crowded and long waits, others said a long ride to the strip, and yet others said no problems. Our experience\u2026..no problem. The shuttle was never full. That said, we went in June/July, apparently the slow season. Our stay was from June 28 \u2013 July 5. Based on what I had read, I was not expecting anything significant for the 4th of July. When we arrived, we asked the concierge at the hotel if July 4th was a big event in Vegas. She too stated that it was not. The 4th came and nearly all the hotels shot off fireworks. It was quite a display. When we made our plans to visit the Las Vegas JW, we knew we wanted to visit the Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, and the Grand Canyon Skywalk. We did, therefore rent a car. I would not, however, recommend driving on the strip if you can help it. The traffic is unbelievable. That said, it is extremely easy to get around and through Vegas. The highway system is well designed and fairly easy to navigate. Just avoid the strip when driving if you can help it. Wall to wall cars, red light after red light, and crazy taxi drivers. We visited Hoover Dam. Amazing. We took a hike in red Rock canyon. Beautiful. Just remember to bring lots of water. Never made it to the Grand Canyon Skywalk \u2013 3 hour drive. A few other things to note: Nice pool but not the cleanest. We actually called to complain because there were tissues and a used Band-Aid in the pool for 2 days. They say there is a refrigerator in the room, but is actually a crisper and not cold enough to cool drinks or keep leftovers. The resort is still using big 32 inch tube TV\u2019s. I expected flat screens. Overall a nice resort. If we were to go back we would stay for less time and stay at the Bellagio, which is in my opinion the most spectacular and classy hotel on the strip. If you\u2019re thinking of vacationing in Arizona or Nevada, I would recommend the JW Marriot Desert Ridge in Phoenix which is far and away a nicer place than the Las Vegas JW Marriott.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Vancouver, B.

Nor is this resort for you as it is 20 minutes away by car west on the freeway. However if you want to relax at a nice resort without all the crowds and packs of hormone induced young and old adults, this may be one of the few places that probably rates highly for that. I say highly because this was my first time to Sin City. I actually used tripadvisor.com to help whittle down the choices I had to make and I'm happy with the selection. Now being there at the end of June does test one's resilience to heat, but that comes with the territory. The fairly lush grounds with many water features and one large pool minimizes the heat sink that a lot of hard surface paving would otherwise create. The JW Marriott Resort is in the town of Summerlin, just west of the City of Las Vegas and very easy to get to from the Strip and McCarran Airport via the freeways. Once on the freeway leaving the Strip, there is only one traffic light to encounter before driving onto the grounds so access is quick and easy. The Resort is a collection of two 6 story towers of over 600 hotel rooms and probably Marriott timeshare units. As we were there for only 3 nights, I didn't get a chance to take everything in. Nestled between the towers, there is the hotel entrance and lobby, the full service Aquae Sulis Spa, and fully equipped exercise facility, 6 on-site restaurants, meeting facilities and the outdoor amenities including a large 4' deep free form pool with water fall, several jacuzzis and private cabanas and tying it all together a network of landscaped water features and gardens.....all very nice. Poolside service seemed quite attentive. Of course, being in Nevada, there has to be a casino, the Rampart Casino. Nice thing though is the entrance lobby of the hotel has no signs of the casino nor any sounds of slots within earshot. The Casino is completely removed, but also not far away. I liked that. Not being a gambler, I cannot comment on this amenity. There is no grand architectural statement made by this hotel like you would find at the Strip or other out-lying resorts. Nor is the architecture of the resort going to turn any architectural eyes with the standard beige sandstone colored facades and Spanish tile roofs. However it is straight-ahead high quality, open resort planning with generous interior spaces and outdoor landscaping finished reasonably well. My wife and I had a standard single room on the top floor with a shallow balcony (about $200/night). The king bed was very nice and the overall appointments were not anything really special, but it was well designed. The bathroom was very large and generous with a shower (with wall and overhead shower heads) and two person jetted tub and separate stall for the watercloset. Granite counters and marble floors were nice. Marriott toiletries were provided. The room itself, while it had a lock-off door to the adjacent room, was solid and quiet. One thing of note, and I don't know if this is typical of most upper scale Vegas resorts as I know it doesn't happen in other desert places we have stayed in, but this JW Marriott treats the hotel room water to soften it (it's not hard water that I've usually found elsewhere in the desert). It's tastes very good, no chlorine flavor, and as is typical of soft water, feels like you've not rinsed off all the soap in the shower. HIgh marks for this. If you've read some of my other reviews, I like to fit in some exercise and with 100F temperatures, that wasn't going to include an outdoor run or hike so I had to resort to using the fitness centre. Very plush and visually impressive with all the treadmills and step and elliptical machines having their own TVs. Weight machines are all on a carpeted area and most machines are there. There's also a glassed in hardwood floor, exercise fitness studio floor where they run some classes, but I didn't see any while there. Locker room is very nice and there is complimentary fruit, juice and use of special treatment baths. There is also a dedicated outdoor pool and patio which looked very inviting. All this comes at a price however, which I found to be the downside and limiting me to only one use of the facility. As nice as it was, the $25 fee for a day pass was excessive, especially if one only uses the place to workout for an hour or two and then is outta there afterwards. One consolation is that if you get a Spa treatment, the fitness fee is waived that day. They should work on a lesser rate for those who just need to get the blood circulating. The large pool was nice with lots of deck chairs. We were out there by 9 each AM to beat the heat and there would only be few others out there too (late risers in Vegas). Lots of trees, grass and plants and some umbrellas for shade. There are several jacuzzis around and also cabanas with misted air conditioning and TVs. While the pool was fairly large and adequate for the numbers, a second separate pool would have been nice. We only had one breakfast at the Ceres Restaurant on site and it was done well, but not memorably special. Other meals were had off site as we wanted to see some of the sights. Front desk service was very good as was the Concierge. It definitely helps with the hotel not being inundated with guests. If there had been a convention, that might be different. We also noticed that the weekend brought in more people. Parking on site, while available on the open air parking lot, is best done in the parkade connected to the Casino to keep the car out of the sun. We rented a Dodge Caliber from Dollar for 4 days for a total of just under $50 plus gas. Can't beat that! For the golfers, this is a great location as the Resort is next to the TPC Las Vegas (formerly the TPC Canyons) and the Palmer designed Angel Park Golf Club which in addition to the Mountain and Palm Courses also features a night play 12 hole short course and 18 hole putting green. I didn't get a chance to play, but maybe next time. While never really wanting to go to Vegas in the past, I can't say I won't go again. Finding this hotel would make that difference. Apart from the hotel, here are a few other things we did that I would recommend: 1. We saw two shows. Bette Midler at Caesar's Palace Coleseum and Le Reve at the Wynn Hotel. Being a Bette Midler fan I'd have to give it 5 stars. She's not only a great singer, but a crack-up comic and so inventive with her spectacular show. Le Reve is an aquatic Cirque de Soleil type show which is in a theatre in the round, all good seats. This too is spectacular for completely different reasons with tremendous aquatic and athletic performances, props water and lighting effects and aquatic staging. You should check the website to understand the story first as there is little dialogue. Also note that big shows in Vegas command big bucks. 2. Shopping is great to buy things at the Fashion Show Mall across from Treasure Island and Wynn Hotels as there is Bloomies, Nordstroms, Macy's, and Nieman there and a three level mall. Also the Las Vegas Prime Outlets 10 minutes away by taxi or shuttle have the usual assortment of mid-range outlet stores. If budget is no object, the The Shops at the Forum at Caesar's Palace and at the Wynn Hotel are Rodeo Drive transplants. We never made it to Bellagio Hotel itself, but I imagine the shops there to be of this same no budget caliber. 3. See the fountains at the Bellagio. It's free and it's a different show every 15 minutes, each show lasting 3 or 4 minutes. Go at night. 4. A short trip to Red Rock Canyon, if you like geology, is a nice getaway. There's a 13 mile scenic loop with a number of stops and a Visitor Centre. HIke in the trails if the temperature allows. Entry fee for the drive is $5 for a car. While it's neat, Sedona north of Phoenix, makes this pale in comparison. 5. Of all the hotels we saw on the Strip (Caesars, Venetian, Paris, Treasure Island, Mirage, Palazzo and the Wynn), my favorite was the Wynn by far. It's probably at least on par with the Bellagio, but not having visited that, I can't compare, but being built by the same guy, Steve Wynn and with the Wynn being newer, I would lay bets, the Wynn may be at least a touch above if not more. Travel websites rate the Wynn as the best in Vegas and one of the best in the U.S..

This hotel had amazing rooms. First of all the rooms are enormous for hotel rooms, especially when you compare it to the regular rooms at any hotel on the strip. They had amazing bathrooms with his and hers sinks, very nice Jacuzzi tub for two (plenty of space; I must add that my husband and I are tall people) separate stand up shower, and the toilet was in a separate place with a door, very nice. The property had very pretty ground, the valet parking was for free and the crew was really nice and fast, very worth the tip :-) They have a few restaurants in the hotel but we had tried only Ceres for breakfast one morning and the brunch was really nice, must try the waffles, they were wonderful, and I normally don't eat waffles. The hotel service was good, and they also have the Rampart Casino connected to the property for all those late night gamblers, $5 blackjack at the Rampart casino. The grounds were beautiful but we never got to use the pool since the weather did not cooperate for us that week-end ;-( The drive the to strip was only 12 minutes so it was very convenient. The only thing I was not really impressed with was the Spa. It seems that it was only one person doing all the treatments that day, she was nice but nothing spectacular. If you want to use the spa facilities ( which included the fitness area) a they charge you a $25 fee per day ( free day pass to the facilities, if you do a spa service that same day). I would not recommend to pay $25 because it was worth it. I think the hotel should give free access to these facilities anyways.

In particular, one server (buyon??) went out of his way to ask the chef to prepare us bag lunches for our hike later that day. As we were getting ready to go the chef ran out and gave us oranges to go in our bags (very thoughtful). Rooms were very spacious. Nice spa tub and rainfall shower and good view of golf course/mountains. The poolside service (although only open one of the few days I was there because it was cold/rainy) was good. Often you had the hottubs to yourself. Unless you are going to get a treatment, I wouldn't pay 25 per person so use the spa facilities for a day (although they were nice (we checked them out-nice sitting areas, waterfall showers/hot tubs in the women's facility)) because you could just use the hot tubs near the pool. Also the spa entrance is right near the casino (poor layout). It is nice, though, that the casino was far removed from the rest of the hotel!! Most of the people at the hotel were older or business people there for conventions. Very few children. When we went to the Dolphin habitat and got a view of the hotel pools on the strip (OVERCROWDED) I was sooo happy I decided to stay at the JW. Grounds were amazing. The red rock casino/hotel grounds looked terrible comparably (just a giant building that pops out of the desert on the way to the red rock conservation area). Only thing that annoyed me a little was that they didn't have a room available for us when we tried to check in at about noon on our first day. They held our bags for us while we went out to the strip though. Great valet service (complimentary). I was getting used to just driving up to the door and leaving the car with the valet.

It also looked directly over the entrance way. This meant noise all day and (this being Vegas) well into the wee hours as people returned from their nights out in, shall we say, a cheerful frame of mind PLUS lots of traffic noise from the busy road starting in the early morning. It being nice weather, I would've liked to have slept with my french doors open but this proved absolutely impossible to do and get sleep and I was on the 5th floor! I can only imagine what it would've been like on the second floor! I honestly have to say I've rarely been in such a noisy room and certainly not at $275 a night! When we return, I will definitely make very sure I'm not \"facing the golf course\" in the Spa Tower! That being said, the resort is great in every other way. I do wish they had some other nightclub venue. They have two small bars offering live entertainment but nothing with a dance floor or a nightclub atmosphere. Also, they have a free shuttle to the strip (otherwise a $40 cab fare including tip); however, it lets you out across from Fashion Mall. It's a real hike from there to any of the main resorts (like at least 20 blocks). Cab fare from there to Mandalay Bay where we were attending a show was $15 with tip.

It is only 5 minutes from the hotel and I can see why it is the #1 restaurant in Las Vegas. We also took a tour to the Grand Canyon, South Rim with grand-adventures.com. Daryll was our tour guide/owner. Most of the tours from Las Vegas are to the West Rim, which is actually not in the Grand Canyon National Park. This tour takes you to the South Rim and is really beautiful. The day we went there was a fresh coat of snow and it was breathtaking. Daryll's tours are different in the fact that he only takes about 10 people in a mini van, unlike most tours to the south rim which are in a large bus with 50 passengers. The ride was about 5 hours each way, but well worth the trip. He allows plenty of time at the canyon. I highly recommend this tour if you want to see the South Rim and have a limited amout of time. We also took an ATV tour and Valley of Fire with awesomeadventureguide.com. We had a great time on this tour, about 4 hours on the ATV in the dunes and than a drive through the Valley of Fire which is really amazing. I would also like to add that a drive through Red Rock Canyon is a must, it is only a five minute drive from the JW Marriott.

During the conference, all the attendees were transferred to the Strip, to the Mirage for dinner at Stack\u2019s and to see \u201cLove\u201d (Beatles Cirque de Soleil Show). That transfer only took 15 minutes. So, the Las Vegas Strip is a short transfer, but a transfer none the less. The JW Marriott is very nice with beautiful landscaping, a big resort pool, a big fitness center & spa, its own casino, a handful of restaurants, a Starbucks, and a couple of shops. The rooms are top notch, spacious, and loaded up with marble bathrooms, separate tub and big walk in shower, a walk-in closet, safe, good desk with an Internet connection. From a conference/meeting perspective, it was just fine, with guest rooms comparable to Bellagio, Venetian, and almost at nice as the Four Seasons. So, if you are going to Las Vegas and don\u2019t want to stay on the Strip, then the JW Marriott will be just fine. For me though, given a choice, I would always rather stay on the Strip.

Rooms are great and typical of an upper-end property, but the layout of the hotel is a bit bizarre. The previous review that said that the hotel wasn't for disabled travellers wasn't joking...I'd also add that it isn't the best for hoofing around in a pair of high heels either! I'd reckon that the endless corridors orginated when the Marriott planning team tried to work its way around the Rampart Casino. The hotel is pretty crisp in a reassuring, vanilla kind of way until you walk through the casino hub...then it's all worn carpet, low ceilings and cigarette smog. Not exactly ringing the five-star bell, if you know what I mean. All of that aside, however, I probably won't rank it as low if it wasn't for the dodgy service issues we encountered. Nothing earth-shattering, but the lot would put me off staying at the hotel again. Stuff that happened during our stay included... --Laundry that showed up at the last possible second. We had sent some suits in to be pressed when we arrived early the first afternoon and we were told they'd run it through and have it up the next morning. Late the following afternoon, as we were contemplating how to spruce up our t-shirts for a business dinner, we were told that the order had been sent off-property and it still wasn't back. The gal on the phone was very helpful and entertained our half-hourly nervous phone calls but it was a little too close for my taste. --Concierge apathy. We needed some information on how to get ahold of a few simple things and both gals suggested that we check the local shops. Funny that I didn't think of that. I was a concierge myself, and I dimly remember something about assisting the guests by providing specific information, and even calling a few places if I didn't know the information off the top of my head. Being as we didn't know the area, even a nudge in the right direction would have been helpful. --Strident telephone operators. My cell phone wasn't working, I was down on the Strip and I needed to contact my husband at the hotel. I had the room card jacket so I called the number on it. The operator patched me through to the room. As soon as I set the phone down, I realized that I needed one more piece of info so I called the hotel again. This time a different operator tells me that she can't connect me. I have to call the local number. I explain that I'm calling from a borrowed phone, and that I had just reached the room moments earlier. Besides, each piece of hotel information in my purse only lists two phone numbers for the hotel; a 877 phone number and a local fax. She tells me that she CAN NOT connect me. It is impossible. She will be happy, however, to give me the local number if I can find a pen. I said again that I was on a borrowed phone and could I please speak to a manager. She sent me to a voice mail box. When I got back to the room, I sifted through my purse again. I had the hotel brochure and a bunch of little cards from the room key jacket. All have the 877 phone number listed. I'm confused why this number is prevalent if guests aren't allowed to use it once they are in the hotel. Overall, there were just a bunch of little details like this that kept the stay from being relaxing and enjoyable. Could have just been our bad luck that we kept running into so many off-putting quirks, but I don't think that I would ever venture back to this hotel again when there are so many other premium options in the area.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Red Deer, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class Joint\u201d", "Author": "donstone", "ReviewID": "UR10165308", "Content": "I had opportunity to spend 4 nights at the J W.

First, they put your bill on the outside of the door in the middle of the night rather than sliding it under advertising to others your name, etc. Upon check-in, I requested and was granted a 1pm checkout time. My conference (held at their facility) finished at noon. The hotel knew I was part of the conference group. I went back to my room at 12:35 and my key didn't work. Then my door opened from the inside. The hotel had taken it upon themselves to decide I had checked out even though all my belongings were still in the room and had given the room to new guests. These guests had been in there long enough to fully unpack and hang everything up (weird that they put my suitcases right inside the door rather than calling the front desk). When I complained to the front desk, they offered to knock a little off my bill, but when I explained that it was not my company inconvenienced, but me and could they offer, instead, points, future stay discounts, spa or restaurant discount, I was told that I could take the business card of someone who couldn't/wouldn't talk to me and pursue restitution when I got home. This was from the customer satisfaction supervisor! They even argued that I had checked out at 10:30 - note... I had not even looked at the video bill, had not called the front desk, had not left my keys in the room - I had done NOTHING to trigger a checkout other than to be a well organized, tidy solo traveler. I had been planning to come back ... now I'd never go back - can't trust their procedures or judgment.

We booked using the Labor Day discount and found ourselves in a tired-looking room with 2 Queen beds (they didn't have any King beds left) with a view of the road, so maybe you get what you pay for? Plus the TV had poor reception, the AC wasn't easy to control and the extra room for the luggage was actually too small for the purpose. Saving grace was the bathroom with the wonderful rain-shower! Service I found to be a bit on the poor side- our luggage was dumped on the floor by a trainee porter who looked extremely hot and bothered and had his shirt buttons undone. The receptionist at the check in counter gave the impression of being very rushed although there were only a few people there. In comparison the Bellagio check-in counter was extremely slow but once you got there they treated you 100% better and catered to every need. The valets were polite and quick though..

The casino is small by Vegas standards but a good way to learn the ropes before losing even bigger sums in the resort hotels on the Strip. Buffet breakfast was included and was good quality with varied selection. Red Rock Canyon is only about a 20 minute drive away and well worth the trip. There is a well signed scenic drive which is great around sunset. CONS Hotel wasn't very busy but we still found ourselves having to wait a little to get anyway from reception when wanting to use the business suite and had to wait to be seated (around 10 minutes) each morning for breakfast. We presume would be quite long during peak season. Not exactly a typical Vegas hotel and drive to the Strip is around 20 minutes with good traffic. The free shuttle service to the Strip is very useful but again, during peak season is must get a little fretful as it is first come first served and only goes every hour.(However you can park at all the main Strip hotels so driving there and back isn't a real problem unless you plan to drink) SUMMARY Overall a very nice hotel and we would stay here again but having stayed one night at The Hotel at the Mandalay Bay we would suggest that if you want the full Vegas experience you go for a hotel on the Strip.", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wimauma, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot for disabled travelers\u201d", "Author": "ez4me", "ReviewID": "UR10014988", "Content": "Recommend for convention & weddings, not weekend or spa get-away.

The on-site restaurant, Ceres, did a respectable job with the breakfast buffet. We had our last night's dinner in the JW's Italian-themed restaurant, Spiedini. It was a little underwhelming when compared to some of the the dinners we had outside the JW, but no serious complaints. FYI, if you stay at the JW, be sure to have a \"special occasion\" dinner at Rosemary's Restaurant, which is nearby. It is the highest Zagat-rated restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and was featured by Rachel Ray on one of the Travel Channel programs, but definitely not \"$40 a day\"!

Apparently there are very few pools deeper than 3 or 4 feet in Las Vegas - except in older hotels - due to insurance company restrictions, which seems silly, since people can drown in a few inches of water in some circumstances. It takes the pleasure out of swimming. Despite large signs everywhere with pool rules prominently saying no diving, at least six people did so during my 45 minute swim one late afternoon - the lifeguard was looking the other way every time, though he must have heard the splashes. The pool did not have a good atmosphere and was a longish walk from the hotel. The cabanas were very basic. The waterfall was nice, though. The shopping centre nearby was huge and comprehensive and had many stores that weren't found on the Strip, including a good supermarket. However, the shuttle bus to the Fashion Show Mall on the Strip was very quick and convenient and the driver even handed out free bottles of chilled water, which was essential in the August heat. Summerlin is a lovely area and the hotel was relaxed and pleasant. It is not as exciting or vibrant as staying on the Strip, but fun nevertheless.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice Change of Pace\u201d", "Author": "NVNative", "ReviewID": "UR8498119", "Content": "I stayed for three nights in late June.

The grounds are beautiful and well maintained, the rooms are clean, modern and in good repair (I was amazed at the \"worn\" comment). The bathrooms are luxurious, the beds comfortable, the couch and chairs worthy of sinking into for a good chat with friends of a late evening. Finally - the staff. Stellar. From the moment I arrived tired, hot and ready to collapse (delayed flights, car rental mix-ups, and a late evening drive through the awful Las Vegas traffic) it was just wonderful. The valet were helpful and courteous, the front desk staff cheerful and professional. The cleaning staff always gave a cheerful \"good morning\" as I left, and I was greeted by the desk staff when I returned. A minor hiccup upon leaving was quickly and professionally resolved. I was so satisfied I even sent a compliment to Marriott directly.

I live and die by the reviews of trip advisor because they are always right on. Just got back from the JW for the second time this year and can't say enough about this place. We booked our stay using points in that my husband is a platinum member. We have stayed at literally hundreds of Marriott\u2019s and this place is right on par with some of the top places out there. I would compare it to the JW in Hawaii or the Marriott in Maui-of course minus the ocean. I love the idea that it is off the strip. We came to reconnect as a family and relax, relax, relax. by the pool. I must stay we are usually very low key guests, but honestly this stay we were nothing short of a nightmare and every time we asked for something random they came through. First of all, Danielle a manager was so completely friendly and hooked us up with the most incredible 2-bedroom suite you have ever seen. I sound like an ambassador but honestly this place was unreal. I was something like 2200 square feet. We were traveling with our 2 young and very dirtily kids (1 & 3). We asked for a high chair and it was done. We asked for a microwave and it was done. Extra blankets-done, pack and play-done. Last minute babysitter-done. Be sure to use around the clock childcare and ask for Rose. She is simply the sweetest grandmother I have ever met. My daughter still prays for her every night. Diane the concierge was outstanding with her resourcefulness and seasoned so she is very up front about what she can get done-which is everything I asked of her. She even ordered room service for us to be delivered because we were at the pool and needed dinner ready when we got up to the room. The girls that get drinks at the pool were everywhere and very attentive. They offer buckets of water by the pool as well. They have a big shallow area of kids to place and steps to the deep end. All the parents congregated here and it was very fun. They have a very large waterfall that gives you a great sound. I heard they are building a water slide too. The housekeeping was outstanding and spoke English-which is not the norm elsewhere. They vacuumed up my diamond earring and actually took the time to take their vac apart and try to find it, which they did. I was so surprised and completely relieved. The bathroom tub was so nice and so big. Big enough for my whole family. I love the idea that they have fans in the bedrooms in that no place ever has these because they get unbalanced and are hard to service. The air rocked. We ordered room service most of the time and it was great. We ordered mac and cheese 4-5 times and they made it fresh and gourmet like for the kids. My husband went downstairs and ordered food from the fancy restaurants and brought it up for us to eat. We loved, loved loved the Spianni (sp?)Restaurant downstairs. I really thought it was a great deal for the quality and quantity of the food. We had take out from there 3 times and every time it was very flavorful and fresh. The chicken parm is very good and very Italian. There appetizers are sooo good. The bread is to die for. We had fish and chips at the Irish pub once and they were okay-the batter was bland. The sushi place downstairs had outstanding sushi. I heard the rest of the menu was not good at all. Starbucks pastries were incredible. I am usually not a fan of there pastries but these were super fresh and very unstarbuckies. The restaurant by the casino is outstanding for a cafe type place. Honestly, this was some of the best food in the hotel believe it or not. The service was incredible and the food even better. The food at the pool was not so great. The hamburger is pool quality meat. We gambled over at the Redrock, which is a very swanky hotel, and very fun to visit for a more Vegas feel. I love that they have a bowling alley and a movie theater. Plus the coolest thing is they have check in childcare so you can gamble or have a nice dinner. You must send in your kid\u2019s shots records 3 weeks in advance so they can make sure everyone is covered since it is such an international clientele. There are tons of restaurants and shopping around the JW as well. I have been on tons of vacations and the amount of space this place provides with the quality of the service makes it a much go back to family vacation place in Vegas. Doing Vegas with kids would not be a good idea on the strip, but if you are okay with getting a sitter (ROSE with around the clock) then your time in Vegas can include both partyng and family time-Which is super rare! We did the Red rock drive to see the rocks and I hate to say it but it was a bunch of different colored rocks. The management of this place is on top of everything and made our stay very boutique like even though this place is very big. I say this in that everytime we turned around we were taken care of even without knowing we were platnium members and in the swanky suite that my daughter referred to as the \"castle\"", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGotta Love It!\u201d", "Author": "Crheli", "ReviewID": "UR8467467", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the JW Marriot in August and had a great time.

When we arrived I was told that those rooms were sold out way in advance. Although disappointed we were shown to an alternate room and were told to check with the concierge later in the week for availability. It wasn't until we had unpacked and went downstairs to scope out the property that we ran into the concierge for our tower. I told her to keep us in mind for a balcony room. She immediately checked out the availability in our tower and gave us the keys to a balcony room. Happily, we switched rooms out. If you care about not feeling claustrophobic then request a room with a balcony. Our room was small for the rate we paid. We usually stay at the Venetian for the same rate. But I must say the bed is the best bed I have ever slept on. The room had the usual amenities, great walk in closet, nice size jacuzzi tub and the waterfall shower head. We never had a problem with the hot water running out and it was nice to go into a hot jacuzzi after spending time playing tennis all day. Now for the balcony...It's nice to relax on the balcony as long as you don't have any neighbors doing the same thing on either side of you. In a five night stay we only ran into our neighbors twice. As far as the breakfast is concerned, we booked a rate which included breakfast for two in the cafe. The view from the restaurant outside was gorgeous. It was nice to look at the ponds and waterfalls. The best thing at the cafe are the belgian waffles. They melt in your mouth and you can't help but eat more than one serving. There's a great omelette bar, fruit, and your usual baked goodies. The only thing that kind of bothered us was when you went to the omelette bar a separate tip jar sat on the counter. Without our breakfast vouchers, breakfast would of easily been at least $30. Being pressured into tipping even more so early in the morning for someone to make your omelettes was annoying. Now if you don't get a room with breakfast, the Starbucks inside the casino has good pastries. I found out that the hotel makes them fresh for Starbucks. It's also open 24 hours in case you have the munchies. I think the best part of the hotel is not the outdor pool but the Gym/Spa. It's worth the $25 bucks to work out in it every day. Equipped with your above average machines you won't have to wait for a cardio machine or fight over free weights. It's beautiful, spacious yet private. The women's lockerroom/spa area is clothing optional so when you walk to use the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi, there's a state of undress which I would prefer to reserve for the privacy of my own home. In addition, they give you flip flops, a robe and a locker key for your $25 so you can use the facilities after working out. If you forgot a hairdryer, hair brush, lotion, shampoo they got it all, including a nice water and fruit bar for your convenience. The grounds are lovely and very green. You certainly don't feel like your in Las Vegas. It was our first time to stay away from the Strip and I think it's a nice hotel if you have a family and want to stay away from the hustle and bustle. As far as variety of restaurants they weren't lacking. A short drive to the nearby SunCoast and strip malls offer your usual chain varieties...PF Chang's, etc.. By the way, we ate at the pool since it was recommended by one of the reviews. We had a lame burger, a tuna tartare salad and two drinks. It was a $40 waste of time. You're better off hopping into the car and finding something else.

The property is definitely above average. Really nice, well kept. Our room: We had a regular king room, but it had great high celings, tastefully decorated, HUGE walk-in-closet, and a huge bathroom with a huge jacuzzi tub. It was not crammed at all! We loved the tub, as it was one of those that was big enough for both my husband and I to stretch out completely in the tub and still have plenty of room. The shower had the regular showerhead, but it also had the option of the rain down shower head from above - which was cool too. And I always sleep well on Marriott beds. Restaurants: We had dinner at the Japanese place, lunch at the restaurant right next to the casino, and breakfast at the Ceres restaurant. The Japanese place was decent. Not amazing, but I would say it was pretty good for an in-resort type restaurant. We had sushi which was tasty. At the lunch place, we split a Mediterranean salad that was really delicious and pretty cheap if I remember correctly. And for the breakfast at Ceres, we both did the buffet, which was really good and had lots of variety, but it was a little pricey for a breakfast buffet - $15/person. Casino: Didn't spend any time there. It was smoky, which I hate, and had lots of old people. Again, we were here for a conference, not gambling. Landscaping/Property: The whole resort is covered in these beautiful lush plants, and they do a great job of curving pathways all throughout the large property. Many waterfalls too. The pool was also very nice and had lots of families enjoying the weather. All in all, enjoyed our stay. It was really peaceful and a nice change from the hustling, bustling hotel/casinos on the strip. Although we loved our stay, I would say that if you are planning on doing everything on and around the strip, you might not be as interested in staying here as it is 20-25 minutes off of the strip.

Room service was prompt and as ordered. For a hotel, the food was amazingly good. The negatives- Check in was a hassle. We were told we could check in early-we had a block of rooms reserved. Only one room was ready early and the rest of us had to cool our heels in the lobby for 2 hours, until the normal check in time.

The resort is lush. First, it's beautiful and the grounds/pool are equally impressive. No problems on aesthetics . . . . rooms are up to date with marble foyer, patterned sisal carpet, pretty furnishings, etc. The bedroom area is outfitted with something comparable to a \"heavenly bed\" -very cloud like - - layered fresh, white sheets/duvet and the most comfortable collection of starched, clean pillows. This hotel feels a little like a Ritz. The marble bathroom has a wow factor. . . entirely marble (walls, floor, etc) w/ a soothing \"rain shower\" in a separate enclosure with bench, etc. giant jacuzzi tub in the corner that sits below mirrored walls - granite countertops -- luxurious. The Room Service was smooth and seamless and reasonably priced. I enjoyed breakfast three mornings and dinner one evening. In the interest of space, I won't describe every crouton, but suffice to say, you get precisely what you order and it's timely. It bears mentioning that the room service dinner I had was as good as some of the meals I've eaten at restaurants in Wynn ! - JW Mar. offers a Pan Roasted Halibut dinner w/ braised leeks and fingerling potatoes w/ a watercress, lemon sauce - - outstanding - - dessert was sinfully delicious (apple tart - baked just before it arrived) - mixed greens salad was large and fresh with thin slices of green apple and apple cider viniagrette. Three olive rolls and one whole wheat roll was on the cart w/butter. I was in heaven. One morning, I threw a curve to the guy taking the phone orders for breakfast, asking for a few substitutions. I was skeptical that it would arrive with the correct changes. It did. Nice! The lady who takes the room service orders needs to familiarize herself with the menu. My only complaint is that she was totally unaware of the specials they offer with regard to a free half bottle of wine when you order a three course dinner. She didn't know what the \"Good Start\" breakfast included - - a little annoying. One evening ( stayed on 5th floor) Vegas had high winds and it sounded like the french doors in my room were going to bust open. Imagine the way a tea pot sounds when it's \"going off\" only much more angry. I called the front desk and within minutes an engineer arrived and he stayed for over twenty minutes, attaching additional weather stripping until the doors were silent. I'm not going to \"ding\" the hotel for this because I valued the prompt response and attention that was offered to me. These folks are masters of service and it shows. Everyone had a smile and was eager to help in any way they could. I forgot my toothbrush and within a few minutes one was delivered to me with a sample of toothpaste. There's a 24 hour Starbucks near the Casino. What's nice about this hotel is that it's a hotel/resort with a casino - not the other way around. I find that most places in Vegas are smoke filled casinos with hotels attached. Now, as for my PITA (Pain in the [--] ) Factor: The tub was gorgeous but I didn't have time to use it and I'm glad because there were two stray, \"ahem\" pubic or some type of hairs on the side. I didn't call housekeeping, but I bet that if I did, they would have immediately sent someone to clean it. Also, the one drinking glass in my bathroom had a residue in the bottom (let's hope it was soap) - the other glasses were clean as a whistle. The worst, however, was the smell in the corridor of our meeting rooms. We spent four days in the Conference Center and certain areas had a sewage smell. Not all of our meeting areas were plagued with this odor, but it was very strong where they had our snack/break tables set up. It was bad. Back to the room: The toiletries are high end and displayed in a nice little wooden crate w/ wash cloths - - - Overall, this is a really nice place - I'd definitely stay there again. Still, it's not a \"Vegas\" hotel - it's a good twenty minute drive from the Strip. For that reason, I'd probably stay somewhere else on a personal trip to Vegas.

There is also a Starbucks located in the hotel next to the casino. The restaurant/cafe inside the hotel was expensive.

There are several and they are spread out quite far apart. The desk rep cheerfully stated that it was only a 5-10 minute walk and that there was plenty of signage to direct you to the right tower. Yeah right! Most of the sign swere pointing at Palm trees or the small water ponds. I have to say though, the walkways were pretty and well maintained. Even though the aformentioned 5-10 minute walk was more like 20-30 it was pretty. Restaurants - Ate at Spiedini's on property. Decent food and service in the restaurant, great staff and service in the bar. Had room service one evening, not an extensive choice off the menu but everything was good and came very quickly. Rooms - Spotless, and even the standard room was huge compared to most hotels. The bathroom was GREAT, I want that shower in my house! Separate jacuzzi tub as well. If you choose not to rent a car, try having the concierge reserve a car for you to the airport, it was cheaper than the cab.

I arrived about noon, hours before normal check-in, and was able to receive a room in about thirty minutes. The first room I had was #1518. From what I could tell it was a standard guest room on the 3rd floor of the Spa Tower. The room was quite large and had an outstanding bathroom. Until October 1st it had been a smoking room and there was a slight smell of smoke which bothered me. I went back to the front desk and the after the associate apologized and made a note for housekeeping she offered me an upgraded room; a parlor suite on the first floor #1115. It was smoke free and an awesome room! Besides being happy receiving an upgraded room, I was even more pleased at how my complaint was handled. There was no hesitation to offer an apology and correct the problem immediately. About ten minutes after I checked into my replacement room the front desk associate called to make sure that I was completely satisfied; great service! Getting to see both a standard room and a parlor suite was nice. Both of the rooms had huge and beautiful bathrooms. Both had whirlpool tubs large enough for two and both had huge showers with regular and rainfall shower heads. Neither room had a proper desk or office-style chair. Both offered wired high-speed internet service for $9.95 for 24 hours. The service worked well and connected with our corporate VPN, but did not work as smoothly as I-Bahn (STSN) which most Marriott properties offer. A minor annoyance was that electrical outlets were hidden and hard to get to. The rooms seem better designed for the leisure traveler instead of a business traveler. Both rooms were immaculate and during my short stay housekeeping was excellent. The bath amenities were generous sized and of very good quality. The bath linens were plentiful, fresh and thick. There were two thick resort robes in the walk-in closets which both rooms had. There was an electronic-locking safe in the closets as well as iron, ironing board, and a bottle of water to refill the steam iron! Room 1518 had a window but no balcony. Suite 1115, on the ground floor, had a huge patio. It made me feel like having a party! Both rooms offered large TV\u2019s with a large variety of cable channels and pay-per-view movies. The Murphy-style bed in my parlor suite was very comfortable; more comfortable than my bed at home! The resort has two towers, the Spa Tower, where my room was, and the Palms Tower. The two are connected by long concourses which connect through the Rampart Casino. The Aquae Sulis full service Spa at the resort and resort shop are located on the Spa Tower concourse. A food court located on the Palms Tower concourse and is home to: Starbucks, the Rampart Buffet, Shizen (Japanese) and several other restaurants. To get to the conference center requires either going outdoors or going through the casino. While the hotel is now 100% smoke free, the casino and the food court are not. The casino seemed fairly large and had lots of slots and all the table games for those interested in gambling. The hotel has a very small exercise room located on the 2nd floor of the Palms Tower that is complimentary. A much larger and much better equipped exercise area is located within the Aquae Sulis Spa, but there is a charge of $25.00 per day to use it and the other spa facilities. I walked through the pool area after meetings one day. The pool is huge and looked very inviting. There appeared to be plenty of lounges and pool towels. There are a number of cabanas around the pool each with a TV, table and chairs, and lounges. On the Palms Tower end is both a large waterfall and an outdoor hydrotherapy pool. Food and drink are available at the pool from the Waterside Caf\u00e9. Behind the pool caf\u00e9 is a sand volleyball court, horseshoe pit, bocce ball area and croquet lawn. Besides all this, the hotel sits between two golf courses. All of my meals were in conjunction with the meeting that I was attending so I did not have the opportunity to try any of the hotel\u2019s restaurants or room service except for Starbucks. I can recommend the JW Marriott for those who want to be in \u2018Vegas, but not be in the congestion of the Strip.

We stayed at the J.W. Marriott from October 4 through the 9th. I have high standards for comfort and service and have stayed at similar resorts before all over the world. Paid for 2 junior suites (about 900 sq. ft. each) at $309 (plus fees and taxes) each per day. Pool: excellent. Excellent service/food, excellent size of pool and pool area, excellent background music, excellent landscaping. Lots of thyme has been planted throughout the beautifully landscaped property and you catch the faint fragrance when you're lying by the pool. Anecdote: I came to the pool bar to order food 5 minutes before closing and the chef was in the process of closing down his station. I asked if I could still order and he said: \"no problem\" and whipped us up a great BBQ chicken sandwich and cashew chicken eggrolls. Great service! Cerres: the resort restaurant. Excellent breakfasts (didn't try their lunch or dinners). Worth the $14 per person (plus tip) to start the day of right. Fresh and ripe fruits, delicious mozzarella/tomato salad, various cheeses/breads, freshly made omelets and scrambled eggs among other, heavier breakfast items such as potato and sausage. Great view of lush landscaping and waterfalls outside through 14 foot floor to ceiling windows. Overall wonderful service by people who obviously enjoyed serving guests. Anecdote: I came down one morning for breakfast with my party of 4 and was accosted by one of the breakfast floor managers (who will remain unnamed but is now known to the hotel manager after I wrote him about the incident) who stated, in front of my entire party, that I hadn't paid for my party the previous morning. I had indeed paid, including my usual 20% tip for any service I received at the resort. After checking with another floor manager she found out she was wrong but didn't have the decency to come tell me. I had to ask. I hope it happened because she had a bad day because she has no business being in the service industry if this is her normal behavior. Putting aside this weird incident, I can highly recommend eating breakfast at Cerres. Rooms: spacious, clean, cleaned fast and in an unobtrusive manner (you leave for just a moment and when you come back it's all done). I made small requests of the housekeeping staff once in a while (more bottled water, more hangers) and was always promptly satisfied. Spacious bathrooms, great features such a whirlpool bath, rain shower head, natural stone tiles, french doors that open (no balcony) to let fresh air in and give great views of Red Rock mountains on one side and downtown Vegas on the other. Excellent all. Hotel: is beautiful. Inside and out. Nothing spectacular (aside from the enormous and ubiquitous palm trees, I guess), just done right and very calming. Valet service was efficient. Best way to get to (and from) the Vegas strip is by taking Sahara if you want to end up at the North end of the strip and taking Tropicana if you want to end up at the South end of the strip. Don't take any other road as I must have tried them all to find the best ones. Either takes 30 minutes, less if all the lights are in your favor. Must see: \"O\" by Cirque de Soleil. Some people in the audience were actually so overcome with emotion they were weeping. Worth the $150 ticket. Don't get \"wet seat tickets\" if you are wearing something that you can't afford to get wet. Try the #1 rated Bellagio buffet before the show or the Olives restaurant. Take in the Bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes after dark) after the show. Grand Canyon by helicopter. We used Maverick Helicopter Tours and can't say enough good things about that outfit. Their modern office is conveniently located on the Vegas strip. Their helicopters are comfortable. Despite the rough weather conditions while getting to the Grand Canyon, the pilot was calm, cool and collected and a genuinely nice guy who gave just the right amount of commentary. There is no flying low for miles through the canyon which I guess I had anticipated from watching shows on television. Instead the pilot landed us on a cliff edge which gave us a great view of the majestic Grand Canyon and the river running through it. Great photo opportunities. Legends in Concert. I thought this would be cheesy but wanted to see it anyway. Glad I did because it was a great time. Live music, the impersonators' real voices, spot on impersonations of Britney Spears, Sting, Elvis, Garth Brooks, Four Tops (rocked the house!) and Bobby Darrin. Enthusiastic showgirls made it complete. The Forum Shops at Ceasar's Palace. Fantastic shops (hundreds of them) in a classy environment. Convenient valet parking in front. Fancy and casual restaurants througout. Simply the best shopping area on the Strip. Red Rock Canyon which is located just 15 minutes from the resort going West on Charleston Avenue. Beautiful vistas and great hiking/biking trials. When I return, I'll probably give the Bellagio or the Wynn hotel a try but I have a feeling I'll regret not staying at the J.W.

Excellent room-- so many amenities and little touches (like a double sink, whirlpool spa, amazing shower.. and the ability to turn up the TV volume in the bathroom!) and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in (and I have \"memory foam\" and egyptian cotton at home, so I don't say that lightly!). Awesome staff-- check-in was a breeze, complimentary waters every time we visited the desk, completely professional and very attentive to our needs. Arranging a late check-out wasn't a problem... they made everything so easy. Great food-- I wasn't expecting much from casino restaurants, but the food at the Promenade cafe (24 hr, downstairs) was excellent, and very reasonably priced. $10 buys a very nice meal. The buffet, although slightly limited in choice, was of very good quality and in the opinion of myself and my 2 guests, was FAR better quality than the Bellagio at twice the price. The pool outdoors was amazing. 11,000 sq. ft., with mini waterfalls and a convenient bar and cabanas. Great. The location for us was perfect. It was out of the way of the strip but near local restaurants and a gym (there are 2 gyms in the hotel, but we have a 24 hour fitness membership). They have a complimentary shuttle bus to the strip... but we drove there in 15 minutes. Not a problem at all. I much prefer the location rather than a busy strip hotel.

We found all the positive comments on this site to be true. The service was outstanding, everyone was very friendly - many hearty \"good mornings\" by the staff in the hallways. The valet parkers were cordial, fast and efficient. Our room in the Spa Tower was quite big, and the bed was one of the most comfortable you are going to find, with plenty of pillows and a beautiful duvet. All the furniture was fresh and in fine shape. Another nice feature was two bathrobes in the lighted walk-in closet (with safe) that were ready and waiting. There was also a convenient refrigerator that had free spring water, a rarity these days. It was clear that tremendous thought went into the design of even the smallest of things, such as the matching wicker trash cans, ice bucket and hamper in the bathroom. The bathroom was huge and featured a jacuzzi type soaking tub along with a separate shower enclosure offering a choice of a standard shower nozzle or a \"rainfall\" setting from above, which was great. The nozzles were both powerful and worked well. The rainfall was particularly enjoyable. For the person who wrote there were no washcloths, they are actually there on the bathroom counter, rolled up tastefully in the wood tray behind the complementary shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, etc. While it took me a few moments to spot them, they are indeed there! The grounds are superb with water features everywhere, winding paths through the gardens, a great pool, palm trees - everything very well maintained. The wedding was held outdoors in a gorgeous lawn setting with gazebo type structure. We were impressed by the way the staff kept the event private, and then ushered us all into the beautiful Ceres restaurant overlooking waterfalls. All was taken care of professionally and in great taste. The service at the reception was impeccable, the wait staff was very friendly, and the food was delicious. The bride was beautiful, too! The surrounding community of Summerlin is booming and there are many new shops and restaurants very close to the hotel for off premises enjoyment. Boca Park is an example, just down the road. While US-95 (main access to downtown and the Strip) is being widened, it still worked fine for us and actually we enjoyed taking Charleston Blvd into the downtown area one morning to get a feel for the growth going on in the area. It took us less than 15 minutes to drive down to Bellagio on Saturday morning, and about the same time to return. This was our first time staying \"off the Strip\" and we found it a nice change of pace - very green, the JW is definitely a great place for relaxation. There is also the Aquae Sulis Spa that features about every kind of massage or treatment you can imagine, and had we the time, we might have given it a shot. All in all, this is a superb place to stay. One suggestion is to ask for a room with a balcony. While our room didn't have one, it didn't make a huge difference to us, I simply think it would be a nice touch and would allow even more light into the beautiful guest room.

So my friends and I decided to stay at the JW Marriott to check it out. Both the Spa and the Resort itself were incredible. Spa first: excellent fitness facilties, fitness classes, treatments and lounge area. I had a body scrub and a clarifying facial and both were wonderful. Hotel and rooms: Who needs the Spa when the hotel room's bathroom has a large whirlpool jet tub in it, as well as a rainfall showerhead in the separately enclosed shower!!! FABULOUS!!! Bedding was soft and comfortable; room was nicely appointed, and yes...the bathroom is DIVINE! The hotel staff were always friendly, always professional, and always \"At Your Service\" when you needed extra anything (towels, robes, etc.) I was quite impressed when I received a follow-up call in my hotel room to make sure that my requests were met. There is also a casino so you really don't need to go anywhere else! AND, if you enjoy golf, there are plenty of beautiful, world-class golf courses surrounding the JW Marriott. Top-notch customer service will always win out, when you have so many comparable, hotels and resorts in one area. That's why the JW Marriott in Summerlin stands out as a class act from others.

We did not use the casinos, but we walked through it in the morning to go get breakfast. We are not really the \"gambling\" type so I did not notice much about the casinos.

First, where were the washcloths? None in the room, none at the spa. I could've used one to scrub away the stench of smoke from the adjacent Rampart Casino (REALLY smokey, even for a casino). Second, in the gym at the spa, there are no mirrors in the workout area, which makes weight-lifting a little more difficult. Also, the spa facilities, which are nice enough, don't compare with the spas at Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio. The room at the JW was great. It was more than large enough to accomodate the rollaway we requested which was delivered promptly and politely. The queen beds were very comfortable - some of the best hotel beds, comparable to Westin's heavenly bed, and better than the beds at The Bellagio, Venetian, MGM, et al. The mattress was the perfect firmness and the duvet and pillows were fluffy and comfortable. The bathroom was out of this world. In a city with numerous hotels boasting grand bathrooms, this one trumps them all. The jacuzzi tub easily accommodated two people, and the rainfall shower was very relaxing. Double-sinks and a separate room for the toilet made sharing the bathroom with four other people a little easier. Also, the faux balcony was a nice added bonus to an already terrific room. The whole room felt newly refurbished and showed no signs of wear, and the decor was understated and inviting. The pool area was easily accessed from the Spa Tower (where our room was located), and we were not forced to walk through the casino or a shopping promenade in our bathing suits. There were enough lounges for anyone who wanted one, and poolside food and drink service was friendly (not prompt, though our waitness apologized numerous times for the kitchen being backed up, and she did not get flustered when it took us a long time to order because some of us were on the other side of the pool). The pool water was unusually salty, but was cool and refreshing nonetheless. All in all, it was a very nice trip. The hotel is VERY calm and quiet - seemingly the antithesis of Las Vegas. We utilized the shuttle service a few times, but it would've been better if they had one later shuttle returning to the hotel, at least on weekends (11:30pm is the latest returning shuttle). Getting to and from the strip was not a problem, though a bit more action and better people-watching within walking distance (much better eye-candy at Mandalay, Bellagio, Hard Rock) would've been nice. Still, for the service, room, and pool, I highly recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helena Montana", "Title": "\u201cJ.W.

The main gym ($25/day) has a pretty nice spread of cardio machines and free weights but the real reason to spend that kind of money is to use the Spa attached to it which has a waterfall showers, steam room, sauna, cool plunge, and jacuzzi. Well worth the money. Also know that there is another smaller gym that is free in the case that you just want to work out but not pay the daily fee of the larger facility. Also ate at Spiedini (an italian restaurant in the resort) that was decent, especially when compared to the high prices for similar fare on the Strip.

We can hardly wait to go back next year, hopefully for longer.", "Date": "April 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience at the JW\u201d", "Author": "Nash_Andrew", "ReviewID": "UR4896415", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at the JW Marriott from March 30 - April 2, 2006. Overall the experience was excellent and we will be returning. Upon our check in Thursday morning we were pleased to find that our room was already available. The front desk staff was excellent, very friendly and explained everything about the property. Robin, our bellhop, was extremely friendly and gracious and took us to a standard king non-smoking room (as requested) on the top floor. The view was good, with some rooftops of the casino and shops, but also could see the gardens and all of the nearby mountain ranges as well. But forget the view -- the room was absolutely incredible! First, the bathroom is easily the largest and nicest hotel bathroom I have ever experienced without staying in a suite. Two vanities, a 2 person whirlpool tub, all marble standup shower with a seat and rainfall showerhead, laundry bin, separate toilet room with telephone and even a ceiling speaker connected to the TV. The bathroom alone is about the size of many regular hotel rooms and is, in short, out of this world. Once you pass the bathroom, there is a walk in closet with digital safe and bathrobes, then a bar with glasses, ice bin and mini-fridge. After you pass the mini bar you will walk into the main bedroom area. The entire bedroom is stunning. Way oversized and decorated very tastefully in subdued gold tones with gold and black accessories. The carpet was a plush burbour and the room was big enough to have a couch and chair with coffee table as well as an oversized desk with two chairs, internet connection, and a TV that is much larger than most hotel TVs (not flatscreen, though). The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Finally, there were the french doors. Forget the usual sealed off hotel windows, these were two oversized french doors that opened all the way onto a tiny balcony. Every night while getting ready we would open these up and enjoy the breeze. There were a couple minor annoyances: the paint in the hallway was scuffed in a few places, there was a spot on one part of the carpet, and it also turns out the fridge is actually a cooler, which was annoying. Overall these are minor issues since we felt like royalty in that room. We never wanted to leave. As for the rest of the hotel: First, the grounds are excellent. The pool situation is very nice. It is quite large, with two oversized 24-hour hot tubs, a poolside bar and restaurant, an adjacent sand volleyball court, and frequent cocktail service. It was not overrun with kids by any means and seemed to have plenty of lawn chairs for the taking. We never had a problem getting a seat and the hotel was full all weekend. We walked all around the hotel and were very impressed by how manicured the gardens were. The spa was also excellent. We had a couples massage, one hour long, for $236 including tip. The massage was excellent. The spa facility is very fancy but not stuffy, heavily staffed, and has like four pools in each locker room along with your standard sauna and steam. There is also an outdoor pool with special jets for your back to lay down in. Very nice. The workout room faces out onto the aerobics classroom and the private pool area and has really nice equipment with flat screen TVs. Highly reccommend the spa to anyone interested in that sort of thing. One drawback: if you don't have a treatment scheduled, it's 25 bucks per day to use it. The one big issue with this hotel is that it is 15-30 miunutes from the strip depending on traffic. The hotel offers a free shuttle every couple hours, but the last one leaves the strip around midnight -- so plan on taking a cab back ($40) if you want to stay out late with the rest of Vegas. But honestly, this could be the best thing about the hotel: you get the best of both worlds. We loved coming home to our amazing room at the JW away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. As for the casino and some of the restaurants surrounding it, this part of the facility was not up to par with the rest of the property. I learned that that part of the hotel is managed separately from the JW which explains its less-classy feel. It was certainly more of a locals casino and the food wasn't that great. Overall though, we will definitely be returning to this hotel. The hotel is not truly a five-star property, as it does not have some of the finer touches, especially in terms of incredible service, that one would expect from the Ritz or the Four Seasons. But it is certainly 4+ stars. The facility is excellent and the standard rooms are simply out of this world. Come to the JW Marriott and feel like a king.

I had high expectations as I read all reviews on this hotel and my expectation was happily met. I stayed four different hotels in Vegas: JW Marriot resort, TI, Luxor, and Aladdin. so I might be able to give an unbiased review. 1. Bathroom: Jacuzzi for two. huge. clean. 2. Bed: Very nice bed for those who love soft bed. I prefer Heavenly bed in Westin though. (I even ordered the bed from Westin for my own place.) But still nothing to be desired. a lot better bedding than normal 4 or 5 star hotel bed. 3. view: very nice mountain view. 4. Food: every restaurant is cheaper than those in Strip. for example, $9 here for breakfast vs. $13 in Strip. 5. Service: no complaint. front desk staffs were professional although I wish they would be more genuinely friendly like those in Aladdin. 6. Casino: I am not a big gambler - that is why I stayed at the hotel. But the dealers at the Casino kindly taught me how to play. I really appreciate their kindness. very nice to talk to. 7. Transportation: $35 by Taxi. complimentary shuttle. last one from Strip is 11:30 pm which is way too early. The hotel needs to extend the shuttle time.

FYI, I am a travel agent in my early 40\u2019s and my boyfriend is an executive in his early 50\u2019s. We have stayed just about everywhere in Las Vegas. Wednesday, November 23rd Taxi ride from Bellagio was approx. $32.00. We arrived at 1:30pm and were given a room right away. Easy, quick check-in. The staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were very nice and large. The best things about the room were 1) you could open the French doors to a walk out balcony therefore letting you have fresh air (unlike strip hotels) and 2) the very large bathroom with a real nice Jacuzzi tub for two and a large shower big enough for two. The hotel is done in a California craftsman/mission style with nice wood touches all over the place. Casino was adequate and large enough. Dining choices were varied and seemed adequate as well. Beds were very comfortable and it was nice to have free bottled water and robes in the room. We had lunch at their Irish pub restaurant which was good and inexpensive. We also had breakfast there on Friday and it was about \u00bd the price as room service and less expensive then their 24 hour restaurant. Service was good too. A 24 hour Starbucks was next door. We took advantage of their complimentary shuttle (several times a day) at 5pm and reached Macy\u2019s - their drop off point at 5:20pm. We walked to Paris to see their We Will Rock You Broadway style show which was very good at 90 minutes long. Note: buy the cheapest tickets as all seats seemed great. We got the most expensive which in hindsight would not have opted for. After that, a little gambling at MGM then back to Macy\u2019s for the Marriott\u2019s last pick up at 11:30pm. Each time we took the shuttle it was on time, precisely. Thursday, November 24th After sleeping in and having in-room coffee (bad coffee though) we ventured out to the pool to have lunch. The weather was nice and the pool and Jacuzzi were both working and of perfect temperature. There was no towel Nazi\u2019s to check your towels out and there were plenty of loungers around the pool. The only disappointment is that for that level of Marriott (JW status) the pool chaises should have cushions on them for comfort. Trying to obtain service at the pool was difficult at first but perhaps they did not plan on having such nice weather on Thanksgiving and were short staffed. We both had enormous Bloody Mary\u2019s and split a chicken sandwich at the pool. Beware you are paying room service prices at the pool which add $2 per order fee plus, I believe, an 18% service charge added on too. We took the 5pm shuttle again and were dropped off at the pitch black Macy\u2019s parking lot. We picked up a cab right away and went to THEhotel at Mandalay Bay for some \u201cperfect\u201d view cocktails at their indoor/outdoor lounge high up overlooking Las Vegas. There was a very nice crowd there. We sat outside on their couches, heat lamps and all and enjoyed some pre-Thanksgiving dinner cocktails. Drinks ran about $12.00 each. We had the Thanksgiving Special dinner at MIX, THEhotel. It was sticker shock as my travel mate did not ask the price when he made reservations. $105.00 per person plus beverages and gratuities. Lots of green for a free range four course turkey dinner. Had I known that I would have opted for the less traditional lobster dinner. Wine list was nice and dinner was good but service was a bit much - way overdone! View was nice and we ate in a \u201cpod\u201d. You must see the pods for yourself! Full, we took a taxi back to hotel instead of their shuttle. Once we got back we ventured into the casino and lost. Back to bed! Friday, November 25th We requested late check out as we had a 3pm flight out. They granted it and then we secured their shuttle at $20/per person back to the airport. The tower representative was kind enough to take care of that and then she went on line for us to print out our boarding passes. Check out was easy as well and the airport showed up right on the minute. Hotel Summary I would recommend this hotel to those who want to get away from the hectic strip and those not minding to take the shuttle at Marriott\u2019s appointed time. If you are late nighter - stay on the strip. The hotel is great for families and couples but not for those who like their in-house entertainment.

We are a family of 4 with 2 toddlers. We've stayed all over Las Vegas and continue to return to the JW because the rooms are spacious, the pool is one of the best in Vegas, we feel welcome with our kids in tow, and the service is spectacular! THE ROOM: We were lucky enough to get a complimentary stay in a 2 bedroom suite in the Palm Tower this trip due to the kindness of one of the Guest Relations Managers. This room was absolutely amazing!!!! It was over 2000 Sq. feet, with a huge master bedroom with king bed, desk and walk in closet, a master bath with seperate rain show and double sinks. There was a second bedroom also with a king bed, it's own bathroom with seperate tub and rain shower too. The entry included a nice bench and led to the bar area with mini fridge, sink area and barstools. There was a dining area with table & chairs for 6, a living area with 2 sofas, a few chairs and a chaise. There are also entertainment centers in each of the rooms, each with a nice TV. There is a small powder room just off of the entry, so you have a total of 3 bathrooms. These rooms are at the far ends of the hallways and they take up the entire length of the hotel end, there is a large verandah that stretches all the way around the room, it has 2 chaises and a table and 4 chairs for lounging or having meals outside. Each room also had it's own seperate thermostat and temperature controls and ceiling fans too. This was the most amazing room we've ever stayed in. The pictures don't do it justice, it was too big to photograph! THE POOL: This pool is huge and heated, it's one of the best pools in Vegas, surrounded by palm trees, waterfalls, cabanas, and plenty of lounge chairs. There are also life guards on duty. You will also find 2 jaccuzis at either end of the pool. The poolside bar is closed at this time of year, but when we've come in the summer they serve great drinks and food at very reasonable prices. THE FOOD: We were given complimentary breakfast buffet at Cerces each morning of our stay. They also have a menu for those of you who don't enjoy a buffet. The buffet includes, pancakes, waffles, omlettes, eggs, sausage, bacon, crepes, blintzs, potatoes, cereals - hot & cold, fruit, lox & bages, pastries, I probably forgot a few things, but it's a really great buffet. We also did room service Thanksgiving morning and had a nice meal out on the verandah. The room service menu is ok, but slightly limited. They do have a nice children't menu and prices are average. We also ventured to the onsite Starbucks several times for hot chocolate, pastries, sandwiches, and chips. There is also an Irish pub onsite, and Japanese, and Italian restaurants. All are located in the Palm Tower except for Cerces which is in the Spa Tower. THE CASINO: We aren't big gamblers, we didn't even venture into the casino this stay. It's small compared to others in Vegas and very smoky, but if you're staying on site it's a nice alternative to the 20 minute drive to the strip. THE SERVICE: Everyone here is so nice, from the valets to housekeeping.

It was our first trip there, and we were very pleased. The resort is located in Summerlin, right next to Angel Park golf course, and is about 20 minutes from the strip with no traffic. You might hit some traffic, so depending on the time of day you are driving, be prepared. We had a car, so it was fine, but it might take a while by cab from the airport. Checkin was quick and easy, and we self parked, although valet is free, just tip the guys. The hotel is very nicely decorated, and the grounds are nice. The room was pretty large, and everything was clean and tidy. The bathroom was a good size, with separate shower and jacuzzi bath tub big enough for 2. We ate at the Italian restaurant(forget the name, sorry), which was not too expensive, and tasted good, and the Irish Pub and also the cafe. The Irish Pub had a great chicken pot pie. We paid $20 each to use the fitness and spa facilities on Saturday, which is very much worth the money. We worked out for almost an hour in a fitness center that had hardly anyone in it, and then swam in a private pool just outside the fitness center. This pool is for spa users only, and was a perfectly warm temperature. As a matter of fact, the regular pool was also nice and warm, perfect for a swim(FYI). We then used the spa hot tub, steam room, showers, and lounge. They have cold water and juice for you.. wow it was relaxing. The casino was smallish, but still had plenty of games, and some $5 blackjack, which is what I would play if I had played blackjack. I didn't gamble since all the football games were on, but the casino is nice enough, and you still get the Vegas feel. All in all, a great trip, and I would recommmend this place to anyone.

I stayed at \"The Hotel\" at the Mandalay Bay earlier this summer and found out what a joke that place was (doesn't surprise me it's now down to the #3 rating as their service is a joke). I would suggest the employees there take some notes from the Marriott on how 5 Star service should really be. Let's start with the valet. I used it throughout my stay and I think the longest wait was 2 minutes. Upon check-in we were greeted nicely and someone even called up to our room in the first 10 minutes to make sure everything was to our liking. The pool was quite nice and there were cabanas that were reasonably price ($50 for a half day on the weekdays). If you needed an umbrella, you just asked one of the staff and they would put it up for you right over your lounge chair. Ironically, it's nestled in the suburbs and there are tons of stores in the vicinity and some excellent restaurants. We went to Rosemary's (about a ten minute drive) and had one of the best dinners ever. As for the drive to the strip, someone quoted here it took them 4 hours?! I'm not sure what that was about. Unless some tanker flipped over, realistically you're talking about 25 minutes. You simply hop on to Summerlin Pkwy and then over to I95 and you're pretty much on the freeway the entire drive. I think what's happening with some of the posters here is they are taking the surface roads and that's why it's taking so long.

First of all, the hotels appearance is all that they say it is, beautiful, fresh and clean. The attitudes, however, were very stiff and cold. We brought our two kids along, another reason we chose to stay here, seemed more family oriented and Vegas is running out of \"nice\" places for families to stay. It did not feel family oriented at all. We were stared at because our youngest is three. staff acted as if they couldnt believe children were there with us? There are a large number of older patrons, who frown on kiddies as well, we felt it all over, very uptight atmosphere. My husband is African and I am white, the racist glares from this place were hard to take at times. Usually, in Vegas, it's a place for everyone. The only place overrun by kiddies was the pool area. Beautiful pool, however, as a parent, beware of the cabanas, there are seedy individuals who rent them out (they are completly covered) and very adult activites going on in front of kids, as the doors sway open at times and you can see in. I did also complain about this to the managemnt, who responded promptly to me, said it happens all the time, but thanks for reporting it, but it was nearing the end of the day and the pool was going to close anyways, so I'm not sure what was actually done about it? We went to the hotels restaurant to have breakfast and we were the only ones there in line, place was nearly empty (we arrived late on purpose to get good seating) There were three workers there, ignored us for about ten minutes, as if we were invisible, then finally took the time to seat us. The waitress was rude and edgy. We ate and left feeling very uncomfortable. I couldnt believe all this, such a nice place with great reviews. I decided to reserve judgement and go to the casino, which you pretty much have to if you want to gamble, as it is far from the strip. It got worse. The dealer in front of me was openly arguing with her floor manager, YELLING in a foreign language, she was rude and angry, threw cards at me and had the worst of attitudes. then, when she saw I wasnt tipping her, She had the nerve of accusing me of handling the cards roughly?? Me? THats a first for me in ALL of Vegas! I know she was mad because I didnt tip her, who would? I got up to leave her table after I couldn't take it anymore. I complained to the hotel manager later, she claimed that the casino is contracted out to the Marriott and is not owned by the Marriott. Okay, but it's still in your hotel? She claimed she would give my entire room service tab to the casino to pay since they didnt know how to treat a guest properly. I was relieved and felt better over this. Until I got the bill, only one snack room service order had been removed, all else remained. Also, We felt it would okay to stay away from the strip, we had a vehicle, we drove in from L.A., so we figured we could just drive ourselves to the strip! Wrong! Traffic on the strip is unconceivably deadlocked, especially on holidays. We drove into town, took over two hours due to dead stop traffic, we got fed up and tired, so we turned back, all in all it took us roughly 4 HOURS to get to the strip and back to the hotel, and we didn't even get out of the car! Never again. Don't drive, use a taxi and be prepared to pay big bucks from this Marriott out ot the strip and back. They have a shuttle, goes to designated areas, it's timed and numbered, so with two kids in 125 degree heat, that wasn't an option. On the plus side, The bathroom rainshowers are great, the large in room T.V's are nice too.

We had a great babysitter from \"Nannies and Grannies\" (recommended by the hotel) she liked to play with my daughter. She came back a few more times and my daughter was always happy to see her. If you want to stay here rent a car. It is nesteled in a residential area. Nice shopping and grocery stores near by. The strip is 20-30 mins away. After seeing some of the crowded strip hotels I was so glad we stayed at this beautiful hotel. We were traveling with a little one and wanted to relax. If you were coming in for a night or something this is not the place. You need a little time to ejoy your surroundings. I asked for a late check out on the last day because I was a Marriott Rewards member we did not have to check out until 3pm. Worst part of our trip was the flight. I will never fly Jet Blue again.

I'm a huge Tripadvisor fan and was excited by all of the positive reviews of this hotel. Wow, I wonder if we stayed at a different hotel. I expected way more from a JW Marriott--have stayed at 'regular' Marriotts that were far nicer. We're also no strangers to Las Vegas and visit there once or twice a year. Since we had our two teenagers with us this trip, we thought staying off the strip would be a good idea--not. We used Marriott Rewards points for our two night stay--I'd be very interested in knowing if this had anything to do with our less than stellar room. FYI--We were in room #5217 in the Palms Tower--far from everything--I would suggest requesting the Spa Tower. Here's my take: No one was friendly in the least (and we're pretty friendly folks), except for one bellman as we were checking out; our room was large but had exactly three pieces of furniture floating around in all of the space--2 hard back desk chairs and an ottman; the carpet had numerous large and dark stains (UGH); bathroom was large and the showerhead was absolutely marvelous; no turn-down service; one of the bedspreads had a 6-8 inch rip in it; pool was nice; hotel itself was in suburbia (not special in any way, shape or form). The hotel seemed empty of life and excitement and no one appeared to be in charge--sounds strange to say but we all had odd vibes from this place. The most disgusting thing about this hotel was the sharp stench of mold/mildew in our room. When I asked someone at the front desk to please send someone up to take care of the smell, she totally blew me off and quickly said she'd 'tell housekeeping.' Okie-dokie but nothing ever came of it. When we gave the valet our car ticket one night, it took them forever to find the car--then they admitted that it was 'temporarily misplaced.' WHAT?? Not to worry, though, and the valet soon came wheeling up in our car while EATING AN ICE CREAM BAR. I kid you not--my family and I were laughing at this point--we were totally missing TheHotel, though. All in all, I was very disappointed in this hotel and plan on writing Marriott to tell them.

When we arrived Friday night, they put us in a double bed room facing a street in the far tower and it looked like there was a building being built across the way from our window. I called down and told them I requested a King bed in the Spa tower, they said there was no room available and this was the best they could do. After calling back again I spoke to a woman who told me I made my reservations on the internet for a discounted rate.... I don't know what she would say that for... whether I booked at the $375 each nite or $275 rate, it should have no bearing on the service she's to provide me or the respect that any customer deserves. She embarrased me and then had someone else call me to tell me they had a king size bed one floor down facing the fountains. We moved and after we finally settled in, I realized we didn't get the champaign and strawberries I requested with a personal concierge planner a month in advance... (not to the personal planner's fault) so once again I needed to call down. I was told they saw the request and will see that they are delivered. No apology. Yes, we did finally get the champaign. After we went to dinner, I called down to ask for the mgr on duty, I was given two names whom were away from the desk or on lunch break. I was told to just call the weekend mgr (he would be in at 7am) and leave a voice mail for him to call me back. I did leave a voice mail msg. On Saturday, we enjoyed our spa appt and service at the spa. I didn't recieve a call from the front desk mgr and did not want to go into it again with anyone else. I wanted this to be a special trip for my husband and I felt I would handle it when I returned home so not to ruin our vacation with the time it took to complain about how I was treated. I feel the night staff needs to be trained in handling situations such as mine. I feel the woman I spoke to needs to be told she can not treat someone rude because they did not pay top dollar to stay at the JW Vegas. We made the decision to check out Saturday afternoon and stay at a hotel on the strip that we always stay when we come to Vegas... they treat us very well! I stayed at the JW in Arizona with my girlfriends last year and we had inpecable service and a wonderful stay. Unfortunitely, I can not say that about the JW vegas. It's very upsetting to be treated terribly when you go out of your way to see that everything is set before you arrive and to be told in so many words, if you would have paid top dollar you'd recieve better service at the JW vegas.

First time staying the the JW Marriott. Wife doesn't like the smokey Vegas strip hotels and we were looking for more of a spa experience, so went with the JW. Got the AAA package with breakfast included both nights ($238/night rate). Very pleased with the hotel. It's only about 5-10 minutes away from the strip and has a wonderful golf resort feel to it. Very well landscaped, lush grounds, nice architecture. Not too crowded at all, saw some leisure and some business travelers. Hardly any smoke, even in the Rampart casino in the evenings. Stayed in the standard room and it was quite nice. Tons of room, almost looked like it was missing some furniture since there was so much space. Still had a \"Marriott\" feel, neutral wallpaper and carpet looked a little older. Not quite comparable to the suite at Caesar's Palace tower, but much better than your average Vegas room. Very comfortable king bed, ceiling fan, large walk-in closet with convenient electronic safe and two robes. Bathroom was huge, with whirlpool tub for 2 (sort of a \"peanut\" shape), shower with rainfall, granite vanity. The \"cooler\" fridge was useless, but there was free bottled water. Room was in the Palm Tower which was a bit of a walk from the spa and Ceres restaurant for breakfast, but really not too far. Each tower has its own valet parking (free for guests) and check-in desk which was convenient. We stayed on the 6th (top) floor and had a beautiful view from the french doors. No real balcony to step onto, but it looks like the suites might have balconies with chairs. Service overall was very good. Friendly, courteous staff. Greeted us by name when we called for a wake up call (yes, it shows on their computer but it's a nice touch anyway). Spent most of Saturday in the Aquae Solis Spa. Booked massage for me, European facial, manicure and pedicure for my wife. Spa area is very nice, separate facilities for men and women, but a common area in the back between with a private pool and jaccuzzi for spa guests only. Very intimate setting, mostly couples or women. Ordered lunch from the room service menu and had it delivered to the spa pool in back, only took about 30 minutes. The waterfall shower was intense, decent jaccuzzi, cold plunge, steam and dry sauna and lots of lounging area to just relax. Also free juices, citrus water and fruit.

Highly recommend the roasted corn tamale with shrimp appetizer and the signature pork tenderloin.

Rampart was great, $5 minimums. Took a few minutes to get a seat, but dealers were friendly and the players seemed to be having a good time overall. Not too smoky either compared to the strip. Played till about 2:00 am and noticed a lot fewer people after midnight, must be a lot of locals. Breakfast was included and was the breakfast buffet at Ceres. Excellent food, lots of fresh fruit and pastries, omelettes, eggs and waffles made to order, usual selection of bacon, sausage, potatoes, cereals, lox, cream cheese, bagels, fresh squeezed OJ and good coffee. Good service too. Ours was free, but the bill for two would have been about $30 including tax. Ceres is surrounded by some waterfalls and you can sit outside if you'd like.

We booked it based solely on tripadvisor recommendations and were not disappointed. Firstly location. Yes it is about 20 mins from the Strip. So if all your activities centre around there, then this may not be the best spot for you. However, it is not a difficult journey to get down there. You just turn right out of the hotel onto Rampart and then keep going until you turn left on to the road that will deposit you on the right part of Las Vegas Blvd. For us, mostly Sahara (about 4 blocks from memory) then you keep on going until you hit the Strip. Upside is that Summerlin is a world away from the hussle and bussle and great for getting out into the hills. Red Rock Canyon is minutes away and it is well located for the 95 and 215 if you want to go elsewhere outside Vegas. The hotel itself is set in its own, well maintained gardens and grounds. There is no road noise, no sense of air pollution and the views of the hills are just great. Reception We arrived and went to check in at the Spa Tower. there were two receptionists on duty and we were seen within a few minutes. We arrived early at 11.00 but were given a room for immediate occupation. We had a ground floor room in the Palms Tower, looking out across towards the hills. We got back in the car and drove around to the other tower and used the free Valet Parking. Car parked, bags brought to room without any delay. Used the Valet parking all the time we were there. Extremely friendly and helpful with directions and advice. We had hired an open top Mustang and they would put the top up and down for us when we came and went without needing to be asked. The Room. I have noted a couple of people saying the rooms looked tired, or other less than complimentary comments about the rooms. So, I am very happy to report that this was not the case. You enter the room via a marble floored hallway, with the bathroom off to the right. It contains a two seater whirlpool bath and seperate shower unit, with standard wall shower or overhead rain head shower. There is a seperate WC accessed from within the bathroom. Lots of good quality product in the bathroom, although I don't recall it having any special name (but I am a guy). Back into the corridor and you next pass a walk in closet on your right with safe, ironing board and iron and plenty of hanging space for clothes. The corridor then opens out into one of the largest bedrooms I have seen in a hotel. Ahead of you is a standard TV/Drawer unit and beyond that a desk and 2 chairs. To the right is a king size bed (extremely comfortable) and a sofa and an armchair. There is also a round coffee table. the opening double patio doors looked out onto the hills and made the room bright and airy. The room has a modern air con unit with digital display mounted on the wall. It also has a large ceiling fan and over head light, both working on variable slider switches so you can set them just so. Wallpaper, carpets, fittings in first rate condition. No signs of wear and tear at all. Room Service. We had beakfast brought to the room on a couple of days. it is delivered on a wheeled table, with winged sections that are expanded to make a large dining table. We had it placed in front of the patio doors so we could take in the view. What I liked about Room Service was that the prices were reasonable and you did not feel you were being ripped off. Can't remember exact prices in the Monte Carlo, just a feeling that you would NOT want to pay that much. I think Champagne worked out at less than half the price of the Monte Carlo. The public areas inside the hotel. The whole place has a very open, airy and chilled out feel to it. There is plenty of marble in the lobbies and corridors connecting the two towers, with high celings and wide passageways. Maybe the feeling is enhanced because we moved away from the Strip and all the crowds, but it feels tranquil. In fact that's a word that a lot of people there was using to describe it, a sort of oasis in the desert. We ate in the Japanese restaurant one evening. Service was good and attentive. Not had much experience of Japanese food, but everything seemed well prepared and was certainly fresh and tasty. There is also a sushi bar in there and they also do Taipan table preparation. We had a lunch and an evening snack in the Irish pub. Good simple straight forward food with an Irish slant. They also pulled an exceptional pint of Guinness. The evening we went in, there was a live band playing. Mostly good, but one of the singers hit a few bum notes. However this was made up for in enthusiasm and energy. In fact, your typical pub entertainment. Staff friendly and some were actually Irish, coming from an area less than 20 miles away from my wife's parents village over in Ireland. Next door to the Irish pub is a Starbucks, open 24 hours. Your room key gets you a a free size upgrade on your drinks there. We had drinks in the Ceres lounge. Large comfy chairs and sofas and attentive staff. We did not eat there. We had a breakfast in the cafe which faces on to the casino floor on our last morning. (We had come down at a time when the buffet place was closed, probably switching from breakfast to lunch?). They ask if you want to sit smoking or non-smoking, but as the place opens out into the casino, you don't get a lot of choice. We also had a meal in the casino's 'fine dining' restaurant. I can't recall its name and had a very average dining experience. we ate at 8pm and when it came to desserts, got the definate impression they wanted to pack up early and get off home. I believe the casino and this place is under different management than the hotel itself. We also had some drinks and snacks at the pool side bar. Friendly and attentive staff. Never found the time to use the pool, but it looked very inviting. there were also plenty of cabanas dotted about if you wanted to make a day of it. Summary. Oned of the nicest, friendliest and most comfortable places I have stayed. A true oasis but so close to vegas. If you are hiring a car, then getting around will not be a problem.

When we arrived the next day at 1:30 and went to check in at the Palms Tower we were told that we were too early.After I explained that we had called the day before the clerk told me that I must have been talking to central reservations. Then we stood there at the counter for 37 minutes while the clerk looked for a room BUT in doing so allowed herself to be interupted by others coming up to the counter and asking questions as well as answering the phone and talking to the aaccounting office Finally I gave up and asked for whatever they could give us and we ended up in tne Spa Tower. So our luggage had to be reloaded into the car and off we went back to the other entrance. The room was nice and the bathroom was super ( love that shower!) We had to phone and have an engineer up to repair the A/C system. Then we put a few soft drinks in the refrigerator only to find out that it was not a fridge but a cooler which you had to go and fill the ice bucket and place inside.This was a new one on us inspite of having travelled all over the world and in all 50 states.

It's about a 20 minute ride to the strip so a rental car is a must, but having stayed at just about every major strip hotel it's a nice break from all the hustle and bustle that goes on inside of these hotels. For starters, you don't need to navigate through the casino maze to get to your room. In fact, the JW has 2 front desks. The main one in the Spa tower and another in the Palm tower. Having stayed in both my only suggestion is to ask for an upgrade to a suite in either tower though even the standard rooms rate better than strip counterparts such as The Mirage, Paris, Caesars, MGM, and Mandalay Bay. Big rooms, huge bathrooms with rain showers and the suites add a beautiful living room with wet bar and a hot tub in the bath. And the rooms are just the beginning. The grounds are spread out and beautifully landscaped like a tropical oasis with waterfalls and secluded grottos. Great pool area, never crowded and very few kids.

The whole place was very quiet and relaxed. There was one person at reception, and tbh that's all it warranted, it was a very unobtrusive feel to the place. Checked in. Caused a nightmare because I have 4 different reservations for the 5 nights. One of the companies had screwed up and booked 2 beds for one night, as opposed to one bed for 2 nights. She said not to worry and was fine about it all. We were over at the other tower, so back to Valet. Guy opened car doors for us and away we went. Pulled up at the other valet and the guy helped u out with our bags and took car of the car. Room was on the 1st floor and was massive. It overlooked the little river/waterfall that seems to run throught the whole complex. Bed was huge. In the UK we have normal double beds, there I dont think I could even reach out and find my other half. Walk in wardrobe and gorgeous bathroom. It was all soo clean and in A1 condition. Even though there were 3 weddings during our time there, there was never any noise. Pool was lovely but not at all crowded. Valets remembered who we were and where we were from. Its a great position to go off to red rock canyon, and to get back on the interstate. PF Chang, Banana republic and Gap just down the road along with the usual Target and 7/11. The hot tub by the pool, well 2 of them, were open 24 hours a day and were a great size. Free USA Today on weekdays outside your room. Only went in the casino once for the toilet!! Now for the food. Having had breakfast at Paris while on the strip, I dont think any buffet can compare to that. There is no breakfast buffet but lunch starts at 11am so thats no problem as we got up late most of the time. Food was a lot cheaper than the strip but wasnt as good, as Paris. However waitresses were very helpful, there was also a bit of a queue. Sunday, they do a champagne brunch with crab and fresh seafood. In the UK 1kg of prawns cost about $30 in supermarkets, so I took full advantage of the food. I think it was about $13 for champagne brunch. Food was really the only let down, if they got the buffet a bit better (its still on par with say the mirage) they would be 100% there I reckon. Also, one thing to note, we were in our mid twenties and the average age eating in the buffet was of retirement age. I dont care but some people may prefer to be with a younger crowd, altho by the pool everyone was about 30-40 age group.

The pool is large and spacious in a semi-tropical setting. It was not crowded with sunbathers like you get at the strip hotels. The JW Marriott Las Vegas is after all a Resort & Spa. So, there is always something to do for those wishing to leave the gambling behind from their quaint casino between the two towers. For golfers, I hear the courses are some of the best. If you\u2019re into a spa and massage, wait until you get a look at the spa facilities it is awesome to say the least. I used the spa exercise facility and I really worked up a sweat after eating all the good food from their buffet. Speaking of food, the buffet was very, very reasonable priced. There was enough diversity to even please the most discriminating pallets. We ate at the waterside caf\u00e9 for breakfast and sat outside close to the waterfalls. My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed the romantic setting. I like staying at the JW Marriott Las Vegas because the lobby and the rooms are far away from the casino and you won\u2019t have to come down from your room hearing the loud noises and smell the smoke filled rooms like the casinos on the strip. I also like the fact it is away from the strip. I don\u2019t particularly like the crowds and the hustle and bustle of the strip. The JW Marriott Las Vegas is not only a great place to get away, but a wonderful place to bring your family.", "Date": "September 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "poughkeepsie, NY", "Title": "\u201cJW the place to stay in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2515081", "Content": "WOW! This is the place to stay when visiting Vegas, especially when traveling with children. One evening spent on the strip only confirmed my feelings. The JW has a large pool with a large waterfall, chairs were never a problem and we were traveling with 4 children and 3 adults during our 8/11 - 8/14 trip. We booked two rooms and they were both wonderful. The bathroom and dressing areas are beautiful and oversized. They have several restaurants, gift shops, and of course the casino. They also run a shuttle service back and forth to the strip. Check the times at the front desk for availability. We used it twice during our stay to go to the strip for a couple of daytime shopping trips. If you like constant night life, noise and crowds, then this is not the place for you. But if you want to stay away from that and you don't mind driving into the strip (a 15/20 drive), then this is the resort for you.

We had a wonderful time! I chose this resort as an alternative to one of the hotels on the strip simply because I believed there must be a nice hotel in Las Vegas that wasn't on the strip. I found it in the JW Marriott Las Vegas. Everyone was friendly and very attentive to our needs. We stayed in the SPA tower section of the resort. The room was fantastic - roomy, large bathroom with spa tub and separate rainfall shower. Yes...this was a standard room. Although we made several trips to the 'strip' for sightseeing and a show, we couldn't wait to get back to the resort away from the crowds and enjoy the layed back atmosphere it afforded. Marriott really did some great pre-planning before building this hotel and it shows. We definitely will be staying at this hotel in the future! As a previous reviewer also stated, the JW Marriott is about 15 minutes out of town off HWY 95 and we did encounter an accident on the HWY, which made one of our trips into the strip a little longer, but we didn't mind. We still believe the hotel is the best value around considering what it offers in return. This is definitely a one of a kind off-Strip hotel that is not to be missed.", "Date": "September 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJW is my new Boyfriend :)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2461908", "Content": "Absolutely wonderful.

We were worried about staying off the strip, but now we find that we may never stay on the strip again.

Marriott in Summerlin. My wife and I and our two boys, ages 8 and 11, were looking for a quick, relaxing getaway. My wife adamantly refused to take our boys to any hotels on the strip, but I longed for a little gambling in my favorite city. We compromised and decided on the Marriott. It could not have been a better decision. We booked a junior suite, which was both spacious and impressive. We had two bathrooms, which allowed a family of four to peacefully get ready each morning. We had a jacuzzi tub and a separate walk in shower with a \"rainfall\" type shower head in the ceiling. Our eight-year-old begged us to let him take a shower at least twice a day. The pool was quite big and we were the only ones there to enjoy it. The casino is small but adequate with a decent sports book. The strip and downtown were minutes away by freeway.

Our first time \"off the strip\", and we fell in LOVE with the gorgeous rooms, mountain views, spa-like bathrooms, and stunning grounds. We slept each night with our french doors open to enjoy the sound of the waterfalls. The restaurants (Ceres & Spiedini) were excellent: offering al fresco and in-door dining. We also enjoyed a fun lunch at the Irish Pub. The pool area is exceptional: and we enjoyed NOT fighting for chairs or awaking at 7:00 a.m. to stand in a line. The staff was very professional and exceptionally courteous. We travelled with friends who also loved this place. The men enjoyed TPC golf course and my friend and I adored the spa: classes, amenities and treatments. In the a.m., we enjoyed a quick trip downstairs to the StarBucks (reg. coffee avail. in the rooms) for an awesome (and reasonably priced coffee.) We paid up to $7.50 for 2 coffees at Caesars. If you're looking for a beautiful spot away from the crowds and hubbub, this is IT. It's the first time in years that we've returned from Vegas RELAXED. (p.s. The Sun Coast is fun for gambling!)
