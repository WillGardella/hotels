The best part of our room was the bathroom, which was quite large by comparison, though the towels were rather threadbare. The room was very stuffy but the air con made a terrible noise.

The hotel is in a residental neighborhood right across the street from Central Park, it is no where near Midtown/Times Square, but that is not a problem since there is a subway three blocks away!! As for dining options there is a deli two blocks away that serves great coffee and delicious bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwiches, as well as other breakfast favs. Crepes on Columbus, about 3 blocks down, is also a great dining option. The neighborhood also has small shops as well as several produce stands and food carts. The rooms arent in the best shape, ours faced several buildings, but it was quiet and my son was fascinated by a family of black cats that had taken up residence on one of the roof tops! The paint job was sloppy, the floor was slanted, one of the light fixtures was broken, but these things didnt matter since we would leave the hotel at around 8am and not return until 11pm. The beds are modern and super comfy with lots of pillows!!!! The staff was super nice and the hotel does provide a car to the airport for $60, which isnt bad considering it's about $45 to take a Super Shuttle.

New York has so much to offer and there isn't enough time to do everything, you certainly don't want to be wasting time stuck in a hotel. The room (on the 5th floor) was cleaned every day, fresh towels were provided daily and if we had any queries about where to go and how to get there the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful.

First of all, I have to give credit to letsgo2 for putting it all together, the trip went on without a hitch and as it was my first time organising a holiday, this was really important to me. I would honestly recommend them to anyone. We even managed to get flights with Virgin Atlantic included in our tiny budget which was a huge bonus (free meals, free drinks etc). We got to New York and arrived at Astor on the Park to very friendly and helpful staff who happily stored our luggage until we could check in. (Check in wasn't until 3pm) Its located on the Upper West Side of New York and when we started walking, we were a bit bummed at how far out from everything we thought we were. However, after walking about 20 blocks downtown, we decided to cross on over 2 blocks to Columbus Avenue when we realised we were definitely walking down the wrong road! While there wasn't a lot but Apartments on Central Park West, we discovered that they were an abundance of shops and restaurants just 2 blocks across in a really bohemian area. We did all the tourist-ee bits in the day, which was amazing but I can't tell you how refreshing it was, after all the hustle and bustle of Midtown, to come back to our hotel on such a lovely street. There are subway stations literally just up the road which we used to get around (so cheap, $2.50 a ride!) and a lovely little Deli nearby where we had breakfast every morning. Overall the hotel was delightful, the staff were absolutely lovely and were always happy to help no matter what time, and the location really gives you a different perspective on New York.

The front desk staff was very nice in offering early check-ins for me and another couple that were waiting for check-in time (3pm).

The elevator was busy with housekeeping using the 1 elevator, but I still didn't wait too long for it to be available for me to use.

At the end of the room's hallway was one of the beds was very close to the wall and was obstructing passage to go around the bed. I have a picture of the bed near the wall and blocking the hallway.

The hotel itself (because that's what reviews are supposed to be i.e. not location) was a great place. Okay the rooms are a bit dated and smaller than what we are used to in Europe but I stayed 5 nights and had no issues whatsoever. The staff are only to be congratulated on their friendly and helpful attitude and we always felt very welcomed. We used the hotel as a base for sightseeing I certainly didn't go to NYC to sit in a hotel room I can do that much closer to home. I enjoyed a good nights sleep each night and the bathroom was good enough, I particularly enjoyed getting up early walking to the deli at the corner for a coffee and sitting on the wall outside the hotel watching the world go by. I would definitely stay here again as the rate was very good compared to other hotels in NYC, and the big plus is the location! I got to walk across the road and sit in Central Park.

We only use our hotel to sleep and shower and don't need luxury or a lot of amenities - just somewhere clean and safe. This place definitely fit the bill. First - the good. The staff is extremely friendly and checking in and out was a breeze. There was always a doorman on duty and by the second day they were greeting us by name and making friendly chit-chat. They also were helpful in recommending the best places to eat in the area. The room itself was nothing special but it was fine; on the smallish side but pretty normal by NY standards. The sheets and towels were extremely clean and we had a private bathroom, which was marble. It looks just like the pictures I saw on Priceline when I booked the room. The location is in the upper west side near the northern edge of Central Park but close to two subway stops. Unless you are the kind of person who needs to be in the heart of the action the location is fine and being across the street from the park is nice. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance and a 10-15 minute subway ride to get anywhere in Manhattan. TIP: the A and C trains run on the same track, but be sure you take the C train (local) b/c it is the only one that stops at 103rd or 110th, the two closest subway stops. The A takes you all the way to 126th and you have to get on the C to go back. We found the 103rd to be the more convenient of the two close stops. The mixed - our room had a view of the park, which was lovely, but the downside is that the street traffic was quite loud. We were on the third floor and the noise from the traffic made sleeping difficult, although by the third night I was better able to tune it out. Perhaps a higher floor would have helped. Again - for the price we paid, it was a minor complaint, and I'm sure the view was much better than the rooms that face the back of the building, which may be just as loud in terms of traffic noise for all I know. The bad - the noise from people walking in the hallways and in the room above us was much more noticible than any other hotel I have been in. The walls seem literally paper thin. This was much more disruptive than the traffic noise. If someone opened a door anywhere in our vicinity it literally sounded as if someone was walking into our room. It was a bit disconcerting. People walking normally in the room above us sounded like a herd of elephants stomping around. Also, while the linens on the bed are fine the bed itself was extremely hard. It was ok for a few nights but probably would have bothered me on a longer stay. Overall I would recommend staying here if you can get it for less than $100 per night - especially b/c most things in that price range in NY have shared bathrooms and this place does not. Anything over that, I would shop around and see what else you can find.

After staying with some friends on the upper east side for a week then staying with another friend down in Brooklyn for 5 days, having our own space was something we were both looking forward to. Our personal experience was great. PROS: Cheap. Keep in mind, this is New York, where nothing really comes cheap and there are places that are constantly booked up. This was the cheapest available hotel we could find that was not a complete dive or a hostel where we'd be sharing a room with nearly 12 people. For the location, the helpfulness of the staff, and the amenities, the price was perfect. Location, location, location. This hotel is in a great spot. Our room (609) overlooked Central Park, a great view to wake up to in the morning. The hotel is right next to the subway. Convenient store, grocery store, deli, coffee shop, bus stop are all within 5 blocks. Since the hotel is on Central Park West, it's fairly easy to find a cab. Safe. Along with location, you'll feel at ease walking around the neighborhood at any time, day or night. It seems fairly family oriented. We walked by several schools, a lot of parents/nannies and children. Helpful staff. From the time we walked in the door, the concierge and front desk clerk were professional, helpful, and friendly. The day I was scheduled to leave my flight was cancelled due to all the bad weather. They were very understanding and helpful, got me on another flight AND although I was supposed to have already checked out, they offered to store my luggage free of charge if I had any errands/business to attend to. Room. Again, for the price we were paying in New York City, we were amazed at what the room had to offer. TV, a king sized bed, clean bathroom and bedroom. Basic. Perfect. CONS : Only a few things I would mention when recommending to anyone. Advertising. Online, the ad for the hotel said there would be a continental breakfast. There is not. Call the hotel itself to find out about their ammenities. The online ad agencies and hotel are not affiliated. Smoking. The people in the room next to ours were constantly smoking. My friend is an asthmatic and it was particularly uncomfortable for her. Although we called the hotel and they said they would address it, cigarette smoke lingers and the hotel can't monitor smokers 24/7. Unfortunate. Heating/cooling. It's confusing to figure out and get just right. If nothing else, call the front desk and someone will come up and tamper with the heater to get it just right for you. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends visiting NYC. For larger groups or families, not sure if this would be your cup of tea. Again, it was just me and a friend staying at Astor.

The hotel and its lobby and rooms are rather plain and devoid of any frills but the decor and aesthetics of the room were tasteful, pleasant and very reasonable given the price we paid. There were a few negatives. The walls are very thin, and we could hear noise through the wall from the adjoining rooms, including the sneezing of a guest and the running of the water in its sink and shower. In the second room facing the Park, the volume of street noise was quite loud at night. The combination of noises from the street and the adjacent room made it somewhat difficult for this reviewer to sleep. There is no coffee shop in the hotel, but there are vending machines for coffee, soft drinks, and candy, all at a reasonable price. The TV in the first room did not work, but the staff replaced it shortly after we brought it to their attention.

Astor on the Park has a great location (just like Days Hotel). It's in a safe, quiet neighborhood, directly across from the amazing Central Park, and steps from all of the major subway lines. On the corner is a nice deli with nice folks, and if you walk up to the 100s and Broadway, you can find plenty of good restaurants and a cute dive bar called Tap of the Keg. Drug stores and banks are all within walking distance so the location is convenient, to say the least. The exterior of the hotel is nice, and the lobby, while very small, is welcoming. The hallway is super small and slightly alarming but I hardly heard outside foot traffic. The rooms themselves are quaint, renovated, and clearly trying to emulate hipper boutique hotels than the corporate chain ones. There are no amenities but like I said, you can get what you need by foot around the corner. My main issue with the room was cleanliness. I found several hairs on my bed that weren't mine, and the bathroom cleanliness left a lot to be desired. I wasn't disgusted but wished it were just a bit cleaner. The rooms ARE small but not suffocatingly so. They have enough room for a large bed and a second lounge-y chair. You won't be roaming around in your room but you also won't feel like you're in a jail cell. The lack of free Internet is disappointing but even more so, the cost. I believe it was $12 per day for Internet, which is too expensive, in my opinion. If Astor could lower the price or better yet, offer free Internet for guests, I'd like this place more. The elevator is very small and slow, so take the stairs for an adventure. The stairs are really narrow and it's almost like a roller coaster. :) The staff were all nice and accommodating. I'd be willing to give Astor on the Park another try but they really do need to improve their cleanliness and re-consider their Internet options to stay competitive with other hotels.

We were there in February and the room was sweltering. Though it was below freezing outside, we had to run the air conditioner to avoid burning it up. Luckily there was air conditioning though! It was a little loud and made sleeping a little difficult, but sadly this is a problem I\u2019ve also encountered at hotels much more expensive. The bed was a huge king and reasonably comfortable. It had nice white linens which I appreciated. (Floral and paisley bed spreads scare me as I always wonder what they\u2019re hiding.).

Check-in was painless at about 2:30 p.m. on a weekday afternoon; I was offered smoking or non-smoking room at that time. I was not given a room with a view of the park as I requested upon booking, but I did not make an issue of it because I did not intend to spend much time in the room (other than for sleeping). I checked out at about 7 a.m., and waited only a few minutes for a clerk (shift change). All the staff I encountered were very pleasant and friendly. Room: I was given a room with two beds, and there was more than enough room for my stuff (solo traveler). Storage space was limited to a wall unit that doubles as a TV stand. The bathroom looked modern, and was immaculate just like the rest of the room. As with many older buildings, the hot water took several minutes to become available. I did not wait longer than one minute for the elevator, although the car does move quite slow. Then again, I only saw one other guest during my stay, so the hotel was probably far from booked. Location: Just opposite several entrances to the north end of Central Park (between 106th and 107th on Central Park West), which is beautiful and relaxing with its ponds and wooded trails. The area is quite populated even during off-hours of the evening, and with the seemingly posh doorman buildings along most of the drag, it does not seem to attact many troublemakers. The B and C subways stops are located on the same block at 103rd and 110th Streets...very convienient. The 103rd Street station actually has a live person in the ticket booth (for tourists that need help, etc.); I did not use the 110th Street station. It is about a 15 minute ride to midtown on either line. I walked around the area to survey the restaurants and, quite honestly, I did not find any places I would have went into if I needed a meal. Bottom line: If you can snag this hotel for $50-$100 per night, I do not think you will be disappointed. Other than internet access in the lobby, the hotel offers no ammenities.

The room was small, a bit claustrophobic after the two of us were in the room with our luggage but it served its purpose as just a place to sleep for us. The private bathroom was small but clean. The shower glass was only half way so it made taking a shower a bit harder since I was trying to make sure I was splashing all over the place.

Yes, the lift is slow and sometimes it is easier to use the stairs. Some of the rooms are small, but all are clean and each bathroom is decorated to a high standard, the hotel having been refurbished in 2005. The individual air conditioning units fitted in each room are effective but a little noisy. There are no other facilities at the hotel apart from the bedrooms, a reception area and a drinks machine and Internet station (expensive) in the basement. Now the positive points about this friendly small hotel. It is well placed on Central Park West and is very reasonably priced. The staff all tended to be friendly and helpful and were happy to engage in conversation and offer advice on places to go and things to see. The hotel is frequented mainly by European guests making it feel comfortable for other visitors from the UK/Europe. Being able to walk out of the hotel and straight into the park is a real bonus. Even at the north end, the park is really well used, with many joggers and people exercising during daylight hours. It is a relatively short walk across the park to the Guggenheim Museum (at 90th Street on the east side). The hotel is very well placed for the subway (B and C lines) being located between the stops at 103rd and 110th Street (110th Street is slightly closer). A trip to downtown takes around 10-15 minutes, and with a weekly ticket for the subway and buses ($27) makes getting around NewYork cheap and easy. There is a very modern and well-stocked Supermarket on 110th Street (Cathedral View) and a small American dinner one block back on 107th Street (La Exquisite) that is convenient for breakfast with a typical meal of omelettes and coffee costing around $10/head. A short walk away from Central Park down Louis Armstrong Avenue (and across Manhattan, Columbus, and Amsterdam Avenues) brings you to Broadway which has a good range of reasonable restaurants at sensible prices. The area between Central Park West and Broadway is a little rundown, although it seemed safe enough to us. Two other places worth mentioning that are within easy reach of the hotel are The Hungarian Pastry Shop (near the junction of 110th and Amsterdam Avenue) for cakes and coffee and Miss Mimmis Caf\u00e9 (on the corner of 110th and Columbus Avenue) for a really good taste of a Southern kitchen.

While the room we had was at the back of the hotel, so no view, the room was clean and we were surprised at how quiet it was! As we were tired after the trip the receptionist ordered us a pizza which was delivered straight to our room. Although you are a bit out of the centre, being able to cross the road straight into central park for a jog or walk was wonderful. There is a small cafe just on the corner of where the hotel is for breakfast pancakes or bagles. As there are 2 subway stations on 103rd and 110th streets (less than 5 mins walk away) it is quick to get to the action downtown.

That said, when i got to this hotel, i did not even stay here. I booked a twin room (travelling with my father) and on arrival was given a small double room. The bed was not even a double bed. The woman at reception had the cheek to send us up to the room, knowing it was not a twin room. The room was dark, and looked pretty unclean. My father did say the bathroom was ok, but i never looked at it. I was straight down to complain. I showed the woman on reception my printed hotel booking showing i had paid for a twin room, capable of sleeping up to 4 people. Did she care? No. She said, on our booking form it shows a double room. Great customer relations. I asked if they could move us into a twin. She said they were fully booked. So i was forced to move to a different hotel, and i did not get a refund. I am claiming for a refund through my credit card. Many have mentioned this is a budget hotel. Well it's not that cheap.

For a fabulous introduction to NYC we walked the length of the park and into the city. If the hotel had been closer we'd have missed half the park, it's so big. Within a 3 minute walk you can jump on the Subway for a 10 minute ride to Times Square, or practically right outside the hotel you can catch a bus and from there you can get anyway at all on Manhatten Island for $2 - and it really helps you get your bearings and see places. We got the bus everywhere and really enjoyed seeing the various parts of the city that'd we'd have missed from the subway. The hotel location is great. Just a short, easy ride into the city and all the major attractions yet sufficiently far away to be able to get a quiet night's sleep. A taxi home at night was very reasonably priced, but the night-bus was equally ok, just took slightly longer. Some reviews state the hotel and being in Harlem which conjures up some pretty negative feelings - don't worry! This hotel and surroundings felt very safe, there is a cafe a 2 min walk up the road which serves fab sandwiches, snacks and breakfasts and is a fantastic place to sit with real New-Yorkers and get a feel for the place - cheap internet access here too. The hotel reception desk, stairwell and lift seem a little small and tired, but the rooms are great. Small, yes. But big enough to unpack and leave your stuff considering that pretty much all you'll be doing there is sleep and wash. The bed was huge - I didn't even know my husband was sharing it with me! It was also very comfy and perfect for a good night's sleep after being on your feet all day. The bathroom was good - clean and everything in good working order with some lovely complimentary toilettries. In the basement you can get snacks, canned drinks and hot drinks from vending machines as well as internet access. We ordered pizza one night and Dominoes delivered right to the room - fantastic when you're exhausted! We stayed in the Astor on the Park for 7 nights, and both agree we would definitely stay there again. For 500 quid each including flights it was a bargain of a holiday and the hotel far exceeded our expectations - especially after we'd read some of the reviews! We were actually on our honeymoon, and whilst it wasn't chocolates on the pillow or rose-petal baths for two, it was a fabulous base from which to explore the city and we'd made a conscious decision to save our pennies for the sight-seeing.

Although it was clean, that's pretty much all I could say for it. The noisy pipes kept me up ALL night, I seriously have not slept so badly in all my life and I live in Central London so I am used to noise, but repetitive banging that ranges in tempo and times is like being in a torture chamber. The room size is small but that didn't bother me, but it got really hot, there is an air conditioning unit, but it is very noisy and level with my side of the bed, as soon as you turned it off it was boiling hot again. The staff weren't particuarly friendly or un-friendly, they were mostly indifferent. When I complained about the noise, they said they couldn't do anything about it. I didn't feel too comfortable in this hotel and was glad that I was on the 7th floor, I can't say it was unsafe but it didn't seem that anyone would know who was a visitor in this hotel and who wasn't, as the reception is in the corner away from the entrance and the stairs and lift are directly in front. The lift was broke for about 3 days of our 7 day trip which meant going up and down the narrowest staircase you have ever seen. This was particuarly frustrating when we had our luggage as we had to wait for about 45 minutes just so we could get in the lift when there was nobody in it, luckily we gave ourselves enough time to get to the airport. It's a long walk from Times Square, but not unbearable, we pretty much travelled by the subway during the day and got a taxi back at night. In hindsight, it probably would have worked out the same price if we had booked a hotel closer to the centre, because we would have saved on taxi fares and we probably would have done more evening activities. There isn't much around in terms of restaurants and places to eat breakfast etc.. We had to wait to get into the centre. If you are expecting a 1 star hotel you will be pleasantly surprised, if you are expecting a 3 star you will be bitterly dissappointed.

The hotel has subway which is very good 2 blocks away however if you are the type that prefers walking out the hotel door into the main city/nightlife then this hotel is probably a little to far out for you .There are some shops, cafes (which deliver to hotel and decent menu in hotel room) however you have a decent walk or short taxi ride to livelier areas in the evening .

I requested one and they gave me a corroded iron that left a copper stain on the tissue I wiped against it. It would have ruined my shirt had I used it. The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable.

Tired and fed up I went to bed only to be kept awake most of the night by a strange clanking noise coming from pipework outside the window. The next day I demanded to be moved and was given a room on the 4th floor. This room was bigger and had a view of the park, but the window frame was broken and the window had dropped and so did not fully close which meant apart from the fact that it was letting in the cold (5 degrees F outside) it was also noisey from the traffic on the main road (even 4 floors up). Additionally the central heating did not work. When I complained I was given a plug in oil filled radiator. After failing to convince myself that I could suffer staying in this room I demanded another move. This time I was moved to the 11th floor to what I believe to be one of the best rooms in the hotel. This room was bigger and the window did close and I couldn't hear the traffic. However the heating still didn't work (luckily I had taken the plug in radiator from the previous room with me) and there was no heating what-so-ever in the bathroom. When I questioned why the central heating was not working I was told that the hotel policy is to only turn on the heating boiler when guests complain about being cold. Firstly, I don't think that approach quite grasps the basics of hospitality and secondly, this was the coldest January for 5 years, how could they expect us not to be cold with night temperatures of 3 degrees F (-16c). This place is a dump. The only positive thing I can say is that the staff were sympathetic to my complaints and acknowledged them without any dispute.

One of the previous reviews said The Astor on the Park was like an upmarket hostel and I think that sums it up. We booked 2 rooms and specifically asked for rooms with a view of the park with one room to have twin beds. The rooms we got looked across a small yard right in to the bedrooms on the other side, the window blinds had to be closed all the time or people in the rooms opposite could see right in. Whose fault this mix up was is still up for discussion so maybe not the hotels fault. One of the rooms wasn't too bad but the other was dirty, 2inch of carpet all around the room was thick with dirt, it just hadn't been cleaned for months. The room size was 10 ft by 12 ft and although the bathrooms were alright with excellent showers they were just not clean, dropping your clothes on the floor meant they were covered in fluff when you picked them up. You do need to read the instructions located on reception desk of how the shower works as there are no instructions in the bathroom. You are provided with soap, shower jell and shower cap which was a nice touch with clean towels every day and the bed was made every day but nothing else in the rooms seemed to be cleaned. A bottle top we dropped on the floor on our arrival was still there when we left and the small dustbin in the room was never emptied so we used a carrier bag for the rubbish. The draught through the window had to be packed each night with pillows or whoever slept next to the window couldn't get to sleep for the cold draught that blew freely through the air con. We took a kettle as there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and the draughty window was an ideal place to keep the milk and it stayed fresh all week. There was a coffee machine in the basement which we didn't need to use but we were told you had to pay for it, you could also access the internet from the basement and again paid for the privilege. It seemed there was a 3 inch wide pipe from floor to ceiling in each bathroom, these pipes were VERY hot, the pipe in one of the bedrooms was lagged but the other wasn't and would have been very dangerous for children or older people. One small lift services the whole hotel so it was always busy and we used the small stairs most of the time which were about 3ft wide and we did wondered how everyone would get out if there was a fire. On the whole the chipped paint, the room doors which were hard to unlock until you got the hang of how they worked, the beds with thin mattresses that were too firm and the walls which were so thin you could hear every footstep both from outside and from the floor above, didn't make this a hotel of quality. The staff were friendly but make sure if you book any trips via the hotel you get the trip you want. We were told the trip to the Statue of Liberty couldn't visit the island, maybe that one couldn't but others can and to be honest the trip isn't worthwhile without landing on the island and seeing the great lady up close. The location of the hotel wasn't the best, its away from the tourist area but close to the underground which isn't bad if you don't mind a bit of adventure. We bought a weekly ticket for just over $12 and used the underground to get all over New York, it can be complicated if your not used to the labyrinth of tunnels but even if you get lost just jump on the next train back. Taxi up to the main shopping area could cost about $25 so can be expensive if you use it a lot and unless your really fit its too far to walk. Id recommend this hotel to singles, couples or young families with plenty of energy who don't mind roughing it a bit and don't mind doing the extra walking or travelling before they get to places of interest. The locals are friendly and being further out you meet a lot of them travelling to work etc. This hotel isn't suitable if your the kind of person who spends time in the hotel, its alright if you just need a bed and a bath and you dont mind things not being too clean.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cAstor was clean, great and freindly.

The fact that the hotel is right opposite central park is a bonus and a morning stroll around the park is a must. For food and drink, nearby the hotel, columbus ave, provides ample choice. The walk into the centre is well advised, you pass the natural history museum, strawberry fields and a little restaurante/bar called the tavern on the green, a draw for tourists so a little expensive but well worth popping in for a drink and a look around the gardens. Now for the hotel, check in was swift and friendly and the doormen are more than happy to give any information you require. The rooms are small but modern, a double bed, one small wardrobe, television, CD/ radio alarm and telephone. The bathrooms are surprisingly spacious, modern marble tiled walls, power shower/ bath, bath shower products and fresh towels each day. If your going to NY to sit in the hotel don't stay here.

After almost being conned out of a lot of money for an apartment in NYC I was pretty stressed and dubious about this place but with just 2 weeks left before leaving for NYC I really had no choice but to just hope for the best! Thank god I did! I can understand why a family, or someone who is used to having what one can only call 'Hotel Holidays' would find this place maybe a little less exciting than a grander hotel but for the price and location I was incredibly pleased with the Astor. Me and my boyfriend stayed there for 9 nights in total and we had a room with a 'park view' which to be honest is just a view of a mass of green but hey! It's better than a wall.. The room was incredibly clean, and yes the walls are painted green but I found the whole place to be very neutral and calming as there was no fuss with wall paper and odd curtains.. The room has a large double bed, two bed side tables with lights / a phone / alarm clock and paper + pen provided. There was not much room to 'move around' but both our suitcases and shopping fit in the room perfectly.. and we had a lot of stuff!! The bathroom was actually a lot bigger than expected! There was a bath and shower (and although the bath may seem small a lot of Manhattan baths are small due to size of apartments.. so this is not just a hotel thing...) and you get a complimentary toiletries basket full of goodies.. The room was cleaned every day with bed linen / bathroom towels and toirlet paper changed every day.. We found the room to be very secure and the cleaning sevice to not only be very thorough but also very honest! (One of the ladies accidently knocked over a glass foundation bottle I had on the bathroom shelf and left me a note asking for full price so she could pay me back!) The staff were friendly and very helpful, we had about 2 hours left before we departed after check out and we left our nags with them free of charge whilst we wondered around town for a bit more!! LOCATION!: Although people here are saying that it is 'too far' away from town we found this ridiculous! The upper west side is a very good area to stay in.. The hotel is 2 blocks away from Columbia University which means a safer place, shops, great places to eat, two super markets near the hotel, and a 24 hour pharmacy that is literally a life saver for tights, sweets, etc etc. There are two main subway lines by the hotel, one which has two stops literally 3 minutes away from tbe hotel (whch is the AC - Blue line and the BD which stops at 110 Cathedral Parkway) and the other which is about 2 blocks away which is the the orange/red colour line 110 Cathedral parkway which is the 123 line) (you can also get off at 103 if needed but you have to walk a bit :) The subways takes less than 15 minutes to get to times square and the lines take you right to times square, ground zero, ferry for statue of liberty and other great places! If you want a quite place to sleep, a somehere thats safe to walk around then seriously this location is amazing! I'm 22 andthis was perfect for me to get our and about! I was not expecting to write such a long review but I always think it's best to get stuff out there, a lot of the time people write these reviews who are used to staying in a hotel for hotel luxery but I went to NYC to see NYC, it was like having a bedroom whilst I was there.. I wa snot interested in the cable, or if I could run around the room, I felt safe, was able to have a great holiday and saved on a lot of cash that I wa sthen able to spend on presents!

I have to say I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews. However, I was pleasently relieved when we got to the hotel. I won't say it's fabulous, but I will call it sufficient. At the price, though, you can't beat it ($145/night). As most people have suggested, you don't go to New York to stay in your room. In all honesty this hotel is not a place you would want to spend to much time in your room. The rooms were tight to say the least, but we had a double bed room. There was enough room for two double beds, a t.v. and a small cupboard for your clothes. There honestly was not a whole lot of room to move around. The rooms would be very crowded for more than three people, and three adults would be pushing it. The beds were actually very comfortable and I got the best sleep I've had in six months. The bathroom had to be the high point of the room though. Our room was clean and was newly tiled. There was no mildew and the shower had great pressure and hot water!!!! The rooms did not smell and the air worked. The down side was the t.v. which didn't really work and there was no remote, but again we only watched it for the weather and news in the morning. Otherwise this is a very sufficient hotel for the tourist. I would definitely not recommend it for a buisness traveler unless you don't mind minimal accomodations. The location was actually great, in my opinion. You're far enough away from the high traffic areas, but two blocks from the subway which can get you anywhere fast. It's about a 10 minute ride to Times Square. Also Central Park is right across the street. It is a very small hotel with minimal accomodations, but as I said it serves the purpose for the tourist. Our group had four rooms and some other rooms were slightly bigger, but not by much. Some of the other rooms had warped floors and older bathrooms, but again everything was clean and everyone raved about how well they slept.

The view from the window in my room was not great but again im not there to look out the window all day.

No. I never saw any advertisements claiming that it was. Are the rooms spacious and does every room boast a sweeping view of the city? No. But if you spent any time researching NYC hotels at all, you'll know that for the price (we paid $108 per night), you're not likely to find better. Astor on the Park has private bathrooms - and very, very nice ones! That is an extreme rarity in $100 Manhattan hotels. No, it's not next door to any NYC attractions other than Central Park - but again, if you looked up the address you would know this, and with the nearby subway, getting to the heart of the city is very easy. If you need a full-service tour guide, enough space to play twister in your room, or plan to spend the majority of your trip hanging out at the hotel, spend (a lot) more money and go elsewhere.

Yes the hotel is basic, but clean enough. Rooms were small but adequate for 2. I agree with peoples comments on the fact that you are only sleeping in the hotel so why pay a lot. We got a reasonable deal here flying with American Airlines, whom were excellent with masses of room on the plane. The hotel is quite a way out but after the hustle and bustle of Manhattan the peace is most welcome. We to suffered from a cold room but we asked for an extra blanket which we got straight away and were then more than comfortable. I was a little concerned before we went about getting to and from the hotel but after the first night's long walk back to hotel we tried out the subway. Not pretty but cheap and reliable. We travelled on it at various different times of day and night and never felt unsafe even when we got on the wrong train and ended up in Harlem. Please use the subway, it's by far the easiest way to get around. Shopping as you would expect is fantastic in New York. Try Macy's, Century 21 and Armani Exchange (Time Warner building). Bloomingdales for UGG's, if your lucky enough to get them. Finally TKTS on times square for a really good deal on theatre tickets. New York was brilliant. Only one word of warning, I found exchanging sterling to dollars a little difficult. Finally found a strange place in 5th Avenue but exchange rate was really poor. Did spot a Travelex on times square near the end of the holiday, but banks, unless customers of HSBC won't exchange currency. Last word from me, try Virgil\u2019s of Times square for dinner, it's great, large portions, good quality, reasonable value. If your looking for tourist tat, try RAG.

Unless, of course, you were looking for a cheap and nasty little hole with no character, no services, located on the dark side of the moon and you were happy to pay $10 a night for the pleasure. We were booked for 4 nights in New York staying at the Astor. We booked in about 1400ish on the day we arrived, went up to the room and immediately groaned. The room was small, stuffy and impractical. Smoking in the place means that non-smoking rooms are far from clean or in fact, non-smoking. A filthy and unpleasant experience. Hanging space for clothes was limited, no drawers, so the case had to do. OK, maybe not a big deal, but certainly not at all comfortable or convenient. There was no room for two people to be moving around the room, so one had to be on the bed and the other could move. Breathing was optional. The central heating was abysmal, with night long gurgling and whistling from an air relief valve. It sounded like a kettle on the boil all night. Appaling noise that made for a very unpleasant night. The only positive comment is the thanks for one of the best hot showers experienced in a hotel for a long time. But, the bed made up for it by scoring in the high negatives. Sleeping between the tracks at 103rd street Metro station would have been more comfortable than the bed contained therein. After one night on that bed, one was next to paralysed. The most uncomfortable night spent in paid accommodation so far, save a nasty event in Doha which was to be expected.

The heaters are controlled by the management and the rooms see little benefit of them which tends to leave the room quite cold. The heaters come on at 5am with an incredibly loud banging and spitting noise which can be quite unsettling on the first night when you do not know what the noise is.

The shower had great pressure even though we were on the 7th floor and the bathroom was new and well kept. The lift that serviced the whole buiding was not a problem and only a 2 minute wait at the most and that was usually in the busy times. The hotel is a few blocks away from 2 underground stations (103rd Street stop in the South and 110th Street in the North) which are within easy walking distance. We purchased 7-day metrocards which were great value for money as it is the fastest and easiest way to get around the city. Of course, there are a plentitude of yellow cabs which the doorman of the hotel will kindly flag down for you as well as booking airport transfers for you. Excellent service. I suggest the other review which stated that the hotel was far out of the centre should either choose another city to visit that is smaller for their convenience or pay premium rates for a hotel that requires no walking or any effort to see the sights as they seem unwilling to make any effort to experience the city.

My partner and I arrived on Thursday (22.11.07) to a lady at reception who was on the phone, so instead of finishing her conversation she proceeded to check us in whilst still on the phone which meant that we had to repeat ourselves a few times as she wasn't concentrating. We got in our room which was room 311, small but clean and adequate. The room had an amazing view of some walls and windows but that wasn't really a problem as it was just a room to sleep in. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were GREAT possibly the best pillows ever, At night when we were sleeping it was cold, so we turned the radiator on, at about 2300 hours, but didnt kick in until about 0300 - 0400 hours and when it did you knew about it. The banding and the rattling was SO loud, we ended up turning it off because the noise kept us awake so we slept being very cold. That was the worst thing about the hotel. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the maids did a marvellous job of that. It is quite away from all the main things in NYC. The surronding areas seemed a bit dodgy when we went for a walk to find some food but that could be down to being somewhere we didn't know. The hotel is situation on Central Park West 106th Street, the nearest subway is 103rd Street which takes you into Times Square, takes about 10mins once on the train but we did wait for some time at times for a train to arrive. Overall, this is a good place to stay in Spring/Summer I should imagine so no need for the radiator to be on, and it is ideal if you just want a place to crash and that isnt a hostel. I won't come back to this hotel, because I regret not staying in central more as after a massive day of shopping/sightseeing you just want to get to your hotel as quick as possible.

It was a good base for sightseeing New York. The concierge doesn't have great local knowledge and generally wants to sell you trips in order for him to get commission, i would suspect! We booked a helicopter trip with him, which we are glad we did - as you need to reserve a place the day before and it was the same price if we'd booked it ourselves. We also booked a car to the airport with him-but this was a bit of rip off compared to the cost of the taxi from the airport. Paid $47 from the airport, plus tips, and the cab he books is $55 plus tips and also $5 for a toll bridge - which they don't tell you about. If you've got the time and aren't too tired would recommend you get the subway instead - much much cheaper! Location - only 3 blocks up from the subway, right opposite the north west side of central park. Recommend you get a day or week pass, as it's the best way to travel and it starts early, runs late and it's frequent. The doorman will probably try and sell you a red bus sightseeing tour - which we purchased, but it wasn't a great way to get around as the traffic is so busy, so wasn't great value for money - although nice to have a guided tour. Also there is a voucher for $5 off the tour (on the table of leaflets in reception) if you buy the tour yourself! Rooms - Beds comfortable, nice bathroom, and very clean - daily cleaning is good. The rooms are quite small, but you don't get much for your money in New York. If get a cheap deal like we did, then it's def worth the money. There is a TV and Air con, but no safe! Food - The cafe around the corner does great breakfasts and massive lunches. If you like seafood and want to eat local to the hotel - suggest you walk (or get the subway) to the national history museum and go 1 block over to the left onto Columbus Avenue- where you will find a raft of restaurants - would recommend Ocean Grill - 384 Columbus Avenue....great fish! Would also recommend Ruth and Chris's steak house - 148 West 51st Street.

The only compliant I have is that on the final day of our stay we left all our lugguge with reception so that they would hold it for the day. There were nine or ten bags and we got a ticket for each bag. A different door man (not the brazilian guy) took charge of them and was suitably tipped for his trouble. Later when our limo (which the brazilian doorman orgaised for us) arrived we handed in all the tickets and were given what we thought was all of the luggage. It wasn't until we reached JFK that we realised two of the bags were missing. Of course we should have double checked at the hotel that all bags were returned to us. We had to pay another sixty dollars to have the bags sent out to the airport. Maybe the not so helpful doorman could have used some of his tip for the fare?

Got used to the subway very quickly - get a 7-day pass for $24, head to the station on 103rd, down to Columbus Cirlce where you can change for pretty much anywhere else. We saw a couple of shows - The Producers and Chicago and would recommend both without hesitation. Bought tickets on the day from each box office with no problem. Good places to eat - the Broadway Diner just off Times Square for breakfast, John's Pizzeria (next to St James Theatre) and Bubba Gump's (Times Square again) and the Heartland, in the basement of the Empire State Building. Would recommend the Astor to anyone - one last bonus, we arrived late at night still on UK time so I was wide awake at 6am and got up before my girlfriend in the mornings... it was nice to be able to wander round Central Park, and just sit outside the hotel and watch the city wake up.

Although this hotel is a little out of the way, the Metro station is 3 blocks away and the trains run fairly regularly (we waited no more than 5 minutes) and we could always get on them, even in rush hour. This was a cheap way of getting around, costing $2 per trip, anywhere. A taxi from Central Park in rush hour, still only cost us $15. The rooms were small, but cleaned every day and the bed was really comfy - a must after all that walking! The bathroom was almost as big as the room and we had no problems with getting enough hot water or clean towels. They provided us with a clock radio, whcih was also a CD player and there was a TV in the room too. The downside to this hotel is the small rooms, no coffee making facilities in the room, although there is free coffee in the lobby and the view was non-existent, but I didn't go to New York to spend time in my hotel room!

We found it very comfortable, clean and excellent value for money. The staff were helpful and friendly. At the time of booking we asked for and got a room overlooking Central Park. The room was fine, far from luxury but more than adequate. Although the hotel is quite a way uptown it is very accesible by subway, the station is just 2 blocks away. But we mainly used the bus M10 that stopped right outside the hotel and takes you to the heart of mid-town Manhattan. A weekly ticket for unlimited use on buses and subway costs just $24. A cab from Times Square to the hotel costs $13. We actually enjoyed being a bit further away from the tourist areas. It felt more like staying in the real New York. Some parts of the surrounding area aren't that hot, but these are easily avoided. There is also plenty around the hotel worth seeing. Columbia University, the Cathedral of St John the Divine and Morningside Park are a short walk away. Also, if you're a Seinfeld fan you will want to visit Tom's restaurant which is near Columbia University on Broadway, about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Of course you can also visit it if you're not a Seinfeld fan and enjoy the excellent value food! The down points to the hotel were; - Blocked toilet (fairly common based on other reviews. My tip to avoid this is, um, to flush regulalry, little and often!!! - Over hot central heating (despite it being minus 10 outside)! But just put the aircon on to deal with that. - The whole hotel could do with re-carpetting. - Make sure you don't do as my wife did and use the local call number when phoning from the room using the very cheap phone cards. Use the freephone number. On some phone cards this is not that clear. We had to pay a $79 bill on checking out because of that.

(It started to become clear that it had been a good idea that I brought my own pillow). Although the room was prepaid, he insisted that I sign a form advising me that if the key was not returned there was a $150 charge. He gave us room 304, but looked at me like I was from another planet when I asked for a second key for my travel companion. The elevator was clean and brightly lit, but small. The hallways are done in a nice boutique style, but the building is old and the hallways narrow. Unlike newer properties where there is a buffer between your room and the hallway (usually a closet and bathroom), you have only the thin door between you and any noisy guests who arrive drunk late at night, early morning loud tourists, or maids calling 'Housekeeping' loudly at another room on your hall. The rooms are clean, the double or twin beds comfortable, the beds are French-sheeted (blanket topped with a sheet) as a bedspread would be difficult to stow in such a petite space. The Queen-sized synthetic pillows were probably the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel, and as a road warrior, I've seen the good, bad and jet-puffed...! Our request for an extra cotton blanket happily responded to with 2! Wall mounted night tables, good reading lamps, but the phones did not work for our first two nights there. A small closet unit housed the TV, and we were given two remotes for some reason...? If you can fit 7 hangers in the closet, youll be lucky. The apple green walls were calming, and the steam heat although hissing, whistling or chirping was effective. The window A/C would do OK in the summer, but no fresh air possible. The bathroom was redone in georgeous marble squares, but when installing the full mirror, they cracked the mirror where the light fixture was mounted. Nice amenities, and very fluffy towels. Some should be replaced due to stains obviously missed by a blind housekeeper who folded them and could not have missed it. 3 towels, 2 hand towels, a bath mat, but no face cloths, it seems. It had a good tub, but the grouting between the tiles has come out in some places, and the caulking of the tub has turned black in a few places and should be replaced. The handle for the shower faucet was either not installed properly, or has broken, the maid should have advised maintenance... Maids are friendly and usually do a very good job. The coffee and tea in the lower lobby is a nice touch, but bring your own creamers from the deli unless the powdered white stuff is to your taste.The CD clock radios described in the website were not in evidence, and the requested 4 am wakeup call came at 4:40 forcing us to cab it to the airport instead of taking the subway. Good value, no frills, OK location, popular with non US guests. No safe in room. Vending machines often out of order. Internet in basement available for an extra fee. 3 blocks to the C line subway and then a few stops to Columbus Circle, 10 minutes to Times Square.

We did get the yellow cab drivers number when he took us to the astor as we thought it be a good idea as taxi's are busiest in the night from 12-3 but we didn't get round to ringing him (my mates phone worked in the usa, but she was worried about the cost ) All in all i thought the taxis were the most expensive thing about the trip and the tipping drove me nuts as i despise giving away extra money for a job that a person is already getting paid for (although my friend saw it differently as she gets tips when working so understood iit) my advice on taxis; is maybe get a number of the yellow cab your in if he seams ok, tube it all the way around if possible sometimes its about 10 mins to wait for a train but there all usually okay and the tube goes on 24 hours, now be careful with 123 tubes as you can end up the opposite side of town like my friend and I, also past 110 street and ending up in north ot central park (if u do its RIGHT from the top of the steps (central park is opposite dont cut through there esp at night) and when you see a gas garage DO NOT turn right, TURN LEFT as that is the way to astor you should also see 110 subway station and then a corner shop on 107 street and astor should be after. we were miles away (well it felt like it) at one point and had to get a tax. we tried to get a yellow cab to take us to jfk but couldn't because it was 3;30pm and rush hour in nyc so busy time for yellow cabs hamed offeeered to get us a cab, as with mo the other guy i was weary, and basically told hamed straight that ive been told that taxi drivers add extra on the fare when they get to the airport we told jhim we had $60 dollars for the return trup which was true and KI told him i basically didnt want to get ripped off by a taxi driver, hammed got us a taxi in the end for $55 dollars inc tolls which are $4.60 ish, and the man we had was friendly, and got lost in jfk which was like a maze lol we gave him $60 anyhow cause at least he got us there even though our plane got delayed... lol Empire State building was visited about $20 if wanted to visit 102 floor - $15 if 86 floor ok *night is awesome with hardly a queue Natural History Museum $28 for two Liberty island Ferry $11 if you want to got up the top apparently need to be there 8am :S and that an extra charge Times Sq = amazing Toys r us has a ferris wheel inside for all those big kids out there Centrury 21 awesome department store, opposite World trade centre just don't get lost in there like in Macys which is on 36th street past toys r us footlocker kifc etc in time square you eill see it eventually its hugeeee The world trade centre has a lot of piics, wat annoyed me is people are selling photos outside and making money out of it Irish bar in a sidestreet of times square was nice :-) The cold... GET ALL YOUR WARMEST CLOTHES... it can be totally freezeing penguin stylee weather.. umm anything else you need to know just ask, i will deffo go back again it basic and good for money and good for being a base for nyc all of you going have fun and don't worry too much go with the flow", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "shell10", "ReviewID": "UR6710798", "Content": "My boyfriend and i stayed at astor on the park for 4 nights, my first visit to new york for my 30th birthday.

The bathroom was a very nice surprise, sparkling clean every day and larger than expected. The shower has plenty of hot water and housekeeping gives you those handy little bottles of shampoo/conditioner- nice ones too! There is free coffee/hot chocolate downstairs along with high speed internet- convenient but expensive at $1/ 5 minutes. The location is not especially scenic or exciting, but it was safe and only a few blocks from the subway. My biggest complaint is hands down, the loudest radiator in the entire universe. We didn't hear it at all the first two nights, but the third it was cold in the room and we got the handyman to turn on the heat. That night we awoke to this unbelievably annoying clanging of the pipes that didn't stop for 30 minutes. So obnoxious it was almost comical. When it happened the last night my friend fumbled around with it until he switch off the valve.

Initially I was rather apprehensive as to the hotel\u2019s quality as we generally only stay 5-star but as it was such a great deal we booked it regardless. And we were delighted with our find\u2026 The hotel is rather more basic than we are accustomed to, but is immaculately clean. We had booked a standard room but when we arrived, we asked for a room overlooking the park and were upgraded to a larger room (room 609). Space-wise it was fine \u2013 we had two large cases and had ample room for them. We had a super-king sized bed with a really firm mattress. Although it was the height of winter we had no need for the heating so did not encounter any noisy radiator problems people have mentioned in other reviews. The room had a wardrobe and enough shelf space for our things. The bathroom was a little on the small size but no worse than any central London hotel. The bath had lots of hot water at all times of the day and night. Twice we had minor problems with the shower and the staff sent a maintenance guy out to fix it within five minutes of our call. For me the plus was the cleanliness \u2013 it was spotless. At night the hotel was really quiet \u2013 the only downside is that being on the sixth floor, we couldn\u2019t open the windows so had to use the AC instead. The last night was a bit chilly so we asked for an extra blanket which again arrived within a few minutes. The location of the hotel is great too. One piece of advice \u2013 don\u2019t bother with taxis unless it\u2019s late at night \u2013 at $15 - $20 per journey downtown we thought we\u2019d just use the subway. If you\u2019re there for a week, get the $24 weekly pass or if you\u2019re there for less, a daily pass at $7 is good value or the $20 pass. We literally then travelled everywhere by subway \u2013 it took ten minutes to get wherever we wanted and at 110th street (the nearest subway station) there are several lines so you can get almost anywhere directly. The area is also absolutely fine \u2013 a few blocks further north and you\u2019re on the outskirts of Harlem which leaves a lot to be desired but where the hotel is located is fine. Streets are clean and much more peaceful than downtown. It\u2019s much more residential so gives you an insight into the real \u201cNew York\u201d beyond the glitz of the touristy areas On the corner of 110th street and central park west (a two-minute walk from the hotel) is a lovely little supermarket where we bought water and fruit for the room. Opposite it is the Saurin Parke Caf\u00e9 where we regularly ate breakfast (super fresh and good variety of food). If you carry on further up 100th street, is an AMAZING soul food restaurant (Miss Maude\u2019s Spoonbread Too). I\u2019d heard about this place before we left for NYC but had no idea it was only a five minute walk from the hotel \u2013 we are there twice (an enormous two course meal for two with drinks came to only $40). If you have a weary day and need to eat in the room, ask the hotel to order you Giovanni\u2019s pizza \u2013 they kindly rang up for us and we had what the menu described as being a \u201csmall\u201d pizza between us for only $14. When it arrived it was the size of a truck tyre and we could only manage half of it! The hotel has tea and coffee facilities downstairs and good internet access which was great for enabling us to check in online before we departed NYC. The hotel staff and exceptional and super efficient \u2013 whatever queries we had, they were really helpful. As for the lift, we had no problems \u2013 we found it worked best for us to walk down the six flights of stairs in the morning when a number of people were also leaving. Then when we came back to the hotel at night, the lift generally came immediately or was already waiting at the lobby. A major tip for you though \u2013 DON\u2019T USE THEIR PRIVATE TAXI SERVICE! A complete rip-off \u2013 before we arrived in NYC, I rang the hotel and asked for a transfer to the hotel as we were due to arrive at midnight on Xmas day \u2013 Mohammed, the concierge was happy to help but told me it would cost $90 plus tolls ($10) plus tips (15%). He implied that we would have to use this as it would be the cheapest option on a public holiday. As we have friends from NYC, we took their advice to just get a yellow cab at the airport and were relieved we did as the entire journey only came to $55. On the way back to the airport, we left the hotel at 4am and so stupidly asked the hotel to book us their private taxi service \u2013 the receptionist assured me it was good value at only $55 flat rate including tips and tolls. All was well until we got into the taxi and when we were half way to the airport, the taxi driver told us the hotel was wrong \u2013 the rate would be $55 plus tolls plus tips, PLUS double fare for it being so early in the morning. As we had plenty of time, we insisted that he took us back to the hotel as we were not going to get ripped off. He took us back on the longest route perhaps hoping we\u2019d miss our flight. Back at the hotel, we then flagged a yellow taxi in the street (surprisingly there were plenty so early in the morning) and it cost us only $45 flat rate and got us there with enough time. The key question, would I go back to the hotel? If we\u2019re in New York for another week to ten days, then definitely. If it\u2019s for a short trip, then maybe one of the swankier hotels downtown would be worth a try.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwickshire", "Title": "\u201cA great base while staying in New York\u201d", "Author": "Saff-O", "ReviewID": "UR6551390", "Content": "I booked my stay at the Astor via the Opodo website where it came up as recommended by them.

The bathroom was relatively new and everything in the room seemed in good condition.

Staff at the Astor were extremely helpful, contrary to some of the other reviews I have read, especially Mohammed who ensured our luggage was safe after check out until our evening flight so we could make the most of our last day, he also advised us on what time we should be leaving for the airport and ensured a private car was ready to take us. It's true you could book excursions through him, but why get so offended at him asking if you were interested like some reviewers seem to have?? We said no thanks and he remained equally friendly and helpful for the remainder of our stay. All in all, it's a cute little hotel at a great price, not central location but hassle free travel to midtown. I've stayed at much worse bigger hotels in NY at higher room rates.

The hotel is opposite central park which is also a bonus and we had an oblique park view also taking in the Empire State which was realy good. Bad points were that the lift is slow, although this was more quirky and amusing than irritating, our hot water cut out at one point but the staff quickly fixed it and I was once accosted by a very mild beggar outside the hotel but he went away when asked politely so hardly a major issue. The staff also tried to plug taxis quite a bit which was annoying seeing as the subway is very close and can take you pretty much anywhere on Manhattan.

I am aware reviews can be personalised and may not reflect a very universal opinion, and experiences can be different for whatever reason. There a a few aspects about this hotel though that i can assure will be to everyone's satisfaction (unless you are a handful of these strange regular hotel-goers who expect the earth). Firstly the staff are great. Very friendly, helpful and courteous. I arranged a few things with the hotel including the classic new york sightseeing tour and transportation back to JFK airport. Secondly, the place is very presentable. Rooms are cleaned once a day from what i could make out and the whole place looks quite modern and well kept, certainly nice enough for me. This could be a matter of debate, but i thought the location was rather good. Upper west-side offers a trendy, quiet and tidy alternative to the beating heart of new york (midtown). The subway at 103th st, numerous cabs and buses means transport was EASY to anywhere. Our room over-looked central park (which was a bit of a bonus) and there was very little traffic at night. Buses were about the only thing that could wake you up (apart from the radiator which i will move on to in a bit). After reading some reviews before my trip i will attempt to challenge/expel some of the negative comments i read. Firstly, the lift is not that slow (and even if it is, who cares its a lift!). The location according to some people is way too far away from the action, in response to that i will say you are experiencing more of new york by staying in a residential area, and as pointed out earlier it is accessable and easy to get around. Granted the hotel is close to harlem, but where harlem ends upper west-side begins. Also, a lot of NYC including harlem has cleaned up its act, though saying that it is still prudent and general common sense to know where your going at night. Staying at the Astor every night felt completely safe. The radiator in our room did make a noise one night and it is loud. i woke up disorientated thinking it might be construction workers outside the noise was that unusual, but like i said it was once and didnt last long. There is an odd way of working the shower, but once i mastered that i had a hot shower every morning. Reception does actually tell you how to work the shower when you check-in, as well as a diagram on the front desk (so dont be stupid like me and just pull down on the bottom of the bath tap)! Room temperature was fine, no problems there. No safety deposit box, but then again no apparent risk of personal items being stolen as long as they are kept away. Even though you do have to check-out at 12 and you have a much later flight, the staff will gladly keep hold of your bags till then and organise hassle-free transport back to JFK, which was $50. Flat rate in a cab to the airport is $5 less but i believe you have to pay the toll fee (whatever that is)?

However, we were pleasantly surprised. This may not be the best hotel in the world but for what you pay, I think you get a reasonably good deal. The hotel is situated on the West side of Central Park in upper Manhattan, in an area that is a little insalubrious at night. However, we had no problems and even coming home late at night, everything was very quiet and we never felt afraid. The hotel, has the normal features - a lobby, reception, a bellboy/man, a basement area where you can access the internet, get complimentary tea and coffee from a machine and go to the toilet. Our room was satisfactory. It was clean, provided a tv with many channels, a cupboard for storing clothes, one bedside table, an ensuite bathroom which was clean and all the utilities worked well. The few negative comments that I can make about this hotel are as followsl; The room got quite cold as we were there in November and we had to request an extra blanket as they only provided several sheets for the bed. Our cupboard door came off the hinge and we had to request someone to come and fix it. There is only one lift in the whole hotel and although the hotel is not huge, the one lift can take a long time if there are a lot of guests using it. The views from our room were not very spectacular. We just had a view of grey rooftops which wasn't very inspiring to wake up to on a grey November morning. The hotel staff were not always as helpful as they could be. We found New Yorkers to be the friendliest, most helpful people, but the hotel staff (many of whom were not from the USA) were often quite rude or unhelpful. That's about it.

I had booked the hotel before reading the reviews on here and when I did, I actually thought about cancelling. Thankfully I didn't. I could not fault this hotel, nor could my three friends. It was ideal in everyway. Four girls on a shopping Trip to New York, we stayed in a two double bed room (room 601) - Yes it was small, but that was the only issue with the room and besides, we only planned to sleep there!! The room had two double beds, which were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was perfect; shower/bath/toilet/washbasin/hairdryer, fresh towels everyday and little shampoo/body wash bottles. An Iron is available on request and they left it with us for the duration of our stay. We got a room at the back of the hotel, so it was really quiet. We had four great nights sleep after our busy days shopping. The staff were very friendly. Any request we had was always answered in a helpful way. The only gripe I do have is that we were encouraged to get Taxi\u2019s after asking if the Subway would get us to certain places. Turns out in some cases we didn\u2019t need the Taxi and could have hopped on the Subway, we were a little annoyed at this. So, maybe try to figure this out yourself ! This might be the only downside of the hotel, it is a little far away from everything, but if you don\u2019t mind walking or getting the Sub, then you\u2019ll be fine here. By the way, the Sub is on 110th street (about 3 streets away, a 3 minute walk) We generally tended to walk wherever we were going and get the Sub or Taxi back (lots of shopping bags) Down in the basement the hotel has a sit down area with tea/coffee making facilities, a vending machine with drinks and sweets. It also has two computers with high-speed access to the internet (which came in very handy when we had to order stuff online which the hotel staff signed for on our behalf while we were out). The cost is $1 for 5 minutes. There is also a printer available. An ATM machine is right next to the computers. There is also a toilet in the basement. If you want ICE, then this is were you also go to get it. You'll have to ask for it as it's in the door marked \"employees\" we had to open the door and ask for it though as they couldn't hear us while they were doing laundry. Lastly, Central park is right on your doorstep. If you walk up to 110th street then over to the east side of Central Park you\u2019ll happen upon the bigger of the two ice rinks! And yes the dreaded lift was slow, but you know, walk up the stairs if you have no bags and you are capable !!

I stayed at this hotel for eight nights in June, and thought it was great for the most part. Some of the negative comments, it seems to me, may be coming from people who have never stayed in hotels in New York--nearly all hotels in New York are small (and, honestly, I didn't think my room was particularly small). The most important thing for me in a hotel is cleanliness--and this hotel was certainly clean. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was excellent (again, compared to other hotels in New York where I have stayed) The A/C was a window unit, and yes it was a little noisy (as those units tend to be), but I was actually appreciative because it helped block out some of the street noise on Central Park West (another common problem in New York). This is a three-star property, and as such one shouldn't be surprised not to find particular services (e.g., room service, traveller's check cashing, etc.)--indeed, many if not most three-star properties don't offer these types of services! But hey, this is New York City--it's not all that hard to find something to eat 24/7. For me, the location was a bit of a problem, but I can see how it would be wonderful for some people. It is right on the upper west corner of Central Park--and the park is definitely lovely for a morning walk, or for people watching during the day. For me, most of the things I wanted to do were in the West Village or Midtown. Subways are great during the day, but you may have to wait a bit when they switch to late night service at 11:00 p.m. (which means that if you are at the theatre it may take a little longer to get back). I knew this going in, but couldn't pass up the amazing rate that I found online ($87/night for a hotel in Manhattan!). As a frequent traveller to New York, though, it was a pleasant surprise to find out some things about a part of town that I had never visited (do walk by the Dakota on CPW and 72nd Street where Rosemary spawned her devil baby, and where John Lennon was shot). Another possible negative is that the elevator can be a little slow in the mornings--especially when the housekeepers start using it. Again, having stayed at properties in New York with no elevator, I just rolled with it. All in all, this was a great experience, and I was a little nervous given the rate (and some of the bad reviews that I had read here). I also wanted to say that I was actually in New York for a week before for a seminar where my accomodations were provided. Because of this, I had made several reservations, and then visited all of the properties to see what I wanted to do. Astor was, by far, the least expensive (I also had reservations at the Hotel Pennsylvania, the Ramada New Yorker, and a real dive--the Chelsea Star--all of which were twice the price as Astor) and by far the nicest of the lot.

At the time, the average going rate for a decent hotel in Manhattan was at least $250, so we decided to save some money and chance it. What I can tell you is you get what you pay for. We booked the stay online and got confirmation of a room with 2 double beds. When we arrived, we were forced in to a room with just 1 double bed, as the receptionist said they were overbooked. So we decided to camp up in the unacceptably small room on the 7th floor (for 3 people) while we worked on getting the room we were actually confirmed for (ended up being Room 702). The doorman was very nice in bringing our luggage up to the room and ended up helping us get the room we needed with 2 double beds. The pictures on the hotel's website display a simple modernity within very small rooms, which is an accurate portrayal of what the rooms were really like. They were clean and livable, and the bathroom exceeded my expectations (e.g. no hair, no rust). Towels were freshly laundered. There was even a tv, which I didn't see from the website photos, although the reception wasn't great. Bring a few cds with you, as the cd player was a nice touch for a budget hotel such as this. What the hotel didn't have that would have been nice (I suppose they could be considered luxuries) is a concierge service and water. I needed the phone number to a Tribeca restaurant and didn't want to spend the money to use the internet in the basement downstairs, so I called the front desk and never got a call back. We were also very thirsty in the middle of the night, but there was no water in the hotel (the vending machines only have juice and soda). But there is a very cute mom+pop convenience shop down the street at 107th that makes great sandwiches and has all the goods you'd need for a snack. Also, the elevator is very small, which means it may take a while for it to arrive on your floor, and exepct crowding with people and their luggage on your trips up and down. I read on other reviews here that several people also experienced the overbooking dilemma that I did, so be prepared for the worst. We checked in at 5:30pm, went up to the room to freshen up and then came back down to the lobby at 7pm, and the lobby was jampacked with travelers just arriving and waiting for their room assignments. Location also wasn't great if you want to head in to the main part of the city and the Lower East Side and such - a cab ride could cost upwards of $20 and it seemed like many drivers were reluctant to drive so far north on Central Park West. We hailed cabs in the evening for our dressy nights out when we didn't want to take the subway, but during the day the subway was closeby (just 2 blockst away) and convenient, although the weekend schedule was limited and it took 30 minutes to get down to Soho and beyond (which seemed long when you were trying to squeeze in a lot of activities before catching the early evening bus back to DC). In short, I've stayed in much posher hotels than this with far better service, so Astor on the Park pales in comparison, but for the money, it wasn't a bad value.

Rooms and bathrooms very clean and there was no traffic noise from outside. No problems with noisy pipes either. Hotel is ideally located for Central Park - directly opposite. It is about five minutes walk from subway and then about six stops downtown.

So, clearly she already knew about the problem but despite there are other live-able rooms available, she chose to give me that room. It is until she was off and I spoke to the night time staff that they are able to change my room, to Room 1004, which turned out to be a perfectly fine room without any pipes problems.

On the first night, it seemed like they were all coming true! The whistling radiators, nowhere nearby to eat! But then after a good night's sleep (the beds are clean and comfortable) and a shower (the showers are really nice here!) i felt much better and then set about exploring NYC. And it's then you realise that the Astor is an ok place to stay. Once you learn how to use the subway and explore the city, the Astor becomes a really nice base. There are two decent cafes two streets behind the hotel, there is a grocery store nearby and of course, the hotel is right opposite the park, which is lovely in the mornings! But most of my trip, i found i was in central New York rather than in Central Park West (the location of the hotel) as it is a residential area and all the sights and the main attractions are further downtown - so much so, you'll hardly want to stay in the hotel area! You do get used to the noise and the rooms are clean, and towels good. I would say if you are expecting a hotel with breakfast, and extras to hand, the Astor is not for you. However, if you already know New York well and just want to enjoy the city and just need a simple base to rest, or you are prepared to find your own way and need a good starting point, the Astor is fine! One tip - if you do use the subway to get to the hotel, go to 103rd street and catch the 'C' train which is local and nearer the hotel rather than 'A' which is express and will land you up on 126th (which is what happened to us and we had to walk all those blocks back up!)", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cwhistling radiators!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4580118", "Content": "we stayed at the astor for 4 nights in october because there was literally nowhere else with rooms in the whole city. there was absolutely no amenities within the hotel, and the room we had was very small but i found it clean enough. one problem was that you cannot control the central heating which is constantly on all night. every half an hour or so, the radiator goes a bit mental and starts whistling and hissing, loud enough to wake you up! because of this we tried to open the window in the room and the hall outside...which promptly fell out! needless to say i didnt let them know about this, but even after 2 days, they hadnt noticed and the window was just left lying on the corridor floor! the hotel is pretty poor, and is a it in the arse end of nowhere, but we didnt want to do the touristy things anyway, and set about touring the bars and restaurants of the upper west side and harlem which we found really cool and full of locals rather than tourists.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOkay for money if less noise!\u201d", "Author": "Linda33glasgow", "ReviewID": "UR4578707", "Content": "We payed a reasonable amount for a week's stay.But no amount could make up for the continuing banging through the night.As we went in February which is cold the heating was on which makes a noise like someone in the toliet hitting the pipes with a hammer.After four nights of none sleep we had to ask for a change of room,which they did with no complaints.After this our holiday began.There is clean towels every day the rooms are reasonably clean.BEDS ARE CLEAN.The subway is near,the staff are helpful,coffee and tea downstairs is free,you can ask for a heater if you are cold,there is plenty hot running water.I myself have read some of the other reviews and notice people saying there is no near shops but if some people are willing to explore two blocks behind the hotel has loads of shops that my husband and I walked to most nights for something to eat.So if you don't mind being a little out of the buzz and for the money and right room the hotel is worth the money.

If you've never been to NYC you really should choose a hotel closer to the action. Spend the extra cash and enjoy your hotel. This one leaves a LOT to be desired, so is hardly worth the inconvenience of the location. We booked the Astor after reading about it here. We requested a room overlooking the park as suggested. Our first night they didn't have one, and they moved us the next day. We should have stayed on the inside. The heat was broken in the room - we had to keep the windows open and the noise outside was unbelievable - not just traffic, but people yelling outside all night. Noise INSIDE the hotel was just as bad. The radiators banged and there was a drilling noise for a lot of one evening. If you're a light sleeper, don't expect much peace here. The walls are paper thin to the hallways and the adjoining rooms. And since it's a discount hotel, expect a lot of younger hotel guests. We could not get ahold of anyone at the front desk - ever. We couldn't get a wake up call, or someone to explain to us how to set our in-room alarm clock. We couldn't get them to deal with the noises. We couldn't get them to fix the radiator. We couldn't get them to fix the television. (We were exhausted one night and just wanted a night in, but no dice - the tv didn't work and the room was a noisy sauna) We couldn't get anyone on the phone for anything. The staff mill about like they are college students in between classes. They gossip amongst each other and complain about the other employees. Loudly, while they're ignoring you. They don't know where anything in New York is. Only a couple actually spoke english. It's difficult to get directions to the drink machine, never mind directions to Times Square. The staff are very unprofessional, and we were hassled non-stop by the doorman - different ones, when we could find one - to book their in-house limo to the airport. It's the only thing they cared about. We eventually DID use their limo, and by the time we got to JFK I was ready to boot. The smell, the lack of suspension and the chaotic driving all made it a ride from hell. You can book a car service for free from the internet terminals downstairs - I highly recommend skipping their car service. Housekeeping was great. Our room was always immaculate, the towels were nice and the bathrooms were spotless. The linens were also of a good quality, the beds were quite comfortable. Nothing went missing, and we tipped them at the end of the stay. If you're low maintenance, this may be a good bet for you. If you expect any kind of customer service from your hotel, don't book the Astor. The subway is a quick walk from the Astor, although I wouldn't want to do it at night alone. There were shady characters loitering about the subway entrance quite often. One night the man across from us was going through a womans purse and discarding things from it. A cab is about 10 dollars to times square. There are great restaurants starting in the w90s, but you have to go up a block - there's nothing but residential almost all the way of the park, not even a starbucks. You can get coffee, sodas and internet access in the basement. There is a store not far from there, but there is NOWHERE to eat for blocks and blocks.

The concierge did help us with our bags though. They also decided to start banging holes in the wall half way through our stay which wasn't great, it left the place in a bit of mess. Be warned of the groups of American teenagers who might stay and shout 'drink, drink, drink' through the night. I would stay somewhere else next time so I could be more central, although its easy enough to get the subway. Oh and the maid did throw away a bag with food in that I'd bought.

The bathroom was really nice, new and clean, our room (1001) was a good size with views over Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the balcony and the staff were also very friendly. There is a subway station at 103 street about three blocks away and about five/six stops takes you to Times Square, although this maybe isn't ideal for people on a shorter break than us as we did get fed up of the trek back to the hotel to get changed before going out at night. I don't want to make this seem a bad review but some things to be aware of: the lift - is a bit scary and woke me up at night every time the doors shut. It broke on our last day and we had to walk up and down to the tenth floor although fortunately the staff helped us with our cases! Don't take your own towels as these might end up in the hotel laundry like ours did by mistake (their's are good anyway).
