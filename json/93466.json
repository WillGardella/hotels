Through Orbitz, we paid approx $40 to $50 extra for a \"high floor\" room. However, at Check-In, we were given a \"low floor\" room. After realizing the room was wrong, I verified that it was \"low-floor\", questioned the night manager about it, and was immediately told by him that \"the rooms on the higher floors aren't any bigger.\" When told that we selected the high floor room to reduce the street noise, he said \"I could give you a room on a higher floor, but then you would complain about the construction noise.\" So we stayed in the low floor room that night and the remainder of the trip. I called Orbitz the next day to get a refund for the difference in room quality, they were no help and \"negotiated\" with the hotel to get us a high floor room. Because we were settled in the room and busy vacationing in NYC, we did not change, and of course never received a refund. Upon Check-Out, I discussed the matter with a desk clerk named Venus, who immediately said \"the rooms on the higher floors aren't any bigger,\" so that must be the hotel's standard reply to any complaint about a low-floor room. Venus agreed that we should be refunded the difference for at least the first night, took great delight in saying that the high floor room to which we did not change was given as a free upgrade to someone else, and would call me back about the first night refund later that day. Well Venus, three months later I'm still waiting for your call. As I expected, no money was ever refunded, so we were cheated by Hilton Hotels, a $Billion corporation and Orbitz for about $250. As for the accommodations, the room itself was tired, worn, ancient, and small. I've stayed at Holiday Inn Express that were nicer.

I love this location when I stay in NYC. So, the location is great, if not pricey, normally. The property is in a great location. The service, too, was great. From check-in, to all services, staff were attentive and caring. Now the awful part: Yikes! This property is in need of a make-over. And they were working on it, too! That was part of the awful part. At two minutes to 9:00 AM, the walls started vibrating and kept vibrating. I was on the 9th floor and they were doing construction on 17th floor and above, but it was very loud. Sounded like it was coming from the next room. When I called to complain that it woke us up (it WAS supposed to be a vacation morning), they offered us earplugs. Really? That was what the \"careline\" was offering as a caring gesture? It was an odd stay, for certain. The fire alarm had gone off the day before and when I called about it, concerned, they were just interested in getting it shut off. (you mean no one was worried there was a fire?). I haven't read the reviews here about the property, so if I am being redundant, I apologize. The paint is peeling from the ceiling and walls - I think because there is no ventilation system in the bathroom. After both of us had showered, the room held so much humidity, it was necessary to open the door to the hall to get air in. The windows didn't seem to open. The heating/cooling system worked fine for my comfort, with the exception of this. The privacy lock was broken on my door. There were paint specks all over the floor and walls of the bathroom. The towel bar was not hung, though the holes were there to hang it. With all of that said, it was very clean and well kept. Sheets and bedding were very comfortable with nice pillows. The safe worked. The water pressure was good and hot water was plentiful. Good towel quality. No robes. But a good working hair dryer and shampoo products. (my daughter did mention that everyone in the elevator smelled the same from the personal care products.) We were not facing the street so it was quieter than it would have been with the street noise in a room on the opposite side. However, no view whatsoever and the building next door looks right in to the room. Again, nice window treatments to address this. The room size was comfortable because we ended up getting a double even though I had reserved a queen. It was spacious for New York City. Getting our boarding passes printed was very easy in the lobby area and the gift shop was well stocked. I am sure once this property is updated by Hilton (they just took it over a year ago?) two things will occur: one it will be to Hilton quality standards across the board and two, the prices will skyrocket. For now, for a good rate, it is worth it, if like on most NYC trips, you are only going to be in the room to sleep. My one regret: I bought the room as part of a Jet Blue package and the rate was the same as the hotel offered, but I did not get my points for staying there as a Hilton Honors member. I would not ever do this again. The travel service lied to me and told me to just give my honors number upon arrival. Jet Blue has a deceptive service provider. I had a few problems with inconsistencies in email confirmations, pricing and service fees. They made me nervous and in the future, I will book the room directly myself.

We have tried a number of midtown hotels but this one ranks the best to us and is reasonable in price and we stopped searching around for better alternatives. We have stayed here about ten times in total. What is especially good is the location. Right by the subway as well as easy walking distance to most things in midtown. The rooms are clean (I always check my hotel rooms with a flashlight for bugs) but one of these years could use a little updating. The bathrooms are tiny. The beds are comfortable and the sleep quality is good. The check in staff are hit or miss, mostly friendly but sometimes could care less. What prompted me to write a review here is is that they have a parking garage which we use which unfortunately does not take good care of your car. Two stays ago the bumper got scratched by the cement wall they parked it against and this time the passenger side mirror had a one inch scratch (apparently because they do not take the time to adjust the mirrors by the interior controls and instead force them by hand to save time and the attendant must have worn a sharp ring). There were also sneaker prints on the bumpers, they must really park the cars very close and they need to climb over them. Frustrating, they would not own up to the fact of damaging my mirror telling me it happened elsewhere and after a few minute debate the manager basically told us to get the car out of the driveway and then walked away from us. I'm considering filling a report with the NYC consumer affairs which likely will be a waste of time and really don't know where to park my car next time I come into the city and honestly might be in the market for a better hotel again because of this.

It was certainly not what have come to expect from the Hilton family. Although the location was excellent (only a short walk from many of New York's major attractions), the room was small, the heating was up too high with no way to adjust the thermostat, and worst of all, all of the water sources in the room released brown water with a pungent odour - this in a city renowned for the quality of its tap water! I called the \"Careline\" and was told an engineer was being sent to the room, but no engineer ever came. I was eventually able to get clean water myself by running the taps for about fifteen minutes. Hilton HHonors Gold members should also be wary of this hotel. It took a considerable amount of effort - several phone calls both to front desk and HHonors, and two physical visits downstairs - to receive the free breakfast to which Gold members are entitled. I was given several stories by staff as to why I was not entitled to a free breakfast, including that Hilton has stopped offering breakfast to Gold members, or that this hotel is a franchise that has opted out of the breakfast benefit for Golds. I confirmed with Hilton HHonors that neither of these excuses are true. Eventually I was told by the Duty Manager that the Executive Lounge (where breakfast is usually taken) was closed due to the renovations that commenced two days before my stay, but that I was able to take my free breakfast in the hotel restaurant instead. This was all well and good, but I have since found out that other HHonors members have been in the Executive Lounge on and after the date of my stay - so this was a lie as well!

My husband and I traveled to NYC (my first time) last week for 5 days for my birthday. We were greeted by a beautiful lobby and a friendly front desk staff. One of the major downfalls was that the room left a lot to be desired. While I didn't mind the size (we had a King deluxe which was actually larger than I expected for NYC standards), the room was very dingy. Everything seemed clean enough, but a little undone. There was wallpaper coming off the walls, bathroom hardware wasn't completely attached, only the heat was turned on so we couldn't cool off our hot room, etc (we were later advised by the front desk staff that we could open our window to let a little cool air in to cool it off). I recognize that the hotel is about to be renovated and that's probably why small things have not been fixed. But is that really an excuse? Seems like guests who are staying there before the renovation are being punished for not booking their stay after the renovation. Another major disappointment was the concierge staff. Each time we called concierge to ask a question (i.e. info on cabs, or recommendations for dinner) they didn't answer. We even left voice messages for them and they never returned our call. We wound up having to call the front desk staff (who, again, were super friendly) for information. One night, around 8pm, we walked down to the concierge desk (because we couldn't get them on the phone) to ask for dinner recommendations. It was my birthday and we wanted to go somewhere fun but had a hard time choosing based on what we could find online. To our surprise (again, this was about 8pm), the concierge desk was closed. Who closes their concierge desk before 8pm on a Saturday? Seems like you should know people are going to be asking for dinner recommendations. Isn't that a huge portion of what concierge staff do? Positives: friendly front desk staff, great location (you are literally 4-5 blocks from Rockefeller Center), a major subway (the 6) is next door, the Cafe Metro next door was really good, inexpensive, and stayed open until 11pm in case you needed an after dinner snack.

No restaurant on property, except a banquet room in next area that served a decent breakfast buffet. Staff was attentive and polite, but noticed with other guests, were more removed.

I had other charges that I paid for other than the room and tax. However, a month later, the charge shows up on my credit card.

Very clean although not sure towels were changed much during our 5 night stay. Huge TV which showed every wrinkle on the breakfast presenters faces!!! Didnt eat in the hotel so cannot comment on food. although service charge on a bottle of wine we drank there was horrendous..

The reservation for our room was made by some friends from California who were coming East to visit us and then stay a couple of nights in the city before going home. Our friends made the reservations long in advance and chose a non-refundable rate of $379 plus tax ($404 per night total with tax). Unfortunately, a few weeks before their trip the wife injured her back and had to have surgery. They could not use the reservation and transferred the name on the reservation to ours. So the room was \"free\" to us. We had no trouble checking in and we were told they had upgraded our room to a \"king room\". Also, when we were checking in, I thought i recognized the building and the location and asked if this was formerly the Summit Hotel. The answer was yes. I first stayed in this hotel in 1971, 40+ years ago. When we got to our room we were somewhat shocked at the small size and the furnishings. The room was small and all of the furniture except the bed, flat panel TV and the toilet was the orginal blonde furniture for 40 years ago. When i put my computer on the \"desk\" and sat in the chair to use it, there was no room for my wife to walk between the bed and desk. There was only one small sitting chair and no ottoman. The rooms are also a bit noisy, since the hotel is right across 51st Street from a police precint and a large fire house (engine and ladder companies). The hotel must know this, since they leave earplugs on the night stand. We did have a nice continental breakfast in their dining room in the mornings. The food was good, albeit, a bit pricey, but that is NYC. My advice would be, unless you absolutely need to be on the East Side, I would choose the Doubletree in Times Sqaure. It is closer to more restaurants and the theaters, but further from the shopping. The rooms are nicer. We were there on 9/11/2001 and have stayed several times since.

We made reservations on line, and called prior to our stay to see if we could get an early check-in as we were going to be arriving around 10am. I was told that they would try to accommodate this, but there was no guarantee. (I later found out at check-in that there is a guarantee: you can pay for the night before and not stay there. Seriously?) When we were actually checking-in, we again requested the early check-in, and were told they would do their best and call us when the room became available, but regular check-in time was 3pm. We left our bags (at $2/bag) at the bag drop-off and headed out for some retail therapy. We got the call at 3:15 that our room was ready and we could NOW check-in. We were still shopping miles away, and didn't actually get back to the hotel until 7pm. Upon arrival in our room, upon initial glance, it appeared clean, but then we noticed an empty bottle of water and opened earplugs on the nightstand. There was also a hand-written note on the desk. This just made us question whether the room was actually cleaned and whether or not they changed the sheets, for example, or did they think the same people who were there prior to us were coming back. We called the front desk and they apologized and told us they would change our rooms and someone would be up with a key. Twenty minutes later, they dropped off the key and we hauled our luggage do a different floor only to open the room and see AN UNMADE BED AND DIRTY TOWELS ON THE FLOOR IN THE BATHROOM!!! We called down to the front desk AGAIN and were told again that they were sorry and they would change our rooms again. The manager brought us our key and told us she had \"upgraded\" us for our trouble and had personally checked the room prior to bringing us the key. We finally got to our room at 7:45 trying to make an 8:30 dinner reservation. The room was clean, but we noticed no upgrade (unless the 19th floor is considered an upgrade). The next night, we made reservations to go to The Top of The Rock from our room from an iPad, and were prompted to print our tickets. Again, the staff was incredibly unhelpful and told me to go to the computer center and I could print them. The iPad couldn't connect to their printer, so I went to the front desk, where they told me there were instructions in my room on how to print from my own device. When I asked if they had a copy of said instructions so I didn't have to go back up to my room and then back down to the front to retrieve my printed documents, they seemed very put-out (this was 11pm and there was NOBODY in the lobby). They finally produced the piece of paper and I spent a few minutes trying to get their instructions to work. When I had questions, they pretended they didn't hear me or said they didn't know how it worked. In the end, I figured out (on my own) that I could email myself the link to the tickets and open my email on one of their computers in the computer center and print them out.

I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell and was NOT interested in anything musty or moldy. However, I didn't recognize either. Early check-in is almost always difficult in the city. This property is happy to store your bags for $1/each and will give you a call if your room happens to come available earlier than 3pm. Received a call around 11am. Perfect timing after having breakfast at a nearby cafe. No additional charges for early check in. If you're driving into the city, find your own parking, don't rely on valet (which is all the hotel offers). They can't be held responsible for damages to your car. I had a rental and valet wrapped it around a curb that cracked half of the hubcap off. Hotels generally contract valet and parking attendants from nearby parking garages. They're careless, so just do it yourself. I normally do but with a parade going on, parking was extremely limited. Other than the valet situation, it was an overall pleasant stay. Really surprised by the rate considering the hotel's location in the city and the quality.

Great location. There is a subway staion outside the hotel as well in case you need it. This hotel is an easy 20 minute yellow cab taxi ($28 + tip) from LGA airport, and all around, very convenient. A negative would be that at 1pm, our room was not ready for check in, and although we only travelled with a carry on each, we had to pay to check the bags for an hour while we went to eat something while they were finishing the rooms. We also had to pay when we picked them up. The concierge said $1.00 each bag at drop off and $1.00 per bag at pick up. When I went to do this, the man taking the bags wanted double until i called him on it...I told him what concierge told me the price was and then he said \"I guess I'll split the difference then.\". I reported the price discrepency to the same concierege, and he didn't seem suprised or to care. Little dod these people know that I have spent a lot of time in new York, and I am not a chump. I have to wonder if he would have done the same to a man??? Anyway, other than that, ther is no free wifi in the rooms (it is $14.95 per 24 hour period), and the lobby was to smoky smelling for me to use the free wifi there.

It was a non-smoking double, and had plenty of room. No fridge in the rooms, but the beds were comfortable, the tv was good, and there was a safety deposit box. The beds were comfortable as well. the bathrooms were on the small side, but had full tub and good water pressure shower. Lots of towels and soaps and a hair dryer that worked fine.

I was set to stay at the hotel for two nights while on business. The front-desk staff was fine. There were hotel staff that met me in the lobby that made sure I got to the front-desk and checked-in. After I got my room key, I did get a nice warm chocolate chip cookie. The check-in process was fine. The hotel is dated and worn. The elevator floors were dirty, the carpet on each floor is dark (seems new) and the wallpaper is old. Upon entering the room... WOW, what a smell. Smelled like an old basement.. Extremely musty!!! The room was damp.. The sheets on the bed were damp, to the point that it felt almost wet. Although the days I visited NY was the hotest and humid in July... There is no reason why the room was so damp. I turned on the AC figuring the room just needed to get cool to act as a dehumidifier. I left and had dinner and walked around New York for 3 hours. When I returned.. the room was still very smelly with the must and the room was just as damp as when I left but now it was also cold. My view overlooked an adjacent apartment building. Not the best view so I just shut the shades. I called and complained about the room but they front desk said they were all booked. No rooms to be had. When I told her the room had a very bad odor. She quickly said, we can send someone up to spray. I told her no as the problem was the bathroom and it would take more than spray to fix this. I turned on the TV and the sound did not work. I turned the volume all the way up and still no sound. I called for a tech, and literally, 5 minutes before he arrived, the sound kicked in. When the tech arrived, I told him the TV now works and asked if he smelled the bad odor.. He said not really.. He is either very use to the smell or lying. There is no way he could not smell the room. The bathroom was very old and there was a slimy film on the sink. I had to use a towel to clean it. The tub and shower are very old and the ceiling was peeling. Bathroom had so many chips chips and marks, I actually thought they were bugs when I had my glasses off. I then checked Tripadvisor.com to see if other people had complained. An YES, almost everything listed in the Terrible/Bad sections was exactly what I was experiencing. I read about bed bugs and quickly check my room and bed for bugs. I did not see any, no signs of any and thank god, that was clean. I had a bad night sleeping at the smell started to make me sick and the cold damp room made me actually wake up shivering. Before I went to bed, I called the front desk and told them I will not be staying a second night. No way in hell! I checked out at 5:00 AM, went and changed my train tickets and left a day early than planned due to the room. I then sat outside my office building for three hours waiting for the staff to arrive rather than having to spend one more sicking minute in the room . Horrible, horrible and horrible. If you like rooms that are cold, damp and VERY, VERY smelly like and old basement where water has been sitting for years, then this is the hotel for you. The staff was fine although the front-desk person responded to my complaint without missing a breath so that leads me to believe they hear about the musty smell all the time. There was no surprise in her voice. Message to Hilton... Get your act together. Too many hotels in NYC to have to put up with that crap. A formal complaint will be going to Hilton corporate and you just lost a business account.

My handicap accessible room on the 6th floor with a king bed was a little on the small side for hotels in this class for NYC, but still acceptable for up to 2 people. Although somewhat showing its age with some minor wear, the room was well-maintained and clean.

Room Service promptly delivered a requested pot of hot water for $1.50+gratuity adding insult to this unacceptable lack of what should be a basic amenity in a hotel of this class. Also on the subject of hot water, in the mornings, my showers were hot with good pressure, although in the evenings, the water temperature dropped off somewhat, and while still warm, did not compare to the mornings.

The 4,5,6, and E trains are all within close proximity, and therefore, the rest of the city is accessible. -Efficient staff. No, they're not particularly friendly, but they weren't rude either.

Um, no. -Tiny bathrooms. I don't need a gigantic bathroom, but I couldn't open the door all the way without hitting the toilet. -I'm pretty sure that I specified a non-smoking room, but I ended up in a smoking one.

With the exception of a very friendly, polite, and professional staff, this hotel was the worst!!! We thought we would stay here and couldn't go wrong because of the location and the other luxury hotels that are on the same block (the \"W\" and The Marriott). Boy were we wrong. For starters our room was not ready when we checked in that evening (around 7:45pm). When we finally checked into our room, the room was very small, old and dated. The door still had a chain on it for security. Our air conditioner was not working properly, which meant it was hot and we baked in our room the first night. When we alerted the hotel's front desk they sent an engineer to our room to change the filter in the air conditioning unit. The filter looked as it hadn't been changed in a couple of years. And to add insult to injury they charged $48.00 for parking. Not $48.00 a night (which I had no problem with because it's NYC) but, $48.00 dollars every time you wanted to take your vehicle out of the garage in less than a 24 hour period. Amazing!!! This has got to be the worst hotel that we have stayed in in NYC. There is no possible way they can compete with the other hotels on that block. You would assume that because of the location and the Hilton name behind it, it would be really nice. NOT!!!!! The only reason I gave this rating two stars is because of the staff who were professional. If I could take this staff out of this hotel and put them in a \"real luxury\" hotel that would be great.

LOCATION: very good, nice area and very close to everything. Walk to Times Square in about 15 minutes.

STANDARD rooms: well..the furniture is pretty new, the beds are very nice but the room itself look old. The finish is not high quality, looking at hanging wallpaper in the bathroom, bad paint jobs on the bathroom door etc..The bathroom is very small but the room is pretty large (2 double bedded room). SERVICE: not what I expect from a Hilton Hotel. When we checked in the lady was searching for a room for at least 10 minutes..asking questions like\" do you need two beds\" - well we are 3 persons and I booked a room with 2 beds!!

OK. No problems. BREAKFAST: not as many items as Hilton usually has but fine. Good quality scrambled eggs, salmon, bacon, waffles, fresh fruit etc.. GYM: pretty good.

On a recent business trip to the city I am sad to report that the hotel has lost it's mojo. My recent business trip lasted for 5 nights and I paid 300.00 per night...not a great deal but fair for NY and a late hotel reservation. Here were the issues that made the experience challenging: 1. No temp. control in the room. This meant that even though it was 50 degree outside, yes in May, the place was air conditioned. Can turn off the air in room but not in the rest of the building. A thin waffle blanket did not suffice to warm the night. The sad heater provided the following night only heated it's immediate sorroundings. Spent 5 night freezing in my room. 2. Internet connectivity charge- 18.00 dollars....in all fairness this was advertised ahead of time. However, it's 18 dollars per device...WTF? Are you kidding me? The internet was super slow and not worth it. 3. Noise....this is always an issue in NY but on several nights there were loud parties on the floor- that in combo with the outside honking, which is just part of being in NY, made it very hard to sleep. 4. Bathroom ceiling was decrepit, the towel rack came undone - not really what you expect from a HILTON and certainly not for 300 a night. 5. On one of the mornings we were greeted by a giant inflattable rat with a bed bug warning about the hotel....this was a labor union dispute but the bed bug warning made me very nervous. Called the hotel and was informed there were no bed bugs. I did not see bed bugs in my room...THANK GOD!!!! NOW- the staff were extremely kind, accommodating, friendly and professional. They tried their best to make the stay comfortable. The manager gave me a night for free and took off the internet charges. This made it almost bearable but in reality, I can't justify paying that much when the hotel fails to provide what is necessary to meet your basic business need- great internet service so you can work from your room, a normal temp. room so you aren't freezing, and a proper noise level (even for NY).

We didn't expect to receive the complete opposite staying at the double tree on Lexington. We travelled from Toronto and drove about 8 hours straight so we could skip all the traffic. We arrive at the hotel but could not park at the front due to all the taxis and other tourist parking. We decided to drive around to the side where we saw underground parking. There were a line of cars going in and out with a handful of guys parking cars. The infront of us drove into the car elevator to park his own car we assumed. As soon as it was our turn, one of the guys opened the driver's door and TOLD us to grab our stuff because he was going to park the car. My boyfriend didn't want to do valet and told him. Also, we had not checked in yet and wanted to know if we can go in and out. Again, this guy continued to give us attitude and told us once more to grab our stuff. He had to park the car because we did not know how to park the car in the elevator and there were numerous cars behind us. Fine! So we all grabbed our stuff and looked around if there was a trolly or another person to help us unload of stuff. NO THERE WASN'T. WE WERE NOT GIVEN A TROLLY OR ASSISTED AT ALL. They didn't even show us the way into our hotel. We all carried our stuff back outside of the garage and walked all the way around to the front of the hotel. As soon as we got inside - there were bell boys standing around with their trollys and still no one offered to help take our bags!!!! We tried to check in but we were too early. My boyfriend told them that we called earlier and had asked for early check in. The person he spoke to said it would be no problem. but the ppl at the front desk said it was not possible. They suggested to leave our bags with the bell boys and leave our cell numbers and they would call as soon as our rooms were ready. If they had told us that in the very beginning we would not have parked our car so early. We all decided to go and grab breakfast and leave our bags with the bell boys. As we finished leave our bags on the trolly, the bell boy asked for $6.00. He said that it would be $2.00 per bag to be left on the trolly and that he will need the first half now and the 2nd half once we pick up our stuff in the next hour. EFFIN' REDICULOUS!!!! Once, our rooms were ready, we picked up our bags, paid the rest of the fee and then carried all our stuff again to our rooms!!!!! They couldn't even help use the same trolly to get us to our rooms. At the time of check out we confirmed at the front desk that everything had been taken care of - rooms and parking. They confirm and again we walked all our stuff outside to the garage. We had to wait about 15 mins for our car and then they asked us to pay for parking. We told them that we paid inside and the front desk said everything was taken care of. The guy asked us for a receipt which the front desk did not give us. My boyfriend had to run all the way back inside and came back with a receipt.

I'd never stayed at a Doubletree before I read the mixed reviews here and was slightly apprehensive, but the stay was absolutely fine. Check-in was quick and efficient, and I got my warm cookie (although they forgot to give me the coupon that was part of the deal I'd purchased). I made sure, having looked at reviews here, to make sure I didn't get a room overlooking the police station - probably best to ask for a \"quiet/high floor room\" upon arrival. The room was spacious, by New York standards, and clean. The room had (in realtor terms) a \"partial Chrysler building view\". The free internet/breakfast I got as a Diamond Hhonors member was the icing on the cake, although during my one week-day morning the employee in the executive lounge couldn't cope with the throughput of customers - no plates/coffee/pastries.

First off, the bell hops are either standing around doing nothing or agressively trying to take your luggage, call a cab or whatever. I don't mind the initial service offer, but after I have told them that I am not interested, they need to learn to BACKOFF! Restaurant service was bad. Wait staff was not attentive - and here you need it. Worse, this hotel AUTOMATICALLY adds the gratuity. I really don't appreciate having my choice taken away from me. This place seems to be always pusing the Hilton time share. Every time you walk by their desk and you have to to get to the elevators, you are harrassed to come and talk to them. Give me a break, in a business hotel - really??? Finally the bell staff in front of the hotel is less than honest when asking about transportation. They push hard their towncar option and fail to really tell you that the cabs real cost. They lead you to believe that their option is better priced - isn't.

It is in an excellent midtown location, walking distance to practically everything from Times Square to Central Park and the Upper East Side. The price/value ratio for the hotel is usually good and you can usually secure a rate below $200 during the January/February period. Additionally, the staff is usually very responsive and pleasant. In terms of Hilton HHonors privileges, I usually get upgraded to the Executive Floor with a complimentary breakfast, although like most Hiltons, the room size/quality doesn't seem to be notably better than non-Executive Floor equivalents. Also like other Hiltons, the concept of a separate check-on for Hilton HHonors members is non-existent. Now for the bad stuff which really left a negative impression at the end of a very long trip. I checked out of the hotel and asked the bellman to store my bag. His reply is that there is a $2 fee for bag storage. I am a little miffed that I just spent over $1,000 on my stay and was being asked for two more dollars, but OK, so since I am without cash I ask the reception staff to add the $2 to my bill. \"I can't do that\", she replied. I explain I was just told that there is a $2 fee for bag storage and I didn't have any cash, so I needed to add it to the bill. \"No\" she advised and directed me to the nearest ATM. \"Or\", she offered, \"you can talk to Them to see if they will waive it\". Of course, Them is the bellstaff, that work for the same hotel as the check-in agent and were standing three feet away, but clearly she was not willing to approach her own co-worker with such a heinous request. So it quickly became apparent. The $2 is not a fee, it's some sort of mandatory tip. And oh yeah, it MUST be paid in cash. I don't have a problem tipping. I tip everyone, including the bus drivers on shuttles at the airport and a daily tip to the housekeeping staff. However, portraying a tip as a fee and not allowing me to pay for it on my bill (just like I am able to add a tip on my credit card in a restaurant) is deceptive to say the least and unacceptable for a Hilton hotel.

Of course, since you're in Midtown Manhattan, there are a million other attractions that are just as close, but those are simply the highlights I remember best. For more daily needs, there are several nearby cafes, a nail salon and massage parlor right around the corner on 53rd St. (The front desk clerk was kind enough to tell me I could find better prices there than I could for services in the hotel.), and a Staples (for your last-minute business needs!). The hotel itself even has a small giftshop with some nice accessories and souvenirs, in case you need to bring a gift home for anyone. It's open until around 11:00 PM, as I recall. I was very impressed by the service; I chatted with room service when they came to my room, and they were warm and friendly. The hotel was also very accommodating regarding the terms of my stay. Extending my stay by an extra night was very easy, and when I invited a friend to join me at the hotel, they took down his information and agreed to welcome him while I was out on the town and valet his vehicle. They gave him a copy of the room key at no extra charge. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who could afford the rates.

Room ready on arrival at approx 3pm. After reading reviews, I requested a room on a higher floor due to potential noise nuisance from the street and Fire Dept. I was given the option of floor 10 with a nice view or floor 16 with the view of a wall! Decided on the 10th floor room and was assured it wouldn't be too noisy. Throughout the stay, we could hear the Fire Dept sirens however they did not keep us awake at any point. Walls are thin and we could hear our neighbours on occasion however, this did not keep us awake at night either. The room itself (1004) has a nice view, as promised, and was not to far to walk from the lift (one of my grumbles in most hotels!). It was very clean and spacious enough for 2 people sharing. 1 king bed and a sofa. Plenty of drawer and desk space. Wardrobe was large enough however not many hangers available. Approx 10 which is not a lot for 2 people. Bathroom was small but again, not a problem. Sink was outside of the bathroom which was handy. Public areas are pleasant and clean. Staff always made an effort to greet you and were on hand if there was anything you required. The bar was closed a few times when we returned to the hotel but sure it opens 6pm daily. A beer and a spirit with mixer was approx $20. Slightly expensive but it's to be expected for a hotel on Lexington Ave. Bar food was very impressive and reasonably priced. We ate breakfast at the hotel on our last morning and it was very nice. Full menu available. We had the buffet for approx $23 each. For other breakfast alternatives there is Cafe Metro which is next door to hotel (cheap and cheerful) or I would highly recommend Raffles at the Raddison (left out of the hotel and a few blocks along). The business centre was excellent. 60 mins free browsing. Printing of boarding cards was free. Wifi available for a charge in the room however, free in the lobby. Very reliable. Location is very good. Approx a 15 min walk to Times Sq. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and could not fault the hotel.

Checking in was hassle-free and the receptionist was really polite and welcoming. We were given warm chocolate chip cookies as a 'warm welcome' which are the best cookies I have EVER tasted. I even purchased a tin of them to take home!!!! I would like to say that the cookies are such a nice touch and make the stay at this hotel just that bit more special! The receptionists were also very generous with the cookies and would ask you if you wanted one when passing. Me and my partner actually made jokes of not making eye contact with the reception just in case we got offered a cookie haha (refraining from putting 10 stone on in 5 days). This is in no way a negative though - jokes only! Me and my partner had such a lovely feeling staying here it almost felt like home and made our trip to New York the best time of our lives! I can't describe how happy we were with the hotel. The room was also amazing - huge comfy bed, huge tv, powerful shower and clean towels. We were also provided with branded toiletries e.g Loreal/Neutrogena!! Again, that special touch that makes you think they really care about your stay with them. The made service was also excellent. Don't get me wrong, there may have been a little tear in the carpet in the corner of the room or a scratch on a wall but this is no way puts me off the hotel and shouldn't anyone else! Overall, the room was in excellent condition and was kept clean. We could hear some noice outside when the window was open but we were staying in New York - which is of course the city that never sleeps!!! I would like to say a special thank you to the reception who were excellent at all times. I think the receptionist I usually dealt with was called Karen??! An american/chinese lady.

We had an excellent stay, on par with my other consistently positive Doubletree experiences across the country. I shared a room with a friend for a two-night stay in the city. Having lived in NYC for many years, I just need an affordable and clean homebase for quick and active trips when I want to keep an independent schedule without feeling tied to or in the way of friends who are hosting me in their small apartments, now increasingly with babies and kids. If this Doubletree keeps offering the excellent rate we got (~140/night), I may very well become a regular here! I found the entrance/lobby/bar area fragrant, cozy and cool-looking, the staff friendly and responsive, the welcome cookie yummy, the elevators efficient, the halls narrow but clean, and the room nice. The room (1 queen-sized bed) was a bit small, but this is to be expected for NYC and the lower rate. The segmented bathroom, with the vanity and sink separate from the shower and toilet is an added convenience for sharing this room. Everything was CLEAN and in order. Our bathroom was spotless -- which is really important to me. However, I did notice that some of the ceiling paint was peeling, probably due to a combination of shower steam and poor ventilation. It wasn't major, but I hope Doubletree monitors it and repaints before it gets too yucky. Our room was provided with a set of earplugs, which I didn't need. But light sleepers should be aware that city street noise or hall noises (room doors opening and closing and/or housekeeping staff in the morning) are to be expected. My only suggestion to Doubletree on this point is that they should consider replacing the room doors with heavier/more solid ones to soften hall noises. I'm a good sleeper, so I really didn't have an issue with noise. In fact, I really enjoyed the comfortable bed! I asked for two extra blankets just after arrival, and staff delivered them promptly.

For this trip we were looking to get a quick weekend away and cut some of the expenses down. This hotel is a reasonable bargain -- but understand you're getting what you pay for. Bellmen were excellent, quite helpful. Front desk was cheerful, friendly and helpful. We needed a rollaway bed and it was delivered quickly. Woman cleaning the rooms was extremely nice and friendly.

Here's the negatives -- the rooms are OK. Emphasis on OK. Not terrible -- but not even close to above average (you get what you pay for....).

There were several other hotels we might have chosen to book, both Hilton family and non-Hilton, at the same rate or less, but we decided upon the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel. Bad choice. In our rez we asked for a room upgrade if available in lieu of the extra 1,000 pts. Our rez was for a standard queen. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 a.m. Friendly & professional reception. Room not ready (no prob, we are very early). Stored bags ($6). Went out for the day and returned to the hotel at 5:30 pm. Long check-in line but it is 5:30 pm; got our room key.Went to assigned room, which we were told was an \"upgrade\" per our rez request. The room was in the process of being cleaned. Went to the \"Ex. Lounge\" and dialed the front desk to inform them room not ready & request re-assignment. Operator picked up and transferred me to the Front Desk. Phone rang on & on; no answer. Tried 3 times- same result. Decided to check on room; housekeeping had finished and it was ready (around 6:30 pm). Found stained walls, peeling paper, damaged drapes, etc. The room was in very poor condition~ found a number in the room for the \"CareLine\" & called ~ explained situation & was given a different room. Went to new room, it was just as bad, this time the BR was much smaller and the bathtub & sink were stained. Again, very poor condition. Called CareLine again. Explained again. We were asked to come to the front desk where the manager would meet us and escort us to a \"really beautiful room\". Waited for some time at the front desk and had to re-explain to a not- too-friendly receptionist the situation. Manager met us and escorted us to another room (the third room), manager very pleasant and apologetic. The 3rd room was in better condition overall and had a decent view of the Chrysler Building, but still several major issues- the shower head was not connected to the wall, the heater/ac unit was banged up, the shades were dirty, carpet worn, walls with obvious scrapesetc. We later discovered that the bathroom fan ran continuously. Anyway- the manager was quite nice. I asked it really, didnt they have something more in line with what we expect from Hilton? Well, this is an old hotel, he said. We thought- OK, enough. We just want to get on with our weekend.The manager later sent us a bottle of inexpensive red wine, choc. covered strawberries, and promised a free drink at the bar. Well, it was something, and we appreciated our concerns being heard. Went to the bar for our free drink. Bartender's attitude was almost surly. Bartender asked us many questions and told us to go get a voucher from the front desk- I said \"why dont you just call the manager\". OK- CONS: Initial reception area dark, poorly organized, and much too small for the size of the hotel. I dislike greatly the hotel lobby decor and layout. Out of the 8 staff we spoke to on the phone or in person, 3 were friendly and professional. The manager was very pleasant and I give him an \"A\". The other 5 were almost, if not actually, rude. The room(s) color scheme was not to our liking (retro yellow / orange / blue ) and DH likes retro! The third room we were assigned should have been the room we originally reserved (except it had a king rather than queen bed), NOT the upgrade.I feel strongly that we were \"cheated\" out of our upgrade- if one isnt available, fine, but dont charge us our 1K pts per night by assigning a substandard room and then making a halfway decent room appear to be an \"upgrade\"! How stupid do you think we are? The Ex. Lounge is a joke. Small, dark, and unstaffed other than someone replenishing supplies. Very limited selection of soft drinks, snacks, etc. I asked at the bar for a bottle of Club Soda / Tonic (as this wasn't available in the Ex. Lounge). Tonic only available on tap and then charged me $4 for a 10 oz bottle of Club Soda. Mediocore breakfeast. Eggs were awful. PRO's: Nicely located for a midtown east hotel.

Our room was spacious and had two queen sized beds. My only complaint about the room would be that the door seemed a bit loose and didn't seem to lock properly. However, we brought it to the attention of one of the housekeepers in the hallway on our first day and she showed us how to secure it. The bellhops were very helpful and the service the hotel offers for holding your luggage prior to check-in/after check-out was great. There is a minimal charge, but it is worth it. Check-in was simple (don't forget the Doubletree cookies!) and although we were not able to get to our room any earlier than the stated check-in time, we were able to stash our bags and begin exploring. The concierge desk does have room for improvement. The lady who helped us on two occassions didn't appear to be very interested and seemed a little put off by my request for theater information. On the day I asked for information on getting to Yankee Stadium, she simply shoved a pre-printed subway sheet to me. Fortunately, you can't go anywhere without maps and City information being readily available and we were able to fend for ourselves. The best part about the hotel was something we didn't fully appreciate until the last day of our 4 day weekend - it's location. It is located at the corner of Lexington and 51st in Midtown Manhattan. Each day we walked towards Times Square and the Broadway area, and we didn't really just how close we were to Central Park and all the great shopping on Park and Madison Avenues. With it being our first trip, it took a couple of days to get our bearings, but I think this hotel is located in a great spot - with a subway entrance right outside, a Metro Cafe next door, St. Patrick's Cathedral about 2-3 blocks away and Central Park easily within walking distance. There was a fire station across the street, but noise was not a problem. We paid about $200/night and in New York that is very reasonable.

But Doubletree is a Hilton, right? So it could not possibly be as bad as all that. Well, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Quite. The hotel is in a superb, central location. If you like the Upper East Side and the huge range of tempting distractions that will draw you without end along the apparently infinite length of Lexington Avenue, it is just right for you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next door to some of the most expensive hotels in the USA and it is impossible not to experience a frisson of delight at the realization that you are getting the same, or a similar, deal for a fraction of the price. Yet, I found it ironic that everything I had been warned about came to pass. When I checked in I was informed that for my website discounted rate I had booked a room \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on a renovation floor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This meant that the corridors were stripped to bare concrete with the plumbing and wiring exposed and the stimulating scent of wet cement in the air. It hardly mattered. The room was perfectly furnished and finished and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in a hotel corridor, but they might have said so when I booked. Am I the only person who would not only be undeterred but would leap at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renovation discount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? To compensate, I was given a free breakfast during each day of my stay, which was very generous, except that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t free. I was billed for the service fee, which was pretty harmless, but very rude. When I checked out, some intuition, probably planted by the reviews I had hitherto regarded as gratuitously negative, made me check my bill. It just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up. There was something wrong. By my calculations I could not get within $100 of the total. What with the service fee for breakfast and the various State and City taxes I realised that I might be calculating things incorrectly. I drew up a spreadsheet on my laptop and spent twenty minutes trying to work out where my figures erred. It turned out I had been billed a daily rate considerably in excess of the agreed tariff. This was instantly corrected by the accounts department (well, as instantly as one can be when there is a check-out line of fifteen or sixteen people with the same complaint), without the slightest hesitation, explanation or apology. Could it be that this is a common occurrence, that maybe this hotel rather prefers to wait for customers to complain rather than ensure the accounts are correct before they are handed to the nocturnal visitor who shoves them beneath the crack in the door at 4.45 am? I had had a narrow escape as I do not incur \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional room expenses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and am inclined to pay hotel bills without thinking that they might have overcharged me by almost 100%. The hotel itself is smart, clean and pleasant. The rooms are large, comfortable, four star rooms with large, comfortable beds, large, comfortable bathrooms, pleasant decor and very agreeable staff in whose mouths butter would not melt (but this is part of the charm of Manhattan). Depending on which side of the building you are on it is easy to use the public wireless internet provided by the City of New York (or other less charitable institutions in close proximity) without paying the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculously high rate for internet access. The breakfast was good but the basement venue was claustrophobic and chaotic and I would not have set foot in it had I had to pay the $20 buffet fee when I could go to any number of nearby diners and have a better breakfast for under $10. Still, the Doubletree Metropolitan was a steal for the discount web rate of $150 per night, and if I had not had the sense that I had survived a pick-pocketing, I would recommend it to anyone. As it is, I recommend it to anyone who is prepared to ignore a concrete lined hotel corridor, who can use a magnifying glass to check their account, and who can apply sufficient assertiveness to demand a substantial refund from a hotel clerk who might be from Venus but who appears to believe that we customers must be treated as though we are from Mars.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFantabulous! - perfect for our anniversary.\u201d", "Author": "deryckp", "ReviewID": "UR84080737", "Content": "We booked the Doubletree online. we have stayed in doubletrees before and liked the hotel. reason for doubletree for this weekend was the price - couldnt beat it in Midtown.

THE FEMALE CONCIERGE LADY.... i've never met someone so rude, unhelpful, and annoyed by her job. I refused to go back to her. Such attitude and could offer no advice. - molding in bathroom, tub had cracks and was very old. they mainly need to work on their customer service. It ruins the whole trip having rude people assist you. for the price you pay for the hotel though, it's relatively cheap in NYC standards.... and thats what you get... cheap service if you are absolutely on a budget, stay here. in NY you're out and about most of the time.

I travel a lot on business. Double Tree is one of the hotels our travel agency puts us in (Marriott is another). When I arrived I was met I was impressed with the staff. Front desk staff and management were very polity and extremely efficient (Marriott can learn from these folks). The floor staff were also polite and extremely diligent (I felt like royalty). Things started to go downhill once I got to my room. I went to take a shower and found the ceiling was covered with black mold. It was disgusting and needless to say a health hazard. I went back to the front desk to request another room. The mid-shift staff were not as polite and competent as the day staff. I was told there were no more rooms and that the earliest someone could come by to \"clean the mold\" is the next day. Unacceptable. I insisted to speak to a manager, which I guess spooked the desk person who came back and put me in another room. The new room did not have mold. The second problem I ran into was that at check out time, Double Tree charged the wrong credit card. They were supposed to bill our company AMEX (they had the credit card authorization form faxed over - TWICE!). Gross incompetence. I've never had this problem with Marriott. 24 hours after checking out, I'm still playing phone tag with Double Tree Metropolitan staff and Chase bank. I'm hoping to get this all ironed out soon so I can pay my rent. Incredible how someone's incompetence can cause such disruption to someone's finances. Double Tree staff is a mix of fairly competent and helpful (day staff) and grossly incompetent and lazy (evening staff) people. My company has a contract with Double Tree. I intend to file a formal complaint to Double Tree (for the moss problem as well as the billing mistake). Further, I intend to recommend to my company to break their contract and find another hotel that has more competent and diligent staff. Would I recommend Double Tree to a friend? Hard to say. Double Tree is cheap. If you get a room without mold and if Double Tree staff don't make a mistake with your bill, then maybe you won't have a miserable stay. My professional opinion, as a constant business traveler, is to expect a level of incompetence and inconvenience (having to compensate for stupid mistakes). My personal opinion, make sure you double, triple, quadruple check that Double Tree staff have the correct information...because they can (and often do - from what I'm seeing) make very costly mistakes. Marriott is a much more sensible place if you're a business traveler. When your boss sends you on the road to work on a project, the last thing you need is to play \"Special Education Teacher\" with incompetent Double Tree staff.

When you are booking this room, be sure to ask for the larger of the 2 double occupancy choices, because there are 2 sizes of rooms, and the one you see on the internet is the BIGGER room. You wouldn't have belived HOW SMALL our room was, In fact we requested a cot prior to our arrival, and it was in the room when we arrived.....I am not kidding, we COULD NOT open it up due to the small size of this room (see the photo I uploaded). Oh ya......ask for a room that faces 51st street, not the back alley. THE restaurant in the hotel is VERY PRICY.....our bill was $90 for three buffet breakfasts.....there is a neat cafe right beside the hotel called CAFE METRO (they are all over Manhatten too), but we could get breakfast there and late night snacks as well, so that was a good thing. The room was cleaned adequately each day, but the decor and overall style of the rooms could use some updating. The beds and pillows are good, but we were so tired at the end of each day, we could have probably slept on the floor. Coffeemakers are available ONLY BY request, so be sure to request one if you are a coffee drinker......ONE issue was the maid forget to provide us with coffee each day, so every night we had to call the front desk for more coffee, so we would have it ready to make in the morning. Finally on the last night, the restaurant manager brought our coffee up, and when he found out we didnt get coffee all week, he gave us 3 breakfast buffet coupons (remember, that's worth $90), so we really appreciated that and we enjoyed a buffert breakfast before leaving for a long day of traveling. Location was good.......the blocks are long but depending on weather its nice to walk so you can see all the shops and cafes along the way. The 'all loops tours' bus stops right on 49th and Lexington, so we used that lots to get back and fourth from Times Square and Broadway shows. Also, there is a subway station on the corner of 51st and Lexington (right beside the hotel). The one on the same side of street as hotel goes all the way downtown (Brookyn Bridge, Canal Street, etc) and the one across the street goes uptown.

I went back to the front desk and asked the front desk manager (Sylvia) if I could have another room, preferably one that was on a higher floor and away from the street and Sylvia was exceptionally accommodating - I use the word 'exceptionally' because the lobby was busy and she could easily have told me to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake it or leave it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Instead she patiently looked up another room and generated new key cards for me to go and check the room out before confirming a room switch.

However \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room had a musty smell to it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not because of poor housekeeping but more so from the sheer age of the room and hotel in general, the windows were big but the street noise still came through quite loudly at night (a police & fire station are located across the street and they use their sirens generously!), the bathroom was old and small and worst of all the thermostat only controlled air conditioning! Of course I did not find this fact out until the temp in the room dropped in the middle of the night & I had to call the front desk to complain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they sent an engineer up who wheeled in a portable radiator and stated that this was the only way to heat the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since it was a suite it was a larger room and the small radiator took forever to heat the room to an acceptable temp. The housekeeping staff was friendly but oddly none of them respected the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 card hung out on the door knob \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three separate cleaning staff members knocked on the door through out the next morning to clean the room when I was desperately trying to sleep in.

I was able to check in early which is a big plus. The room was huge by New York standards and relatively clean. The linens and towels were clean and fresh-smelling.

Really, you're in New York and you sit around reading Facebook? The Bad: The room was awfully rundown considering that the hotel just underwent renovations. Based on other reviews here, I wonder if people who book through a service such as Priceline or Orbitz get the lower quality rooms. I was on the 2nd floor and the wallpaper was peeling away, the door barely closed (and a metal piece was actually missing - you could see the glue where it was supposed to be!) and the carpet was so worn in the traffic path that you could no longer see the pattern. I was also located just underneath the 3rd floor ice machine and could hear every time someone got ice. I would stay again, but try for a better floor.

We were greeted by a kind and polite receptionist on our arrival, and was swiftly processed and upgraded from a queen to a king size room, which was a nice surprise after an 9 hour flight. We got a room on the 6th floor facing 51st street, where a police precinct and fire station is located. The windows seems to be sound isolated, as we didn't hear much noise from the fire trucks, which we heard about once every evening. The room itself was updated with a clean carpet, 32 inch flatscreen TV with several HD channels. The bed was great, and the room service was great. My wife dropped some water on the bathroom floor around the sink, and dried it up with a napkin, which showed no trace of dirt or filth. The room also had an in-room safe, which was large enough to store a 16 inch laptop and a SLR camera in it at once, which was a big plus for us, with all our tourist gear. The location is both good and bad. The good thing is the hotel's location in relation to the Subway. You got easy access to 3 lines, from a subway station that runs beneath the hotel! The bad is that it is a business area, so the choice of food and restaurants are in generel limited to expensive juice bars and caf\u00c3\u00a9s. The downsides to this hotel is the expensive WIFI, which runs up to $17 per day. The trick is to go down to the lobby, and log on your computer while down there. You get 1 hour of complimentary highspeed WIFI, when you are in the lobby. You can then bring your computer back to your room, and still use it there! There seem to be no daily limits on the complimentary WIFI, so use it, instead of wasting money on something that's free, if you bother going down to the lobby. Another thing that annoyed us a bit was the late housekeeping in the evening. The maid would at times start to vacuum and clean rooms at around 8 to 9 in the evening, and the room's front door wasn't exactly as soundproof as the windows, so it got a bit annoying at times.

On my first trip I was greeted quickly in the lobby area and provided my room without issue. The room itself was a ADA equipped room as it was the only remaining room with a king size bed in it. This was not such a big deal as I was only staying a single night. Upon going to my room it appears the floor was under renovation which appears from the various reviews on this site is a common thing with this hotel. I then went to the lobby bar for a quick dinner and was pretty much ignored for the first 15 mins while the waiter was off watching the game that was on the tv's even ignoring me waving to him. After finally getting his attention he pleaded that he was not intentionally ignoring me but I did not feel the same. I would expect someone who is there to provide service to actually watch for people coming in and sitting down and paying less attention to the baseball game that is on. To top it off the automatically add a tip to the bill which is pure BS considering the poor service they provide and that i would have to now ask them to remove it if I want that changed putting me in a uncomfortable situation.. I only stayed one night on that visit appears they did not honor my request to have my airlines rewards number added to my room bill. Fast forward 1 month later and I had to return to the same part of the city as last time so I figured I would give this hotel another shot. Again the check in process was quick and efficient and I provided them my rewards details to hopefully get the air miles this time. I was given a room with a king size bed that is not an ADA room and is on the 9th floor looking into the stairwell of the building across from me and has a very odd wet sock like smell to it and appears the cleaning staff use far to much air freshener to try and mask this smell. The room has a so called 'Pure' air cleaner in it and i am not sure what effect if any this will have on the odd smell and I am hoping that while I am down in the same hotel bar as last time the smell will go away. Speaking of the hotel bar I was again ignored by the staff for nearly 10 mins while the bar tender and lone waitress where chatting at the end of the bar with each other. I just do not understand why they can not pay attention to people walking in and sitting down.

First of all, the hotel's fragrance or overall smell reminds me of MGM Grand in Vegas. I can't put a finger on it, but it reminds me of Vegas every night during my 4 night stay. The overly funky, hip lobby / bar area also reinforces this. The service was great, especially since I lost my key card one night and they helped resolved a business center issue (connectivity) for me another night as well. The bed were quite comfortable (King) and I think they actually had too many bathroom towels and amenities for me.

Prior to our stay I had previously contacted guest relations about my concerns regarding disruptions to guests from the ongoing construction/renovations in the hotel as well as other concerns I had gleaned from reading recent TripAdvisor reviews. Within a few days, I received a courteous reply from the Guest Relations Manager and contact information for head of housekeeping. I was assured that my stay would be pleasant and enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel shortly after 3:30 p.m. Even though the lobby was very busy, check-in was very efficient and we were in our room very quickly. The room was a pleasant surprise. In an apparent effort to assure that we would have a pleasant experience, the management had upgraded us from an Upper Floor Deluxe Room to a Junior Suite. The DT Metropolitan is already known as having large (for NYC standards) guest rooms for a 3-star hotel (it was built as a 4-star Loew's Hotel). Walking into the Junior Suite was like winning the jackpot. Enormous by NYC standards with two ample closets, it had a pullout sofa bed in the seating area in addition to a very spacious walk-out terrace facing 51st Street. The only thing on the small side was the bathroom (which held the toilet and combo shower/tub)--the sink/vanity is outside the bathroom and was more spacious. Upon returning from a lovely dinner nearby at Brasserie the first night, we entered the room to discover a note left by the GM with a bottle of wine and a cheese and crackers plate. It was an unexpected, pleasant surprise but I suppose the management is really serious about generating positive interest and reports about their property after some negative reports this spring and early summer. I did have a minor gripe about the delivery of the wine and cheese. We had left a do not disturb sign on the door but the sign was apparently ignored. Now, my general critique of this property. Hotel has recently been renovated/\"refreshed\" but it is difficult to tell what is new on the guest floors and what is legacy. Renovations appear to have been done quickly but not very carefully. Still, hotel is pleasantly appointed for an older 3-star hotel in NYC. I think the 3.5-star rating is pushing the limits a bit. Cleanliness is good, but public areas have high traffic and show it. Buffet breakfast was included in our rate, but otherwise I would not have eaten breakfast at the hotel--it was just adequate in quality and given the price if you had to pay for it, there are much better options in the immediate vicinity. Elevators were usually fairly efficient except for one morning when there appeared to be some sort of event on the penthouse level which tied up all the elevators. HVAC was a little problematic in our particular suite--despite adjusting the thermostat, our unit was constantly running and the room was rather cool (better than the 90 degrees F outside, though!). Validated parking through the hotel is an excellent value for this part of Midtown ($30 for 24 hours with no in/out privileges). Even though we were directly across the street from a fire house and police precinct, up on the 18th floor the noise was not too bad for this part of Manhattan--compared to the even older Radisson Lexington Hotel a few blocks south, noise levels in the room were very acceptable by Midtown Manhattan standards. Most of the staff encountered seemed friendly, helpful and accommodating. My request for an extended checkout to 1 p.m. needed because of a delayed business meeting was met without hesitation. I think high speed internet access was a bit pricey for a hotel at this price point and star-level--charging $14.95-16.95 per 24 hours of access. NYC is a very competitive hotel market. At the time I booked our reservation, the DT Metropolitan was very competitively priced. It's strengths are a good Midtown location for business, large rooms, and an apparent can-do attitude by a good portion of the staff and management. It isn't luxurious but is comfortable for a large, somewhat older hotel in Midtown.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cFun hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "sgtreas", "ReviewID": "UR72562272", "Content": "A wonderful gem in NYC.

At night, there was a security officer checking to make sure only guests were allowed to use the elevators to the guest rooms...noninvasive, yet a nice step towards security. There was a nice mix of what appeared to be business travelers and families. The executive lounge was nicely stocked. The people working the room were nice but when it got a little busy, they seemed a little overwhelmed with things like checking for vouchers and keeping the garbage under control. Outside of this, they did a good job of keeping the food and drinks well stocked and fresh. The hot oatmeal was a nice touch though another hot option would have been nice. Some more options for coffee would also have been nice (flavored creamers, etc.), though certainly not necessary (I usually drink black, but the coffee was a little on the burnt side).

The pedistal sink in the bathroom was not properly secured and the basin would rock back and forth about 3 inches when bumped. The room door looked as if someone had broken the door to gain access (perhaps an improperly programmed door didn't allow access). The door had since been repaired, but the workmanship was shoddy and the door was loose in the door jam when locked shut. All things considered, there wasn't a single 'deal breaker' that made the hotel unsatisfactory. But, the several small issues made me think that the hotel should do much better -- especially given the price of a Manhattan hotel. I phoned the front desk to ask for another room and was surprised to find out that there was a significant hold to discuss the issue with someone. Eventually, the front desk discussed the issues with me. Since I checked in a little early, they said I would have to wait several hours to see what might be available. She offered a compromise: we will fix the issues that are broken while you are out. I agreed. upon returning from a great night out, we discovered that the room hadn't been touched. It was frustrating, but we stayed in the room anyway as we were tired from staying out late in NYC. Overall, I think that we probably got a dud room in what appears to be a nice hotel.

We were within walking distance to 5th Avenue, Central Park, The NY Public Library, The Empire State Bldg, Grand Central terminal, and so much more. We experienced very helpful staff throughout our stay. Service was quick and with a smile! It was such a pleasure. We were booked into a queen room, and although small, it was quite adequate for me and my daughter. We were pleasantly surprised at the very large flat screen TV in the room and there were ample outlets in the room for charging our various devices. I did feel the room could have been more clean. The tub/shower area had mold stains - this is probably because the hotel is very old, but the grout does need to be replaced as it was chipping and stained which was unsightly. Also, wallpaper was missing and peeling throughout the room and hallways. The mattress seemed to be leaning slightly towards the center which made it somewhat difficult to get comfy, but the room was very quiet - we were not disturbed by any street noises or other guests which was a plus for sure! The room was very warm! Upon inspection of the thermostat I noticed it was turned as warm as it could go, so I turned it to a cooler temp. It didn't seem to cool the room down, so I turned it as cold as it could go and left it there for the duration of our stay. The room finally got comfortable, but something was clearly wrong with the unit, as I had it on 50 degrees and it never got near that. It was chilly wile we were in town, but 80+ degree room temp is too hot even for this Floridian!

I would recommend this hotel to a friend because of the location and price I received from Priceline.com, but I would have to explain the issues with the hotel so they know what to expect. I did not complain about the problems with my room as I was enjoying my time in the city and didn't want take time away from the short time I had in order to deal with the little inconveniences I was experiencing.

I called housekeeping for new shower gel and they just pour in some shower gels into the shower gel bottles for me, which gels still spilled out onto the bottle.

The bathroom, however, inconveniently only has 1 bar to hang your towels.. so if you are someone who uses all 6 of the towels (2 washcloths, 2 hand towels, 2 bath towels), you will have to create your own towel hanger using a clothes hanger. Bath towels are also incredibly coarse and abrasive. Overall, I still had a good trip, but I DO NOT recommend this hotel for the price it advertises ($200-400).

I wrote a review about this hotel before in 2007 and wanted to update since we decided to stay again. Check in was smooth and everyone was very friendly. We received two warm chocolate chip cookies - which came in handy the next morning when I was starving and needed something! As far as our room, we did not get a free upgrade this time but we had a good room. I had requested a room that was not near the elevator, was on a higher floor and was non-smoking. Also, I did not want to be on the side of the fire station on 51st street. Our room was 1443 and met the criteria. Our view was not particularly exciting, we looked out onto what looked like luxury condos, but it was fine for what we needed. The hotel provided Neutrogena shampoo, conditioner, soaps and lotion. The water pressure was great (i always check that first) and the sinks and tub drained properly. There was some bubbling of the wallpaper near the window but other than that, the room was clean and the bathrooms were very clean. I forgot to take pictures, but the room was similar to my last post in 2007. This time we had a huge wide screen TV which was very different from our last stay. It was fun to watch TV on such a huge screen, it was like being at the movies! I had them bring us a refridgerator to help us store leftovers and drinks. There was no coffee maker in the room, but they provided a hair dryer, iron, ironing board, extra hangers and a safe was in the closet. There was only one chest of four drawers, but we weren't there that long so it was fine. There was also a sitting chair, writing desk with office chair and side table. There are two sets of window shades as well, one to prevent light and one to block out stong sunlight, one of the windows opens about six inches in case you need fresh air. It was warm in the room when we walked in so we changed the thermostat from 72 to 60 and we were comfortable the rest of our stay. The sheets were cotton and soft but the pillow cases did not seem to be all cotton, again this was not a deluxe room. We didn't order from the Met restaurant because I heard that the food wasn't very good and not worth the price. We went to the Oxford Cafe one block down on Lexington. They have all kinds of food, including breakfast, and the food is good quality. They even sell beer! The prices are reasonable, you can get a meal for under $10. If you need to go cheaper, the Metro Cafe is right next door to the hotel. The hotel was in the process of slowly re-doing the the Lobby bar/lounge. They replaced all of the furniture before we left and now have brand new couches, ottomans and chairs - all are the cushy sofa style. We didn't try the bar but it looked nice. My only serious complaint about this hotel is that they use an air freshner/flowery scent and pump it into the Lobby. The scent was so strong that everytime I was in the Lobby or the elevator I began to sneeze! It was really uncomfortable and upon check out I complained about it. I did have a little stuffy nose cold during my stay which did not help, but on my last day there my cold had cleared up and I still sneezed in the lobby. My only other complaint was that they piped-in music in the elevator and the Lobby was cheezy pop music(Brittany Spears, Usher, etc.) that I didn't really care for. It made me think that since this is a \"Hilton\" hotel that maybe that cheezy Paris Hilton had something to do with that! We checked out at Noon on the 30th but didn't leave NYC until 6pm, so we gave our bags to the hotel to store for us. They store them in a locked room and put numbered tags on each bag. I believe it cost $2 per bag to check them in, and $2 each to check them out. However, they charged us $5 for all 5 bags to check in and $4 to check out. Not sure how that math goes! Anyway, that freed us to head off to lunch and visit a museum before returning to retrieve the bags and head home. By the way, the hotel is located right next to the Green line Metro stop and the blue/Orange line is 1 1/2 blocks up on Lexington. The hotel location is really great, we went to four museums during our trip and took the Metro right on the corner. This was really important because one day it was 20 degrees and it was nice not to have to walk far to the station in the cold. All of the service people were very nice and service was prompt. There was no line when we checked out and everyone seemed like they were genuinely happy to help us regardless of the chaotic pre-new year's crowd.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto, canada", "Title": "\u201cFine Manhattan Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lilaki", "ReviewID": "UR51824687", "Content": "We stayed for five nights at this hotel just before the holidays.

We were disappointed from the moment we walked in the lobby. I had read online that the hotel had been renovated. It must have been back in the 70's. We were greeted and immediately helped by friendly staff. We went to our room and couldn't believe the decor and condition of the room and bathroom. The furnishings, decorations and carpeting were old. The bathroom was tiny; mold on the shower tiles and poorly repaired guages and renovations on the cheap. We looked out the window and only saw a brick wall. If my husband sat in the chair at the desk, I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. I called down and requested a renovated room. I was told all rooms were renovated at the same time, We were offered a room 2 floors up with the same configuration, but a view of the street, which we accepted in a heartbeat. The room air conditioner was old--a register along the wall. It didn't kick on at night. The only place for free Wi-Fi was in the lobby and it was always crowded and loud. The 2 positives are: staff was friendly and the location was great. It was very noisy from the outside, as well as, people closing doors in the hallway. It was like the doors were being slammed. I think it is because we were in a area were 4 rooms converged and the doors were positioned right next to each other. We would not stay here again.

The second thing is that I hope the house keeping staff can keep their noise level down. I know they can't control the noise from the vacuum machine, but please don't yell their voice over the vacuum machine. The last thing that annoys me the most is that one time I try to call a guest in the hotel. I made the call at 1am (eastern time) to the ask the operator to connect my call. The operator replied me, \"No!\" Then I asked why and she replied, \"Ok?\" then hanged up. I wonder if she is extremely busy for connect a call at 1am in the morning.

At least the room has a new nice TV, a radio where you can connect your MP3 and a safe in the closet (not all hotels provide one!). The gym is quite big and the carpet was lately renewed. But honestly: how much time do you spend in your room, when staying New York? If you want a relaxing or romantic vacation, New York is not the best place to go. ;-) The most important thing when staying in New York is the location!

Upon walking into the lobby I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was clean, modern, narrow, something I expect out of a NYC hotel and a Doubletree. I had a great time, check in was easy, with no hassles or long waits. I got to the hotel after traveling awhile and arrived at the hotel before check in time. All of the hotel staff (especially housekeeping, & the bellstaff :<)-thank you) were pleasant and greeted me and my family with smiles and a warm hello. I asked the Concierge (Jennifer) for several different suggestions, which did not disappoint. Britney checked me in and my mother very quickly. I originally booked under a package deal with Expedia (normally I book under hilton honors since I am a member), I was afraid I would be treated with disdain but the complete opposite happened. I booked a queen size bed but asked if I could get doubles instead. Unfortunetely she was unable to do that but upgraded me to a king room and a corner room which allowed for more space. It turned out to be great since my niece and nephew ended up visiting with us for awhile. I did not have breakfast there but opted for daily breakfast runs at the adjacent Metro cafe. I believe it is not affiliated with the hotel. The elevators ran fine and there was never a problem or a long wait for them. The hotel is diagonally across from the Waldorf Astoria, and is next to the subway. I felt very safe especially since there is a fire station and police station on the same block. People complained about the noise but I find that hillarious, you would think you would want to be close to such emergency departments just in case (especially if you are solo and have to go to the atm at night). I brought my earplugs which I really did not need because if you are in nyc you will be walking all over the place or on your feet most of the time so by the time you get back to the hotel you are knocked out anyway. One negative, I did see traces of mold in the shower which I thought was disturbing especially since it was a beautifully remodeled bathroom. In nyc you will see this in many hotels since the buildings are old and there is not adequate air circulation. All in all I would definetely stay here again, the hotel was clean, lively, and happy!

We didn't use any of the food services in the hotel so cannot comment on that area but the bar located in the hotel was always full with people so it must be good.

You can also take the subway for a lot less to either airport, but will have to take the bus part of the way. The staff was very nice and polite. The hotel is close to central park. I think their last renovation was in 2004, so it was practically a brand new hotel on our first visit. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, although i'm sure my wife wouldn't. I don't think the hotel is bad at all for the price we paid. But just beware that if you're looking for a luxurious hotel with plush accommodations, you may not see it at this hotel.

I booked though a certain low fair website that doesn't show names. It was worth that price, but not much more. Pros: Location - 6 train right outside the door (one stop from Grand Central), E and V trains 2 blocks north. Rockefeller center is a 10 minute walk away. It isn't even too unreasonable to walk to Times Square (although the E train to 42nd street/PABT is faster, but just 4 stops). Rooms: Good size for Manhattan. Private bathroom, but a small one. Parking: Attached garage offers discounted $30/night parking for guests. Just get your Valet ticket stamped at the front desk. Cons: Climate control: Couldn't find a thermostat. Just had a choice of High or Low. Overpriced amenities: Roll away bed for $50/night (glad I bought the air mattress, which the maids were even kind enough to make up every day). Don't even touch the minibar or the stuff they leave set out. There are sensors. Internet would have been an arm and a leg. Fortunately, I could connect to the Cornell Medical School wi-fi from my room. Elevators: In the morning, I had to wait 15 or so minutes before an empty enough elevator made it to the 8th floor to go down. Should have just taken the stairs. A minor inconvenience, but still. I didn't go for room service or anything else, so I won't comment on that. All and all, it's a room that would only cost $90 or less outside the city.

There was no stopper for the drain in the sink so one had to simply waste all the water down the drain when using the sink. Also the hotel engages in deceit to gouge the innocent that would make MADOFF proud! There is a tray in the room that appears to have items that are complimentary such as a bottle of water... However one will soon discover that if you touch any item on the tray for 20 seconds (I am not kidding) you pay $7.00 for each item. Finally if you park in the garage make certain that you have the receipt stamped at the hotel as you will pay the discount rate of $30.00. If you forget to have it stamped you will pay the full price. We ended up paying 440.00 for 2 nights which ironically is considered a bargain to some for NYC.

After booking my hotel fare through Priceline, I called the hotel to make a few requests for my two hotel rooms. I asked the reservation attendant if she would include in my reservations that, if possible, I would like two rooms with double beds, views of New York (as this was my first visit to the city), and early check-in. She explained that she could not guarantee any of these requests, but that these types of requests can usually be accomodated. When my traveling companions and I arrived to the hotel on June 6, we were told that the rooms were not ready and that there were no double-bed rooms available. I expressed my disappointment to the front desk attendant, and explained that we had two males and two females in our party (non-couples) that would not feel comfortable sharing a bed. She offered us two cots for the two rooms, for $50 per cot, per night. This would be an additional $200 for our stay. When I asked why the cots were so much more, the front desk clerk merely shrugged her shoulders and did not reply. At this point, I felt that she was being rude, and asked if I could speak to the manager. When the manager came over, he seemed immediately confrontational and hostile. I wanted to tell him that I understood the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, but felt upset that I would be charged so much more to keep my companions comfortable. Instead he kept repeating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what do you want me to do about it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, I suggested a discounted rate for the cots. He said that he would ask housekeeping if he could discount the rate, but that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to make any promises. At this point, other guests were watching our interaction and I was becoming embarrassed by his demeanor. So, I said that would be fine, and that I would come back in two hours to see if my rooms were ready. When I returned, only one room was ready so all four of us went up to the single room to change for dinner. When we returned from dinner, the desk attendants had switched shifts and we were helped by a different clerk. He told us that there was a double bed available for the second room, which he gave us. On the last day, as I checked out, I asked the clerk if there were any additional charges for the room. She told me that there was an $8 fee for the mini-bar, for an item that I did not purchase. I explained that I did not purchase an item, and she gave me a disbelieving stare. She said that she was going to send someone up to check the mini-bar in the room, to confirm that nothing was missing. I told her that would be fine. She then took the keys from me, told me that she took the charge off the bill, and waived her hand to dismiss me. At this point, I requested a complimentary cookie, because I had not received one during any of my check-ins. She handed me one bag, and then waived her hand a second time to dismiss me. Although I fully understand that my requests were not guaranteed, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that I received the customer service that I have come to expect from the Hilton brand. I also found it very disrespectful that during my interactions with the hotel staff, I had the clerks iterate to me (and the manager during the initial confrontation) that I was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Priceline customer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as if this had a decidedly negative connotation. Beyond this lack of service, the hotel also had some amenity issues. The first room was directly adjacent to the Fire Department and did not have a cot. The second room also did not have a cot, and smelled like smoke (even though it was on a non-smoking floor). The first bathroom smelled like mildew and the sink would spray water everywhere. The other bathroom had a screw where the handle for the shower faucet should have been. Lastly, when we tried to call for the much-advertised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast, lunch, dinner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room service, we were told that they were not open from 11am until 6pm. Based on the last encounter with management, I chose not to complain in person again, but instead filled out the survey that was left in the room. I dropped the survey off on the morning of my second day, and included my name, address, phone number, and hotel rooms on the card. However, I was never contacted regarding my concerns. Also, the cot situation was never followed up, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the last day that I was sure I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be charged for them.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eagle Pass, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms and bathroom was dirty\u201d", "Author": "TX_Flyer001", "ReviewID": "UR31531706", "Content": "This hotel is not up to Doubeltree standards.

Front desk staff did not welcome us, grabbed the money of us and took an extra $300 of us as a security deposit. When I asked why I couldn't use my credit card for that, he would not answer. This meant that we did not have the money for Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. He then threw the cookies down on the desk and broke. The worst thing about this experience was that he ruined the suprise I had for my girlfriend in the room (strawberries and chocolate sauce) The room was very big with large but not too comfortable bed on 14th floor. Location of the hotel was great. Just beside the subway stop. On the first day I rang for extra blankets. These didn't arrive by the next day so on the way out of the hotel to go sightseeing I mentioned it to one of the staff on front desk (Jacinta) She was not helpful at all and quite rude. I was very taken aback by her attitude. She shouted after me as I walked away. When I came back I complained to a supervisor who was very apologetic and said she would sort everything out. That never happened Thoroughly disatisfied, I rang the General Manager who was on holidays, great! I spent three days trying to reach a manager and then on the last night Miguel rang the room and asked what the trouble was.

Breakfast (which was included in our rate) was a welcome bonus. If you can get a good rate for this hotel it's probably worth taking but there are certainly nicer hotels in the area if you're prepared to spend a bit more.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orpington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn Average City Hotel\u201d", "Author": "W0rldTraveller09", "ReviewID": "UR26273696", "Content": "Stayed here mid-February 09 for a city break in New York. Firstly the location of this hotel is very, very good. Easily accessible by subway as 51 St/Lexington Ave station (which is served by the E Train which runs to/from JFK Airport) is right outside the main entrance. It's also walking distance from The Rockefeller Center and only a little further to Times Square and Broadway. The reception area of the hotel is attractive and modern, and the reception staff were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out. The signature DoubleTree welcome cookies were an extra treat and very tasty (still warm too)! We were allocated a standard twin room on the sixth floor. The room was an average size for a city hotel and was functional but a little tired in places. Whilst all the surfaces were very clean, it was evident that the furniture was quite worn. There was also some evidence of dampness in some patches on the ceiling by peeling paint, particularly in the bathroom. A picture above one of the beds in the room also had some very minor graffiti written in biro on it. Another minor issue is that whilst we didn't have a problem with traffic noise (our room looked over a quiet side-street), noise does travel inside the building, particularly through the walls from guests in neighbouring rooms or walking past in the corridor. Despite these 'niggles' though, the beds were very comfortable with clean bed linen and nice soft pillows. A review here reports bed-bugs but we never found any during the four nights we stayed there. The bathroom and towels were also clean. The temperature and water pressure in the shower is just right too! The large HD TV in the room was a great bonus, with a reasonable selection of channels. Also liked the 'View on Demand' feature where you could 'rent' movies using the on-screen menus. Only other thing that would have been nice in the room was tea/coffee making facilities, rather than having to go to the cafe outside the hotel to buy it. One other minor complaint was that house-keeping weren't very consistant in their timings. They came every day, but one day our room wasn't serviced until gone 8pm in the evening. Whilst we didn't have dinner in the hotel restaurant, we found that the breakfast buffet was expensive and so only used it on our first morning. However this wasn't a problem, as New York is full of small coffee shops and cafes that serve very nice breakfasts, so you only have to go for a little walk to find something. Lastly, the hotel Concierge were extremely helpful in organising some great activities and entertainment during our stay in New York. So overall I recommend the DoubleTree Metropolitan for business travellers and the tourist who like to go out and explore most of the time who's just looking for a place to sleep. If you like a bit of luxury, this probably isn't for you. It's in a great location and is clean and comfortable. Just needs a lick of paint here and there.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "EZT", "ReviewID": "UR26122468", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights in early March 09.

The friendly counter lady moved me from a room on the 2nd floor that faces the noisy street to one on the 7th that faces a quiet alley. I went upstairs and ate my delicious warm signature welcome cookie. The room was nice enough. Clean and well situated. I noticed that the chain lock plate on my door was installed backwards, ie. ineffective (ineffective when installed correctly too). Unfortunately, there was this tumbling, knocking noise that seemed to be from the room next door (but wasn't) that began at about 8am and ended at midnight each day. Laundry chute? You will hear every whisper/drunken rant from the hallway. Some guests feel the need to talk loudly at 3am. Uh. The door also lets in quite a bit of light when closed so plan to use some extra towels if you want a good nights sleep. Even then the rooms are too bright IMO. This hotel has been renovated but it still shows it's age in its doors, beds and some carpeted areas. The beds are lumpy but soft and they are the type that you can \"sink into\", which I like. If you like firm, go somewhere else. There are no blankets so turn up your heat on cold nights. Beware the minibar. It actually has a first aid kit for $8! BYOB, bring your own band aids! The shower was hot and had great water pressure. Plenty of towels and good quality freebies (shampoo, soup, etc.). The toilets have a rocket powered, loud flush. The toilet paper is very cheap, one ply. The sink is powerful and you will get water all over until you get the hang of it. The closet is large and had enough wooden hangers for two people, also a safe that I didn't use. Their is a charge for net access from your room but wifi is free in the lobby. Every hour of everyday, you'll find folks with their laptops in the lobby, clicking away. The decor is modern but not overly so. Better then average hotel art adorns the walls. The palette of the rooms and hallways are nice on the eyes. The tv does not give you listings, only channels (We, MTV, etc). To find out what is actually on, you have to flip using the worn remote. I had to mash the buttons to get it to work well. Lots of news (loud talking head) channels. I did not eat at the hotel. I did notice that the bar is fairly busy in the evenings (you have to walk by it to get to the elevators). The location is right at the 51st street subway exit. A very good and convenient location for midtown travelers. The restaurants around this area are overpriced however, bring a good guide book, check the local websites and find other eateries elsewhere (west 50's is a good spot). The exception is Ess-a-bagel which is right around the corner. You must go there and enjoy their large, yummy bagels. The doormen are quick for their tips. The hotel will store your luggage for free when you arrive (which I didn't have to do but had inquired about before traveling) but they charge you $1 per bag to store and then $1 per bag to retrieve once you check out. Talk about nickel and diming you. When no one was available to retrieve our bags from the unsecured room, we got them ourselves. I noticed a bellhop began a mini-sprint to us once he saw us exit with our bags. He stopped short realizing he had missed his chance for $2. You should tip a min. $1 per bag, per handling and I certainly tip but an outright fee is silly. The fee could be due to cheapskate who don't tip. First rule of traveling/eating out, if you can't afford a tip, don't go out. This is a good hotel for those who get out of their room and explore, getting so much exercise that they can sleep through the noise. That is fairly general for all midtown NYC hotels... if you aren't accustomed to urban noise at night. If you are looking for an upscale place, this isn't it. If you like to hang out in your room and luxuriate, this isn't it. Doubletree Metropolitan is just above average in my opinion and has its pros and cons.

When I checked into my hotel, I disregarded the girl at the front desk's (Tina) unfriendly welcome as just the \"NYC attitude\" when she slammed down 2 bags of warm DoubleTree cookies on the counter. I shrugged it off because I was here on vacation, and nothing was going to spoil my optimism to explore this great city. Upon entering, the room was a bit smaller than expected from the pictures online. Again, I overlooked this inconvenience as another NYC characteristic. I noticed automatically that the sink and bathroom countertops were not clean. After several attempts to connect to the internet, which is $13.95/day for wifi service that is slower than dial-up, my room was charged every time I signed on regardless of the daily rate. The hotel said it was a \"system glitch.\" I stayed for a total of 3 nights. On the 2nd morning, I found one small bug on my pillow. I thought, \"Hmm, maybe it's just a random bug that got lost.\" The next morning, my friend and I found 4 more bugs that were significantly larger than the one from the day before. They were roaming on the bed, underneath the covers. The manager of the hotel said it's a big problem for NYC, and it happens everywhere. The Director of Operations blamed it on the European tourists. They shrugged it off like it was not a big deal, but I'd like to see them roll around with a bunch of bed bugs for a few nights. I had higher standards for a DoubleTree hotel. Don't stay here unless you want the bed bugs to bite. The only pro was that it was convenient to catch the subway on Lexington.

We had \"carry on\" size luggage so the bellman never even approached us - I prefer to deal with my own luggage. This trip was a rewards certificate from Hitlon Honors 80,000 points for two nights. Kathy M at the front desk was super nice and honored my request of a high floor (#1604).

The decor in the bar was a hodge podge of a 70's flea market.. It seemed dirty lots of food crumbs on the floor and hardly any customers. The Staff from the maid to an Assistant Manager were friendly - I was shocked that the maids in the hall went out of their way to greet you. My one issue was in my opinion being lied to or at least misled by a female Concierge. Upon arrival we asked about going to the Statue of Liberty she tried to dissuade me by saying it would be too crowded on the normal ferries. She was much too quick in whipping out a private cruise boat and trying to get me on their cruise.

At the end of our stay we had a bill for the minibar for three items, when we had not even opened the fridge nevermind take things off the ultra-sensitive shelf, but the staff removed them off the bill without any fuss. Our room was also facing the fire and police station, but I think we only noticed the sirens maybe three times in our stay, no problem at all. When we extended our stay we changed rooms, we were allowed to stay in our room past check out time until the next room was ready which was before 3pm, and we were upgraded to and king size room for free which was just that bit bigger then the queen but it made a lot of difference, as the queen was ok, but a bit small with the suitcases in. I would say the one downside to our stay was being next to nosiy guests in the 1st room which was next to some very noisy teenagers who had no respect at all for the other guests, twice security was called to quieten them down, i personally think they should have been thrown out the 2nd time as they would come in around 4-5am shouting screaming down the corridors and in their room. It would seem the walls were a bit too thin. As i said, great location, only a walk away from times square, 5th avu etc, or just as easily get the subway as the station was right next door and you can get a day pass for only $7! bargain! We ate at Pax for breakfast which is just around the corner as they had breakfast specials which were cheap enough and good quality, but also try Ess a Bagel and Metro cafe next door for the sandwiches and salads. Overall, a good hotel in which i would stay again!", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cA book's cover hides some imperfections\u201d", "Author": "Travel4FunBoston", "ReviewID": "UR23467343", "Content": "We stayed for 1 night in January.

The hotel is just steps from Rockefeller Plaza and St Patricks and is within walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. The room was a good size, especially for NYC and the shower pressuer was great! The bed was very comfy, in room mini bar and gorgeous flat screen HD tv! All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Cons - No on site parking. The parking garage they've arranged with is within a half block, but is still a hassle to schlep your luggage. Also, when I went to pull in they told me the garage was full until I told them I was with the hotel and only staying one night. Bear in mind I was there just before New Years Eve and the town was packed already. When I did leave however, there were several scratches on my rear bumper. Of course I didnt notice until after I got home so check your car before you pull out!!!! Also, the lobby was very unimpressive and dungeon like. There was no room service until after 4 pm because they're doing renovations on their restaurants. There was no in room coffee. Also, the service in the on site restaurant was very slow.

The bathroom is rather small although the sink is outside the bathroom itself, which is a nice feature. The flat screen TV is HUGE and is great! There is a great floor to ceiling mirror in the room as well as a great big desk that is nice for storage. Elevators are extrememly fast and the conceirge is quite helpful. Subway is right outside the hotel and so are taxis. CONS: Be aware that there is a police station across the street so sirens are quite loud throughout the day (not bad at night.) Sleeping in or taking a quick afternoon cat nap is really not possible if you are a light sleeper. Also, bathrooms do not have fan blowers, which bothers some people. Walls are very thin and you can hear people passing in the hallways (turning air conditioning or heat on high definitely helps with the sirens and hallway noises.) RECOMMENDATIONS: Check out Pax which is a great breakfast spot. It is a block away- on 51st and 3rd- and has everything from bagels to yogurt/granola parfait to cereal to hot breakfasts. Upstairs, second floor seating is available for people watching or just enjoying the newspaper while overlooking the bustling NYC streets. Also, the Metro Cafe which is right next door to the hotel is great!! It has a salad bar, a pasta bar, and everything from quick bites to eat (like sandwiches and side dishes) to munchies (nuts, fruit salads, cookies, chips) to freshly made sandwiches and paninis. The prices aren't too bad (for NYC that is) and won't blow your budget. The Cornerstone restaurant is a great lunch spot down a few blocks from the hotel on 2nd Ave ( I think.) It is a fun little pub style place with a top notch lunch menu. Prices are great, too (for NYC.)

I would love to say that our minibar bill was a mistake since it was quite large, but truthfully, we couldn't find a liquor store open after 9pm so we pretty much cleaned the room out of alcohol. What ever happened to the \"city that never sleeps???\" In the end, we decided to stay in the room and enjoy beverages because we could smoke there plus it was still cheaper than a NYC bar....and we could wear our pajamas while doing so. The location couldn't be better. There is a metro stop right outside the hotel and it was an easy subway ride to Yankee Stadium or anywhere else throughout Manhattan. This is certainly the cheapest and most efficient way to travel in the city. Midtown is very safe so you can feel comfortable walking alone almost anytime except the very early morning hours. We parked in the garage around the corner from the main entrance for $30/24 hours which is a good price for this part of town. The hotel has an agreement with the parking facility and you just have to get your valet ticket stamped at the desk to get the special rate. Our only tiny gripe was that the prices stated on the minibar menu differed from the ones on our bill at checkout. I brought this to the manager's attention and he rectified it right then with no problem. We were very pleased and would stay there again.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cDecent place with bad AC\u201d", "Author": "1goirish", "ReviewID": "UR17960352", "Content": "This DoubleTree has a good location, fairly close to Grand Central Station.

It is very close to a subway, very close to walk to great tourist and shopping areas, it is easy to get to almost any spot from the hotel. The beds are very good and the pillows are great. The room is a little small for more than 2 people but was adequate for us. The bathroom is newly remodeled and while small, very nice. Another positive was the doorman at 5am. He could not have been any nicer or more helpful. The negatives: Maybe too many to write all. I booked and paid for the hotel about a month in advance. I asked for an upper floor with a view, got the fourth floor with a view of a wall and air conditioning unit. Called and asked for different room and was told all Lexington Ave rooms were private apartments and nothing else was available. We were not able to check in at 1pm and had to place our bags in \"storage\" for a $1.00 per bag. Since we were going to walk around we placed backpack and large overnight bag so the total was $6.00. Imagine our shock when we came back in and had to pay another $6.00 to get them out of the closet. Not a bellboy bringing them to our room, but us walking into the closet and getting them. Just the beginning of the nickel and dime charges we experienced during our visit. We were not offered cookies and someone wrote about free bottled water, well, we were not offered anything that was free. I had asked when I made my reservations if there was a fridge in the room to place insulin and was told yes. There is a fridge but it is so full of items that 2 vials of insulin kept knocking a beer off to the side and were charged $6.00 numerous times. I asked if we could have someone take out the items and leave the fridge for us to use and was told no, but if an empty fridge became available, they would bring it up for a charge. They did take off the charges of the beer when we checked out (sort of). My daughter had arrived before I did and she put up a credit card for incidentals. Four days after checkout her credit card was still holding $180 pending charges. $50 a day plus the mini bar charges I was told would be taken off. They took the items off when we called to ask about the pending charges and they said the $50 a day incidental charge would come off the next day. Wow, holding this money for 5 days is really not acceptable to me. You have to pay for Internet access to the amount of $13.00 a day which is very unusual these days. I cannot think of anything that came as complimentary. I would really check around before staying here again and figure in the price of the things that are usually free at other hotels. I think this hotel was about $20 a night cheaper than the other 2 in the area and with the extra charges probably came out to be about $15 a night more expensive. The concierge was VERY rude and quite insulting when I asked for a map of the area. I suppose because I was not booking anything through them, he assumed it was ok to be rude. Once again, not what I was expecting. We were going to see if we could book a play through them and then decided we would plan everything else ourself so as to not be in a position to tip these horrid people.

Admittedly, it was my first experience of Manhattan hotels, but I refuse to believe that this is the best that 300 dollars can buy. The staff were civil, but not in any way warm, welcoming or helpful. Staying here, you're very aware of staying in a large hotel chain - the general feeling is totally impersonal. As for facilities, the restaurant is ok - but again very expensive and the food ok but nowhere near 4-star standard.

No tea or coffee facilities in the room which seems to be the norm for New York. The only downside to this hotel was the Fire Station & Police station at the end of the block, which due to the one way system all emergency vehicle traffic passes your room especially if you have a front or side facing room you will hear a variety of sirens through the night. Book your limo if you want one through the hotel and at all costs avoid Lincoln Limo's of New York www.lincolnlimousine.com unless you are particularly fond of rallying in city traffic in a battered filthy LIMO with only one working seatbelt and a driver who had very successful charisma bypass operation and paying 152 dollars for the experience. Not exactly the surprise I had hoped for my family when telling them as we walked through arrivals that one of the smartly dressed Chauffeurs with name boards will be for us.

Although the beds took up the majority of the floor space, the room was definitely larger than expected and equivalent in size to rooms I've had in other cities, whereas I ususally find NY rooms to be miniature. Desk set up was also functional and flat panel TV was nice. I found the beds to be extremely comfortable. I was on the 19th floor.

I found this to be one of my quieter hotel stays and slept better than I usually do in hotels. My only complaints are that the hotel room was a bit musty and temperature did not seem highly adjustable (although I did like that you could leave the unit on for venting and background noise). Only serious problem was that the bathroom smelled VERY strongly of mildew and mildew was visible between tiles and on the bottom of the shower curtain. Given the very small size of the bathroom, this was quite unpleasant. I thought the location was good. An easy walk to Times Square and even walkable to Herald Square shopping.

Beware of the cookies if you or your kids have nut allegries. They have walnuts in them. The front desk should tell you this when they hand them out.

On arrival to which we were early we were unsure whether we would be able to check in and didn't expect it, however we were greeted by the receptionist who must had a bad start to the day and had a right face on her!! On checking in, she confirmed to us that we were booked in for 2 nights which we stated at the time was incorrect and that we were actually booked in for 5, this she argued until she actually gave me chance to show the hotel voucher which stated 5. She then proceeded out the back to which my husband and I expected this to have been dealt with on her return, to which we got an all ok and she checked us in gave us a cookie without no have a nice day or nothing.

Never have i got dressed so quick to resolve this, having already contacted the company who'd organised our trip who confirmed the booking and emails confirmation all stated 5 nights!! The receptionist (different to the one on check in), just kept stating \"our system shows 2 nights and you're checking out today\" as you can understand things started to get a little strained. Luckily a deputy manager was near and overheard there was a problem and he informed the receptionist what to do and how to approach it, it was then we explained that we'd thought the problem had been resolved on check-in and didn't expect this half way through our stay. At this time the hotel excepted no responsibility for the error whilst they had no proof of the booking document, to which i then spent the next hour on my mobile phoning the UK to get the company to fax over the necessary documents. Even they stated that the hotel were not too helpful as they were ringing them to try and confirm that this had been received!!

I booked the hotel based on reviews, which I will never do again. First, the highlights of the hotel: The location and the warm cookie upon arrival. The following are a list of things that made me come to the conclusion that I will never stay at this hotel again. 1. The king bedroom was very small. (14 floor) 2. The toilet seat was small and plastic. The bathroom was so small when you sat on the toilet one knee touched the door and the other was on the bath tub. 3. The shower was not separate from the tub and when you took a shower the water in the tub raised to the top of the tub. For $600.00 for two nights the hotel should have had a stand up shower. 4. The restaurant inside the hotel prices were ridiculous!!!! A bowel of cold cereal with a banana was $12. Three buttermilk pancakes w/no sides costed $18. 5. The room contain a cold wet bar and a small snack bar. Check this out, the products all had sensors on them and if you picked the product up for more then 20 seconds to actually determine if you wanted to purchase it or not, the hotel charges it to your room. 6. Upon arrival there was a card on the bed from the hotel it stated, \"We only clean the bed linen every three days and when you check out, if you would like your linen cleaned before then to let us know.\" For $600.00 I would like my bed linen washed everyday without making a request. 7. Motels have HBO, the Doubletree only had basic cable and wanted you to pay for movies. For less money the hotel would have been fine however I expected more for my money. I would not recommend this hotel for the price. I saw another review on this site from a person who stayed during the same dates and he only paid $135 per night.

The hotel restaurant was very expensive so we didnt eat there- the cafe next door does a very resonably priced breakfast which was delicious!Overall we felt we really got value for money staying here however the room was very small and I think if we had paid any more for our stay we would have been disappointed. Also a quick note- the hotel website says hotel has had a very expensive renovation-however our room was obviously a old room that had received a lick of paint and some new furniture-the bathroom tiles were broken in places and the paint chipped off the door and doorframes. Plus the halls leading to the rooms were grubby with large patches of wallpaper missing in places- i think whoever did the renovation didnt do a very high quality job of it and as a regular Hilton hotels visitor there was no comparision between this and other Hiltons I have stayed at.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOnly if the price is right!\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie99", "ReviewID": "UR12415660", "Content": "Hotels in NYC are never cheap and are often way over priced.

I decided to cross my fingers and went ahead and booked a room for Christmas Eve as they were running extremely low rates for that night. Needless to say, by the following day, I felt sorry for any traveler who paid a penny more than me. The Front Desk Representative who checked me in was not the least bit friendly. In fact, she seemed bothered by my inquiry to upgrade my room for a fee (I didn't mind paying but she had an attitude over having to go through the trouble of looking it up on her system). When that didn't work out, I asked to switch my room from a King to two doubles and that set off more sighs from the Rep. I don't even think she finished looking it up in the system, she just told me that she was going to give me the room I booked (King). When I asked for a roll-away bed, she told me they charge $50 for it. By that time, I had it with her negative attitude and snapped back at her. She then left the front desk and when she returned, she told me that her Manager was going to waive the $50 charge but that I should know in the future, there would definitely be a charge (like I would consider going back there after the way she represented the Doubletree). I checked in at 1:00 PM and assumed that they would be bringing the roll-away bed at some point. My family and I hit the town and came back at 5:00 PM. Still no bed so I placed a phone call to the Front Desk who told me they don't handle roll-away beds, I needed to call Housekeeping. I called the Housekeeping Extension and Housekeeping told me I would have to call the Customer Care desk. The Customer Care desk stated they would send Housekeeping right up with it. In the meantime, I ventured over to the Concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk to see if they could help make a dinner reservation for me. The Rep. was very short with me and said that all places in the area were booked. I would have to chance a walk in. Not much help there, just more of the Doubletree unfriendly attitude! An hour later I went back to my room and still no bed. Called a 2nd time to the Customer Care desk and same Rep. answered the phone. She apologized and stated she would contact Housekeeping again and have the bed sent right away. I knew we were planning on being out late and wanted to have the bed set up so my son could go right to sleep. We left for dinner assuming the bed would be delivered as promised, after all, it had been 2 hours since we were first told it would be delivered right away. We came back from dinner at 9:30 PM and par for the course, the bed still had not arrived. Yet there was a message on our phone from the same Customer Care Rep. stating she hoped by the time we received the message, our bed would have arrived. I called back down to her, but her shift had ended and I had to start all over with a new Customer Care Rep. who didn't know I was waiting for anything. She too promised to contact Housekeeping and get the bed to me right away. That \"right away\" ended up taking another 90 minutes. Besides all of the Customer Service issues we experienced, the room itself had an odor to it. I laughed when I looked at the bathtub area and noticed exactly what was mentioned in another Tripadvisor review, the black mold was simply painted over in many spots throughout the stall and the ceiling. We opted not to even shower at the hotel (which is rare for hygiene conscious people like us) and wait until we got back home that morning. What's sad is that on our way to the Doubletree, we walked past our favorite chain hotel, Marriott and my husband asked me why I didn't book there. I told him the rate at the Doubletree was too good to not try-out. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that \"you get what you paid for.\" Despite the dismal hotel experience, NYC was fabulous and if you go, there is a fantastic Italian Restaurant called \"San Martin\" on 49th Street that we ate at. They were reasonably priced (especially for NYC), the food was delicious and the staff were all so hospitable!

There was a choice of rooms and rates available on the website, with a higher rate for a room with a 24-hour cancellation policy -- I believe their regular requirement was seven-day cancellation. The doorman was immediately attentive to my arrival, even though he was busy, welcomed me, and handed my bag off to a bellman. There was a hostess (for lack of a better term) in the lobby, who also welcomed me and pointed me to an available front desk person for check-in, which was friendly and efficient. The bellman who accompanied me with my bag was friendly as well, and covered the hotel facilities in detail for me. The room was somewhat larger than I expected for New York City, clean, with a flat-screen TV. There was a sort of mini-sofa in addition to the king bed, and sufficient room to set my suitcase up as well. The bathroom was adequate, with enough counter size for my shaving kit; tub/shower and toilet were in a separate room. The shower head was high enough -- I hate the hotel shower head aimed at my chest -- and produced plenty of hot water with little wait. The view was of the buildings across Lexington. There was a minibar with snacks and a couple of mystery boxes -- I picked one up (it was a sewing kit, label side down) spotted the sensor, and put it right back down -- not quickly enough, apparently. You supposedly have 20 seconds on this one -- they've apparently been devalued, too. (More later about this.) I had to get a cab at 6PM, almost impossible in New York, and the bellman found something for me -- he didn't just stand and whistle, but went out in the middle of the intersection to grab one. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fine: good selection, excellent service. There was a coffee shop as well, full of New Yorkers grabbing a cup en route to the office. I don't usually fix coffee in my room, so I didn't really miss a coffeemaker; I'm sure others will. Checkout was efficient: again, the \"hostess\" asked me if the bill slipped under my door was sufficient (it wasn't) and directed me to an open position. Friendly service again -- I had been charged $7.50 plus tax(es), twice for the minibar. OK, once for the sewing kit, but I have no idea what the second could have been. Both were removed from my bill -- apparently this isn't uncommon. I'd wanted a hotel where I could check in quickly, get to my dinner, have a good sleep, hot shower and good breakfast, and quick check-out.

Unless you consider a large building blocking out all the sun and anything else to see a view, I would strongly disagree. A park, that's a view. A landscape of city lights, that's a view. A river, that's a view. A slab of concrete? Not a view. Also, I should not, that when I did open up my blinds there was a scotch-taped sign on the window that read something to the effect of, \"Construction is going on outside this building. You might want to keep your blinds closed because construction workers will be looking in.\" So, even if there was a view-- they were trying to get me not to see it anyway. Hey, maybe they thought the scotch-taped sign was the view! It did have nice font. 2. The air-conditioner wasn't working. So, I do have to admit I did have a sauna in my room which was an unexpected treat. Well, not really much of a treat since the sauna was the entire room. They never sent someone up as promised, and wouldn't respond to my request to change a room. Maybe the entire hotel was just rooms of saunas. 3. The next morning upon check out to find a better hotel, which would at this point have meant a park bench, I spoke to a \"manager\" (he had a tag that read \"manager\" but considering his inability to manage maybe he got them at a a real manager at a hotel he stayed at the way a kid gets those plastic pilot wings from the real captain on a plane). This \"manager\" had a \"so sad, too bad\" attitude. He actually tried to tell me that the room I had did indeed have a view. \"Slabs of concrete are very popular views in New York City. You're very lucky to have had a room with that kind of view!\" When I told him about the sauna, he tried to charge me extra because I was not supposed to get a room with a sauna. He didn't even realize any of their rooms had personal saunas. Okay, I exaggerate a bit. But this next part I don't. He actually asked me if I knew how to turn on the air-conditioner. That perhaps I didn't know how to switch the button from \"off\" to \"on\" and it was my fault and not the hotels. Granted, I'm no rocket scientist, but I have learned how to do that. Even the desk guy was shocked at this question, probably because the \"manager\" had the nerve to ask it twice. Possibly he thought I could not only not turn things \"on\" but that I didn't understand the english language. Sure, I speak with a NJ/NY accent but I was in NY and I have a very good command of NY language. I can say; \"Not for nothin,\" and \"are you gonna eat that,\" with the best of them. And I can most certainly understand lame questions because I know live in LA. My suggestion to anyone wanting to stay at this hotel is to check yourself into Bellevue first because you need to have your head examined.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "hawaiibeen", "ReviewID": "UR10068108", "Content": "We had a great time, the location is good, close to the subway right across the street.

We used the subway to get to the Financial District to see ground zero and wall street. This way really easy and much quicker than a taxi as the roads are gridlock.

Our room looked nice, the service was great, I even boasted to my boyfriend how great of taste I had. Unfortunately later on he would have the uper hand. The first night we found out how noisy it was. You heard perfectly the people showering above us. We can't really complain about the noise outside as it IS NYC, but I do not recommend staying on the Lexington St. side. Going through our room and walking down the hall, we were really let down. The wall paper in the halls were peeling, and the siding was falling off of the wall. Our room had water damage and beside the sink vanity looked like it was never cleaned. *we got that taken care of after 3 calls*. Our large lamp also did not work, and even after the housekeeping lady tried it infront of us, it was never fixed. Also, the ice machine and \"vending machines\" which was a single pop machine was the scariest site we both saw. Located in a dark, dirty room by the service elevators and janitors closet, there was garbage, old mops and broken equiptment everywhere. I definately did not go back and made my poor boyfriend make that \"lovely\" trip. Our \"anti-slip\" tub was anything but after my boyfriend took a nasty spill and still has the lump to prove it. Please get the bathmat offered if you call. Though the room service was friendly, the food was HORRIBLE. We had breakfast one morning, and then went to the restaurant the next, and both were very bad experiences. We left our room on the 3rd day by 11am and when we returned at 6pm that evening, our room was not cleaned. If we didn't have a broadway to go to that night, we would have to wait outside the room while it was cleaned or wait until the next day. Our \"stocked\" mini bar was never stocked even when we called 3 times. Unfortunately the only real \"plus\" we could think of for this hotel was the cookies. They are delicious! haha but other than that, we left unsatisfied. The hotel looks wonderful and the rooms amazing, until you really look at what you're paying for. Perhaps if we coughed up the money to stay in a guest suite or one of the larger rooms *we had a queen, non-smoking*, but I wouldn't risk the money.

However, watch the menu bar as they will charge you every day if you or the maid bumps the tray. It automatically hits your bill whether you take anything or not. It's supposed to allow you to pick up something and look at it for 20 seconds before billing you. I didn't use the mini-bar at all and got charges everyday. Anyway, try to get a completed bill when you leave. The clerk refused to give me one when I checked out, and indeed they hit my CC for some more menu-bar charges after I left.

Convenient to Grand Central and there is a subway station right at the corner. Staff and service were very helpful. My room was on the 7th floor on the Lexington Avenue side. I was concerned that the street noise at that level would be unbearable, as I'd experienced several years earlier at the nearby Marriott East Side. This hotel was much quieter than that one, which was a pleasant surprise. The room was surprisingly quiet. it was also about $100/night cheaper. However, the rooms are clearly dated despite renovation attempts. The bathroom is tiny and feels cramped when showering. Water flow is good, however. The bed was very comfortable. Circulation for A/C and heat is poor, so the best way to ventilate was keep the window open. As a business traveler, I was frustrated by the lousy electrical sockets. They are not well situated in the room, and over half of them were so loose and rickety that PC and Blackberry power plugs would slide out and not stay plugged in. The TV also seemed to reset itself and turn on at midnight each night. Another co-worker's TV would turn on but not display video. It took the hotel 3 days to correct the issue, which ended up being a simple matter of correctly programming the TV remote. Not a great hotel if you'll spend a lot of time in the room.

We had booked directly through the hotel's website so we could make specific requests (twin beds, connecting rooms) which travel agents could not guarantee. It was a little more expensive, but we thought worth it to be sure of what we would be getting. Upon arrival at 4 p.m. we were told if we wanted these requests filled we would have to wait for our rooms, which we agreed to do. After 45 minutes I returned and was told 1 room was ready.

The rate varied with each night (from a low of $139 to a high of $199). Oddly, Quikbook offered the four different rates for my stay, whereas the Hilton website only offered the highest rate for all 4 nights (i.e. $199 x 4). When I called to see if I could book directly with the hotel at the rates of $139, 159, 179 and 199), I was told no (although I guess I could have achieved the same result by making 4 separate bookings ....) Overall, I was happy with our stay. The location was perfect for my business trip (meetings mostly in midtown east) and for shopping. I much prefer this area (which is near where I used to live) to the Times Square area (where I'd stayed a few weeks ago - at the Westin). There is a subway stop right beside the hotel and Grand Central is a short walk away. Our room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was of a reasonable size and had good water pressure and reliable hot water levels. Housekeeping was friendly and efficient; the woman who cleaned our room each day did a great job of accommodating our needs (we had to spend a lot of the time in the room working and/or studying), and cleaned around us when we had to stay in. There is a decent choice of nearby cafes (Au Bon Pain is one of the best). As I recalled from when I lived in this neighbourhood, there seem to be relatively few restaurants on Lexington or Third Avenue just to the East. You'll have much more choice if you walk one more block further east to Second Avenue. There were a number of irritating aspects of our visit, though. First, most of the front desk staff we dealt with were brusque and unhelpful (the exception was the supervisor who dealt with some problems with our bill on check-out; he was very service-oriented and professional). As others have mentioned, there is no minibar or coffee maker in the room. At this price, a free cup of in-room coffee in the morning would seem appropriate. Of course, the room was so tiny, there was practically no room for either appliance. The room is so tiny, there was only enough space for a small armchair jammed up between the bedside table and the window. There was so little space, it was impossible to sit in the chair. Internet was $10.77 a day (better than some hotels, but not cheap); frustratingly, the box and wire connection for the internet had such a short cord that it was impossible to sit on the bed (adjacent to the tiny desk - and only 18\" away from the box/wire contraption on the desk) and use one's laptop. (Note: There is a Fedex/Kinkos about 2 blocks north - a better value if you only need the internet for a short period of time or if you need to print something.) It costs $1 per bag to store a bag - perhaps I would have tipped that much but I think this sort of thing should be in the customer's discretion, not a fixed fee. Would I stay here again? Yes, because of the location and because the hotel is clean and the beds are comfortable - but I wish the hotel wouldn't nickel and dime its customers - and if I could afford the larger rooms, I'd pay for upgrade.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatwick, West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGood Stuff\u201d", "Author": "beauxl2002", "ReviewID": "UR6751179", "Content": "Location ideal, 5 mins to Grand Central, 10 mins to Times Square.

Impossible to do any of the prior mentioned while keeping the door open. No bathroom ventilation whatsoever, so even with the door wide open while bathing, the steam collected on the ceiling and condensed huge droplets even several hours later. The bathroom or shower curtain consistently smelled musty and even the paint /wallpaper was peeling from the excessive moisture. The in-room internet via television was circa 1992, I think. It would be faster & more legible to check your emails from your phone. The keyboard failed so we called a tech who came immediately but who could not fix the problem even with a new keyboard. Charges for the in-room internet were credited, although we had to ask twice.

Here are some tips for your stay: -- Parking The hotel has a $30 daily reduced rate ($40 standard rate) with the adjacent garage on 51st street. The garage is on the LEFT side of 51st as you approach Lexington Ave. It's the building just before the DoubleTree. As you leave the garage, use the small entrance on 51st into the hotel. This will save you the walk and hauling of your bags up to the hotel's Lexington Ave entrance. Get your parking ticket stamped at the hotel desk before picking up your car ... to save yourself a trip and to get the reduced rate! -- Hotel Location The hotel's front door is the only thing on Lexington Avenue. The hotel extends down 51st street. -- Room Location All even numbered rooms overlook 51st street. The view from these rooms is a towering black glass building directly across 51st with a reflection of the hotel being your primary view. Rooms are well insulated from street noise. All odd numbered rooms look out on a series of old brick buildings, A/C units and water towers behind the hotel. Not a nice view. Many of the queen rooms are positioned on this side of the hotel. The best rooms for a view are rooms numbered 02 and 04 on each floor (ie: 302, 1202, 1404, 1602, 1604, etc). These rooms are first two rooms on each floor, are located on and closest to the corner of 51st and Lexington and have extended views up Lexington. -- Rooms As others have said below, rooms are of a very good standard. All have plasma tv's, comfortable beds, ample space and good baths. -- Check in If your room's not ready upon your arrival, simply check your bags and go see the sites. No need to wait around in the lobby. You're in NY! Enjoy the city! -- Internet All rooms have a high speed connection. Charge is $10.77 per 24hrs. The electronic safe in the closet is big enough to fit a laptop. Our notebook is about 14.5\"L x 11.5\"W x 2\"H, and just fit in the safe. -- Getting Around Cabs are always outside the front door, the subway (4,5,6 Green Line) is on the corner of 51st & Lex to take you downtown. Crosstown lines are available on the corner of 53rd & Lex ... 2 blocks away. There's also an excellent (and free) city & tourist map available at the front desk & from the concierge. The map is well marked and includes all major landmarks, subway lines, etc. Overall, the hotel met our expectations and we would definately consider it for future stays.

Since ----- charges a booking fee, I then called the doubletree directly and they quoted us the same rate so we took it. Since it was our anniversary, we requested an early check in for noon vs. 3 pm. The room was not available until 4:30 which was very frustrating. The lobby was PACKED with people waiting. We had to stand the entire wait. They agreed to hold our luggage for $1 per bag so we paid $3 for them to hold our bags while we parked the car. Parking is $30 per 24 hrs/ plus tax and is located directly behind the hotel. (The men in the parking garage are very rude. I don't think they are part of the Doubletree hotel though.) Once the room was ready, they charged us another $3 to take the bags back again. This made me VERY annoyed. THIS IS VERY CHEAP on the part of Doubletree. You don't charge people to hold their bags, especially when we where waiting for our room for so long and wasted the entire afternoon in NYC checking in. The wait was a pain in such a packed, noisy waiting area. People were all over the seating on their laptops chatting away, burning time I'm assuming as they too waited for their room. They told us we'd have a room on the 9th floor with a view. When we got to the room, it faced a brick wall. I called the front desk and they put us on the 10th floor facing uptown and the view was nice and the room was larger than the queen and looked very chic and was very clean. The king bed was very comfortable. The room came with hair dryer/iron/iron board and a flat screen TV. Internet access, although the keyboard was broken and the service doesn't allow you to access your email and it costs $10.95 for 1/2 day. Bring a laptop. The room was super quiet. The A/C is not self regulated, it's regulated by the hotel, but I found the room comfortable. Neutrogena products are available in the room (soap, shampoo, conditioner). The sink area was separate for the shower, so it was great for couples getting ready. Lots of towels and they were quite nice. Loved the bedding. All white and very comfortable. TONS of pillows. :) Chaise in the room too for putting my luggage as I unpacked. Large closet with wood hangers. Lots of drawers to store all of your clothes. Windows open in case you feel the need to hear a little NYC night noise. I loved that the windows opened so I could here the cars 10 stories below. I have to have a little noise at night so that's why I opened them. Otherwise, you could have heard a pin drop if the window wasn't cracked. Great for light sleepers. The hotel staff , in general, were quite nice. There is a bar that is nice right off the lobby and a restaurant (we didn't eat there but it smelled nice!!) I heard that a gym was in the hotel too but with all the walking we did in NYC in 94 degree weather, we didn't make it to the gym. There was also a gift shop that looked very nice. The elevator was very quick.Taxis are ALWAYS outside in front of the hotel. Around the corner is the W hotel with a bar and a place called the Whiskey Bar. There is Starbucks, Au Bon Pain, Bliss spa, a great deli with buffet foods for breakfast, etc. within one block. The train was also within a block. Times Square, Bryant Park (eat at the outdoor Bryant Park Cafe at night - great cheap sandwiches and martinis), 5th Avenue, Central Park entrance within walking distance. But, if you love boutique shopping, bars and pubs and nightlife, don't stay here. This is mostly for tourists with kids doing the tourist thing. Lots of the 40+ crowd stayed here too - I saw groups of ladies and lots of older couples. Many screaming children in the hotel too so don't stay here if you are looking for the upscale hip crowd. But again, dead nightlife in this area and no real shopping except for 5th ave, which I found so amazingly boring. 5th Avenue has ZERO charm. I was so disappointed by the large department stores. SNOOZEville. Overall, the hotel was nice and I'd stay again if I was looking for a deal in NYC. But, I would NOT take a queen room - tiny room and bed plus the bed wasn't comfortable and the space was very tight. I wouldn't stay here unless I booked a King room. I was happy they upgraded me to a King for having to wait though, so doubletree if you're reading, thanks for that. Made wasting my entire afternoon in your lobby a little less painful. Also, if you're reading, don't charge people to hold their bags, super tacky. And at the end of the stay, don't have your hotel manager standing in the lobby approaching guests in line to check out telling you to rate them a 10 online.

We went there as a part of a American Girl package. The rooms are great. Spacious, clean, comfortable. The only problem we had was as to how to work the shower. Very confusing. Make sure they show you what to do. The cookies at check in were a hit with the granddaughter. Soft and warm. We stayed on the 11th flood and no outside sounds were noticed. The pillows were the best I have ever put my head on. And there were four pillows per bed. We had two double beds. They provided a bed for the American Girl doll my granddaughter brought with her. They also brought a rob, but they wanted $40.00 for it and we passed on that. Be careful about the prices for food. It cost me $20.00 for a buffet breakfast and $10.00 for the granddaughter. A little pricey for french toast, sausage, juice and coffee. The buffet does have a lot of food, and it is all tasty, but just too expensive. The service was excellent and prompt. If it were not so expensive and I could get the same room, I would stay there again. I think that since we had a package deal, that the price was quite high for 4 nights and five days. Location is great. Just a few blocks from 5th Avenue, St. Patricks, Rockafeller Center, The American Girl Place, Park Avenue, etc. We took a pedi cab one night when we were very tired and it cost us $15.00 for the short rride back to the hotel from 5th and 49th. The next night we thought we would do it again but this time they wanted $25.00. I said no and told them I would walk rather than pay that much for the ride. One of the other pedi cab drivers said he would do it for $15.00 and we went with his pedi cab. So be careful about the pedi cab charges. Ask BEFORE you get in as to how much they will charge you. There is a Fromms book (not a very big book) that has a wonderful map of Manhattan that was a great investment for me. It has detailed areas and a lot of great ideas.

We were very happy to receive rooms next to each other. I was a bit apprehensive when I read all the other negative reviews, but perhaps you get what you pay for. Our rooms weren't the cheapest, but they were very big for New York standards. The bathroom, however, was tiny but everything was there that you needed including nice Neutrogena products. The bed was very comfortable (perfect after walking all over New York). The air conditioning in my room did work well but was noisy - I was at the end of a corridor so I think that was why. My friend's was not as noisy. The room was well laid out and there was plenty of room for all our stuff. It did not have a minibar or fridge in the room, which we missed especially since it was so hot in New York. The hotel itself is in a good spot - walking distance to Moma, Central Park, shops on Fifth avenue, etc. The concierge was very helpful though the front office staff were a bit snobby. We ended up paying about US$240 per night direct from the hotel's website - this included a full buffet breakfast, so I felt that it was good value for the location, the size of the room and the breakfast.

I will never stay there again, but for some it might be an OK choice. First, except for the person who checked us in this last time (who was charming), the staff are either overworked, or totally indifferent, or just rude. I'm not sure which, but either way, no one really cares how your stay is. For instance I asked for more hangers three days in a row. Service is basically crappy, generally no one will answer the phone when you call reception. Location is very good, you can walk a lot of places. It's NY so plan ahead if you want to extend your stay, I've seen rates go from under $200 to over $600 in the course of one week. Housekeeping is very good, and the rooms I've stayed in are clean, and the beds are very comfortable, decent decor. AC is good (although I guess it was broken in some rooms last week). Beware that there are some VERY small rooms, but the ones I've stayed in are OK for NY. Ask at the desk not to be put in the extra tiny rooms -- I'm not sure what the numbers are but you can see from the fire safety maps on the wall -- go back and ask for a bigger room. Unless you hate NY traffic noise, get a room that is not on the back/inside side. I have stayed in both, and the big fans make a droning noise that to me is worse than traffic - zero view. The windows have heavy soundproof glass so you should be OK. try to get a room that is higher than the 10th floor or so -- there are only 18 floors in the hotel, so higher is better for less sound. My biggest complaint - we had a laptop and a hard drive stolen out of our suitcase from the luggage storage last year. Stupid me I actually said 'please put this somewhere safe, there is a laptop inside'. We discovered the loss the moment we got to the airport, but of course the hotel would take absolutely no responsibility and blamed us instead. I suppose they were so worried about liability that they could not be professional and instead were complete jerks - seriously, dealing with them about the theft was a terrible experience. No apologies, no callbacks, total runaround....nothing but hostiility. I recommend locks on your luggage, and check your luggage before you leave the luggage area. I'm sure this was a random event, or one bad apple or whatever, but I've never been so disrespected as I was when I was trying to deal with the stolen laptop. When I got the hotel again on priceline I thought it was a cosmic joke, cause i swore i'd never set foot there again..

I first stayed here in 2003 before it went through the much publicised \"extensive refurb\" and to be honest it hasn't made a huge difference. The lobby and bar area have certainly been improved, but as far as I can make out the only difference in the rooms are a basic flat screen TV, better beds and window blinds that may be more modern but are already showing signs of wear. They also put new shower curtains in. WOW!!!!! My biggest complaint is the the bathrooms are ridiculously small and claustrophobic. This month they gave me room 1402 which at least has a good view up Lex, but mostly the rooms have poor views (most look out over air conditioning units and the back of office blocks). Basically, if I weren't on tight corporate expenses, and I were paying with my own money I'd look for somewhere else with more character and better value. The gym facilities are not bad and it's worth dropping in for an hour after work. The doormen also have a nice little scam going with private cabs and will charge you $70 to JFK no doubt skimming $10 for themselves in the process. They're more interested in booking you a cab than they are in anything else. When you arrive at checkin they make a big deal of handing over one of their \"legendary Doubletree chocolate chip cookies\". I've never eaten one of them (mostly because I arrive after midnight!!) but to be honest it's a hollow gesture that doesn't even come close to making up for shortcomings elsewhere.

Some things to note if you're gay/lesbian and staying here. 1. The concierge didn't give us a room with a King Bed, like we'd reserved on Expedia. This was my partner's 30th birthday and I wanted to provide a romantic weekend for her. I mentioned that the Standard King is what we booked, but she wouldn't budge, leaving us with two double beds. It wasn't a bad room, but just neither what we'd reserved nor expected. I felt that if we were a straight couple, this wouldn't have been an issue that needed explaining. 2. The hotel bar downstairs is for super made-up straight people. We felt out of place. Because we didn't look like the Real Housewives of Orange County, we didn't get served for a very long time and we were annoyed because we had money to spend. Funny how quick people are to judge. 3. The room was surprisingly quiet for being in midtown Manhattan. The beds were very comfortable \"Sweet Dreams\" beds. 4. Midtown probably isn't the best part of town to stay for people who don't really care too much about shopping at Cartier and Louis Vuitton, but I will say that there was a Starbucks right around the corner and one of Manhattan's best bagel places one block away, \"Ess-a-Bagel\". 5. We loved SoHo, the East Village, TriBeCa and Chelsea. When we go back, we'd probably stay in lower Manhattan, which was more our speed. 6. The Russian bar in SoHo, Pravda, is great! I loved that place. Bottom line, if you stay here and midtown isn't necessarily for you, don't be afraid to take the green line subway (right outside of the hotel) to lower Manhattan.

We got a great deal on a standard room with queen size bed on the Doubletree website ($130 CAD). I was a bit nervous to see the place judging from some of the reviews here, but I am not sure what all the negativity is about. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful front desk person, and were provided the excellent warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival. We had arrived at 8 AM, and were not able to check in that early. However, the hotel was able to put our luggage away for us until we returned at lunch time. Check in was quite smooth and we were into a room, as they said, by lunch. We were on the 6th Floor and thought the room was great. Not large, but cozy and I found they made great use of the space. The room had been recently renovated, and was bright and clean. We enjoyed the flat screen TV, and found the bed to be very comfortable. It was greatly appreciated each night after long days touring the city! The bathroom was clean and modern, with no complaints. With regards to the noise, though we were facing the NYPD and FDNY stations, the noise didn't really disrupt us that much. Maybe if it was the summer and you had the window open it would be noticeable, but with the windows closed it didn't bother us. The hallway noise was noticed (thanks to the young children running up and down the hall), but as has been suggested could probably be drowned out with a towel under the door. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel as a great home base for your trip to New York. The rooms are clean and modern. The location is fantastic--within about a 10 block radius you can walk to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Trump Tower, Times Square, Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue. We were there in the middle of the transit strike, and weren't terribly effected because of our proximity to everything. And now that the strike is over, it is good to know the subway is right next door as well. I recommend the Broadway Diner across the street. You can get a great breakfast there for $5. The food, service, and prices are great. The only negatives I would have were that they told us toll free calls were free from our room, then charged us for them. (They were quickly removed when we pointed it out to them.) Also, we were told the luggage storage was free, then were charged $3 when we picked up our luggage.

There was no way we could sleep in there (decent size though I thought!) so went back down.We got a room change straight away which was in fact a little larger and plenty big enough for us although had no view but you can't have everything! We woke at about 4AM the following morning to the strong smell of cigarette smoke which my wife traced to be coming from the aircon unit, we just opened windows and carried on but we came home that evening and the room stank of fags again!! We went back down to check-in....they offered to get security to patrol the corridor which wasn't where the smell was coming from and after some discussion they changed our room again which was the 2nd in 24hrs but in fairness was not their doing.

Also when we were waiting to go home all I seemed to see two porters in particular do was count their tips, one had a missive 'wad' of notes which he would stand in the foyer and count. I have to be honest in that we wouldn't stay here again because of what happened but the staff were extremely helpful when we went to them with the problems, I couldn't fault them at all, the problem I think lies with the hotel itself and not enough thought when the refurb went ahead...

The shower was very powerful (which is a must for me!) and had a number of setting depending on how you like your shower. There was also adequate wardrobe space \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including quite a lot of hangers instead of the usual one or two! I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to use the fitness facilities at the hotel, but did take a look and the equipment all looked fairly new. After my second night in the hotel, there was a message asking me to call reception. They said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproblem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the room next door and they were having to relocate people to other rooms. I was a little annoyed at this inconvenience, but the hotel staff were incredibly helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they even offered to help me pack and then unpack my stuff. I politely declined as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too much. I was relocated to the 9th floor and the room was exactly the same standard as my first room. I would therefore presume that they were all of this standard. As an apology for the inconvenience, I got loads of free cookies, plus another one each day in a cookie jar in my room, a free newspaper each day plus tickets for free buffet-breakfast for the rest of my stay which made the whole move ok! I was staying room only as most hotels charge ridiculous prices for their breakfasts, and the Doubletree Metropolitan was no exception, however armed with my free breakfast token, I indulged every morning. The food was freshly prepared and there was a wide selection to choose from. Everything from a traditional cooked breakfast to cereals, fruit salads, fresh fruit plus lots more. The food was very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but still wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have paid their price for it. The service that the staff in the hotel provided was (with the exception of the check in guy) exemplary. Nothing was too much hassle and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like I was asking the earth if I needed something. The concierge were brillirant and booked me a helicopter flight with Liberty Helicopters and the porters were always ready to help with luggage storage and they always had a cab ready if you needed it. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and would definitely recommend it to anyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses or pleasure travellers. I will definitely be staying here on my next visit to New York.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guernsey, Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "Anji Page", "ReviewID": "UR4117781", "Content": "I loved this hotel and can't wait to stay there again.

The bathroom was a little on the small side but hey, who comes to New York to spend all their time in the bathroom! It was clean and functional so that scores points in my book. We had no problems with the reception staff, check in was quick and easy - the warm chocolate chip cookies were delicious! Had trouble trying to use the internet access in the room which I was charged for (even though it didn't work) but after explaining the problem at check-out, it was taken off my account without argument. We were on the 9th floor which was lovely and quiet. The location is great - it took us about 20 minutes to walk to Times Square but it was perfectly safe, even late at night. The hotel is close to Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, the Rockefeller Centre and the subway. Plenty of places to eat nearby, lots of coffee shops. The cafe right next door to the hotel was open late and their latte was much nicer than Starbucks! And it had the most amazing cheesecakes! The whole area outside the hotel was always busy and had a real New York vibe to it - a film was being shot right across the street. Got the subway down to Battery Park on my own one morning, again felt very safe, there was a policeman on the platform who gave me directions. Can recommend doing the Sex and the City tour (not for children!) and visiting the top of the Rockefeller Centre which had just opened when we were there - the views were amazing. This hotel is in a great location for exploring New York - from Battery Park I walked all the way back up one morning, stopping at shops and walking through different areas of New York.

One problem I did encounter at check-in was we had reserved a 2 bed room, plus rollaway. I had received an email from Hilton Reservattions stating the rollaway was at no charge, and even presented it to the clerk. He stated they made a mistake and the charge was $25/night. I was tired from the long flight and did not feel like arguing, but I will be sending a complaint letter to Hilton Cutomer Service. The room was average size ( I actually expected smaller by the reports I had read), and the bathroom is cramped, but workable. The beds are VERY comfortable, probably the best I have slept on away from home. Our remote control was missing, and they sent one up immediately, with a coupon for more cookies for our trouble (Those cookies are GREAT !). The rollaway took 2 calls to finally get it delievered, and it was beat-up, but fine. The ice machine was broken the first day we were there, but fixed later, but I found it interesting that it is tucked away in the storage/housekeeping area, and I probably could have moved one of the rollaways stored in this area to my room and save the 25 bucks ! Our room was 1407, and had a very obstructed view of the hotel next door, but we did not need a view, and it likely kept the noise down. I agree with the earlier post, the gap at the bottom of the door is ridiculously large, allowing too much light and hallway noise in. Placing a towel in it at night resolved this issue. We did not eat in the hotel, as it was never busy, and I would like to see more people eating there to feel that it is worth it. The Cafe Metro next door, and other close cafes were more that adequate for a good breakfast. Location is the only problem we had, we will likely pick a more centrally located hotel next time.The Lexington line subway is right outside the door, and this was great going to Battery Park/Statue of Liberty, but not so for Times Square/etc. My wife and I did discover that going east, instead of heading to central Manhattan, that there is a plethra of great bars to visit.

We stayed in the executive room, which has a bit more space than the regular rooms--- I took a tour of the smaller room and I think the price difference is justified. I would take the executive room and pay a bit more. The service is fine: the front desk receptionist Karen is one of the friendliest and nicest hoteliers I've ever met. Each guest is greeted with a warm chocolate chip cookie, which is funny considering we are in tough, very un-chocolate chip cookie NYC. One thing that irritated me was when I checked my luggage in with the concierge for storage (I had a late afternoon flight), he told me: \"Oh I won't be here when you come back to pick up your suitcase.\" Kind of too obvious in his effort to get a tip.

Upon arrival, I was asked by an rather arrogant front desk staff member if would like the twin bed room I reserved (?). Furthermore, she denied lounge access stating, that the lounge is for Hilton HHonors status members only. She got the manager for me, who said the same thing. Showing him my confirmation print-out which clearly stated \"lounge access\", he oh so generously gave me continental breakfast coupons for the Met Grill, but only for five out of seven days, stating that the lounge is closed on weekends (in fact, for those weekend days guests with lounge access get breakfast coupons, too), repeatedly saying \"I don't have to do this\". THANK YOU VERY MUCH! After that unpleasent incident, a bellman showed me my king room on 14th floor (I wonder if that really was an executive room as the exec floors are according to my confirmation floors 16-19, but front desk said so at check-in) facing 51st Street with its police and fire station which was NYC standard size and well appointed with flat screen TV (although NY1 and Weather channels missing) and the best bed I ever slept in at an U. S. hotel, Doubletree's new Sweet Dreams bed, with lots of cushions and downs. Bathroom featured Neutrogena toiletries and lots of hot water. Room attendants did a great job: room was very, very clean, they replaced the many towels every day. Bed linens were changed on a daily basis, too. Don't believe that the new windows are sound proof (as mentioned on some websites) - they are merely sound-resistant, but nevertheless keep enough noise out to have a good night's sleep. The biggest noise problem (as many reviewers mentioned before) comes from the inside: the very thin doors with a huge gap between door and frame which let a lot of sound and light through and which you can't close without a major \"bang\". IMHO, it should not be a problem giving those doors some rubber isolation. The in-room safe deposit box was a nice touch. Two features I at first wondered what all the fuzz was about were very good: the really delicious warm signature cookie you get upon arrival and the arched shower bar, which prevents the shower curtain from sticking to your wet body. I was not so impressed with the hairdryer, whichs cord was only about 6 inches long (prepare for unusual hairdos using the hairdryer head-down). Breakfast buffet in the bunker-like Met Grill with its stained chairs was a laugh riot considering - not holding coupons - you have to pay 20 USD for continental and 26 USD for an pathetic American breakfast. Luckily, there are enough diners and other hotels you can have breakfast at in the proximity of the hotel. Unlike guests rooms around me, mine never got a morning newspaper, although I am Hilton HHonors member (apparently they think foreigners can't read English, anyway). Check-out was a breeze, but only because I had some phone fees for 1-800 calls removed from my account beforehand (front desk said, they were still having problems with the phone system - Hello? The hotel is open more than half a year and is surely not the first to run this system!) Location of the hotel is great: several subway lines and downtown buslines right outside the door, crosstown und uptown bus lines only one or two blocks away.

I had on 3 inch heels and even though we walked slowly it only took us about 15 minutes to get there. Passed Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and Radio City Music Hall along the way. The rooms are newly renovated. They are very modern looking and small. You have plenty of room to walk around, but there is no extra space or mini-fridge.

I am Hilton Gold and had expected to be able to use the Executive Lounge for breakfast, but it is closed due to renovations, so they gave us coupons for continental breakfast. The normal charge is $20 for continental and for $6 more you can have the hot food at the buffet. Very overpriced for what it is - but that's New York. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance, so explore the city a little bit and avoid the hotel food. Loved the flat screen tv and the safe.

I had read the trip advisor comments about the doors slamming and really didn't seem to notice. I did see, however, that there is about a 3/4-inch clearance between the bottom of the door and the floor, because a lot of light was getting in to the room at night--a towel shut the light out, and maybe some of the noise. I am a light sleeper, and the doors didn't keep me awake. The room was clean with plenty of towels and the staff was very, very friendly and helpful. I really liked the fact that there aren't too many children or college kids that stay here. There was very little noise in the hallway. It seems to be an older/business crowd, possibly because of the price point. The location is perfect--not too close to the hustle but not too far away either. There is a subway stop--the 6 line--right around the corner. Metro Cafe next door has wonderful Panini sandwiches and a salad bar. We didn't eat at the hotel because it looked too expensive and we hardly saw anyone else eating there anyway. The bar was nice but I'm still trying to understand why I paid $16 plus a service charge for one drink (a well Bloody Mary). Now, for the ugly: This place is right across the street from a fire station!!! I don't remember reading about this before on trip advisor. We were really worried when we checked in on Sunday afternoon as the trucks left about 10 times with blaring sirens. I think maybe they do more checks on Sundays or something, because we didn't really hear any more sirens throughout our stay (left on Wednesday). And we don't remember hearing any sirens after about 7 p.m. Another thing--I had read on Trip Advisor that the air conditioning doesn't work well--SO CORRECT! This hotel, as many other older hotels, is on a boiler system--so it's either hot or cold air. The front desk informed me they hadn't switched the AC on for the summer yet. So all you can control is air flow--which there really wasn't any. I had called the front desk before our stay to make sure they have individual climate controls in the room--which they do, but you can't adjust the temperature at all. Thank God we stayed here in the Spring and it wasn't too unbearable--just slept on top of the sheets. I guess we would have the same situation in any other older hotel in the city. Lastly, there are no coffee makers available for the rooms. I have stayed at probably 10 different Doubletrees all over the country and they always have coffee makers.

Most of my feelings about the hotel are positive. The Metropolitan recently went through a $30M renovation, but quite frankly I couldn't see where that much money had been spent. The lobby while attractive, is rather plain and simple as were the other community rooms. The guest rooms were comfortable but not lavish. I think the wall paper in the rooms could have been redone as I noticed a tear in the paper in my bathroom. The staff, in my opinion was quite courteous and professional. On my way out in the evening, I stopped at the front desk to let the clerk know that the toilet in my bathroom was constantly running. While it wasn't annoying, I was mostly concerned about water conservation. The clerk said he would call someone right away to let them know. I had to return to my room about 20 minutes later to pick up something I had forgotten and the toilet was fixed! I guess the mixed feelings I have are because I stayed in this hotel back when it was the Lowes Summit and I suppose it's like comparing apples and oranges. The Summit was much more opulant with more ammenities like bed turndown and Godiva chocolates on your pillow and they had a very nice hotel restaurant. As the Doubletree Metropolitan, it's much more simple with fewer ammenities and there was no bed turndown and no chocolates.

We got a super rate on the Doubletree website, and we got excellent value for the price.

We found all of the staff to be attentive, pleasant, and helpful - we were greeted at the front door by the duty manager, and looked after all the way from there.

We expected it to be busy and it was. We were slightly early arriving at the hotel and were unable to check in, reception advised us to return at 3pm. We left our cases with the porter (bellhop?) and went for some lunch. We returned at 3 as requested and were advised our room was not ready. We were asked to take a seat, a problem when there are no seats as several other parties were waiting for their rooms. After an hour of waiting we managed to get a room, however it was on a lower floor and I had paid my travel company extra for a deluxe room that should have been on a higher floor. Check in advised all the rooms were the same, no matter what floor so I had paid extra for nothing. Finally got our room on a higher floor an our hour and a quarter after we wanted to check in! The room was excellent by New York standards - a decent size, good tv and fab bed. Even the shower was pretty good - not a power shower but not a trickle that you get in some hotels. However, after we had been in our room for 15 minutes, another couple entered our room. I was in the bathroom and my wife was laying on the bed and to say we were a little shocked and concerned is an understatement! Our room had apparently been allocated to two lots of people - not sure how this happens but it is unpleasant. My wife contacted reception and was made to feel that this was her fault which is clearly unacceptable. We went out for our evening meal and were then unable to get back in our room - all in all a frustrating first day at the Metropolitan. We were given a complimentary breakfast in the hotel but this was distinctly average and would recommend you don't eat at the hotel. The hotel bar was nicely decorated but heavily over-priced. There was also a lot of work taking place on some floors at the hotel and although we couldn't hear anything from our room, the lift often stopped on floors where work was taking place. In summary, the room was very good and the location was good being away from the hustle and bustle but a 5 minute walk to Rockerfeller and 1 minute from the subway.

We were moved promptly and settled into our \"renovated\" king room. Now let me just add, wallpapering old, water damaged and unsightly walls doesn't change the fact that they are still old, water damaged and unsightly. Similarly, putting \"modern looking\" furniture in a small space doesn't make it appealing. In addition, the rooms have absolutely no soundproofing and the housekeeping staff apparently felt the need to vaccum starting at 9am on Sunday morning for at least an hour, I also heard every person that walked by the room. While the room did have a safe, there was no second lock on the hotel room door and I definitely would not have felt comfortable there had I not been with my fiance.

The television was a flat panel, very nice, with 60 or 70 channels. The bathroom was very nice with an \"optimizer\" shower curtain, slate floors and walls in the shower, etc. Watch the water in the sink. If you turn it on too high it tends to splash out. As for noise versus view, if noise is a major concern ask for a room on the \"back side\" of the hotel. If view is, ask for a room on the front. There will always be noise in NYC, and the easternmost part of the motel is across the street from a police and fire department. Keep both windows closed to minimize noise. I don't understand the comments about holes in the windows. Each window has both an inner and an outer window. The inner opens, but the outer one didn't. I would assume this is a safety concern.

However they offered us lower standard rooms to be moved the following day. My colleague, a non smoker, was given a very smelly smoking room. She was lucky. The first room I was shown in had been used. I had just realised this and was on the phone to my colleague when a porter barged into the room without knocking. Strange!!??Another room was allocated. The room was next to the lift shaft (as was the other used room). This is a big hotel and the lift was in constant use throughout the night which basically meant it was impossible to sleep. I wnt downstaires to complain. The night porter looked very sympathetic - the room was basically not lettable - however the manageress to whom we later complained wouldn't give a reduction on the room rates.

I wouldn't walk on it in my bare feet for our entire trip (7 nights).

Between the desk, two chairs, bed, and nightstand, two people can not manuever around the room comfortably. We did not have control of the temperature in our room, which was extremely frustrating, as we like to have the room cold before going to bed. The thermostat either didn't work, or we had no control.

After a long talk with management we got the rooms but they were on different floors. The rooms were dirty and the bathrooms were terrible. The soap was open and the toilet was dirty.

One thing i will say is don't use the phone in your room as it cost a mint! I paid around $90 for 2 calls home (England) that lasted around 5 mins in total!

My room had scratched furniture and stains on the carpet. Renovations or no, that is the sign of a dive. My first night was uneventful, but upon returning from a late dinner the next night, I discovered a large cockroach or some such insect taking up residence in the bathroom. Recognizing that such insects rarely travel alone, I called the front desk. They sent up someone from security (who knows why-- maybe the guy was going to arrest the roach), but by then the roach had crawled into a hole in the wall near the floor. I packed by bag and went to the front desk. The manager offered me two options. The first was to have the room sprayed. Great--I spend the night breathing in that poison. The second option is to be moved to another room -- but they only have rooms in the smoking section, so I can breath in that poison instead. I asked them to find me accomodations in another hotel, but they claimed that all hotels are booked solid from here to Laguardia. I wanted to call Amtrak to see if there were any trains back home (since I was leaving the next day anyway). The manager could not even provide a phone book to assist me (the rooms have no phone books, not even a Gideon bible). But it was already 11:15 and the next train was not until 3 AM. So, with no choice, I agreed to be moved to a smoking room. More scratches, more stains on the rug, but I survived the night. The next morning I go to take a shower (the shower heads are only high enough to give you a colonic irrigation) and the knob came off in my hand!!! I showered as best I could, packed up and went to check out. I told the manager of my experiences, and he would not offer to discount the price. Instead he offered me the laughable options of either (i) late checkout privileges (I explained to him that my goal was to escape that hellhole as soon as possible, and not delay it), or (ii) am \"upgrade\" upon my next visit to the hotel (which I explained was extremely unlikely).

We had to go down to the lobby and use the bathroom the next morning. We couldn't shower until they fixed it after 10:00. They finally moved us to a bigger room but it was not much better. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone at this time. For $159 a night I expected at least clean and functional accomodations - even in New York City. This was without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

The rooms are good sized for NYC (if you are not used to hotel rooms in NYC, they are generally very small compared to other areas of the country) and very clean. They are larger rooms than some of the 4 and 5 star hotels we've stayed at in the city. No, they aren't posh, and sometimes you may find some chipped paint or a corner of the wallpaper peeling in the bathroom. But for the price, this is a great hotel. Staff is very friendly, there is a coffee shop right next to the hotel, and you are literally 50 feet from a subway stop - the biggest plus, in our opinion! Plus, you are just a couple of blocks from Rockefeller Plaza and all the mid-town sites. The location and reasonable price makes this our favorite hotel.
