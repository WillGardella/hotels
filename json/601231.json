{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean, Comfortable, Cozy, and Great Staff Sitting at the far end of Queen\u9225\u6a9a Road East near the Happy Valley Racecourse, the Cosmo Hotel is nestled between its\u9225?sister property, the Cosmopolitan, and a Sikh Temple. The location is convenient to Times Square and the Causeway Bay shopping district, or you can take a short walk in the opposite direction into Wan Chai. We stayed here four nights over New Year\u9225\u6a9a and can recommend this hotel as a moderately priced option that delivers on its\u9225?promises.The staff and service in this hotel are excellent. They did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. We traveled on a package from Shanghai that included our airfare and hotel vouchers. On check-in, we asked about supplementary upgrades and were offered two options: an Executive Room, which was slightly larger than the Standard Room that we had booked, or a Studio, which was again a little bit bigger and had two bathrooms. We chose the Studio, but after seeing it, we changed our mind. The Studio rooms have a very small extra living area with a sofa bed, and would perhaps be a good choice if the room was to be shared by three people. But the space is a bit chopped up, and we had no real use for the extra living area and the second bath. Some visitors may also be put off by the fact that all the Studio Rooms look out over the cemetery behind the hotel. After a quick call to the Front Desk, a bellman appeared with the keys to an Executive Room, just across the hallway on the 21st floor. This room was more to our liking. All the rooms at the Cosmo are small, but our room was functional, quiet, and clean. But be forewarned: there is not a lot of extra space in the room. The bath opens via a pocket door and is about the size of a closet with toilet, shower, sink, and no vanity. The closet is a tiny area with one drawer and enough space to hang a few shirts. A few well-placed hooks and other accessories would make this room more functional, but the cozy quarters are entirely adequate for a short stay.The hotel offers a buffet breakfast downstairs in the Nooch Bar. They have eggs, bacon, cereals, and a few Chinese dim sum items. The highlight is that they have not one, but two Jura Impressa S9 expresso makers dispensing all the great coffee you can drink! My partner was not as thrilled with the breakfast as I was, but from my standpoint it is much better than many \u9225\u6e07ree\u9225?breakfasts I\u9225\u6a9de been offered elsewhere. And if you know about the Jura machines that I mentioned you will really appreciate this unexpected treat.The Nooch Bar itself is little funky and a lot cheesy. There is a DJ station right behind the bar, and a vaguely Moroccan feeling to the d\u8305cor, with hanging beads and round, peaked curtains over some of the seating areas. It seemed only to be missing one or two drag queens to complete the experience! There is a huge projection TV screen and, almost right beside that, another large flat screen TV. CNN was on during breakfast each morning, which provided a nice way to catch up on the day\u9225\u6a9a news, along with free Wi-Fi.I liked the Cosmo Hotel and would come back for another stay. It\u9225\u6a9a a reasonably priced hotel in a relatively convenient Hong Kong Island location, with nice, friendly staff that cares about making you feel comfortable. It is quite a good find in this price range.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR606270566", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "wglennevans"}, {"Content": "Love the stay at Cosmo Hotel I wish to report to you that we truly enjoyed our stay at Cosmo Hotel from 30Nov08-5Dec08.This hotel is not only new, it is also very clean, comfortable and convenient to move from one place to another place. The hotel also provide free shuttle bus service to and fro town area and airport station which really helps alot in moving around. Of course for those who wish to do more walking, it is only 5-10mins walk to time square or causeway bay.In short whether you take bus or walk, it is that convenient. We are so thankful that we were uograded to Studio room without any extra cost though we have booked the superior room for the 5nights stay.We actually got this promotion from Zuji which I will encourage those who wish to book reasonable and good hotel to book through zuji.For those who wish to stay in a budget hotel and somewhere in Hongkong Island and near town area, I would encourage you to go for this hotel.if I were to go back to Hong Kong again,I wish to go back to this hotel again.Hope this review will give you better idea re this hotel.

Two year ago I didn't find many boutique hotels in Hong Kong but when I recently visited there again, I found many options! Considering location and prices, I checked into Cosmo Hotel and definitely worths applaud. On the website I noticed there're many choices of room color, I left a message hoping to check into a yellow one. On check-in, they offered me a yellow room (so they did respond to what I put and that impressed me from the beginning). The hotel is chicly designed, the bar of great atmosphere, the room is a bit small but this is Hong Kong standard I reckoned. What impressed me the most was the service by their staff. My housekeeper was excellent! He knew everything and offered me great tips on travelling around Hong Kong. Other staff from the concierge to the waiter serving me breakfast were all nice and welcoming. I would say the persons there made my trip!

Room was small but this is Hong Kong so we had expected it! Not bad for the price (we got a good deal on the BA website). The rooms are clean and pretty funky. The best thing was the bathroom with its powerful shower, just what you needed after a day's walking in the hustle and bustle of the City. The room had no window though only a frosted pane as I think our room overlooked the graveyard at the back which wasn't a problem unless you thought about it too much! However, there are rooms which look onto the main road, so worth checking ahead to see where your room is likely to be if you prefer some natural light.Staff were professional and helped us with our return journey to the airport. Location isn't brilliant as it looks close to the MTR on the map but isn't. Causeway Bay is the closest MTR station which would take about 15-20minutes to walk to but the hotel does offer a free shuttle bus which takes you to Times Square which was useful as you could take the bus and then walk to the MTR (5mins). You do need to use the subway to get to the hotel as you can't cross the main dual carriageway road - we used it at night and had no problems and it seemed quite safe and well-lit. By walking around we got to see quite a lot though around the hotel such as Wanchai Market which is well worth a wander through in the morning when you'll see all sorts of seafood, meats, veggies and fruits for sale.

I just returned from 5 nights at the Cosmo. 1. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable and has caused me to have back  neck pain the entire time. Also , the sheets had some long black hairs in it  i wasn't entirely sure it was fresh 2. Staff was surly upon check in and bordered on being rude. Basically threw my key card at me. At the same time that the couple next to me was checking in to a lower category room, was upgraded, with free internet and breakfast .. I booked the executive room and got nothing like this . I inquired about it and it was followed up by a phone call telling me they paid more than I did. Very strange service. ( Upon check out they were more pleasant) 3. Only 4 non-smoking floors and the air con is connected so when someone smokes in their room it comes into yours. I had to move for the 2nd night.. the lowest setting on the aircon is quite high, so your choice is freezing or no air movement. 4. Amenities were random. My first room was kitted out well , the second only had half the amount . I was not sure if the water was complimentary or not. 5. Upon request they brought me an iron  ironing board , well at first just an ironing board, but it was done very quickly .. the front desk could learn how to be more pleasant from their very nice housekeeping staff. 6. The lobby really smelled like old pine disinfectant covering up bar smell - which is not what you want to be greeted with 7. The shower was really good  strong -however, the hairdryer was useless.. it blew out weak cold air . On a final note, i had the misfortune to get an orange/grey room. i saw a yellow room while it was being cleaned and looked much nicer, It is a bit of a walk to the MTR , but walking in HK is very easy  well signposted . Taxis were fairly easy to get ( i used them 50% of time) but the hotel is not easy to get to ,as the taxis had to go out of their way to make U turns. I would not recommend this hotel but I wouldn't say don't stay here either, just don't expect too much . I think their 4star rating is a bit far reaching.. more like a 3 star hotel.

The lobby is small, practical and trendy. We walked to the reception desk and we were greeted by a friendly staff. After fill in the check-in form and passport inspection, I was asked to give a deposit of HK$300. This is not my first time I have encountered such request in Hong Kong, it is more or less normal practice. The staff informed us that we have got an upgrade and we prompty went upstairs by the lift to see our upgraded room.I think the lobby of the hotel did set the scence of the room. I remember I use the word cute when I first walked into the room. The first impression of the room was small and smart.The room is clean and tidy. The person who did the interior design of the room do manage to use every inch of the room without wasting any space.In the room I stayed it has 2 single beds within the bedroom, next to one of the bed is a semi-glass wall partition between the bathroom and bedroom, this partition does give a trendy atmosphere to the room. Next to the other bed is the windown of the room, the window is sealed and can't be opened.We went downstairs to the 5th floor Breeze bar. To be honest The Breeze bar is actually just a nicely converted roof terrance of the base building. It offers self service complementary coffee and free wifi services. When we went there it was empty and we have the entire bar for ourselves. The bar isn't grand but it does have modern touch.The location of the Hotel isn't great. It is not near a MTR station. It is 15+ minutes walk to Time square. Time sqaure do have an MTR entrance but it is a good 10 minutes walk from the entranace to the train platform. Surronding the hotel isn't much to see or shop either. The PRC Chinese News Agency is next door and Happy Valley Horse Racing course is within viewing distance.One good thing is that the number 10 bus stop to central is right outside the building and the airport express shuttle bus stop in front of the hotel too.

We decided it wasnt a big deal. The next day, there was an even stronger smell , almost like gas. At first I ignored it, but then I started to feel dizzy so I went to the front desk to inform them about it. They told me they were painting the room next door. Why didnt anyone tell us that morning they were going to be painting? The hotels are very small and there is basically no ventilation. We left the hotel and the smell was still there when we returned in the late afternoon. They switched us to a different room only after they made sure we went upstairs to check if the smell was still there. They never once apologized for it. The staff wasn't always friendly. It depended on who was at the front desk. The only thing I liked about the hotel was their shuttle bus service.

The other reason was because Cosmo had a Studio room which could accomodate 3 adults, an absolute rarity in HK. I did not want to put in an extra bed and lose all walking space, knowing how tiny HK hotel rooms are. The Studio was small, but much bigger than their usual rooms for sure. Heard other guests from the normal rooms complaining how small theirs are, so be warned! The Studio had an extra living room area (very small too) which has a small plasma TV and a sofa which converted into a bed for the 3rd person.What I liked about the Studio room:1. Separat area for the 3rd pax, which afforded some privacy for 3 pax in a small room.2. Extra TV for the 3rd person, hence no fighting for channels.3. Extra toilet for the 3rd person - very important in the morning when everyone needs the toilet or basin to wash up.4. Lots of bottled drinking water - something like 10 new bottles, pick your brand from the 4 and also fizzy or non-fizzy. What I disliked about the Studio room:1. No view for all Studio rooms. They all face the cemetary on the hill (very close) so the hotel frosted the windows to let light in but keep guests from freaking out. Not for the claustrophobic.2. No wardrobe/cupboard for hang your clothes (except for a limited space above the safe deposit box). But you could ask the chambermaid for a standing rack, if you have space in your room.3. No space for luggage - You'll need to plan very carefully where to set your luggage due to space constraint again.There is no business centre on 6th floor. It's an open terrace with some chairs and Wi-Fi. The staff at the reception ranged from cordial to delightful, depending on who you approach. I made friends with a female front office staff who enthusiastic provided me with helpful tips on where to go and how to get there. When I checked out, I left my keys on top of the safe. The hotel said they have it when I called days later and sent it to my home in Singapore via courier, which was really nice. (But asked me for my credit card number to charge it to me of course.)Overall stay was OK. Given the size of everything, it's not an impressive hotel but it's comfortable enough and the shuttle bus shared with Cosmopolitan Hotel is an added advantage.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR709813333", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Linda_Laughs"}, {"Content": "It was a Nice Stay.

The whole place is so pretentious it can almost make you nautious. They try to keep an image of a trendy, stylish, posh place to stay. Do not buy into that. All that pretense doesn't go any farther than the lobby.To get a room with a great city view, you have to pay extra. If you don't, guess what you get? A room with the same view but with its windows sealed with a matte film (mine was torn a bit on one side and that's how I could see the view behind it). So, essentially,they are saying unless you pony up some cash, we will make sure you don't see anything nice out of your window! This has to be one of the most idiotic hotel business strategies ever.Rooms are small in size and average in quality. Only 2 elevators for almost 30 floors, sometimes the wait is long. Good luck finding room numbers on the doors. I found mine after 2 days - it is on the floor aside your room door. Must be part of the idiotic chic interior design.Don't bother paying for their internet. There are plenty of wi-fi networks available in the rooms. Most are secured but some will always be open. And if you choose to pay to get connected through the Ethernet (LAN) line, you will be disappointed with how slow it is... without a doubt the slowest wired hotel connection I've ever experienced.The restaurant is at the sister hotel, Cosmopolitan, 1 minute down the street. Poor quality food, poor service, and completely unacceptable for the price (one lunch cost me around US$50). BRoom service is average. One time I had to wait for 40 minutes before calling back to find out that my order wasn't brought because they had made it wrong and had to remake it. No apologies or anything.Rooms service food orders are small. A glass of juice is no more than 100 ml. Chicken sausage was very greasy (must be some cheap kind). If you ask for something special, like 2 packs of honey with my tea, please, seems like you'll get it only about 50% of the time.The most ridiculous thing is their Nooch bar that they dare to describe as a chic and hip place where the cosmopolitan crowd revitalizes after work. I laughed out loud when I saw that myself. The entire bar is tiny, and can fit perhaps 30 guests. You'll be lucky to see more than 10 at any one time. Just 3 kinds of beer on draft, and guess what, only sold by pints. And if you are 2 people and would like to share that pint, no, you each have to get one.

Not a single response each time I chased them up! I even left them my mobile number just in case and all they did with it was to produce it on a ripped corner piece of paper upon my check and quoted \u9225\u6e1forry, forget to phone, where are you staying?\u9225?I\u9225\u6a6b ALREADY CHECKING OUT!2. on check out, we complained that there was a leak in the bathroom from the room above and that the black sludge had stained a piece of our clothing.

During a busy period in reception, I was queuing up to simply leave my mobile number so they can contact me about a possible extension to my stay.

On both counts it does not work and is definitely not what you would see in wallpaper magazine.- The bar, claiming to be the most chic place in town, was empty most nights, had a terrible live band belting out inaudible cover versions, and it doubles as the breakfast room. The breakfast looked far from appetising and is the only thing the cosmo managed to claim as boutique hotel, i.e. \u9225\u6e15inimalist\u9225?br/>- The location is on a very busy main road and requires you to go through an underpass, then cross 3 major roads before reaching Times Square where you can get into the transport network.- If you do decide to chance a stay, do not pay the extra for an executive room, it\u9225\u6a9a the same small size as the superior room \u9225?with the sliding door to the toilet/bathroom 2 feet from the bottom of your bed. Not worth it.- The 6th floor terrace caf\u8305/business centre is awful \u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a simply a small outdoor terrace with a few cheap bamboo chairs and air conditioning units as company.Overall my colleague and I had a terrible experience and stay. For a \u62e2100 a night, please please go and stay elsewhere, there are plenty of good hotels in HK for that kind of money.

We did not get the room type that we requested, and were taken into two rooms that were unfinished before they actually found us a room with a double bed, which ended up being a smaller cramped room. Even though we were downgraded, the hotel offered no compensation or refund. The room had a window that was completely frosted over and there was no light in the room. Although Expedia stated several amenities, the hotel had NONE. There was no hairdryer, the internet was expensive, the television had three stations, etc. The staff was friendly, but not particularly helpful.

I was charged over 100pounds for a tiny and cramped room on the 5th floor- the same floor as the breakfast restaurant. There was constant traffic on the floor as staff and other guests accessed the restaurant. Not a quiet night. The room itself was divided into to a narrow hallway and a bedroom. A desk was crammed into the hallway, but the space was so small, it was uncomfortable to work at. There was a couch in the entrance area, but it was badly stained and in general need of repair. The bedroom was tiny and claustopobic and all the soft furnishings, especially the headborad, were in desperate need of cleaning. The space is poorly designed and the general condition is poor. All in all I was completely unimpressed.
