Things are certainly different since the credit crunch hit? The suites are still a great way to holiday but the quality and standards of the Hilton group are just not there at least in this hotel. Some comparisons to three years ago are the easiest way to show the cut backs clearly evident: 1. Room decor: The decor has not been updated: these rooms have such a high turn over of visitors, they there for need to be kept up to date and managed properly with a good clean modern standard. This they are not: Our bathroom work surface was badly chipped and dangerous to touch! Clearly they had been smashed with a heavy object in the past! But long enough ago to round off some, only some of the edges! The rest were sharp and dangerous. 2. Breakfast: disgusting and a far cry from what was on offer for many years in the ES. This was a high positive for us as to why we chose this group of hotels! No longer the case. The buffet is no longer present and the choice is pathetic. The express breakfast is boring and has no taste or sustanence. Big let down. 3. Managers reception: The choice and variety is no longer there. Still a great idea and can't fault the free drinks, but no longer the high standards or quality once offered. E.g. Once a nice quality Jim Beam was offered as a bourbon ? Now it's a play on words, I was offered Beam, bourbon yes, but pretty vile and not the same standards. Wine of the day used to be Yellow Tail brands throughout, which is a very nice wine, now it's a poorer choice and standards are down. Beers are Coor and Bud. I could go on but this has been a massive let down and we will not use this particular location again. I just hope the ES have not dropped standards all over. End note: do the place up and up the standards to what they were and that's why we were attracted for so long.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBusy Easter Weekend\u201d", "Author": "TheNomisFamily", "ReviewID": "UR128384134", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights over Easter Weekend with family of 4 and over-all we were very pleased.

The hotel is located directly across the street from one of our favorite Orlando restaurants- Bahama Breeze.. and is surrounded by numerous restaurants, shopping & entertainment venues all w/n walking distance. Disney parks & Universal Studio are only short drives away. We were pleased from the moment we checked in until we departed. The check in lady ( Joanne) was so very pleasant, she reminded me of my sweet grandmother. The entire hotel is clean, nicely decorated, and has a very relaxing, laid back vibe. On Easter Sunday, the Easter Bunny treated the children at Breakfast to easter eggs... nice touch. The staff were friendly and courteous; it is obvious that this a very well managed property, and the staff has been expertly trained in delivering good customer service. My teenager and 8 yr old girls enjoyed the pools, where we met the nicest employee Lennox , in their restaurant. He served us poolside lunch & drinks; and Lennox makes the best long island iced tea I have ever tasted. Lennox has service with a SMILE down to an artform. The rooms are typical of modern ES, very large, spacious & clean. My one area of disappointment was with the housekeeping staff, they appear to not have embraced the concept of good service as the rest of the staff. I had to constantly request towels etc; and they did not always clean the rooms as well as I expected. This was not a major problem, however, because the front desk staff responded so quickly to our requests that we overlooked the shortcomings of the house keeping staff. Breakfast was terrific, with great service and good , healthy choices. My 8 year old was unhappy that there was no French Toast , so I had to take her to IHOP, but the rest of the family enjoyed breakfast. The store in the lobby had a great variety of items to purchase at reasonable prices. Internet Access was a breeze, my husband worked a litte, and we had no issues with internet speed & efficiency. Upon checkin- I mentioned to Joanne that I would be celebrating my B'day on the 11th, and to my utter delight, this wonderful hotel delivered an entire birthday cake, w/ candles and all to my room on my B'day. I was so touched by their thoughtfulness and kindness, I almost cried. On our last day, my little girl said, \" mommy can we stay here again?\" I thought she meant could she return to see micky & minnie; , but she clarified that she wanted to stay at this hotel the next time we visit Orlando, which we do 1-2X year as my children are Disney fanatics.

This hotel was chosen after looking at all of the amenities that the hotel offered and also after reading the other mostly positive reviews provided by tripadvisor. Another item which really impressed both my wife and I was the fact that Mr. John Parkinson, General Manager at Embassy Suites Hotel Orlando, appears to respond to every review, both positive and negative, in a very respectful and polite fashion. In the responses that I read from him, he genuinely appears to be concerned about customer satisfaction and the perception of his hotel, which is a rarity nowadays.

It is most convenient to Sea World and the Orlando Convention Center. The staff is well-trained and polite. For families, there is one unadvertised drawback to this property. They advertise shuttle service to and from both the Universal Studios and Disney Parks. While they have this service, it is extremely limited. There are two departures each morning, one to Universal Studios and one to Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center. The shuttles do not run to the other three Disney parks. Further, the last return from both parks is BEFORE the main events of the evening. So, if you seek to see Fantasmic, or the Disney Fireworks Display or the Illuminations Show at EPCOT, you will be out of luck.

It is well served by public transportation and has good road access so travelling to and from the area\u2019s many attractions and shopping venues is easy. International Drive is in between the Disney and Universal complexes, so is well placed for those intending to visit both. It is also only a short way (walkable) from the huge Orange County Convention Centre. On entry to the foyer, you are greeted by a huge covered atrium surrounding which are the room walkways. Above the ground floor level there are seven floors of rooms. Public spaces and most rooms are non-smoking, but there are a few smoking rooms available. There is WiFi throughout, available at a fee. Self-parking is complimentary and there is valet parking at a fee. The atrium has many tables and chairs where one can meet and/or relax in a very pleasant environment. Rooms on the top floor (only) have a tiny balcony just large enough to step out onto. There is a bar, two swimming pools (one inside, one outside) and a fitness centre. A complimentary breakfast buffet, with some cooked-to-order items, is provided, and this has a far broader section than is typical for many US hotels. Standard is fairly good. And for two hours early each evening, complementary beverages, including alcohol, are available to all guests (alcohol subject, of course to the legal age limit of 21). There is a small (and expensive) shop offering confectionery, soft drinks and trinkets etc., and a vehicle rental counter. The hotel has International Drive to the front and the very busy Interstate 4 to the rear. External traffic noise from both does penetrate guest rooms. This may disturb some people. And my room on the second floor was, I guess, close to the lift (elevator) plant and an annoying intermittent low hum was a disturbance. We stayed here on two occasions recently, each stay for two nights. Reception staff were pleasant enough but there was, perhaps, just a little less of a feeling of welcome than in some other hotels. Nevertheless, a problem with our reservation on the second occasion was resolved well enough despite the hotel being almost fully booked. The rooms themselves are large and comprise two parts with a door in between. The first part is a parlour area with comfortable lounge furnishings, a desk, and a \u201cwet bar\u201d with a small sink, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, etc. The main bathroom is accessed from this room. I understand that, as an option, one may choose a room where the parlour is instead arranged for business/conference meetings with a large table and several chairs. I also understand that there are both \u201cpresidential suites\u201d (with two bedrooms and two bathrooms) and accessible rooms available. The second room is the bedroom which also has a washbasin and vanity unit. There are two types of bedroom; those with one king bed are slightly smaller than those with two queens, but the overall space in either is more than enough. There are TVs and telephones in both rooms. The bed was very comfortable and everything worked as it should. The hotel and rooms are air-conditioned throughout. In all, this is, for those with the necessary budget, a good place to stay, ideally located, but with the matter (an issue for some, perhaps) of the traffic noise. The complimentary breakfast and evening drinks provided go some way to justifying the cost, as does the room environment.

In the bedroom area there were two very comfortable double beds, with washbasin facilities and a large flat screen tv. Our bathroom was clean with shower/bath options. The living space had a pull down sofa bed, firm and comfortable, with table, large flat screen tv and coffee making facilities and a fridge. Over the course of the first few days of the holiday we had a couple of nags about the A/C in our room which we could not operate properly, which the maintenance team replaced and fixed within 1/2 hour. Housekeeping are only too pleased to provide more pillows and bedding - just ask. Both the bellmen/valet guys are also only too pleased to help with any query or question no matter how big or small, again just ask and you'll be met with a smile and super fast service. Breakfast is very acceptable and included in the price of the stay, queue to the left of the grill for express breakfast (sausage, bacon, chips, scrambled egg and pancakes) or use the center line for omelettes cooked to order. There is also cereal, porridge, pastries, coffe and tea etc. The fish eye grill has a good menu not bad value for money and an option if you don't fancy eating out. There is a small shop that has drinks, painkillers, sun cream etc as well. There is a lovely indoor pool and hot tub and spa - take your room key, but extra towels are provided to get you back to your room (there are no changing facilities). The hotel also uses an independant travel company that provides free shuttle service to the Universal and Disney Parks, with varied drop off and pick up times that suit fine. If you want to go to Sea World simply ask for a FREE day pass to use the i-Ride that runs the length of International Drive and has multiple stops every few hundred yards. We will definitely be returning to Orlando and be more than happy to use Embassy Suites again in the next year or so and will check rates direct next time and maybe book fights separately. It's not a 5 star hotel, but has very good facilities, very clean, has great staff and offers everything else we needed for our fun and full on two weeks family holiday in Orlando!

However, we chose this particular hotel because of the advertised scheduled free shuttle to Disney and Universal attractions. Because we had the opportunity to use the free shuttles at previous Embassy Suites we had stayed at, we made the mistake of assuming that this one would run just like the other ones we had used. Every hour on the hour. Wrong. There were two trips to Disney in the morning--8:30ish and 10:30ish. That's it. They will pick you up from Disney, but only at 5:15 pm, 8:15 pm and maybe 10:00ish? The Universal shuttles were even more scarce. We were really disappointed when we realized the free shuttle was different than other experiences at Embassy Suites. I should have called and looked into it before we left. Be careful. We tried the shuttle one day--it only drops off at Epcot--which was another big mistake, because we had a heck of a time getting to Downtown Disney, which was our destination. It was really more trouble than it was worth, and didn't work for us at all. It took us two ours to get to Downtown Disney with the tangled web of Disney Transportation. Take a cab and pay the $30. It will save you a lot of time and confusion. Also, the online brochure advertises a steam room. Don't be misled. I had a bit of a cold and was looking forward to a steam, but it seems they don't have one. No one at the front desk seemed to know. The men at the front door who greet you are fantastic, but one of the females who answered the phone was very unprofessional, and was laughing so hard she could hardly speak. The free breakfast is great, but the complimentary happy hour is pretty sad. The room was fine, but the furniture and carpet was pretty worn.

We were also travelling with another family with same aged kids. The Embassy Suites served our purpose very well. We wanted to be in the Disney area without the big Disney prices and with flexibility to come and go on our own schedule with rental cars and to eat non-Disney food. What we really liked about this hotel: --Rooms are good sized, amenities like kitchenette were very handy. --Breakfast in the AM made the start to each day pretty darn easy --Pools were nice for our kids --Free parking --No resort fees --Clean and fairly comfortable --Quiet What we wished would be different: --Pack and Play (aka crib) was tiny and rickety. My son ended up sleeping with us which was not so nice but he simply did not fit in the pack and play and frankly it was in shameful condition. The hotel should invest in larger size pack and plays (they do come in different sizes) and they should be checked that they are not completely wobbly. This one even had an egg size hole in the mess on one size. Not nice at all. --Plumbing is lousy. The shower drain was slow and that was disgusting. Our friends reported the same thing. I asked housekeeping to fix it and they never attended to it. --Main bed was soft. I might be spoiled as we bought a top of the line bed at home, but even so, a hotel bed should not feel soft and rocky. this hotel could invest some money in firmer matresses and I bet everyone staying at this hotel would be happy. --Curtains in living room do not close in such as way as to give full privacy to the living room space. We had to push furniture up against the windows in an effort to have full privacy so my daughter sleeping on the pullout sofa could not be seen by passerby in the halls. --Sofa-bed was miserably uncomfortable. For a four year old it really does not matter but for an adult it is truly a punishment. This was a bony frame that would make any adult long for home and I am pretty sure that is not what a hotel wants its guests to feel. I say all this with a grain of salt. We were paying a quarter of what the Disney hotels were charging Christmas week. It is a quick drive to all attractions. The hotel in general is quite nice and a little shopworn, but then again every hotel in Orlando gets a big workout. Still, the Embassy Suites could have kept the drains clearer and the beds firmer and so on. You are, afterall, in the sorta luxury hotel business. We had a lot of fun in Orlando and would go back. BTW, if you want a nice dinner go to Bahama Breeze across the street and sit behind the reggae guy outside and your kids can run around, its not too loud and the food is quite good.

I am a Diamond member at Hilton and stay at a Hilton property just about weekly. I spend usually 80 nights a year at hotels. From the second myself and my 8 year old got there it went down hill. We checked in at 4 oclock got the key from the desk clerk who barely said hello. I asked about getting a cart to get my luggage out of the car and he said to check with the person outside for one. I asked said person and the response I received was \" I am too busy too help you right now if you can come back in 20 minutes you can have the cart\" So needless to say I made several trips up and down to get our luggage. When we got in our room there was no remote for the TV, light bulbs were out. They sent Jose up to fix them,,he was super,,I didnt realize he and I would get to know each other on a first name basis. The room was by the elevator on the 6th floor and which was super noisy all week and one of the elevators was out of order for the first few days. The carpet in the bedroom under the sink had a 6 inch hole in it that really should be covered up with a $3 mat or something so as not to be an eyesore. The bathroom had rust around the bottom of the door frame which again, if touched up with paint would make the hotel not seem so run down. The shower to get hot water took like 10 minutes to get warm. The toilet every time you would flush it sounded like a sump pump then a shrill squeal at the end. I would not even flush in the middle of the night as I was afraid it would wake all the neighbors above and below me. That finally got fixed.The pull out sofa was sooo bad that my 8 year old son even complanied about the 2 inch mattress and the bars in his back that he refused to even sit on it. The managers reception was subpar to say the least. I stay at Embassy Suites all the time and generally it is cheese,crudite etc. The first night here was tortilla chips with ranch dressing, olives, banana peppers and some sort of cracker mix. The next night again ranch dressing popcorn and potato chips. The next night,,Horseradish ranch, animal crackers and pretzels. I could not think of more bizarre combinations if I tried. I went to the on site restaurant which is not affiliated with the hotel and that staff was super. I was telling my bartender about how horrible my experience was and she immeditaely got her Manager who asked about my stay, she apologized and said she would make sure the hotel manager knew. Which again I got to know Jose the maintanance person on a first name basis but not one word from management about my concerns. Jose gave my 8 year old a $25 ticket to spend in the shop downstairs and a fruit bowl showed up in my room. The outdoor pool is super small and again looks like it needs to be pressure washed as the bottom is black. The indooor pool was nice. And the breakfast was good. I have never, ever left a vacation a day early but I did this time and came back home, it was just that bad. I stayed the day before at the Hilton Grand Vacation club about a mile away and wish I had stayed there my whole vacation as it was awesome. It was only $98 night and worth every penny.

Room 326 (eastern exposure which I recommend) had microwave, good-sized dorm refrigerator with plenty of room for doggy bags/bottles of wine,etc. The granite wet bar with these amenities is a really nice touch. All countertops were granite and tv's were all good-sized flat screens. Where this hotel shines is in it's employees. Clearly they are well-managed and carefully chosen. Friendly, professional, and above all happy. No surly, curt employees here which is hugely refreshing in a touristy area. Location-wise you can't beat this for ease of strolling to many restaurants, as well as the Orange County Convention Center which is a 10-15 minute stroll along landscaped sidewalks and pathways. (Look out for the many pedi-cabs which work these pathways--they move quickly as they work only for tips. You need to move off the wide sidewalks to avoid them.) BTW, these pedi-cabs are a great choice when you leave the convention center and don't want to walk to hotel. Just go across the st. to the restaurants where they wait for patrons and pick one up there. Back to the hotel. Indoor and outdoor pools with hot tubs in each location. Great facilities include appropriate heat to enjoy all the water. The gym is well equipped with Precor ellipticals, treadmills, and a stationary bike. Exercise ball, etc. Breakfast is complimentary and was on par with some Royal Caribbean breakfast buffets we've had. Each morning offers plain bulk yogurt or little cups, two kinds of melon; oatmeal, cold cereals, toast, lackluster pastries (the weak link). Also on offer are delicious made to order omelettes and sides of bacon, sausage, homefries, pancakes. The cook is fast, don't be daunted by a short line. He really cranks out these omelettes in under a minute a piece. Complimentary happy hour is not to missed and also draws a small line. We enjoyed pina colado-esque mixed drinks, several type of cocktails to choose from, or draft Bud. Late night dinner for 8 - 10 in the hotel restaurant was disappointing for the slowness of the food to arrive. Our orders took well over 30 min to arrive and there were only 2 other tables. But my burger and homemade cole slaw were tasty once they arrived. Final thoughts: the hotel has been upgraded and is in generally very good condition. Especially nice place to spend time: on the outdoor poolside chaises-brand new Tropitones, gorgeous and comfortable. Nice outdoor lunch venue adjacent. Only drawback to this hotel: it backs up to I-4 so there is background noise of this freeway.

All of the front desk personnel are very friendly and treat me great. This hotel also have a fantastic cooked to order breakfast and Carmen makes the absolute best omelette in Orlando and Miss Charlene fixes the best drinks during the managers reception everyday from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Let me also mention Jose one of the engineers.

We are Hilton Honors members and usually love Embassy Suites but we were so disappointed with this stay. A prior guest mentioned a problem with a pushy bellman. Apparently, this problem has not been remedied. When I told Richard, the bellman that his help wasn\u2019t necessary, he stated that \u201cI have to push the cart.\u201d When I again stated that we were fine, he snapped \u201cI only have one cart and I can\u2019t let you have it.

He stated \u201cas long as you bring it back down immediately\u201d, and he finally walked away. Aside from being extremely pushy and obnoxious, Richard was lying because I know the hotel has at least two luggage carts because we saw them at check in. This was our welcome to the hotel. The d\u00e9cor of the rooms is circa 1970\u2019s, the curtains, sofa and carpet desperately need to be replaced. However, the white bedding and flat screen televisions were appreciated. All the rooms are sprayed with a sickening sweet room deodorizer. Also, despite multiple visits from maintenance, the air conditioning was never adjusted properly and our bedroom was still extremely uncomfortable. The main reasons we stay at Embassy Suites are for the up-to-date spacious rooms and for the breakfast service. Unfortunately, this hotel is lacking in both. Anyone who would rate this breakfast highly has not stayed at other Embassy Suites or is just thrilled to have an all-you-can eat \u201cfree\u201d breakfast. The omelets were overcooked and dry; the bacon was very fatty and limp, not crispy; the scrambled eggs tasted like egg substitute; and the muffins were ice cold and gummy.

Regarding the manager\u2019s reception, we do not drink cocktails but did notice that the line was ridiculously long during the reception hours. Perhaps, additional employees should attend to the guests during this time. Also, we did not use the indoor pool because the chlorine smell was overpowering and the outdoor pool area was so small and crowded, it could not accommodate all the guests.

I'll break my review down into sections for easier reading. Location - Excellent. The suites are a short walk (and I mean very short) to many good restaurants and pubs. Olive Garden is next door and across the street you have Bahama Breeze, and Millers Ale House, both very good places to eat and drink. A short trip down the street is Pointe Orlando which contains a number of excellent eateries which are somewhat more expensive - Maggianos and the Capital Grille are in my opinion the two best. Accommodation - The accommodation in the Embassy suites comprises a large bedroom (we opted for a king size bed) and a reception room which is also very large. The bathroom however is small by American standards. The rooms are beginning to look a little dated but are spotlessly clean and there is a daily maid service which is excellent. Sheets are changed every 3 days and can be done more often if requested. The rooms are quiet (we were on the 6th floor) and very comfortable. Beds are excellent. The rooms however do not have a balcony which might put some people off. Food - Embassy Suites includes breakfast and I can tell you, it's a very good breakfast. Good quality juices, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals, tea, coffee etc.. They also have a cooking station where they will make up a full cooked breakfast to order. I even met a nice lady called Carmen who I asked to cook Huevos Rancheros (a Mexican dish) for my breakfast. She wasn't familiar with the dish but to my surprise she went and got the recipe later in the day and cooked it for me the following (and subsequent) mornings. Now that is top notch service. If you have the full breakfast you will have no need to eat lunch. Service - All staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Pool - Unfortunately, the outdoor pool was closed for refurbishment when we were there, but the management arranged for us to use the pool facilities at the Hilton Orlando (which was excellent) and they even paid for transportation there. In our case we drove but they paid our parking charges. They also gave us free wi-fi to make up for the inconvenience of not having the pool. That's very good customer service in my book. Manager's reception. Embassy suites also have a reception from 5:30 to 7:30 where they have a free bar. Beers, cocktails and spirits all free for two hours. That can't be bad. Summary - If you want comfortable accommodation in a good location at a price that won't break the bank, then you'll find it hard to beat this. Overall, very good value. Tip - The i-Ride bus stops outside Embassy suites and travels the length of International Drive. Buses arrive about every 15 minutes. Handy if you are going to dinner and don't want to drive. $17 buys unlimited travel for 2 weeks.

On other fronts, the snacks at the manager's reception were weak (pretzels, chips and crackers), but the drinks were excellent. The breakfast fare was very good and the omlette chef extremely friendly and making a good product. Unfortunately, all of the hot items outside of oatmeal (including eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes) were behind the omlette counter and not out on a buffet.

We stayed in Disney for the first 5 nights before changing to this hotel. It is on the less hectic end of I drive and has ample free parking. The saving grace if I had to choose one is how friendly the bell hops and housekeeping were. Now to the experience that we endured. We arrived at 1pm and had lunch while the room was not ready, no problem as we were early. I helped the bell hop store our luggage in one of the boardrooms and he handed me the ticket stubs for our bags. We had lunch in the hotel bar that was fine. We were then given our key and we checked into our suite on the 6th floor. One of the lifts on our side was out of order and remained so for a number of days. We only had one bed in the room and had requested a double when we booked through our travel agent. When I called the desk to enquire about changing rooms I was told that I was on the transfer list and to call down in the morning. They explained the hotel was full and we could not be moved that day. I was then told that my travel agent had \"forced through the booking\" and that is why we had only one bed. I called the travel agent the next morning and was advised the room was booked in January and this was not the case that it was booked last minute. We rang reception twice before our luggage finally arrived and we were told that the reason for the delay was that the bags were put into a room with guests who had the same surname. This was hard to accept as I had handed the stubs for the luggage to the receptionist as I took the room key. The stubs were numbered so why was the name on the case used? More concerning was the fact we were told that the mistake was only noticed when the luggage was spotted outside the room where it was delivered. Thankfully nothing was missing from the cases. They were put in the wrong room where they could easily have been gone through. One of the chairs in the room was covered in stains and was a disgrace. How housekeeping had left this in the room is beyond me. The next morning I dropped down to reception to see about moving to a room with two beds. I was met by a girl who was in full flow of enjoying her first juicy fruit of the day. The packet was on the desk in front of her for all to see. She continued to chew the gum throughout the conversation I had with her. I asked about been moved and she advised they were completely full. I then had to push her to ask when would a room become available as we were there for 11 nights. She told me it would be on Sunday and this was now a Thursday morning. I thanked her for the time and agreed to move rooms on the Sunday. I walked past the same person later that day and she was still chewing away. I went back to my room and rang down to reception to meet with either the manager or the duty manager. I was told to come down to reception where I sat down with the duty manager and told him about my experience for the first 24 hours in the hotel. We came to an agreement in relation to the room that was appreciated and the chair was replaced. He also took away a sample of what was found around the sink in the upstairs. We were moved on the Sunday and the staff moved everything for us and even checked the wardrobe for items we did not pack. Again very helpful. What really disappointed me was no one ever came near us again to see if the new room was okay or even a note in the door to wish us a pleasant stay for the remainder of our time in the hotel. The breakfast was ordinary and Denny's provided our breakfast for most of the stay. One of the lifts on ourside of the hotel was out of order for 3-4 days at the busiest times while we were there. A sign was eventually placed on the lift that it was out of order and then when it was fixed the sign was dumped behind the elevator for a day or so before been picked up. The rooms were big but the air con was leaking through the roof of our first room, as it did beside the bar in the downstairs area one afternoon. The outdoor pool was disgusting as were the splash pools surrounding the main pool. Full of bugs etc. A rat was disposed off on one of the afternoons that I was outside. We used the pool once and that was it. It was pretty small also. Managers drinks was a great idea however from the 3 or 4 nights we were part took no management came to the table to say hello. There is a shop on the ground floor and the movies at managers drinks time was a good idea to let the adults relax outside the room were the movie was been shown. The lines to get to the bar were sometimes long when only one person was manning the bar. This was longer if you ordered two beers and a soft drink as the staff member would have to take the drink to the table as they were not allowed to be seen to serve more then two dinks per person, even soft drinks! There were free ices at the freezer in the reception, the security guard enjoyed these. Watched him make a few trips one evening. If you are going to stay then request a room overlooking the front of the hotel. As I said before the team of guys you had outside the hotel were fantastic and are a credit to you. Management could learn a thing or two from them. This is at most a 2-3 star hotel. I look forward to getting a response form the manager as I did not have the pleasure of meeting him in person during the 11 night stay we had, at least a message on the phone during the stay would have been nice John to acknowledge the problems we had. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor before we left I was sure we were going to be well looked after unfortunately this was not the case.

Breakfast was a big hit along with the manager's evening reception.

The staff were polite and courteous and couldn't do enough for us. Our suite was on the 7th floor facing International Drive. We had a few problems with the room which were quickly resolved - we were compensated with vouchers for the restaurant, shop and a free movie. These problems were not entirely a surprise as the hotel is slightly dated and in need of modernisation. Our only issue was with the free shuttle to the theme parks - 3 years ago the driver was excellent (who may have retired now) - this time there were many drivers who insisted on knowing the time that you wanted to be picked up. Twice we had a problem in returning - once from Disney on an extremely hot day (97F) - we waited for over 30 minutes and the driver only turned up after we called and the second time from Universal when we had to come back with someone else as the shuttle was full.

We had been staying at the Enclave on Carrier Drive for the first 5 nights and wanted the last 5 nights in a better hotel so had researched which hotel on Trip advisor back home before booking. The one thing I noticed that stood out was the Embassy Hotel Reviews were always replied to by the manager, which is rare! I read reviews all the time for different hotels I wish to stay at and look at travellers picture which help make my mind up on which hotel I would like to stay at. The icing on the cake was the manager responding all the time to good and bad reviews and always making sure people have a great stay. Once we had booked the hotel I emailed the hotel to see if it was possible to get a room overlooking International Drive, very promptly I got a response saying that wouldn't be a problem and my request would be met. We arrived at the hotel early as we were only 5 minutes away from the Enclave, as our room wasn't ready I had an excuse to go back to Mall at Millennia! (Got Jimmy Choo Uggs on sale!) When we came back our room was ready :o) My husband checked us in while I waited in the car with the kids, I had no experience with front desk, but they always seemed very welcoming and had a smile on there face. Another one of the reasons we booked the Embassy is that we had stayed at the one at Miami airport in 2009 and were impressed. So we knew the basics of what to expect by the \"brand\". We were on the 8th floor, on the floor was Laundry facilities and an ice machine. Our room overlooked International Drive, from the bedroom there was a balcony you could step out on. The living area is excellent, there was a large tv, dining table, chairs, sofa, foot stools, a sink with microwave, ice bucket, fridge and lots of cupboard space. From the living area is 2 doors, 1 to the bedroom the other to the bathroom. The bedroom had a very large bed! another sink, and lots of drawer space and a massive wardrobe! It was now time for the managers reception! This is not an Urban myth! its true! free drink for 2 hours! I have taken a few pictures of hat drink you can get. I would have Rose, my husband would have beer, but we did try vodka and the cocktails as well. It was a very relaxing atmosphere. When I had 1 drink, my son would watch a film in the cinema room, with other children, its a great idea as many parents would do the same, some nights the kids got carried away and there was a cushion fight! my son loved it! I think there was a popcorn fight another night (not my son!) The area was kept very clean for the children and always someone on hand to tidy up. The bartenders are very nice people, so we would give them $1 every time we would go to the bar, they were very thankful and would always say thank you for your appreciation. We would usually have a few drinks they head out to dinner. In the morning was breakfast time! Usually I would go get breakfast first and then my husband then the kids as I would go down to breakfast while everyone slept! There was loads to choose from, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, etc... Now I had never tried Omelette before, and I read the reviews and said im not gonna eat an omelette im not an omelette person, well I don't know what make me wait in line but I got my first omelette and it was with cheese, 1 word.... WOW.... I loved it! There was sodas to choose from and fresh orange apple. I did notice that a lady while we stayed there had empty water bottles in her bag and proceeded to fill the bottles up with fresh orange and apple juice, I was kinda annoyed as I was waiting for 1 apple juice, but she was filling up 3 bottles to then put in her bag, how mean! as if juice is so expensive to buy! After breakfast I went to the business centre to check my emails, it was mainly to see how my dad was keeping as he gets hospital treatment once a week and I was keen to hear how he has been getting on. I got in but no email so I would check later on that day. Once we had returned from our busy day the business centre was jammed packed of school kids from Brazil. Now i know kids are kids but I really wanted to check my email, turned out I couldn't as I would have been there for hours. My husband asked front desk if there was any solution, and they gave me a code to use the wifi at the hotel as we had our Ipad with us. It was a god send, as I could check my email and Internet from my room or anywhere in the hotel! Thanks Embassy Reception :o) On the way out one night I noticed a freezer at the entrance of the hotel, inside is ice poles for the kids! Great idea! Thanks Embassy :o) I used the indoor pool once with my 3 year old son and it was excellent, it ready gave him a lot of confidence in the water, my husband watched him while I tried the hot tub and the sauna. One day we returned from the parks there was an envelope through our door, we opened it as it just had the room number of the envelope, inside was a gift voucher for $25 for the shop, we could not understand why we had this as well as having someone else's name for our room. My husband took it back to reception and explained this is our room but not for our name, the gentleman at reception checked his records and couldn't explain it either and as a goodwill gesture told us to keep the voucher. Thanks again Embassy :o) One day we were sitting at the I ride bus stop a kind lady and her son who were also staying at the hotel gave us a free i ride pass each! she said the hotel gives them to you if your going to Seaworld. I think they do this as the hotel offers buses to Disney and Universal, they offer the pass for Seaworld, but you could use the iride to go other places as well, check out my picture and you will see what it looks like. Thanks again Embassy! Lastly the staff are so friendly! Everyone had a welcomed smile, whether in the lift or in the hallway, they always had time for guests, well done Embassy! As you can see all these little extras add up, free Internet, free breakfast, free drinks, free Iride, it makes the icing on the cake!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kingsatyrx", "Title": "\u201cCustomer Service Was Outstanding\u201d", "Author": "kingsatyrx", "ReviewID": "UR116184162", "Content": "I have promised all of my fellow trip advisor users a fair review of this hotel.

Room was also noisy from Interstate highway traffic. A couple of museums and several restaurants on South International Drive that we were too tired from Disney to visit.

The desk clerk mentioned this and gave us coupons for free drinks in the bar without us asking. The breakfast was amazing. The first morning I ate really light, I did not want much food in my stomach for the WW rides. The chef made me a one egg omelet and it was delicious. The second morning we ate hearty. At the first breakfast my husband wrote on a comment card that his preferred sweetener was not available. That night there was a small gift pack in our room, containing \"his\" sweetener and a note from the GM. We also took advantage of the indoor pool and sauna. They were nice.

The suites are very roomy and well appointed. The beds are comfortable and there's lots of drawer space (something my wife always comments on!).

The buffet breakfast was great - a huge selection - though it does get busy at the most popular times. The managers complimentary cocktails each evening is ok, but the seating areas seemed to get a bit dirty with people not tidying up after themselves. Staff are around to clean up, but it just looks a bit of a mess in the meantime.

I guess you wouldn't spend too much time there anyway, but it's nice to have somewhere to relax on your less busy days. The location of the hotel is very good - just a few minutes walk from lots of restaurants, bars and shops (Pointe Orlando). We've stayed at lots of places along International Drive and I would say this is one of the best in terms of location.

This hotel needs to be updated significantly and should not be compared to other Embassy Suites. The room we stayed in, on the 6th floor, had crumbs on the floor, and the trim in the bathroom had quite alot of water damage. The pull out sofa bed had alot of cigarette burns in the sheets and blankets on it (this was a non-smoking room) and the mattress was so thin that you could feel the coils and it was very uncomfortable for the kids. The tv remote did not have batteries that worked, so we requested more. This was fine, but was just another annoying thing. the elevators we used were very outdated and had crumbs all in the floors. Others have left decent reviews about this hotel, so it may just be that our room was nasty. But, in my opinion and given the location of this hotel, there is no reason that it is not updated and immaculate. Especially, given that it takes 35,000 points to stay there and is supposed to be an upper-level hotel. We decided that the hotel probably puts most of their money into the lobby area, which was pretty and they breakfast that was served to guests is really pretty good. But, if you would like to pay for a clean room and expect to get what you pay for (even though we used points), I don't recommend this hotel.

We reserved three rooms with king size beds and all were supposed to be on the same floor. Upon check-in we were told that our rooms were not on the same floor. We went up to our room (after riding an incredibly slow that took forever to arrive and close) and the door to the room was open - as if someone was already staying there. We then went back downstairs via the slow elevator and were advised that the manager had left the door open after confirming it was clean. We entered the room and observed a big white object on the ottoman and on the floor. We called down and by the time someone answered the phone (10-15 rings) a maintenance guy came in and advised it was the shower curtain and hung it up. We then noticed that the room had double beds. We called again and advised we were supposed to be a king size bed. They moved us. \\After this unnecessary ordeal I went to take a shower. I got in the shower and noticed water not draining, and when my husband checked to see what was wrong black stuff got in the water which was now up to my calves. We called downstairs again and they sent another maintenance guy to fix it. It was fixed. This guy was quick, friendly and the best part of the stay. The ceiling of the bathroom looked like it had cystic acne. I don't know what could make the ceiling look like this - water leaks? Let's talk about the climate control in the room. Apparently there was something broken with the system that prevented it from delivering heat. That was fine with me, but it bothered other members of our party who were cold the entire trip. But whether you wanted hot or cold air, everytime the system turned off (hit the temperature set on the thermostat) there would be a loud bang from the ceiling. I'm not talking about the normal clicking sound that old climate control systems make - I'm talking about someone banging a drum or slamming a door - everytime the system turned off. This woke up almost every member of our party during the night. Suddenly ----BANG, you've never heard a noise like this come out of a climate control system.

We aren't fussy people so didn't bother to complain but I'm shocked that the cleaning staff hadn't mentioned it to management as it was very evident. The shower head was loose from the wall and with the shower on, the tap would still run regardless. Again, very trival and it didn't really bother us as the pressure and temp were lovely but I'm surprised that this room had been let out. The maids were inconsistant with bin emptying and towel replenishment but the worst, very worst, was this. Two days into a 10 night stay, my husband lost his PJ bottoms. We found them the day before we left muddled in the bottom of the eiderdown. The linen had obviously not been changed in over a week.

I felt this he was trying to force me to obtain his services for a tip so I asked the desk clerk for a cart but she directed me right back to the same bellhop who was holding the luggage carts hostage.

It has an indoor plaza with plenty of tables and lots of plants. The staff is friendly and responsive, from the waiters in the restaurants to the bell hops. The rooms are also well furnished and clean. However, there are some design flaws with the rooms. For example, the entrance to the room has a tall window on each side of the door. That seems like a nice touch until you come inside and realize that it's very easy for people walking by to look into your room. They have curtains on both windows, but the curtains still leave a gap along the edge of the door. If you like to lounge around in your underwear, you better do it in the bedroom. See my photos to see what I'm talking about. Another problem is the shower. I am 6 feet tall. Not short, but not super tall either. The shower head is at my chest level. If you are tall and have any kind of back problems, you may have a hard time taking a shower in these rooms. Don't bother with the free breakfast. The eggs I had were watery and the potatoes were not much better. There wasn't much variety in their selection of fruits and cereals either. You have a Friendly's and a Denny's about 1 minute away and even an IHOP just past the convention center. Go there instead. On the plus side, you are not too far from some excellent restaurants for lunch and dinner. I highly recommend the Funky Monkey Wine Bar, which is about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The convention center is about 20 minutes walk time. Overall, it's not a bad hotel, but it's not great either. if you can live with it's flaws, it's not a bad deal.

The bed was extremely comfortable, not too hard or soft, and it's nice to have the living room between you and the hotel hallway because it reduces the noise. It was nice to be able to grab breakfast on the way to the convention and though it was nothing special it had a good variety (omelettes, bagels, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt). I agree with the previous reviews that it is annoying to have to pay for internet and that would be my one recommendation to the Embassy Suites is just because other hotels do it doesn't make it right.

My review will not go anywhere close enough to do it justice. Even before our stay, I was amazed by the response to emails I had sent to the hotel asking about a few items such as shuttle times etc and a few personal requests. You really get the feeling that everyone will do all they can to accommodate the guests and make the trip as enjoyable and special as possible. And that your individual stay is exceptionally important to them. We had initially booked a 14 night stay at this hotel but due to the Air Traffic problems linked with the Icelandic Volcano, our visit ended us being extended by a further 9 days. This gave us even more time to appreciate the facilities of the Hotel but also time to be further amazed by the friendliness, kindness and the exceptional way the staff go above and beyond to ensure their guests enjoy their stay. I will talk of this later in my review. Approaching the Hotel it looks proud and welcoming stood in the quieter and in my opinion, more refined location at the southern end of International Drive. As mentioned before in other reviews, there is the I-Ride stop number 22 just outside the hotel and also a Lynx stop. Nearby restaurants all within very easy walking distance include the delicious and exceptionally friendly Olive Garden, Tony Roma\u2019s, Sizzlers, Pizza Hut, Subway, Bahama Breeze, Cattlemans Steakhouse, Ponderosa, TGI Friday\u2019s, Boston Lobster Feat, Friendly\u2019s, Houlihan and not too far away, Ming Court. As soon as you walk towards to entrance of the hotel you are greeted by cheery faces from whatever member of staff is one duty at that particular time. You walk in the entrance lobby/reception area and the WOW factor kicks in, the atrium further in to the hotel invites you to wander further in to complete the first impression experience. The Reception staff greet you with a smile and deal with your check-in in a speedy and professional manner, offering any additional information that may be necessary to ensure you feel at home and acquainted with the surrounding of the Hotel immediately. We found all other occasions when we either went to the Reception desk with a query or just passed by on our way in or out of the Hotel there was a smiley face and cheerful greeting. Our room (number 218) was delightful, it was a corner room, facing the I4 Interstate but we never found the sound of passing vehicles a nuisance, this was great, as in our own home we live in a rural area with no sounds at all, so we found ourselves pleasantly surprised to not be bothered by the sounds of passing traffic. In fact it is a point to note that the whole hotel seems extremely well soundproofed and we never noticed noise form rooms above or to the side of us even though we knew they were occupied. The living area of the suite appeared huge and we made use of the Double sofa bed for one of the members of our party for the duration of the holiday and most days left the bed in situ rather than pack it away each day, we still had plenty of space to move about in the living area, and didn\u2019t feel too cluttered. We had a full size under the counter fridge, with small ice box (the icebox didn\u2019t tend to freeze items though unless they were flat against the surface, but this didn\u2019t pose a problem for us). We also had a microwave and coffee maker. (The coffee maker didn\u2019t appear to boil the water to a temperature good enough to make a decent cup of tea, again this wasn\u2019t a problem but if you are a tea drinker, it might be worth taking a travel kettle or asking to see if Reception have a kettle you could make use of). Everyday the stock of complimentary toiletries was replenished, these items consisted of mini shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion. A couple of days we returned to our room to find swans or elephants made out of towels on the beds. This was a great treat and a nice touch. The main bedroom had large patio doors with a narrow balcony, it had net curtains as well as fully lined black out curtains so your room remained private to people walking past outside. Our room had leafy trees outside the windows so this also gave a degree of additional privacy but without appearing to block out any sunlight. We had two double beds which were very comfortable. There is also a large flat screen tv in both the living room and the bedroom. The wardrobe was a brilliant size to hang all our holiday clothes and the sideboard was huge with plentiful drawer space to pack everything away. There was a hairdryer and Iron and Ironing board in the room. On every even numbered floor there is a laundry corner with a washing machine, tumble drier and soap powder vending machine. There are plentiful selections of Ice Machine which you can take the Ice Bucket from your room to fill up for free. There are also food and drink vending machines dotted all around the hotel if you fancy some munchies or are thirsty and don\u2019t want to wander down to the shop. The shop is fairly small but sells everything you could possibly need from toiletries, clothes, food and drink to souvenirs. The gentleman there seemed a little shy but once he got to know us we had great chats. The Managers Reception was a lovely added extra to the stay and it was so brilliant to be given something for free these days, I thoroughly enjoyed trying the different cocktails on offer whilst my husband chilled with a beer and his daughter quenched her thirst on soft drinks. The snacks they provided were lovely and plentiful, the salsa dip and ranch dressing were especially nice and to think this was all laid on for free. I was surprised at how many guests seemed to forget to offer tips to the ever friendly and jovial bar staff. This daily event provided us with a great opportunity to mingle with other guests and was the thing that helped us to make friends with people and through this we have created a great friendship with another couple from the UK who ordinarily we may never had sat and chatted with as we would have just been guests that passed each other by during our stay. But because of these free drinks/snacks one or other of the couples would grab a spot ready for our evening catch-ups and our daily laughs. What a brilliant way to end each evening. The shuttles laid on for free went at times we felt were suitable to enable you to visit the parks and we even managed to stay to the firework display at Disney Hollywood Studios and still get the shuttle back. The outside swimming pool was never crowded and most of our stay the inside pool was empty so we felt like we had our own private sauna, hot tub Jacuzzi and pool when we visited it. Both pools had plenty enough chairs and loungers to chill on when we didn\u2019t fancy a dip. There was piped music which we felt was an added touch, it was not too loud but enough to unwind and relax to. Outside there were little lizards sometimes popping out of the undergrowth but these never became a nuisance or bothered us as they scupper out of your way if you go towards them. I normally hate all reptiles but I found them really cute and fascinating. There was always a plentiful stock of fluffy white towels to use in either of the pools. The Business Centre was great as we could use the internet for free and had use of the printer etc which proved a great help in our holiday, there was also a space where we could take our laptop and use that there, thereby allowing us access to all our own files and documents etc. The breakfast buffet was always fresh and the area kept spotlessly clean and hygienic. The selection was brilliant, from memory there were good quality yogurts, apples, oranges, bananas muffins, bagels, mini Danish pastries, bread and a toaster to put it through yourself, jams, Philadelphia cheese portions, butters, four different selections of cereals, from memory, raisin bran, fruit loops, cornflakes and cherries, also grits and porridge with a selection of different granola sprinkle to add if you so wish. The cooked selection was eggs, scrambled or fried to your own specific request. The choice of omelettes was mind blowing but extremely fresh and tasty. There was crispy bacon, sausages, corned beef hash, breakfast potato chunks, French toast and pancakes. There was also little extras such as chocolate sauce, maple syrup and salsa portions. There were fruit juice and iced tea/soda vending machines to help yourself from and hot drinks machines also providing hot water for cups of tea or hot chocolate. The Atrium where the seating is for the dining area was nice and bright and airy and the seating area didn\u2019t feel to cluttered so you felt you had space around you whilst you were eating. It was lovely to sit amongst leafy lush plants and rockeries with gentle waterfalls. The staff where very quick to clean crockery etc away but never in an overbearing manner, two members of staff shone out for us and they were Elene and Alyssa I think. I never ate in the Fisheye grill restaurant so can\u2019t comment on that but the seating area was tastefully decorated and looked really nice. The Concierge area seemed to have a lot of information and the chap on the desk \u2013 Robbie I think his name was is very friendly and appeared to be very helpful to those needing assistance. Other people who we feel need an extra special mention are Robert who genuinely seemed sad to see us leave when we finally got the call to go home, Teresa, Cody, Alvera, Tiffany, Ken and we have saved the best till last, Dee. Well what can we say about Dee, for us he was the highlight of the hols with his cheery face and greeting everytime we saw him, he always seems so pleased to see us and always made the time to stop and chat with us, like we were VIP Guests. He made my step-daughters day by showing us his spiderman skills by performing his back flips and acrobatics. He also came and personally brought her a leaving gift on the day we eventually set off for home. Talking of going home, as mentioned previously, we were some of the Brits who found themselves stranded across the Atlantic when we couldn\u2019t get flights home to the UK. The hotel was amazing and made the situation as painless as possible by always making sure we had our places in our rooms extended each time we heard that the possibility of going home had been further delayed. We luckily never felt we were going to be booted out of our rooms like other guests in other hotels nearby. As soon as the situation regarding being stranded happened the hotel immediately offered all UK guests stranded 50% off any bill in the Fisheye Grill Restaurant. They also allowed us to make some emergency and important calls from the reception desk free of charge. We also were provided with and amazing offer for Internet Access in our room (don\u2019t want to shout what it was just in case someone shouldn\u2019t have done so and don\u2019t want any person to get in trouble, but if staff read these reviews, thanks to whoever it was). But finally the thing that touched us most once we were stranded was the fact that the hotel organised and provided us with a free Pizza Party put on just especially for all the stranded brits in their hotel. It showed us all how cared for and important we were as guests. We found special invites put under our doors and when the evening came around we all could not believe the amount of effort and thought that had gone into the party, the volumes of free food laid on for us all was astounding, I think we all only just managed to finish the food before we all rolled off happily to our rooms. It was a really happy evening full of laughter amidst all the trauma and stress and uncertainty of being stranded abroad. For anyone unsure whether to book this hotel, go for it you will not be disappointed. For anyone who has booked and is just checking out the reviews before your hols, you are in for a real treat. Finally, for all the staff at the Embassy Suites, thank you for making our stay so memorable, watch out, one day we will be back.

Location is great, with many great restaurants around. But when I got in the shower, I kept feeling dripping ice water on my head. It took me a few minutes to figure out that there was a PVC dripline coming right out of the center of the bathtub ceiling. Thinking it was a release from a bathroom leak above me, I went down to the front desk who told me that all bathrooms had this, and that it was the condensation drip from the a/c in the room. The lady told me the only way to avoid ice water from dripping on my head was to turn off the a/c for 30 minutes before your shower, and to keep it off until after you stepped out of the tub. This is really bizarre, and I'm surprised that A) the builders would have allowed this in the design of the rooms and B) other TripAdvisors haven't mentioned it yet. If management is listening, why does the a/c drip into the center of the bathtub, and is it really this way in every bathroom? Other that that, the rooms are dated and tired but clean. There were several members of our group that complained of moldy and musty smells in their rooms. My other complaint was the $10 daily charge for wireless internet - nobody charges for wireless internet anymore. Trying to be funny with the nice girl at the front desk about paying for wireless internet, I also asked her if the hotel also provided banks of payphones for guest use - she didn't understand my joke and pointed my way to where there actually were payphones. Positives about the hotel are the friendliness of the staff, and the value of the overall product with the larger rooms, free cocktails, and free breakfast.

Meals in the retaurant were very good too. Pleasant and helpful staff and good service all round. The only downside was the noise from outside. We had a room that faced onto I 4 and the traffic noise was bad, even during the night. Also, from a safety point of view, children do need to be supervisd at all times on the higher floors.

Our room did smell a little musty on arrival but that soon wore off (or maybe we just got used to it).

The hotel is in an excellent location, we have stayed in other hotels at the same end of I-Drive but this the was best for it's location. We felt quite secure as the rooms all open out onto the central atrium rather than the outside. Breakfast was excellent, food was kept topped up even during the very busy weekend of our second week. The transport provided to the parks was adequate but very busy even in November and we had to stand for the journey a couple of times. The service from staff was good although the receptionist did not bother to wish me a 'Happy Birthday' despite seeing the badge I was wearing. The hotel had been advised of my birthday but I was a little disappointed that it was not acknowledged in any way by the hotel. I did feel that at times the staff tended to concentrate their attentions on conference attendees rather than holidaymakers but as a conference hotel I guess this is understandable.

They have a happy hour from noon until 7:00 PM with 5.00 drinks and appetizers. The hotel rooms need a little updating. By that I mean that the \"wood\" furniture is starting to chip and the shower head needs to be moved up about 6 inches. I am 5'11\" and the shower head come up to my chin. I had to bend over at the waist to wash my hair. Room was still great though. All rooms consist of a living room with a sink, fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Separate bedroom with sink vanity. Bed was a little firm for me, but perfect for hubby. Both TVs are LCD (awesome picture!). The one thing I did not like is that there are windows on either side of the door (all rooms surround the atrium). Even though there are curtains there, the curtains leave a gap where people can see in. I think if the curtain rods curved towards the wall that would fix the problem. We had to push the chair up against the curtain to keep in closed. Very annoying and I felt exposed. That's why I docked one star from the rating. The restaurant, Fisheye Grill, was a bit pricy. It was 60.00 with tip for 2 sodas, 2 appetizers (chicken tenders) and 2 \"meals\" (quesadilla with nothing on the side, no fries, nothing). Food was great, but definitely not budget friendly. It would have been a reasonable price if the quesadilla actually had fries or something with it. I would consider it an appetizer, not a meal. Free breakfast was great. All hot foods were kept behind the grill counter. Omelets are cooked very quickly so we never waited more than a minute or two. Hot foods were eggs/omelets cooked to order, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries and pancakes. Other foods were biscuits, english muffins, pastry, cereal and fruit. Soda, coffee, juice and milk machines. Also, every night there is a manager's reception from 5:30-7:30. Free drinks (you can take two at a time) with chips/salsa and popcorn. Self-parking was free and we never had a problem finding a spot. Valet parking was 10.00 a day. Not worth it considering we found a parking spot within the same walking distance as the valet spaces which is about 50 feet from the front door. Might be worth it during the busy season.

The room was comfortable and cleaned daily, with the maids also leaving towels in the shapes of swans on the bed, an appreciated touch. The breakfast was substantial with omelettes cooked to order along with other hot and cold buffet style items. The only disappointment, which I do not blame the hotel for, was the coffee which left a lot to be desired in terms of taste, which is probably not an american strong point. A decent cappuccino would not have gone amiss. However, this was a minor blemish considering that there were delicious pancakes, (this certainly is an american strong point!) with fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and unlimited juices and soft drinks. The happy hour was a welcome feature considering that it was free. The cocktails were a pre-prepared variety, but nevertheless. I repeat, this was complimentary and I simply cannot have any complaints. The drinks were accompanied with nachos served with a freshly prepared salsa, along with popcorn and pretzels which we snacked on each evening. A special thanks goes to the concierge Robby, who was always helpful in providing information even though we never actually purchased any tickets from him. He even gave us his own personal suggestions on his favourite restaurants and attractions, and was always happy to chat and to share his experiences. He deserves credit from the hotel. Furthermore, on our first night the gentleman at the check in desk was also kind enough to provide us with a free 24 hours of internet connection for our laptop so we could try it out, which usually is 9.95 for 24 hours.

Loosely termed kitchen as it consisted of a full size fridge, microwave, coffee machine and sink. The other room had two queen sized beds and a wash basin area. Each room has two large flat screen tv's. What was even better about this hotel was the free (yes free) breakfasts. This meant you could have your breakfast without having to go out to a restaurant. There was everything you could want for breakfast, perhaps not as extensive as the all you can eats buffets elsewhere but more than enough for us Brits and did I say it was free! the omelette station meant fresh cooked to order omelettes every morning.

I had read many wonderful reviews and I had certain expectations. Some were on the mark - the breakfast was good, but could get very crowded. The room was nice and the staff was accomodating. However, a few things on their website should have been clearer. They advertise \"free transportation to the parks\". This is true - but VERY limited. There were 4 times you could leave from the hotel & 4 times you could get back from Magic Kingdom & Epcot. There was only ONE time for all of the other parks. None of the times were appealing, and most of them would have caused you to miss some of the coolest things in the park - like the Electric Parade and the Laser Show. We ended up driving ourselves and paying for parking. Also, one of my biggest complaints - they advertise \"Hotel-wide internet access and free business center\". The internet access in the rooms is $10 PER DAY and the business center (where you could access the internet for free) was 3 computers that were always in use. I had brought my laptop to upload vacation pictures to my Facebook, and once I finally was able to get to an open computer, Facebook was blocked. Overall, it was a nice hotel.

We never took the Trolley so I\u2019m not sure about that but I did see a large bus every morning and evening outside the hotel for Disney/Universal transport. Now onto details regarding the hotel: The outside is currently in the process of being re-painted into a pretty yellow/gold color, which I must say is much more appealing than the blue and white theme they previously had going on. The outside looks great with the new paint! When you first walk in the hotel the staff is eager and friendly to greet you and the decoration is pretty. The atrium is nice and kept very clean and despite being Thanksgiving weekend, it was never too crowded or loud. The hotel has 8 floors and we stayed on the 5th with a room facing the front. Our view and room were great. It was nice and clean and things looked recently renovated. The master bedroom has a flat screen TV as well as the Living room. All and all I would rate the rooms a 4, the only reason I would not rate a 5 is because 1- the bathroom could be a bit bigger, and 2- the curtains in the living room could be a bit longer to prevent outsiders from looking in. Other than that no complaints, we enjoyed our stay. As for the breakfast there was pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, omelets, hash browns, grits, potatoes, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, and juice; and the food was very good. The staff kept the food coming out hot and there were not a bunch of kids running around spilling things. There are ample places to sit also. As for the managers reception there were free drinks, popcorn, chips and salsa. Regarding the staff everyone was very helpful especially the concierge, both of the guys who worked there were willing to go above and beyond, they were the best people we met there. The bartenders could use a little work, but I think because they were so swamped each evening that contributed to their cranky demeanor. The outdoor pool is very very small but the inside pool is nice. The fitness center also has treadmills with individual TV's on them! Well I think that's everything, if you need somewhere to stay in Orlando definitely choose this hotel over the one on Jamaican Court.

I have no allergies whatsoever and this room had me stuffed up like I had a bad cold! I finally turned off the A/C, opened the window and let in the 90 degree humid air just to get some fresh air circulating. The TV was a joke...I think it was about a 14\" model from the mid 1980's. The bed was very comfortable! No complaints there. Breakfast was actually pretty good, fresh and pretty tasty. The bell staff got me a cab which turned out to b just be some guy with a towncar and dollars in his eyes. I took the cab to the convention center which is only a few miles for which I was charged $20. I finally got him down to $10 but only after threatening to call the transit authority.

I chose it specifically because I've always liked the Embassy Suites hotels; I like the hot breakfast and the full suites. I arrived after a grueling 8-hour flight and an over 2-hour wait for a shuttle to the hotel (there were 14,000 people in the area for the conference), and made it just barely in time to catch the last five minutes of the manager's reception. I took my glass of wine with me up to the room before I even dropped off my bags. ;-) I caught that manager's reception every night, and the bartender was great; by the second night, she was pouring my wine as soon as she saw me, and was unfailingly friendly and efficient. I was a little taken aback by the room; it was very dim and smelled extremely musty (I later found out this is pretty common for Orlando; everything is humid and rather mildewy owing to the climate). I was also disappointed to get a third-floor room DIRECTLY over the HVAC units when I'd specifically requested a high floor. The rooms have no windows, just a tiny little balcony (it's actually too narrow to stand on), and my balcony overlooked the aforementioned giant (LOUD) HVAC units and the freeway. Not exactly scenic. The rooms are peculiar; to admit some light to the living room, they have floor-to-ceiling windows on either side of the front door which look out onto the hallway. Given that people are going up and down the hall right outside those windows, it's not as if you can leave the curtains open. The layout otherwise is nice; the bedroom especially was quite spacious. Lighting over the desk/table was somewhat inadequate, and the hotel charged $10/day to use their wi-fi, which seems excessive to me. Power outlets were adequate. The bedding was quite comfortable and there were ample lamps and lights in the bedroom. I can't comment on the TVs, as I never turned them on, nor the pools, as I never used them. The elevators were slower than molasses. I really appreciated the mini-fridge and microwave, since I was there for a week. It would have been nice to have a real coffeemaker, not a miniature one. I very much disliked the air conditioning; the filters obviously badly needing changing, as the a/c was causing me horrible allergy issues. I tried turning it off and opening the balcony slider, but between the heat and humidity, the bugs (there's no screen on the slider, which I find extremely peculiar), and the exhaust fumes from the HVAC and the freeway, that wasn't practical as an option. As other reviewers have mentioned, there's a constant white noise from the A/C. Probably not a bad thing, since the plumbing is quite loud; you hear every nearby shower and toilet flush. Weirdly, the wastebaskets in the suite were never emptied during my week-long stay, even though housekeeping had clearly been in to make the bed and replace linens. Since I quite often have dinner in my room (and thus have food waste to dispose of), that was a distressing oversight. I also came back to my room twice after housekeeping had been in and found the door wasn't all the way closed, which was unnerving. Anyone could have simply pushed it open. Hotel staff were very helpful, when I did have occasion to deal with them. I needed to print a boarding pass on the last day of my stay, but the printers in the business center were both malfunctioning. The desk clerk was kind enough to print it for me. The valets out front were especially helpful and friendly. The lines for the hot breakfast were horrifically long each morning, so I ended up giving up on it. I never did have a made-to-order breakfast during my stay. The coffee at breakfast was AWFUL. I know I'm a coffee snob, but that stuff was paint remover. The location is quite convenient - far enough off I-Drive to not get too much noise, but right there for all the restaurants, shops, etc. Don't count on using the I-Drive Trolley to get around, though - I had three of them pass me up one night before I gave up on that as a form of transportation. Overall, this wasn't an unpleasant stay, but I think the Jamaican Court Embassy Suites is a slightly nicer hotel, and there are options much closer to the convention center (it's within walking distance, presuming you don't pass out from the heat and humidity) if you want to avoid having to rent a car.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat room, nasty staff\u201d", "Author": "Beatrice01", "ReviewID": "UR19832822", "Content": "The female staff at the desk were very condescending, but the men were much nicer.

We wanted to go to the theme parks and also to relax by the pool on a couple of days and this hotel was just perfect for what we wanted. Firstly, the hotel staff were so accomodating. The concierge were really friendly and helpful, as were the reception staff. The reception staff took some postcards from me that I needed to mail and they didnt charge, its nice to get something for nothing now and again!! The staff in the breakfast were very friendly aswell. Every morning we had the same experience, staff coming over asking us was the breakfast ok and did we need anything else. Breakfast was lovely. Omelettes and Pancakes cant be beaten and they have a good range of juices/cereals/fruit too. The outdoor pool is small, but there are plenty of sun loungers there and it is very quiet during the day as most of the people are out at the parks. The indoor pool is lovely and relaxing aswell. My husband used the gym and, while it was small, he said the equipment that was there was good. Also, we used the business centre which has complimentary internet access. This was good for checking flights and banks etc. In relation to the theme parks - perfect location! There is a free bus that goes from directly outside the hotel entrance. It only comes and goes at certain times though (you can get a timetable from reception). But if you find that you are finished in the parks before/after the bus leaves, the local bus service goes past the hotel aswell. The hotel is closer to Universal Studios (about 10mins) than it is to disney (about 20mins), but its not too far whatever way you look at it!! The location of the hotel is very close to lots of restaurants. There is a really nice steakhouse (Charleys) just about 10 minute walk up International Drive and if you want to wander a bit further, there is a fantastic Seafood restaurant. About 5 minute walk down the other end of Int Drive, there is a really nice Chinese restaurant (ming court) and I would higly recommend all of these restaurants. There is also a good bar across from the hotel and a supermarket just down the street too. Our accomodation was good. Seperate bedroom and living area.

The only issue we had with the room is that it smelt a little musty when you first walked in but you soon got used to it. The room was a good size, a huge king sized bed and a comfortable sleeper sofa in the lounge that my son slept in. There was a fridge which was handy to store drinks and a microwave but we found it strange that they didn't have any plates or cutlery in the room. Whilst we didn't do any cooking it would be a struggle to eat anything in the room without any cutlery. Apart from that we couldn't fault it. Also, the windows kept the noise of the I4 out of the room so we weren't waken up by the traffic noise. We didn't really use the hotel pools as we tended to be out from dawn till dusk. My husband and son went for an early morning swim in the indoor pool one day and enjoyed it.

I hope some staff read this report they certainly deserve recognition. thanks Chris sunley", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mt.

We were on holiday with our two year old daughter and needed somewhere with a bit more space, so the suite we stayed in was ideal. The rooms were well furnished and well equipped, and were kept spotlessly clean all the time we were there. There was a spacious lounge and dining area with mini kitchenette, a nice bathroom and large bedroom with comfortable king size bed. There was plenty of space for clothes etc in the bedroom, with large wardrobes and drawers provided. The service we received from all staff we encountered could not be faulted, everyone was very friendly and eager to please. The complimentary breakfast, although not the best meal we've ever eaten, was more than adequate, with a reasonable selection. We didn't eat at the hotel every morning but when we did we all enjoyed what we had. The location of the hotel was also fantastic. It was at what we thought was the nicer end of International Drive, down towards Sea World. If you turned right out of the hotel you were less than five minutes walk to Pointe Orlando, and if you turned left out of the hotel you were five minutes away fom the Mercardo Centre, both contained some lovely restaurants, bars and shops. We were travelling as part of a large group and were the only ones staying at the Embassy Suites, and when our families came to look at our room and the rest of the hotel, everyone said that they would stay at this hotel next time they came to Orlando. All in all, a very nice stay. Well located for all the attractions and theme parks, easy walking distance to a lot of nice restaurants and bars, and very comfortable and spacious accommodation.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, NC", "Title": "\u201cNot Embassy Suites Standard\u201d", "Author": "drsmarty", "ReviewID": "UR8262665", "Content": "This hotel is old and in need of renovation.

Suites were big , nice comfy bed plus a large fridge to allow you to bring and store own drinks/food if required but as others have said between 5.30 and 7.30 every evening it's Managers hospitality time and drinks are free with no restrictions on what you can have - plus crisps and dips. The barman in the Hurricane Bar was excellent, really helpful with directions/tips on where to go etc and breakfast whilst limited choice was very good (and included in cost) Being a 'weight watcher' they make omelettes to order and I had no probs having healthy option of egg white omelette with spinach and mushrooms (trust me it's tasty) . Would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone and would def go back when next in Orlando - it's not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and there's an awful lot of flea pits on I Drive .

The coach left us to the embassy suites at \"Jamaican Court\", rather than the \"convention address\". The guy on the desk was totally un helpful . I was really glad when we were able to identify the mistake and quickly escape being treated very badly (I could not begin to imagine what 2 weeks of his abrupt unsurley treatment would have been like). Fortunately a very short taxi ride sorted the problem. On entering The 'Convention suites' it was blatantly apparrent they were offering far superior treatment to guests. The staff were all, without exception extremely pleasant and helpful. The maid created a different towel oragimi each day, swans, elephants, bears etc. The kids looked forward to opening the suite each day we returned from the theme parks to see her latest creation. Free drinks evey evening for two hours, with popcorn and chrisps for the kids. This proved very handy as you could get a pager from the local restaurants, enjoy free cocktails and then quickly skip the queue when paged. Local restaurants include the Bahama breeze- try their Bahama Rita cocktail, the olive garden and TGIFs. The Trolley stop is right outside the hotel so you can sail up and down International Drive at Your Leisure(the hotel sells tickets). There is also a free coach to Disney and the courtesy coach to Bushe Gardens is close by. The out door swimming pool is heated and can be enjoyed even in the rain. The indoor pool is cold, but great on a hot day. Breakfast time is very busy and sometimes you have to wait a long time on a lift.

We travelled with another family , both families consisting of 2 Adults & 2 children , neither family could fault this hotel in any shape or form. The high points were the breakfast that catered for everyone's taste and the the managers drink reception was enjoyable, during our stay which included the Wireless convention, Spring break & Easter holidays ( very busy to say the least) we never had to wait long for breakfast or a free drink. Some people on previous reviews complained they had to wait up to 30 minutes for a free drink, but if they were that desperate for a drink they could have nipped to the Hurricane bar in the hotel and bought one, simple as. With regards to the up keep of the hotel , again i have no complaints, the maid we had on level 5 was polite, very friendly and carried out her duties to a very high standard, this included some great towel designs. All staff could not be faulted on any fronts, from the ladies on reception, bar staff and porters all were polite and curtious beyond the call of duty. It seemed genuine and not an act , unlike some other hotels that i have stayed at. Indoor pool was great for early morning wake up swim and out door pool small but the kids loved it. Location is great for I Drive and all its eating and entertainment. Bus times for parks where a little odd either to late or to early , but free is always a good price and you accept what you cannot change.
