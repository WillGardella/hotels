I found the style full of character and individual, a far cry from the bland uniformity often found in the chain hotels. The room size was on the small side, but then that was to be expected in the middle of a buzzing city where space would be premium. despite the small size, the room had everything for a comfortable stay and modern fittings. We had been given a room that fell to the back, which is a bonus as you don't get the sounds from the busy road there. The hotel entrance faces the Luxembourg Gardenswhich are beautiful and has a brasserie next to it where the hotel patrons can have breakfast. Although our package included breakfast, we preffered to experience the different cafes and bistros and so can't comment on the breakfast, however, we did stop there for lunch and enjoyed the meal and service offered. Being located in the heart of the Latin Quarter, there is no shortage of eateries. While I touch on location, the hotel is a 15-20min walk from the Notre Dame, along the way there are lots of brasseries and cafes.

For the person who left without unpacking their suitcase I cant remotely see why. Firstly this was our 1st trip to Paris and travelled with Eurostar, which in its self fantasic so worried about finding the hotel. Arrived Gard De Nord and took Metro to Luxembourg. As hotel was 107 St Michel when coming off Metro you have the choice of 69 or 99. Go to 99 and as soon as you come up the steps the the Hotel is straight in front of you. Check in was quick and friendly and concierge extremely helpful in what to do, see eat etc. Room was small, not extremely, but clean with good views of the area. The rooms were cleaned daily and no qualms wwhatsoever with the room. Also good stock of toiletries in the Bathroom although the shower was small. The area is quiet and safe and yards from Luxembourg Gdns, and 15 minute walk possibly quicker for younger persons to Notre Damme abd 5 mintes walk from the university of Sorbonne. If walkinf recommend turn right down St Michel as nothing much to the left. One regret is that we didnt take the breakfast in the hotel as we thought it might be cheaper looking elsewhere but the hotels seem as cheap as anywhere else. 2 small negatives but these were far outweighed by the positives. 1 is that there must be a line directly beneath the hotel and at certain times can hear the underground, and secondly you are not trusted with the key and must hand it in everytime you leave the building but the concierge on every occasion was extremely courteous. On the final day they kept our case for 5 hours after check out which was another plus. All in all would certainly go back and the location and accessibility to all of Paris hot spots makes it a desirable place to stay.

Note: Hotel rates drop in Paris November 1 and seem to drop again after November 15. The weather, while overcast (when is Paris not overcast?), was cool, but reasonable. And no crowds anywhere except the Louvre. So if you can choose your travel time and are on a tight budget, consider coming in November. One drawback of a November visit. though, is the sun sets about 5:00 p.m. When, jet lagged, we first saw our room, my heart sunk. It had the pleasant view I'd requested (of a garden with bright yellow chrysanthemums), but it was so small! Nonetheless, we were able to make the room work for us and appreciated the fact that, even on in a hotel on the busy Boulevard Saint-Michel, we didn't hear the noise of the traffic. In fact, when we returned ten days later and were put in a larger room, I missed our little room with the pleasant view. The hotel had free internet (if you bring your own computer) and a little refrigerator which we used to store cheese and bread. We ate at the hotel one morning, but, over the course of our stay, preferred to have bread and cheese in our room and save our money for nice lunches. The little cafe adjacent to the hotel was a pleasant spot for dinner when we were too tired to go out for a big event dinner. BTW--if you're looking for a restaurant guide, definitely look at Pudlo as an alternative to Michelin. If you haven't heard of Pudlo, just type Pudlo Paris into the Amazon.com search engine. He also has books reviewing various regions of France. The people at the front desk were courteous. I especially appreciated that, even though we arrived about 11:00 a.m., our room was ready and we were allowed immediate access to it (which might not be the case during a more busy season). Luxembourg Gardens is only a half block away. A not terribly appealing Franprix is half a block away, but is adequate for replenishing breakfast supplies. A Monoprix, between a quarter mile and half mile away, is a preferable spot for groceries. The major drawback of the hotel is its location on the RER line. That location is excellent if you're arriving from the airport with little luggage, but if you're going to the standard tourist sights (e.g. the Louvre), you walk a considerable distance changing subway lines. At some point we realized we were better off walking half a mile to a different line (perhaps the green) which then gave us direct access to sights we wanted to see. On the plus side, the location isn't as crowded as parts of Boulevard Saint-Michel that are closer to the Seine. My best guesstimate is the hotel is a ten minute walk to the Pantheon and a twenty minute walk to Rue Muffetard. The hotel was clean, including the bathrooms. I have sometimes have trouble walking so the subway issue was relatively important to me and might be a reason I'd choose another hotel for a return trip to Paris. But if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a location near Luxembourg Gardens, and plan to spend most of your time in the 5th, this hotel might be just right for you.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney - Australia", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Choice - couldn't have been any better...\u201d", "Author": "Harry-Syd", "ReviewID": "UR50860391", "Content": "First, some repeats: the hotel is a conveniently located straight shot from the RER station and on the wonderful Blvd. St. Michel, a short walk form the Jardins Luxembourg and the Seine, Pont Neuf, Notre Dame and the Sorbonne.

The hotel staff were all excellent and very helpful, especially Mustafa. He truly made us feel as if we were family members staying in his home. 2. The hotel chamber service was excellent. Our room and the hotel was extremely clean. 3. The rooms were very comfortable, but remember if coming from the U.S. not very large as are most Parisian Hotels. The rooms were not in any way cramped and the beds were very comfortable. 4. Location is excellent. The hotel was not in the hustle and bustle of the tourist scene areas, but only minutes walking distance to the mayhem from the hotel, which allowed for the room to be very quiet. Right accross the street is Luxembourg Gardens (A great place to lay on the grass looking at the gardens and palace and open a bottle of wine with cheese and french bread at the end of a long day!) 5. The Luxembourg Metro station is across the street and the Latin Quarter and Montparnasse are less than 10 minutes walking distance away. Negatives: (These are the reasons I did not give the hotel five out five.) 1. The bathrooms were kept spotlessly clean by the staff and quite comfortable, but they are dated and need to be spruced up a bit. 2. The furniture in the lounge area was quite worn and in need of replacing. The furniture took away from a space that could be a very comfortable meeting area for friends or for waiting for your wife to put on her make-up. Tips: Make sure to request a room facing the gardens behind the hotel. It backs on to a very quiet lane and the view of the garden is wonderful.

The hotel is very well maintained, and we waited in the very nice sitting area where Mustafa tried his best to accomodate us 3 hours before the actual check in time. That is where we first noticed the cleaning. The hotel in SPOTLESS and they insist on cleaning everything again to be sure. My friend and I just for fun tried to find spots to run our fingers against to see if there was dirt...Nothing. We dropped off our bags and had breakfast next door. The hotel is also located minutes away from the Sorbonne and on the Blvd St. Michel which was very convenient. We were two adult males and our room was large enough for both of us, two checked bags and two carry ons.. not as tiny as I was imagining considering the reviews. (the lift however seems to have two person max or 1 adult and two big bags.) The room had a lovely view of a beautiful small garden and a quiet street. The bathroom was well appointed and also clean. I am 5'11 and my feet were not dangling anywhere off the beds. The beds were also comfortable enough for us to recover after our nights of partying. Everything in the room worked, t.v. safe. mini-fridge, lighting, phone, strong internet signal from the 4th floor, etc. Lovely windows and very charming decor. The night manager (forget his name) was incredibly personable, extremely nice and very helpful. Everyone spoke English. As much as I spoke French, after a night of partying, the last thing I wanted to do was conjugate verbs,, etc. So I was happy when they realized this and spoke English.

We were told that the double bed was actually two singles and they would remake the bed in the morning as twins. We were then abruptly ordered back to the room to check this was the case. The bed was clearly a double - in any case the room was so tiny that it would have been impossible to accommodate two single beds. Back down to reception, this time with the booking confirmation - pointed out the request for two beds - whilst the French was not perfect it was clear that was what was required. Manager then acknowledged this, apologised and we were given a much better room with two beds. At this point we assumed that the matter had been resolved. The next evening we called at reception to pick up our key and the desk clerk informed us that he had taken the original booking and then proceeded to lecture us on how it was really our fault as we had made an incorrect booking and had asked for a double - this less than 24 hours after the management had apologised for their error. If a double is standard, then it seems pointless to request one specifically. What part of '2 beds please', did he not understand?? As the desk clerk appeared to want to make an issue of this and continued to harangue us, we took the key told him that we considered the issue resolved and walked off, fuming. In any case, if it was not clear what we were requesting, then an email to me would have clarified what we wanted. If the hotel then did not want to take a twin booking, then we could have cancelled and looked elsewhere. This hotel clearly has a problem with its bookings and the website lacks clarity. On the first night the duty manager told us 'this happens all the time' and two incorrect bookings on one evening would suggest this is the case. The hotel does not appear to recognise that two people travelling together are not necessarily sleeping together. With the exception of the woman who finally sorted out our room (and who appeared to be staying after hours to do this) the staff were rude and unhelpful. Nothing was their fault, the 'take it or leave it' attitude was disappointing. Although the room eventually provided was beautiful, well maintained and clean, the hotel is in a convenient location, and with a good brasserie attached, our overall response was negatively influenced by the unhelpful attitudes of the staff on the first night and by the appalling behaviour of the desk clerk on the second night. I have rated the staff at 2, without the intervention of the helpful duty manager on the first night I doubt if I could have rated the staff at all.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "LardB0y", "ReviewID": "UR21927115", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for three nights while attending a conference.

The reason why I picked this hotel, b/c when I did my study abroad in the summer of 2002, I stayed @ a student hostel which was down the block from the hotel. The area is great and there are a lot of places to go eat. If you drink a lot of water like I do, when you walk out of the hotel to the left about 5 to 6 store fronts over is a small supermarket. The water is Paris isn't expensive. As for the room, it was a good size room. As the other reviews say, rooms in Paris aren't big as the standard rooms in the US. The hotel doesn't have full size beds, they have twin size beds in the room for two. I am not a twin size person since I am 6'3 but I was able to deal. I stayed in room 104 and it had a great bathroom. The cleaning Lady came in everyday and did a great job. One day she even left us a little treat. Fresh towels everyday and she did a good. As for noise from the street, it would bug a person who doesn't live in a Major City in the US. I was able to take the RER B line to Luxembourg Train stop and the station is across the street from the hotel. Tip!!! If you are taking the train to the hotel from CD airport, get on the first car of the train b/c it will leave you at the exit you need that leaves you across the street from the hotel. If you are looking to go to dinner, the best thing you can do is go to Latin Quarters and you have find a deal for dinner. One place I would recommand is a small place called \"El Bistro Latino\" which is typical food from Spain. The address is 5,rue de la Harpe. You can find Rue de la Harpre when you are walking down on Blvd Saint Michel and the coner of Saint Germain. It's not expensive and you will have a great time with friends or family. The only english channel you can get on the hotel TV is CNN which was good for me. I did enjoy seeing the Music channels like MTV and MCM which play English and French music. When we left the hotel, we checked out @ 6am since our flight was leaving @ 9am. We didn't want to take the train so we booked a \"Yellow Van\" with the front desk the day before we left. It's a cheap way to get to the airport and we had to leave half of the cost of the trip with the front desk. It was much cheaper then taking a cab. For a group of 4, we paid 17 Euro per person verus the 50 Euro you'll pay with a cab. My final advice is, if you are looking for a clean hotel and a good place to sleep, this hotel is good. Don't spend so much money on expensive hotels and save the money to go shopping in Paris. One last advice, the day b4 you go on your vacation, check the exchange rate and remember you will always get the best exchange rate from ATM. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. When I return to Paris, I will be returning to this hotel.

The receptionist was polite and helpful, but not extraordinarily friendly like the Greeks we had stayed with in Santorini's Stelios Place. The website provides poor directions - from the airport, one shouldn't get off at the Notre-Dame, but the next one, I think it goes by the name of Luxumbourg Gardens. Also, the website should clarify that even though the large Gardens are 'across the hotel', the actual entrance is a block or two away. This will clear the expectations of tourists such as the ones who reviewed this hotel above. The problem with this hotel is that it is indeed far (25 minute walk) from the Latin Quarter. It is a quiet residential neighborhood, and therefore most cafes stop serving food after 10 pm, which is quite a shame in summer for tourists who spend their entire day sight-seeing like we did.

My girlfriend and i often started the morning wandering through there to get panzerottis and gelato on Rue Vavin.

It\u2019s years since I have been to Paris so I can only compare it with recent accommodation at a deluxe room at the 5* Le Palais in Prague (twice the price though) where I stayed in May for a week. This is a 3* hotel and that\u2019s exactly what it is. No more, no less. If you want a 5* hotel you need to be prepared to pay the price stay in one. In fact the wardrobe hanging space rail at the Observatoire Luxembourg hotel in each room was twice the rail length of that at Le Palais, although as always taking clothes on your own hangers is best. The linen/beds were clean and firm and there was a small bath. We were given a standard room 101 on arrival and that room is small (but no smaller than many \u00a3100+ a night London rooms) with a large bathroom (including bath/shower) overlooking the street. The room arrangement of that room looks exactly like it did on the website picture where I booked withroom to walk around the bed, but it\u2019s not suite like, just a basic clean adequately furnished room. Room 101 was darker than I hoped it would be \u2013 it had deep terracotta walls and seemed darker that rainy day than later that week on sunnier days. But both my husband and I thought it perfectly adequate for a few days stay and quite clean and fresh smelling. If we could not have changed rooms we would have been ok with that room. I immediately went to ask for a different off street room and Sabine was exceptionally charming saying they were fully booked, but if I was quick before other guests arrived I could see superior room 103 and 503. The view from 503 of some gardens was really delightful, but I chose 103 on the lower floor as there are no outside fire stairs. The bathrooms were smaller in these latter rooms, but did have both a bath and shower, plus Roget et Gallet toiletries. The room had 1 carver chair and one plain chair and a stool, a 3 drawer chest, a dressing table plus suitcase rack. There was a mirror on the wall and one inside the wardrobe door. There was a fixed bendy tube hairdrier in the bathroom, but I hate those so took my own plus an adaptor. The room turned out to be quiet enough once past 10.00pm. All these 3 rooms were non smoking, all very fresh smelling and not one had evidence of being used by smokers. To get to the fabulous Luxembourg Gardens just cross to the road opposite the hotel entrance then you walk a mere 50 yards down the side street where there is a side entrance to the Gardens. The gardens are not blocks away. They are accessible from the hotel within 100 yards. The buses (no 38) right outside take you up to St Germain or Notre Dame. These two areas are really no distance from the hotel area, but they are not of course just across the street. This is actually a plus as it can be like a madhouse of tourists up there one imagine until all hours. You can see the hordes (including moi) walking over to the St Germain eating area from the Louvre/ Notre Dame at the end of the day. If you are like us you will enjoy ambling along thinking I\u2019m in Paris looking at the bookstalls etc. You can pay the bus driver 1.40 Euro or buy a carnet of 10 tickets for 10.70 Euro at the metro etc. We found the hotel very convenient and easy to get our bearings with it being on a main street. There is little supermarket for extra drinks just 30 metres away and use the room mini bar to store them. We had 3 full days and rode around on the bus a bit to glimpse certain areas, but we specifically visited the Notre Dame, St Chapelle, Sacre Coeur (wonderful) in Montmartre, Musee D\u2019Orsay (marvellous ballroom) and the Louvre (magnificent interior and gold rooms/ceilings apart from the art and the crown jewels) as well as taking in the ambience of the left and right bank just strolling. We also ate out around the area, but especially memorable was a high quality special meal at the lovely restaurant Le Christine in St Germain. The American breakfast at the Hotel was included in our rate. It was nothing special and just filled a hole really. If you want great pastries get them elsewhere, but the fruit salad/creamy yoghurt and coffee were all excellent quality. I would skip it if is not included in your rate. I\u2019ve stayed in great hotels and lesser ones and this is a clean hotel with a bit of wear and tear, but nothing really awful. However if you are used to super slick American standard hotels with massive bathtubs this may not be for you so you need to go 5*. We were more than happy with the Observatoire and enjoyed our break in Paris far more than our May stay in Prague. Paris feels comfortable to walk around. It feels relaxed and happy. There was none of that undercurrent still evident we felt on our Prague trip. Paris is a beautiful city and we are already thinking of going again there is so much more to see and do. You could easily fill a week and still not do everything. We might stay a different part of Paris for another vist, but would be happy to stay at this hotel again. We used a Taxi Parisien (60 Euro with the tip) to get from the airport to the hotel and that was worth it as after the journey you are straight into the taxi rank. We used the RER on our return journey. It took us about 15 minutes to walk the walk to get to our airport carrier from the RER station itself. The RER journey took about 40 minutes so allow an hour for the journey to CDG from this hotel.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed staying there\u201d", "Author": "Kovnacka", "ReviewID": "UR5376942", "Content": "We stayed in room 206, which overlooked the street.

The bathroom was surprisingly big, almost as big as the room--so it felt like we had two rooms! The bathroom was recently remodeled and clean. Having AC in the room was great during the few hot days in Paris. American breakfast buffet was included in our trip package: assortment of croissants, bread, sausage, scrambled eggs and potatoes. Also cheeses, cereals, coffee and juices. The food was fine, however, if I had to pay 15 Euros for it (this is what it cost to buy it), I would most likely rather check out crepes stands down the street. The location is indeed a bit away from the big action spots, but we actually liked that because it kept street noises at night to a minimum. We walked to Notre Dame a few times and explored St Germain and Latin Quarter neighborhoods, but the easiest and cheapest way to get to all other locations is taking metro that is right by the hotel; it was very convenient--just hop on and go anywhere in Paris.

The Metro system is great, and you can get to any major destination in the city right from the station across the street. Make sure you take a few hours to visit Luxembourg gardens, espeicially on the weekend. It is beautiful, and a great place to see Parisians relaxing. Hotel - We had room 504 which overlooked the garden behind the hotel. The room is extremely clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Yes, the room is small, but why would you need a big hotel room in Paris when you are never there? We really liked the quaintness and style of the hotel. We also enjoyed taking a late afternoon nap with the window open so we could hear the sounds of the city and the fountain in the garden. Staff - Each member of the front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant. They were very helpful with dinner recommendations & reservations, answering questions, helping us with our French and giving us directions. They made our staff one to remember for a long time. Food - We had room service for breakfast once, and it was quick and good. We did not eat downstairs or in the attached restaurant, so we can't comment on that. For a quick, inexpensive breakfast, walk past the RER station and visit the crepe stand (see photos). It was fun to watch them make them, and you can't beat a Nutella or egg and fromage crepe for the price. Other stuff - Our best advice would be to bring a good pair of walking shoes. We estimate that we probably walked at least 10 miles a day, sometimes more. Get into the neighborhoods away from the touristy spots. We had a great time exploring the Marais, St. Germaine and Montmartre by just walking the streets and visiting the shops and cafes. Learn a little bit of French before you go.

The room had lovely padded fabric wall covering, a desk and chair, a small dresser, 2 side chairs, and a safe. I was delighted that there was a small (stocked) refrigerator in the room as I had medicine that has to be kept cold. The bed was maybe even a tad more comfortable than my comfy bed at home. The ensuite bath included a tub with a shower and little bottles of bath gel and shampoo, like American hotels. The sink was spacious for washing out stockings, etc. In the tub was a clothesline you could pull and hook to the far wall for drying the stockings. Quite handy. When we first arrived, we were disappointed that the Luxembourg Garden was so small. It was a day or so later that we laughed when we realized the little walled garden our room overlooked was just the backyard grounds of a nearby building. The Luxembourg Garden was a block away, on the other side of the hotel, and was more like what I had imagined (except for it being March and the trees bare). The Metro is not even a half block away from the hotel. The neighborhood has a couple of grocery markets and a number of other shops and eateries, and it felt quite safe to walk the street in the evening. The front desk staff was fairly fluent in English and quite helpful, especially Sabrina. I am grateful that we took her advice to take the airport shuttle 3 hours before our flight.

Very much so worth the money. There's also this great little store across the street for late night munchies. Has a fruit stand on the outside & all kinds of great goodies inside.

As is generally true, smallish rooms but clean and nice. The front desk staff was very helpful and kind. All spoke English well to very well should your French have a few holes. I am a seasoned traveller and would not hestitate to go here again...with one caveat. One side of the hotel faces Blvd. Saint Michel, a very busy street at ALL hours. The other is off a side street facing out into a large, enclosed park. Upon arrival the heating system was going full speed so I shut it down, but the room was still hot. An open window cooled the room but brought in all the street noise from Blvd. Saint Michel. When the window was closed, the noise level decreased considerably but the heat went up. Should you go during warmer weather, this may be a non-issue as windows will be closed with air conditioning. If you go during colder times, request a room on the park side. As is mentioned in other reviews, very close to the RER and metro. About a 10-15 walk to Notre Dame.

The rooms are small, but what does it matter when the whole city of Paris is at your doorstep. The beds were comfortable and clean. As every reviewer states the location is great! You are just a few blocks away from the Pantheon, Sorbonne, heart of Saint Germain du Pres, the Cluny, & the river, but far enough for the nights to be quiet. The street noise was minimal over night considering its a busy blvd by day. The double pane glass windows help! The english speaking staff (day & night) were extremely hospitable and friendly. They made reservations for dinner for us, (we don't speak French with the exception of pleasantries), chatted about local brasseries, showed us menus and discussed other things to do. They were even interested in the restaurants we dined at & our opinion. Paris has thousands of hotels, we felt like we picked the right one for our budget and expectations. The hotel is what you make of it. All we needed was a good shower & minibar in the room! We got it! Did I mention you could see the Sacre Coeur from our cozy little room? We'll be back!

The RER covers much of Paris, and connects without extra charge with the metro system (a word of advice, on the RER you need to keep your ticket because you cannot exit the system without a ticket). The hotel itself was clean, although we did have a problem getting the air conditioning to work. The rooms were small, but that is supposed to be typical of the smaller hotels in Paris. There always was someone at the front desk, so we felt the hotel was safe. The front desk staff spoke English well, although the daytime desk staff were not overly friendly and seemed to get annoyed if you asked too many questions (the exception to this was the evening/night staff at the front desk, who seemed to welcome questions and enjoyed giving directions and helpful suggestions).

Being in the heart of the city the hotel is in the perfect location for exploring the city with all the major sights within easy walking distance. Suprisingly, condidering its location the area is very quiet at night. The restaurant 'Le Luco' ajoining the hotel is more than adequate if you don't want to venture out too far, you might find the menu limited but what is available is quality and with a fixed price menu of around 16 euros for a 3 course meal its excellent value too. A good choice for breakfast too, just 8 euros for coffee, orange juice, baguette, croissant, pain au chocolat, jam (all of it!).

The shower also leaked from the half glass door so it was scary climbing out and not slipping on the water with a sharp glass door in your way.

The hotel charged us 145 Euro for the first night and 106 Euro for the last night without specifying the charge up front. We assume that the extra charge was to cover the cost of the reservation service. The total cost was as specified, but it was a shock.
