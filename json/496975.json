I travelled down from Scotland so my son could see arsenal play. Staff are very nice and I must mention the receptionist who was so helpful. Found my son an I phone charger which made a huge difference to our trip as his French girlfriend was chatting on facebook when battery died! Rooms are really clean and tidy and seem to be very new. Breakfast was lovely and staff very polite and helpful. I also spoke with a wee Italian chap who offered to get me a coffee. Nice conversation and it was clear he was the owner. Very friendly which epitomises the hotel. Don't worry about staying here. It's a fine hotel, well run and will be just what you need.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cWell, well, there are room for improvements...\u201d", "Author": "perjak", "ReviewID": "UR115348263", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights at the Queens for the \u00bbLondon Feis 2011\u00ab. As of Summer 2001 a total refurbishment is taking place, so many things were a bit messy. Our room was quite big (and hot - for some unknown reason...?), with no decorations at all and with lightbulbs with an extreme cold color-temperature (like in factory halls). Breakfast is served downstairs. Waitresses were not very aware of missing cutlery, cups and the compulsary 'more coffee?' The way of payment of first night-deposit from abroad is too old fashioned, and we couldn't believe it, when the receptionist the second morning asked for payment for the previous night. But to cut it short, we paid for the rest of our stay - in cash, due to their unacceptable credit card fee. (Fair play to Queens: The price had been lowered \u00a310 compared to what we expected - might be due to the mess in the house?). Never the less, the Queens is a better choice than other hotels in the area, which we have tried before. And, I believe, that some of the issues mentioned here, will be improved in the near future. We might be back, if the \u00bbLondon Feis\u00ab continues :-)", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "germany", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "MrFrankly", "ReviewID": "UR50866949", "Content": "Stayed at the Queens Hotel for a business trip.

Exceptionally clean throughout, it also smells very hygienic, with the communal areas very well carpeted, painted and lit. Reception staff clean and polish in communal areas at quiet times.The overall impression is of a calm and dignified place, with helpful ,polite and unobtrusive staff, who represent a vast array of countries.The three reception staff I encountered were Georgian, Hungarian and Maltese,with the kitchen/breakfast staff eastern european. The cooked breakfast was good,and cooked and presented to the same standard every day. On the first day I asked for extra toast, thereafter it was given to me from the start, by the friendly servers. The room was clean and well lit, the water in the sink and in the showers down the corridor always piping hot, and the bedding changed every day, with fresh towels and little soap, as was the drinks making facilities.The furniture was basic and the light lacked a shade, but this was known about anyway, no plug on the sink, but one wasn't necessary for my purposes as I waash and shave, etc., with running water.The room was warm , but a convector heater was supplied in the wardrobe for addtional heat, which was never necessary, and the other guests were quiet and there were never any noise issues. It would be hard to imagine a better locationfor a guest house in this price bracket, opposite the green lung of Finsbury Park, less than a minute from bus stops, shops ,petrol stations and cashpoints, and two minutes from mainline and underground trains, post office, supermarkets, restaurants, etc. Great care is taken by the management to supplement the green theme, with a welcoming array of planters, tubs and hanging baskets, and with pot plants in evidence inside too. Looking forward to staying there again !", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Queens Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d496975-Reviews-Queens_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$127 - $253*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">324 Seven Sisters Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">N4 2AP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "496975", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/da/83daf5fb7506904d2b5bc01f973ec8ce1large.jpg"}}
