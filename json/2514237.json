The showers are lovely ,no water coming on to the floor like some hotel rooms wich is a pain especially when you get dressed and your soaks get wet when you keep goin in the bathroom to spruce youre self up on occassions to get ready for youre night out. The beds were very very comfy lots of spring in them very pleasnat nights sleep.Some beds can be a bit to solid.. The central heating i put on in the room was put on immediately as the hotel bedroom window was open and there was a bit of a chill in the room. The room soon heated up and in the middle of the night had to turn it of as the room was very warm . Good for a winters night most pleasing.

On our way to the car to put my beloning back for our return journey home the Hotel Manager very well spoken ask us if we had enjoyed our stay and if we had had breakfast.

We were on our first holiday away to Thailand and decided to have 2 days in London before we went. We got to the so called hotel in good spirits. We were welcomed by the receptionist all was well until we started to walk the stairs. You could tell by looking at the corridors that we were in for a fun time. We got to our room and opened the door. Our faces dropped. We had what looked like a foldup double bed in a dated kitchen! Our hearts sunk. The matress on the bed was 4inches thick so you could feel every spring, even when you moved in the bed it would creek which would keep you up all night. Sheets were dirty with yellow stains and the brown wool blanket was covered in long clumps of hair. There was no bathroom. Just a small shower cubicle in the corner where the fridge freezer used to be. There was a public toilet at the end of the corridor, which wasnt even fixed to the wall. We sayed 2 nights. On the second night we were kept up most of the night by scratching of vermin in the walls and I swear at one point something was trying to get into the bin at the other end of the room. Horrible :( Breakfast was so basic and consisted of cornflakes, orange juice, tea coffee and toast given to us by a scruffy looking polish girl who could not speak a word of English. Even when she braught the toast over there was no \"good morning\", or a smile. Good customer service (?). Yes the place was 70 per night but you would expect a little better.

First things first - we were overcharged. I was given a roughly \u00a365 mark for a twin room per night, which for new years eve I LEAPT on for myself and my friend, and I booked 2 nights. When I rang back several months later to add another night, somehow I had managed to book 2 twin rooms for one night. Okay, a slight mistake that was resolved. ANyway, so we arrived and signed in, only to find that we had been overcharged (an extra \u00a350 each!), the gentlemen on the desk was new and could do nothing about it, so since we were in a rush we left it to sort for the next morning, Well, to summarise, when I asked about having the extra money refunded (We had paid the previous night) the answer was NO. And best of all, the man behind the desk told us to be GRATEFUL because we weren't charged the new years rates.Me and my friend were each \u00a350 out of what we had budgeted for this month, I guess we should be happy?? Apparently the only way to resolve this was to send a letter to the (never present) manager. We asked if we could cancel the third night and have the money back that way, but again, not a chance. For this, we had a broken radiator (which the cleaner had to turn on with a wrench! So the room was either freezing or sweltering), a tv remote that sometimes worked, and a light and shower that didn't work! The breakfast is so basic, the only cooked thing is toast while sitting on plastic chairs, it almost felt like I was back in school.

It is situated within a few minutes walk of the Oval tube station. The exterior is, shall we say, unpretentious; the interior is a lot smarter. I booked online, and check-in was quick and stress-free. I have to say that all the staff we encountered were charming, helpful and friendly - and very efficient. Our room was not enormous, but did not feel cramped. It was spotlessly clean, and comfortably and intelligently furnished and equipped - crisp white bed linen, wool carpet, good mirrors and fittings, lined curtains, flat-screen TV, safe, tea & coffee making facilities, hairdryer etc. We had a full bathroom, attractively tiled, with a shower over the bath, huge fluffy white towels, dispensers of shower gel and handwash. We were at the front, overlooking Clapham Road, but apart from the occasional emergency vehicle we were not aware of traffic noise. The price included a simple Continental buffet breakfast - croissants, toast, cereals, yoghurt, fruit; plus orange juice, tea, but only instant coffee. The breakfast room is in the basement. Whereas a lot of money has been spent on refitting the hotel, with marble, pale wood, wool carpets etc, the approach to the breakfast room has been neglected and lets the place down - it is frankly dingy. The breakfast room itself is bright and clean but has the air of a works canteen (plastic chairs, no curtains...). As such a lot of money has already been invested, it seems a pity not to complete the job with a few cosmetic improvements in the basement, say pretty curtains, wood tables and chairs, a few pictures. We had read up on the place, and seen that it was originally a 2 star hotel, upgraded to 4 star after the refit. I feel the classification is over-generous (it felt like a standard 3 star hotel to me), and it probably does the hotel no favours as it raises people\u2019s expectations. For 4 star accommodation I think you expect real coffee! I suspect that some of the unfavourable reviews that appear are from people who have looked at the classification not the prices, which are definitely NOT at 4 star level! Our stay was quiet, comfortable and we will definitely stay there again if we need to visit the area.

After a tiring megasearch in the net I ended up to the Belgrave's web pages and was lured by its clean looks and good basic facilities. Considering the price (\u00a355 for a single, 70 for a double) in central London I was both hopeful and terrified about what to expect. True, the first impression from outside is unconvincing but inside it was a different place. The hotel must have been refurbished quite recently. The public areas were clean and tidy. The small reception hall was basic but worked great with current newspapers and LCD-TV (and a cute aquarium on the wall). I paid for my single nights on arrival and for the doubles when checking out so I'm not sure what the actual policy is. The staff was very friendly and spoke good english (contrary to some previous opinions in this thread). I got my single room from top floor street side. Despite it being one of the smallest I've ever had I ABSOLUTELY loved it. It was impeccably clean and modern with everything perfectly at hand (LCD, safe, water heater, hair dryer). With ample light from three windows it was the coziest ever and I really felt home. There were a couple of desk drawers, an open closet and a luggage rack but no other storage space. The bed was comfortable with a good pillow. Electric outlets with multipurpose sockets were located in the bathroom (for shavers 110/230V) and within the digital safe. WLAN was available for \u00a34 / 4h. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the towels were changed daily. Absolutely no complaints about housekeeping here. The water pressure in shower was great - actually there was only one pressure level: high with adjustable temperature. I would have appreciated a separate handheld sanitary shower by the toilet, however. The traffic on Clapham Road is lively, especially during the rush hours but it didn't bother me. When my girlfriend arrived the staff with kind intentions placed us to a big room on the quiet (but a bit junky) backyard side and I requested to get back to the street side which they arranged in a couple of days despite a full house. We stayed in a double room on the first floor which resembled the single I had. The double rooms, being larger, somehow lacked a bit of the cozyness of the single and weren't quite as \"fresh\" - but very clean and tidy. The breakfast (inclusive) was quite basic but gets you started. The small buffet consists of cereals, yogurt, toast, croissants, marmelade, cheese, fruit, juice, tea and coffee. The breakfast room is small but full of natural light. There were also two LCDs for watching morning news (nice feature). The hotel is located on a very spacious streetside in a suburban neighborhood and the locals are a mixture from various ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Every now and then I came back from downtown after midnight and not once did I feel unsafe. The hotel is only 150 m and one minute walk from the Oval Underground station and several night buses stop right in front of the hotel. There are no dark alleys and the area seems quiet in the night. Right across the street there is an internet cafe, a 24 h supermarket, a fried chicked takeaway also open till late and a couple of peaceful pubs. I don't know what life is like further down in Stockwell but the area seemed totally ok (to an academic go-better like myself *grin*). The location was good. Even without a Zone 1-2 Travel Card (which is an extremely worthwhile investment if one wants to effortlessly explore the city) one reaches the Thames at Vauxhall bridge easily in 15 minutes by foot and Westminster / South Bank within half an hour. The tube takes you to from Oval to Waterloo in 6 min, Charing Cross 10 min, London Bridge 10 min, Piccadilly < 15 min, Oxford Street < 15 min, Kensington 20 min, Greewich 30 min. In addition the numerous bus connections leave almost from the doorstep. All in all, I consider Hotel Belgrave an unbeatable value for money in central London area. It is very clean with modern services and friendly staff. Unless someone treats me with a \u00a3150+ per night downtown experience, I will surely be staying in Belgrave again.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington", "Title": "\u201cClean Safe and cheap\u201d", "Author": "MikeNorth", "ReviewID": "UR6910025", "Content": "Having read reviews we were very pleasantly surprised.

The breakfast is continental ie some cornflakes and toast but what more do you expect for the money. The place was spotlessly clean .

There is a lovely italian right across the road and many other restaurants in the local area. The hotel is across the road from the Oval tube station and close to waterloo. Our double bedroom was spacious, however there was no airconditioning which could get hot in summer. A double room cost 65 pounds and was more than excellent value for money on par with Confort Inn/ holiday inn express. The decor is nice and did not hear any noises in the night or anyone at the door. There is a 24 hour reception which wuld make it ard for any intruders to enter the hotel without purpose.

This was the perfect stay and very close to the Oval Underground (Tube) stop which is only a few stops from Waterloo station for the Eurostar. Don't be worried from the exterior of the hotel - it's not got much curb appeal. It's located next to the Belgrave Hospital. The inside of the hotel was very nice. The front desk staff was friendly and helped us get settled in. The room was smallish but immaculate. All new furniture and fixtures. Very clean! It's a contemporary style and quite lovely. Nice hair dryer and television. Breakfast is included in the hotel price. There was a small continental buffet in the basement. The area of the hotel wasn't really ideal (Clapham), but would be convenient for sights in South London. The hospital noises were slightly distracting and I would suggest getting a room in the back away from the busy street.

Getting from here to everywhere you might want to go in touristy London is close by via public transportation. It's in a very nondescript modern building, but inside everything looks freshly decorated. The rooms are small, as are most London hotels, but are impeccably clean. Shower pressure is great which is very important! There's wifi or wired internet available for a fee, and limited parking (also for a fee) in the underground secured parking lot. We paid 70 pounds for a twin bed room, including continental breakfast - hard to beat that rate for a decent hotel in London! The staff is quite friendly and helpful. Some minor drawbacks: it's on a very busy road (Clapham Road) so request a room facing the back if street noises bother you. There's no air conditioning, so it could get hot in the summer. Closet space is very limited. And though that shower pressure is great, the shower stalls themselves are so tiny that it's a bit hard to even turn around. All that wouldn't deter us for staying there again though.
