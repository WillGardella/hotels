The hotel itself is not really a SeaTac property; rather, it's located near a large mall ringed by other hotels that is in the vicinity of the old Longacres race track (Renton). This particular hotel has an atrium configuration (rooms face into a large open area), with a large seating/dining area at the base. Overall, the public areas (reception, atrium, pool & exercise room) of the hotel were modern and well maintained; there is an on-site restaurant, but we never used it. As for the rooms, they are large and include a \"living room\" area (w/couch, chairs, table, bureau), a wet-bar area (w/fridge, sink, microwave, coffee maker), an average bathroom and a separate bedroom w/door (we had two queen beds, large closet, iron & board); flatscreen TVs were located in both the bedroom and living room areas. The room was clean and in a pretty decent shape; there were a few minor things indicating that the room needed minor maintenance (a mirror w/some loose trim, a caster from a rolling bench that was broken, scratches on the bathroom cabinets), but nothing that would prevent me from returning to this property. A few quirks (both positive and negative) to note: 1) Parking is ~$10/night. As this is not really SeaTac (nor downtown) and there is a huge parking lot adjacent to the hotel, this seems a bit tic-tacky for a mandatory \"fee.\" However... 2) The free breakfast is worth ~$10 and is significantly better than the usual \"free Continental\" sort of deal you typically get. They offer what I would describe as a \"Denny's type\" breakfast (eggs, omelets, bacon, sausage, pancakes) in addition to breads, fruits, yogurts, cereals and various drinks...all of it included and as much as you want to bust a gut with. We found ourselves eating large breakfasts and then skipping lunch...so the breakfast outweighed the parking penalty in our case. And finally... 3) Free drinks at 5:30! Actually, this is a \"Manager's Welcome\" sort of deal...whereby you can go to the little bar in the atrium and have a couple of mixed drinks, beer or wine and popcorn or chips & salsa. The first night there, we watched as people just kept going to the bar...I don't think they ever cut anyone off (though the bartender advised us that it was a two-drink limit per guest). Mind you, the social environment remained friendly and not like a frat-house or anything; it was very pleasant. And the booze itself wasn't bad; not top-shelf stuff, but okay...and they offered a passingly decent beer (Sam Adams) on tap. So, what did we learn here? Well...if you get this property at a bidding discount, don't mind the drive downtown for the tourist traps, can justify in your head the parking $$$ tradeoff w/the better-than-average breakfast and free drinks, and don't mind the mall-ambiance of the surrounding area, then this might just be the hotel for you and your family. We feel like we did pretty well on this one... BTW: I reviewed an Indian restaurant in the vicinity that was AWESOME; as Dr. Steve Brule would say, \"Check it out!\"", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cNice place, great location!\u201d", "Author": "Jeslaf", "ReviewID": "UR127286292", "Content": "Been here several times on the way in/out of Seattle.

The shuttle leaves a bit to be desired as I was shuttled back and forth on a normal passenger van opposed to a mini-bus, which created issues with the amount of people it carried. Any way, upon arrival to the hotel it appears to not be a newer hotel and when you're inside it is confirmed by the somewhat dreary, or darker appearance. Upon check-in the front desk staff was excellent and the process was speedy. In fact, while my room was not ready upon my arrival, they sought me out in the restaurant personally to hand me my key when the room was ready to be occupied. The room itself was a corner suite and I found it to be acceptable but nothing extraordinary and certainly very dark. The TVs were newer flat screens but they did not offer HD service and the cable options were limited. The room service I ordered was good food, they just didn't get the order right as I received incorrect beverage and condiments. However, in the restaurant itself, all went well and the food was actually surprisingly good. The staff in the restaurant and bar area, specifically Erika and Susan were excellent. Very friendly, well attentive to the needs of the patrons and were extremely courteous. It actually was refreshing to see them interact with the guests and even laugh with them. Greg was an excellent bellman who assisted upon arrival and the waiter Gabriel was also superb, relative to his friendliness and overall service. The stay was ok, but it was made better by the staff. The hotel just seems older and outdated to me but I believe it to be one of the better options if you need to stay near Sea-Tac. My rate was $170 per night and both nights I was there, they were full.

After staying home in the cold, we decided to get a hotel room and warm up and charge our toys. I called them on the phone and asked for a executive suite. The girl insisted that all of their rooms were suites. When I got there, we were given a standard suite. That's OK, but I did want the step up. The hotel room was nice, and the service was good. When we went to get dinner, I stopped at the front desk and asked for a couple of extra pillows. They were delivered to our room while we were gone. While using the pool, I almost slipped on the pool deck. I wasn't the only one, I saw several other people almost take a fall. They need to do a different surface in the pool area. When it gets wet, it's downright dangerous. I'm surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet. My daughter ended up forgetting her watch in the pool area. The following morning during checkout, I asked at the front desk, and thankfully, someone had turned it in. The clerks were very nice when I asked if the watch was turned in. The free breakfast in the morning was good/bad. Since the hotel was crowded, they setup a second serving area for the hot food (pancakes, french toast, sausage/bacon/eggs). Although it was a nice thought, all the food in the second area ended up being cold. If I would have looked harder before getting breakfast, I would have stood in line longer for the hot food. The rest of the food availability was nice. The internet is an extra charge at this hotel, but since I am a Hilton Gold member, that was free. Parking was also an extra charge, and being a Hilton member doesn't help you on that one. I have no idea why they charge for parking. It is nothing special, and they own the lot.

We were assigned a room on the third floor, king bed, non smoking. Our room was great. There is a living room with couch, desk, and TV that is separated from the bedroom and bathroom. There is a little sink area outside of the bathroom with mini fridge and microwave. The bedroom was a little small. The bed took up most of the space, but it was fine. The bathroom was average in size and came with crabtree & evelyn shampoo/conditioner/soap/body wash. Do keep in mind that there is a train nearby in the area and you will hear it periodically throughout your stay. You will also hear noise in the atrium if you are in the living room area. We couldn't hear the atrium from the bedroom. This seems to be the hotel of choice for high school and college teams. There were a bunch of teenagers gathering in the lobby and atrium area at night talking and having fun. Breakfast during the weekdays is from 6-9am. I don't know why breakfast ends so early on the weekdays. On the weekends, breakfast is served from 7-10am. We had breakfast on one day and it was really good. There was a line for the hot food, where they take your omelet order. You also get to choose from pancakes, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. There is also the usual stuff like muffins, yogurt, and fresh fruit. It's a really decent breakfast with good selection. There seemed to be enough seating for everyone. If you miss breakfast, there is a bunch of fast food restaurants down the road. I think I saw a Jack in the Box and Taco Bell and a 7-11 store. The hotel is also close to Southcenter Shopping mall, a Target, and Costco. The hotel is right off the 405. We found the hotel's location to be very convenient.

We have a small child, so we like to have a suite, and have stayed in Embassy Suites around Seattle, but this was the first time in the SeaTac Embassy Suites. The good: Our room was very spacious, and seemed reasonably clean. There was a small kitchenette in the room with a microwave and a tiny sink that we could use to wash & sterilize bottles. The bad: Extra charges everywhere. Yes, at all Embassy Suites the wifi is extra (which is lame in this day and age, but not unexpected for a hotel in the Hilton chain). But here, the parking is $8/day, despite having to park yourself in a huge lot that's never full. They wanted $15/day extra for each extra person, including the baby. When I asked why, since this isn't the case at any other Embassy Suites I've ever visited, I was informed that it's to cover their \"complimentary\" breakfast. Uh, at most Embassy Suites the complimentary breakfast is covered in the cost of the room, not extra -- and I can find breakfast for a lot less than $15/person in Seattle (and especially in Southcenter). And the baby eats my milk and sleeps in my Pack & Play on my sheet -- so why should I have to pay $15/day extra for her? Other bad things: No hot water in the kitchenette sink. In the end I had to move hot water to that sink using glasses and the bathroom sink (no one wants to wash bottles in a bathroom, or cold water). The TV doesn't get all the local channels -- if you want to watch, say, the Mariners game on that night, you can't, because the hotel doesn't get FSN. Also, be warned: SeaTac (more accurately for this hotel, Southcenter) is a sketchy area. There have been shootings at the mall, etc. You get a VERY mixed crowd at this hotel -- airport travellers who didn't realize this hotel was nowhere near the airport mixed with heavily tattooed construction workers. If the room could have been moved into a normal Embassy Suites, in a better area of town, this would have been a great value. As it is, though, I would only recommend it with reservations. If I have to stay at the airport, I'll stay at a nicer hotel close by the airport, not this place.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria BC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great location 10 minutes from Seattle.

Also the room was non-smoking, but had a strong cigarette smoke smell when I arrived which cleared up after a day. So I think the previous guest was smoking in the bathroom. Finally, when will hotels learn that it's time to stop delivering useless USA Today newspapers, and start giving customers free Wireless Internet instead?

We are a family of four and our teenage daughter brought a friend. The two girls shared a room adjacent to the one we had with our son. We paid an advance, non-refundable charge of $89 per room, which came to a total of $100.31 including taxes for each room. Oddly, however, because we paid in advance, the front desk wasn't able to provide us with an itemized bill on check-out. The only item on the bill for check-out was the parking charge we incurred (more on that below). Since we booked over the phone, this meant that we actually have no record (other than the single line item on my monthly credit card statement) showing what we were charged (i.e., room rate and taxes). The hotel is located on the east side of Interstate-5 (i.e., on the opposite side of the highway from the airport), away from the main \"strip\" of SeaTac's airport hotels. I've stayed on that strip a few times and I don't recall hearing any air traffic noise, so there may be no advantage in that respect from staying further away from the airport. However, there was definitely no noise at the Embassy Suites. They had a shuttle van and, because we didn't fly in, we didn't use it. I did get the impression that if timing and proximity to the airport were critical, we might prefer to stay closer to the airport on the strip. I can only guess that a round-trip circuit from the hotel to the airport terminal and back could take 25-30 minutes in the van. So if you go to catch the shuttle and it has just left, you could be waiting a while (or trying to get a taxi if you're in a hurry). The rooms are typical Embassy Suites suites. The living area is reasonably large, with a pull-out couch and TV. There is a microwave and bar-size refrigerator. There is a TV in the separate bedroom. My pet peeves (which are not big complaints) include: \" They provide HD-capable flat screen LCD TVs, but they don't provide HD programming. As a result, the picture is squished and skewed (i.e., to fill up a 9X16 screen with a 3X4 image). Despite the high-end TVs, this distortion means that the picture is actually worse on the LCD TVs than it would be on a regular CRT TV. \" They charge $10 per day for internet access. I didn't bring a laptop, so it didn't affect me. However, this is just a cash grab because it costs them nearly nothing to run the system. I see this as not much different than charging you for the room and then charging you a separate fee to be able to watch TV. I also don't like being charged to park my car ($8) when the property is not in a densely built-up location. If I'm in a city, I sort of expect to take a hit on parking. When we're as far out in a semi-rural area as this property is, it just comes off feeling like another cash grab. The hotel has a small indoor pool with a small hot tub. We went to use the pool around 8:00 pm on Saturday night, but it was extremely overcrowded with a large group that included many small children and few supervising adults. I have no problem with kids, but there were 18 (yes, I counted) in the hot tub, which had a posted capacity of five people. The pool wasn't much better. We went back later when it was less crowded, but it was still very busy with a number of out-of-control kids (e.g., one took the emergency rescue life ring off the wall, wore it like a hula hoop and jumped into the hot tub a couple times. Another kept asking us, somewhat politely, to move out of the way so he could swim laps in the hot tub). The real culprits were the parents who weren't adequately supervising their kids. However, there appeared to be little or no monitoring done by hotel staff either. Ultimately, if the parents won't do their job, the hotel staff should intervene ... and they shouldn't have to be asked. Embassy Suites is a preferred chain for us because their properties usually (always?) include breakfast in their room rate. Unfortunately, their food service staff did not seem adequately prepared for their guests on Sunday morning. When I arrived, they had run out of drinking glasses, coffee cups, knives and syrup cups. This wasn't a giant deal, but I did need to share a knife with my daughter (who managed to snap up one of the last ones before I arrived). Ultimately, I would stay at the Embassy Suites - SeaTac again, but the experience wasn't so positive that I wouldn't look around for a better property or better deal. There was plenty of room for improvement. If I had to rank them, I would have to put this hotel at the bottom of the three Embassy Suites I've stayed at so far this year. I provide a \"thumbs up\" positive recommendation. However, the few problems we encountered were almost enough to change our rating to a \"thumbs down\" negative recommendation.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monument, CO", "Title": "\u201cDon't even think about staying here!\u201d", "Author": "MGD220", "ReviewID": "UR36422472", "Content": "We booked reservations at this hotel directly through the hotel's website several weeks in advance.

The location was excellent, a few blocks to the fields, shopping, restaurants and a Costco. The accomidations were great, perfect for families. Clean, spacious and well equiped.Despite the open atrium design the bedrooms were quiet. The hotel was fully booked with lacrosse teams and management was on top of keeping all the kids in line and ensuring a comfortable stay for all their guests. What impressed us all was what was included in our room rate. ( Team members recieved a tournament rate of $109 per night). This included a full \"cooked to order\" breakfast - omlettes, scrambled eggs,pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, muffins, cereal, oatmeal etc. and a nightly \"managers reception\" with complementary beverages - alcoholic and non, for TWO HOURS ! Afterwards we were welcome to remain in the atrium and mingle with the other guests and teams which was great, sure beat cramming into each others rooms to visit, as often happens at tournaments. The open concept allowed parents to monitor their children, while still able to socialize themselves. It was great ! We are hoping to return next year and will definately look for more Embassy suites when traveling anywhere else in the future.", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cexceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "NICOLEandJACOB", "ReviewID": "UR8840409", "Content": "i stayed at the embassy suites for a week while i attended a conference there for work. it totally exceeded any expectations i had. the bed was perfect. i meant to look at the brand before i left so that i could get one at home, but i forgot. the room was clean, the shower was comfortable. free happy hour every night includes beer, wine, and a full bar, plus snacks. i would stay here again for business, but it's too far from the center of town to stay on a tourist trip.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Seattle - Tacoma International Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100602-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Seattle_Tacoma_International_Airport-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$117 - $219*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">15920 West Valley Hwy.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98188</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515355", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/25/46/2546b46c90494e3007c7d894c36015265large.jpg"}}
