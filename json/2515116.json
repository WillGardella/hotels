First: know that all of the rooms are on the second floor of the two-story building. You can request rooms with a view or interior rooms opening to the small courtyard. As there are only 17 rooms to choose from, I'd recommend discussing your options when you call to make reservations. My daughter suggested an interior room to avoid street noise and indeed, the room was silent. The door to the hotel stairs is almost unmarked - which gives you the sense that you're staying at a \"secret\" location. There is a large flight of stairs to get up to the common area and registration. The room we had was the size of a standard studio apartment, and decorated in what the hotel termed \"50s retro\" which apparently matches the restaurant below - however we never entered the restaurant so I can't weigh in on that. The room had brown and orange tones - my wife didn't like the color scheme - but was otherwise comfortable. The bed was too soft unfortunately - In the end, it was a great location for us (easy walk to Pike's market, Seattle Center, Belltown attractions/shopping) but is expensive for what you get. As an alternative to a large chain, it works nicely. There are only one or two people working at any given time so there is more of a sense of personal attention and I suppose the expense is in part to fund that \"premium\" service. After doing a lot of exploration in Belltown, this is probably the best hotel in that area.

As one waitress, not our waiter, was passing by she remarked that we could not use these to pay since we ordered from the happy hour menu.

We initially had difficulty finding a room as it is the height of the cruise season.

We were, however, very disappointed as other than the fact that the rooms were nicely furnished, everything else about our stay did not live up to the \"hype\" given on the website. We stayed at El Gaucho for three nights and so probably were able to get a good feel for the service there. The website advertises that there will be a staff person to help carry luggage up to their second floor lobby. The problem with that is that there is no way to let them know that you have arrived so that they can send someone down to help. Most people don't want to leave their luggage unattended downstairs to inform the desk of their arrival as the first floor entry is not secure. The continental breakfast was sparse. One morning they were especially low. Even though we were one of the first to come to breakfast, upon finding that they were out of some items, we asked at the front desk if they could replenish. We were told that they were all out of a particular item. No offer was made to get some more or offer to get something else. No one kept watch on the breakfast area to keep things refilled on a regular basis even though it is right next to the front desk. The only thing done to our room by housekeeping was to make our bed (even though we pretty much made it first). The shower rug, which we hung over the door to dry, was taken down, rolled up and placed on the floor while still wet. Bathroom supplies were not replenished regularly to the point that we had to get some ourselves off of the maid's cart.

The hotel has a great vibe to it; we had a room on the same floor of the lobby (I think it was #14) and it faced out towards the harbor. I think if we were higher up, the view would've been great. The room itself was very large and very well kept. The color and decor (orange, it felt like a set from a noir film) were cool. The bathroom was huge and clean. The bed was great; great linen and very clean. Flatscreen TV and Bose stereo.

The comfortable, chic surroundings contributed to the best vacation of our lives in this beautiful city. Our wonderful experience at El Gaucho is one of the reasons why we are returning to Seattle this August. Yes, we encountered the flight of stairs at the entrance, but if your party has no mobility issues the stairs really shouldn\u2019t dissuade you from selecting El Gaucho. A bellman was ready and waiting at the entrance and assisted us with our few pieces of luggage. Check-in was smooth with a front-desk escort down the short hall to our room. She went over the features of the room and brought us a bucket of ice from which we enjoyed a glass from our bottles of complimentary Evian. We had a harbor view room, which we booked not for the view (which is admittedly minimal due to neighboring buildings), but to avoid what we heard was the noisy street side of the inn. The bed was the most comfortable of our 10-day trip to Seattle/Portland \u2013 I only wish they offered king size beds. The linens and pillows were plush and cozy. The sofa and chair seating area was a great feature and provided a \u201csuite\u201d feel to the room. It\u2019s amazing what a modern flat panel TV does to freshen and open a hotel room \u2013 all properties need to make the investment. The bathroom was just the right size. However, I agree with another reviewer that the white tile/grout floors & walls were probably not a great choice for long-term cleaning and maintenance. The toiletries were luxury brand Philip B and the shower had plentiful hot water and good pressure. I was grateful for the in-room iron and ironing board, which came in handy. We had stayed at the Mayflower Park earlier in our trip. While we felt that the Mayflower\u2019s location was best for us as Seattle rookies to get the lay-of-the-land, we were able to navigate and easily walk to as many locations from El Gaucho as we were at the Mayflower. And our experience at the Mayflower can\u2019t compare to El Gaucho in terms of comfort, modern amenities, and travel for couples. We had made dinner reservations at Waterfront before our trip and learned upon check-out that they are owned by the same group. The front desk attendant mentioned that the inn works to get their guests perks at El Gaucho and Waterfront.

Its location, I would say, is half way between Pike Place Market and the Space Needle \u2013 so about equal walking distance to both depending on whether you turn right or left out the door. You wouldn't know it was a hotel from the outside, it doesn't really look like one at all. Just a word of warning (thankfully, we were prepared for it), you have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the hotel itself so don't take really heavy suitcases with you. We did book a Bell Town Suite and when we checked-in we were very happy with it but we soon noticed that there was a lot of road noise. The hotel is above a restaurant all on one floor so it\u2019s close to the road. We asked if we could be moved and the hotel moved us straight away to a lovely quiet Atrium Suite on the inside which was equally nice. The rooms are spacious (the ones we saw) and have wonderfully comfortable beds. They are well equipped with robes, slippers, nice toiletries, stereo systems and large flat-screen televisions. I can\u2019t fault them. It was really quiet when we stayed there; I think there was only one other room occupied. I think that meant that the service was a bit quiet too. The first day we went through to the lobby area for breakfast and it wasn\u2019t there, we ended up just going out for something. The next day we double-checked what time breakfast was again and the receptionist told us that because there were only a couple of rooms booked that they would bring it to our room. It was slightly delayed whilst they ran to the bakery but it wasn\u2019t a problem. We did eat on our first night at the El Gaucho Steak House downstairs.

We actually stayed in 2 different rooms because we came for 3 nights then went away for a side trip and came back for 1 night. One was on the interior and thus was a little dark (it overlooked a small courtyard) but very quiet. The other was on a corner overlooking 1st & Wall and there was tons of natural light, which was nice, but there was a lot of street noise. I live in New York and am used to street noise but I couldn't have slept with the windows open. The best thing about both rooms was the beds. I honestly think those were the 2 most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. We didn't ever want to get out! There was also a nice little office space in each room where you can set up a laptop. Internet access is free with a username and password provided by the desk. The bathrooms were quite small and left a lot to be desired. We requested a tub and had one in each room. This is not a tub for a luxurious long soak, but it's clean and you can take a bath. There is no counter-space--a pedestal sink. While overall the bathroom was clean the floor was very dingy and dirty in both rooms. White tiles seem to have been a bad choice. If you need much in terms of service (concierge, valet, bellman), you won't get it at the Inn at El Gaucho. The front desk staff, while pleasant, seemed a little clueless, with the exception of one gentleman who worked evenings during our stay. He was friendly and really helpful and knew his job. On the other hand, you aren't paying for this. With rates of about $175-185 this was the best value for a good hotel that I could find in Belltown/Downtown, and the room is more than adequate.

If we had been staying further in the downtown area, we would have missed out on all of the great restaurants and shops on 1st Ave. Many of the main tourist attractions are within easy walking distance, like Pike St Market, the downtown shopping district, the Space Needle, Argosy cruises, Pioneer Square etc...and as an added bonus, the Olympic Sculpture Garden is just a few blocks away and is the start of a beautiful waterfront trail for cycling or jogging in the mornings. The only negatives that I can come up with would be the stairs leading into the Inn as mentioned in many other reviews and the somewhat confusing air conditioner.

Before I get to what I consider to be down-sides, I'll give you the high notes. The bed was wonderful, probably best I've ever slept in, certainly better than any chain hotel, Kimpton properties and the Westin/W included. The towels and bathrobe were very soft (although the towel didn't absorb water as well as I expected it would). The high definition television with loads of hi-def and premium channels was a nice perk. In general, you can tell the hotel put a lot of considerations into the furniture in the room. There is also free wireless. There was a great shower head in the shower. Lastly, the hotel has arranged for free use of the Seattle Athletic Club (although this is not very close to the hotel). The wine glasses and water glasses (with corkscrew) was a nice touch. On the downside: I'd consider the bathroom average. Nothing was wrong with it, but it came across as an afterthought compared to the rest of the room. The ironing board was miniature - I had to sit down to iron my shirt. For the price of a nights stay, I would expect a full-size ironing board. Lastly, while the staff was very professional and personable, they were apparently stretched thin. I called the front desk three times in ten minutes to set up a wakeup call and got the hotel voice mail every time. I ended up leaving a voice mail but never got the wakeup call I requested.

(I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given 2 room keys, which is helpful. The room was a suite (they are all suites) facing 1st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a 40\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and 2 ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee/office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down 1st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only 2 blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!)

Also you could hear the band downstairs in the Pampas Room every night till 2 or so, if you're sensitive to that, but it didn't bother us too much. Upon check in the woman at the front desk forgot to mention that for $10 we could get a continental breakfast in our room (you have to arrange this the day before), so when morning came and we were looking for food, we were directed to a local bakery (Macrina) which was great and much cheaper. Loved the gift bag, the staff was fabulous, the robes were soft, the bed was comfortable, enjoyed the flat screen TV that you could move to watch in the sitting area or in bed! Belltown is a fabulous area. Great restaurants, nightlife, boutiques, and at the Inn you're just a few blocks down from the Free Bus Ride area, but we did a lot of walking. Overall, I would highly recommend the Inn at El Guacho!", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago IL", "Title": "\u201cGood, but....\u201d", "Author": "mamizs", "ReviewID": "UR5366446", "Content": "Stayed there over a long weekend and I agree the service was friendly and attentive. Hotel is in a great location in Belltown, and it is located near many interesting shops and restuarants. I would give this place another try, but there were some things that could use improvement. To their credit, the staff tried to remedy my biggest complaint which was a very loud air condtioner that hissed, started, stopped, etc, every 2 to 3 minutes. When it was quickly obvious that their own maintenance staff could not fix it, they immediately called a professional who came out on that same Saturday to fix it...he kind of fixed of it, but even admitted that it was not completely right. For just under $200 bucks a night, the AC should work. Period. In addition, the toilet paper holder was falling off the wall and the remote (batteries?) died. Not all bath products were replaced and ran out of soap. Stairs are a pain to navigate, especially since you have run in and out as their no vending machines or gift shop to purchase water, snacks, etc located on the property. That's the rant. Here's the rave. Again -great location. Cool room, very different than most hotels. Nice furniture, ceiling fan (on a remote), Bose, Plasma, free wireless and nice gift bag when you arrive. Extra reading material in room (great cookbook, other Seattle information) is a nice touch as well. Extremely friendly staff. All in all, a nice stay - maybe just got a \"bum\" room, and would try again.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Robert, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cStay at El Gaucho\u201d", "Author": "Pulaskicountytourism", "ReviewID": "UR5364173", "Content": "We were so pleased we decided on the Inn at El Gaucho. Fantastic service, very clean and tastefully decorated rooms. All the employees there are very helpful and friendly. The valet team lives by their company's motto \"Aggressive Service\" The hotel recommended a driver Asmelash K Bihen - Global Connection - 206-859-1181, be sure to use his services to and from the airport and any trips you might take around the area he is super! The hotel is located on the corner of 1st and Wall, at the edge of Belltown where tons of cafe's and bars are. It can get a little noisy on the weekends but we were able to sleep just fine. You can enjoy some interesting entertainment from the window, we wished the Inn would have balconies. We would have bought wine and sat out there and watched the people all night. They are located within easy walking distance of Pike's Market, and the Needle, a litte more of a hike to Pioneer Square. They do have steps up to the Inn, but aren't that big of a deal for those in good health. The night clerk thought the continental breakfast was being fazed out but the two times we requested breakfast, we received, and it was great! So double check if they are still offering this service, so you won't be disappointed. At the end of the day, you collapse into a wonderfully comfy bed. I thought I would never say this about a hotel bed....I miss that bed!", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Inn at El Gaucho", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d578306-Reviews-Inn_at_El_Gaucho-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$127 - $288*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2505 First Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98121</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515116", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ee/e0/eee0ccc20b2310f8360306521fc3da5c5large.jpg"}}
