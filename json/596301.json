It was in the afternoon and we asked the receptionist if it was a safe area. \"Of course\" she said and so we trusted her as well as the positve comments from Trip Advisor. We went in and out of the hotel throughout the day. We went to dinner that day at 8pm and returned by 10pm to find the hotel room safe completely ripped away and missing from the particle board shelf in the wardrobe closet. It was totally missing and NO signs of forced entry into the room. The police and locksmith agreed that the burglar had a room key (digital card type), and the hotel owner, Phillip, agreed that there was no evidence of forced entry, as the door automatically locks when closed, not to mention the window was secured when we exited. Needless to say, we were obviously \"targeted\" by a hotel employee as no other rooms were burglarized and none of our other possessions were searched except for the missing safe that contained our USA Passports, cash, jewelry, and irreplaceable important documents. We heard about the pick-pocketing throughout Europe so the room safe seemed like a secure option. Worse yet, the hotel owner would not even comp us for the one night where we stayed up to 3am at the police department filling out useless police reports that went nowhere. The owner said he would help out but then disappeared throughout the week as we anxiously sought replacement passports days later. The owner also said he would provide his insurance company name and contact information, but never did even after several email requests. He suggested our insurance company contact his insurnace company, but how could we do that without the contact information for his insurance? Bottom line: he kissed us off and said \"Au Revoir.\" One other thing, the front door to the hotel was never locked until our burglary. During that week, they continually locked the door and screened each visitor.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood location / good value\u201d", "Author": "Mike G", "ReviewID": "UR121085790", "Content": "stayed in hotel doisy for two nights while on a trip for the horse racing/40th birthday lovely hotel very clean good location and transport links excellent staff,would have been nice to have coffee making facillities", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, small space, good value\u201d", "Author": "firegarden", "ReviewID": "UR119872973", "Content": "The location is unbeatable - a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Metro station.

Our room was facing a busy street, but noise wasn't an issue because of the thick window glass. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel, which is great if you're arriving to Paris via train (about a 25 minute ride with traffic). The nearest metro station is right in front of the beautiful Arc de Triomphe (about a 10 minute walk from the hotel). There are also lovely cafes and bakeries all around the hotel. There's a cafe at the end of the block (I cannot remember the name) that has THE BEST creme brulee I've ever had! We unfortunately had a bad experience in Paris missing our train to Venice. When we returned to our hotel that they had already book the room to someone else and were completely booked. The head receptionist was a sweetheart! She tried calling hotels and hostels around Paris for us, but because of a tennis tournament, there were no hotels available in Paris. Being tourists in a foreign city, I felt overwhelmed, but they took care of us and let us sit in the lobby until the train station opened again.

Breakfast in the hotel didn't look great for 12 euros but there is a fantastic boulangerie a couple of doors down that provides for all your breakfast needs - so skip the hotel breakfast and go there instead! The hotel was very quiet and we particularly liked that for a small hotel there was always someone available in Reception to deal with any questions we had. The staff were friendly and very helpful.

Breakfast was not included in our room rate, although we did take advantage of it a few times. It's rather expensive for what you get (\u20ac12). Breakfast offers boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, yogurt, toast, pastries, fruit juices, tea, hot chocolate and coffee. You can get a cheaper breakfast at one of the cafes located nearby. The one offered in the hotel is more for convenience. The water pressure seems unusually high in my experience. The sink faucet would literally force water right out of the sink towards your legs. Fortunately we noticed this before we had been dressed for the day, saving us from watering our pants. The hotel design style is very modern with clean lines, cream and beige colors with splashes of pink and magenta. The location is in close access to both the Ternes and the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Metro stations. As for new arrivals to Paris, if you arrive on a Monday, purchase a Navigo card. Otherwise, purchase a 1, 3, or 5 day pass which gives you unlimited use of the Metro trains and buses.

When we first arrived, we were told check-in was not until 3 pm (was originally thought to be 2 pm), however the hotel did store our bags for us. The only part of the Doisy that I think needs improvement would be the staff that works the front desk. I found that the staff working while we were there were not very friendly, nor interested in helping us (relative to all other people we encountered in Paris). Even just scheduling a cab pick-up for the check out morning proved unreliable. Considering price and location, I still would opt for a larger hotel chain, with more consistent standard services and staff over this hotel.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic three star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "blacklabel75", "ReviewID": "UR59743094", "Content": "I visited Paris for the weekend to watch the finale of the Six Nations Rugby, the hotel was booked by friends as they had stayed there in the past and liked it. I must say I was not disappointed. The location is fantastic, a mere 10 Euro cab fare from Gare du Nord and within walking distance of the Champs de Elysees and Arc de Triomphe. The staff were very friendly and spoke good English. I initially spoke to them in French but upon hearing my accent they were more than happy to converse in English with me. The boutique nature of the hotel is fantastic, especially if you want a quiet weekend away, there were only four rooms on my floor. My room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very modern and was immaculate with a fantastic shower that was akin to standing under a waterfall. I also had an electronic safe which isn't always present in three star hotels. The owner of the hotel was brilliant and recommended a great restaurant a friend of his owned around the corner, he also wrote us a note to hand to the maitre'd and as a result we got a very good discount on a great meal. The only downside was that the breakfast wasn't worth the money but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance so this isn't a major issue. All in all, a very high quality little three star hotel!", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Loacation\u201d", "Author": "Gillymcc", "ReviewID": "UR58159274", "Content": "I thought this hotel was perfect for a trip to Paris.

It's in one of the calmest district in Paris. Arc de Triomphe is at about 5 minutes walking. Apart from the location, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. The room was extremely small. The distance between the wall and the bed was no more than 20 centimeters. The room was also quite dump and for this reason it smelled bad after a while. The bathroom was ok and the shower worked perfectly. The biggest remark I have to make is about the cleaning service. Towels aren't changed daily. Once I left the dirty towels (they were clearly dirty, like with big visible spots) on the floor and when I came back at night they hadn't been changed, but just nicely folded and put on the radiator. Another fail is that they do not have a free internet access, not even one single computer that one can use just to check emails or bus timetables etc. You can have access to the hotel wireless from your laptop or phone, but you have to pay 8 euro/day, which is quite expensive in my opinion. To sum up, even though the overall value is acceptable (we just paid 75 euro/night, which is quite an average/low fare in Paris) I would recommend this hotel only to Ryanair Travellers.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ATHENS, GREECE", "Title": "\u201ca great hotel\u201d", "Author": "PEGGYAthens_Greece", "ReviewID": "UR53938692", "Content": "a new modern hotel in the center of paris. everybody tries to make you feel like at home.i strongly recommend it", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Friendly Staff, Lovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "EAMOH", "ReviewID": "UR50207882", "Content": "This is a perfect location in paris.

TIPS Take the air france airport bus from cdg to the arc de triomphe...From there you are only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. 24eu return each person. Pastry shop next door to the hotel...very good...inexpensive compared to competitors food market near 12 rue de ternes.....cheese,bread,olives,etc FINALLY...go to cafe francis in front of pont de l'ama after 10pm. order a champange and watch the eiffel tower light show.
