Great room, plenty of space for the 4 of us (2 kids). This is a great location for getting around San Diego - right in the Gaslamp area. It is definitely loud at night - especially on the weekends - but it can be entertaining to watch some of the people down there! At times it did seem like non-stop action from police, ambulances, and fire trucks going by in every-which-direction, but it was still a comfortable place to stay. The staff here were absolutely I N C R E D I B L E - always friendly, willing to help, and great service all around! With the bell-men at the door it made it feel safe to come and go from the resort any time of day. There is a trolley stop only a block away - made for a convenient way to get around without a car. Parking is via vallet parking with unlimited in/out for $29/day for 2012 - seems pricey, but compared to area parking it is quite reasonable - we did 5 of our days with no vehicle then rented a car to get to some further out places the last 2 days. The mass transit via buses/trolley's is superb in the area with frequent service - easy to get to San Diego Zoo, Sea World, USS Midway museum, Coronado island, and many other places. If you are going - check into the Go-San Diego Card - good way to access many popular destinations with one single (pricey, but worth it) payment. Would absolutely stay here again! Room for improvement? - needs a swimming pool and hot tub. Other than that - GREAT!

We felt like we were \"someone\" every time we approached the hotel with a cheerful greeting and the doors being opened for us. When we checked in the staff had our bags waiting in our room. The staff was very helpful with giving suggestions of where to eat and the must sees in San Diego. The valet service is pricey but SO SO SO worth it! $29 a day goes a long way! We had originally thought that we would try to park in a lot thinking we would save money until we read the lot rules and they wanted to charge for every time we went in and out not to mention the not so close walk to go get your car. With Harbour Lights Valet we picked up the phone and said we needed our rental car and walked down stairs and within minutes it was there - when we brought rental car back same thing pulled up gave them the keys and walked right into our hotel. So worth the $29 a day. We stayed here 10/27/11-11/1/11. If I was to return I certainly would not stay here the same weekend as their Halloween Monster Bash - total craziness and we made the mistake of going out to eat out of the city and when we came back it took us an hour just to go a couple of streets over to our hotel because of the event traffic. However with that being said boy I have never seen a city go all out for Halloween like San Diego - go to the House of Blues and eat on the patio and just people watch (costumes!!)

Probably a hundred bars and restaurants in a 6 block area. The staff at the hotel are excellent. The rooms are large and comfortable. Since this is a time share we were asked upon completing registration when we arrived (copied my credit card and checked ID) to go to a seperate area for the \"second part of our registration\" which I interpeted meant \"try to sell you a time share and find out as much as possible about you.\" We declined after the long trip and were never bothered again. Everything you need is in the room to include a small kitchen and related items. One night we couldn't find a cork screw so we called the front desk and within 5 minutes one was brought to us. Nice small gym/sauna/steamroom in the basement. No pool. Parking $29.00 for 24 hours valet. Cheaper places to park in the area. There is a grocery store within walking distance which has a large deli and assorted wine, liquor, beer. Ralphs grocery store is the name and is down 5th avenue to g-street and then take a right for about four blocks. When I say down I mean down hill and when I say up I mean uphill. Once you arrive you will understand. From the airport take the city bus 901. Get off at 5th avenue walk half 200 feet to the hotel. Cost is $2.50 each for those under 60, Those over $1.10 each. Exact change required. Just stick it in the machine which excepts paper money and coin but gives NO change. One person can pay for two so generally I just put in 2.25 for the two of us. For a day pass for two I stuck in a $10.00 bill and got two day passess. We saw a lot of people everyday using the buses with backpacks and carry-ons. No big deal. A taxi ride is about $20.00 from the airport. Taxis are expensive everywhere else. The city buses and trolleys are safe and clean. The drivers, for the most part, are helpful and courteous. We did have a couple who were rude or just grouches when we asked if the bus went to a particular place. For any age a daily pass is $5.00 each day which allows for as many rides on the buses and trolleys as you want. Just show the pass when you board. We used the bus and trolleys to old town and the zoo as well the Midway Museum. One day we rented a car and went to Safari Park and the botantic gardens in Endicino which is about 50 miles. Covered both places in one day. Both are worth the trip. It takes a day or two to get the bus routes figured out. The city has a bus and trolley \"trip planner\" online and the hotel has free wifi so we used that. We recommend you take the buses or trolleys as parking is limited, costly, and traffic a pain and often oneway. WIFI is free in your room, just call the fornt desk for a password. Business center available but there is a charge. Now the bad. Noise on the weekends woke us several times. Mainly the extremely loud public safety sirens that seemed to echo.. We had a room fronting 5th avenue. The room doors are heavy so you can tell they tried to lesson the noise but if you are a light sleeper try to get an inside room away from 5th avenue or be prepared to wake several times each night. The homeless were everywhere holding cups, signs, and sleeping in doorways. They never bothered us but the sight and their condition was a bummer. In the park and trail along the harbour which is a favorite jogging/walking spot they take up a lot of space. We walked up to 5th avenue and then down to the harbour each morning (one half mile) . They have a great walking/biking/jogging trail that goes along the harbour for miles. Lots of nice restaurants as well. Don't miss Seaport village or the MIdway aircraft carrier (Museum). Balboa Park is next to the zoo and there are several museums and gardens where a lot of locals hang out on weekends having picnics and such. Very nice.

Both my wife and I travel a lot for business as well as for leisure. We rarely give a hotel a five star rating - but this resort (a former boutique hotel in the middle of Downtown San Diego) deserves five stars for everything. The location is one of the best you can ask for: The Gaslamp district with all its restaurants, bars, and specialty shops starts right at your front door. Other reviewers complained about the noise this location causes. We cannot agree. The noise level we experienced during our three night stay was not different from any other downtown hotel in any city. Our room was not large, it was giant, with a wonderful (double paned) bay window right above Fifth Avenue. The decorating style is modern with a very elegant comfortable flair. Everything looks fresh, new and clean. We had a King Size Bed, a pull out sofa, a full kitchen with all necessary utensils and a bathroom more than average in size. A flat screen TV, DVD- and CD-Player added to the comfort of the unit. You should know that the hotel is a timeshare, also available for rent. Like in every timeshare weekly housekeeping is provided, but not daily. There is no self-parking. Valet parking, which is prompt and easy, costs $ 27 per day with unlimited in and outs. This compares favorably with the rates one would have to pay in downtown garages where they charge you for each in and out. Everybody who works here was friendly and helpful all the time - from the receptionists to the bellboy and the valet. Check-in was a breeze. My wife and I agree that in the future should we return to San Diego we would not even try another hotel. It seldom happens that we leave a hotel 100 percent satisfied, even when we like the place.

We enjoyed our stay very much. It was a nice change after camping in the N California parks and down the coast for 9 days. This is another stop on our 2007 Western Trip. See our earlier reviews. We had lots of adventures and breathtaking sights, and now we were ready for civilization. Harbor lights is located at the edge of the Gas Light District with trendy shops, restaurants, good transit system, 2 blocks from Horton Plaza Mall, etc. Lots of activity, energy & vitality. Great fun! This resort is really a converted hotel, as noted in the Wyndham info packet. The unit was a large, nicely decorated, comfortable studio. It had a nice, large bathroom, small, but well stocked galley kitchen near the entry, queen bed, sofa w/pullout bed, armoire for storage & TV/DVD, a nice desk for our computer (download pictures), and a small table & chairs in front of the window. The large window (no balcony) faced the side street, but we did not hear the noise that others have complained about - maybe because we were on an upper floor facing away from the main street. There was no washer/dryer (unusual for Wyndham resorts), and no WIFI in the unit. However, there was a good WIFI signal in the lobby with plenty of seating & tables so we could catch up on email. The nicely equipped laundry, with large machines and tables, was in the basement near several resort offices. It was secure and comfortable. The elevators worked well and were never crowded. Parking was by the valet in a garage somewhere nearby. We did not see our vehicle for 4 days. This is not unusual for urban resorts and is noted in Wyndham info. We felt that the parking fee ($25/day) & tips was worth every penny. Public transportation is a part of the urban experience. The staff at Harbor Lights was great. The doorman was friendly and lots of fun to talk too. The check-in/check-out were both fast & smooth. The concierge was friendly and very helpful with info, discount tickets, reservations, etc. The \"owner's update \" (points sales pitch) was not bad at all - actually fast (<1hour) and friendly, after we told him that we had all of the points that we need. We had no problems with the unit, so I cannot address the maintenance staff - everything worked perfectly. We did not need maid service (we can pick up after ourselves) - but our unit was spotless when we arrived. Really, another \"home away from home\". We did not spend much time in the unit - we were enjoying San Diego. The bus stop & trolley stop nearby were a convenient way to see the city. We spent 2 days (not enough time) at Balboa Park and the Zoo. We took a Trolley tour of the city and of course enjoyed the wonderful restaurants and shops in the Gas Light District. We enjoyed wonderful dinners at Asti Restaurantie(1 block), Dakota Grille(next door), and Top of the Market @ Fish Market (at the harbor). This is a nice place, not exactly like most Wyndham Resorts (condos), but really a great urban property in a lively, colorful, interesting city. We enjoyed our stay and would love to return some day. Friday, we headed east, toward San Antonio, TX, through National Parks in CA, AZ, & NM and TX.

It took you everywhere from the water front to the Zoo,Old Town and every place in between. A great way to see San Diego without a car. Now we know why our son loves San Diego.

Let me start by saying the facility is very nice and the employees were very friendly and helpful. However, I wish we would have read the previous reviews before we made plans to stay here. We had our toddler and preschooler with us and keeping them entertained while we were there was a challenge. I would not describe it as \"kid friendly\". It's a great location for couples who like dining and bars, or even a baseball game, however. There is no place for kids to go to play. Even the main lobby isn't really a lobby. The \"lobby area\" consisted of tables filled with sales people and prospective timeshare clients. It almost felt as if we were walking through a new car showroom. They would be better served if the sales personnel handled that business out of sight of the lobby. There was no room for guests to hang out. As a matter of fact, they were constantly giving tours, so the elevator was always jammed. When we went to check out, not only was everyone else checking out, we had to compete with the salespeople giving tours. We couldn't get an elevator! They need to take care of current clients and not give priority to prospective ones. No pool, no lobby, no park nearby for the kids; a broken crib, a TON of noise every night of the week and homeless people hanging out right outside of the building.

It is a great location for someone in San Diego on business, or even for a romantic weekend. However, my wife and I went with our daughter to see the sights in San Diego, and the hotel was not someplace I would ever stay again. To start, if you want to park at the hotel, it is twenty five dollars a day. The hotel advertises that you can come and go as often as possible, however if you do so, it is only customary to tip the valet. So, the more you come in and out, the more it costs you. Some of the valets were fantastic, very friendly, and overall extremely helpful. The room was clean, but slightly dated. We were told that the rooms will soon be renovated, but they were not bad. The hotel does not have a pool, and swimming in the Pacific Ocean in October is not something I would recommend for anyone, it is far to cold. The hotel is located in the middle of Gas Lamp, which for the right people this would be great. Again, with my family, it was not a great location at all. The noise level was extremely high in our room from the surrounding bars etc. We checked out four days early due to how loud it was at night, and we were actually on the fourth floor. I can't imagine how bad it was for people in the lower floors. In comparison to other hotels we have stayed at through our timeshare, this hotel left us extremely unhappy.

The location is basically in the heart of the Gas Lamp area of Downtown San Diego. If you want a quiet place, this is not somewhere you should stay. If you want to be in the midst of the San Diego action however, this location is prime. All the rooms are studios, except for one (which is a 1BD). The studios are fine. Everything seems to be newer. There are not many amenities on-site (i.e., pool, etc.), however, you are close to everything like the beach, etc. The rooms are decent size, bigger than most hotel rooms, and average appointments. Each has a kitchenette, so there is a 2-burner stove, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine, blender, pots, pans, utensils, etc. We had a unit in the back corner (609), and I think we are happy it was there. Being on the main \"strip\" of the Gas Lamp, having a room in the front of the building would be way too loud (most especially during the weekend). Not much as far as views at this location. The whole building is 7 floors, so not a highrise either. All in all, very good and comfortable stay. No parking on-site, you have to valet at $25 per day (but it includes in-and-out privileges, so it is worth it in that regard (otherwise, for surface lots you have to pay each time, and there weren't any close by).
