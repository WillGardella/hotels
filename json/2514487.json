I returned early evening and found that the room they had given me was directly next to a bathroom. The room was dank, the carpet was soggy, the linens appeared to have been changed before my arrival, but they were stained and torn - nothing you want to see when you enter a hotel room. Because of its proximity to the toilet, and the sewage smell coming from the bathroom, the room smelled and felt like an extension of the bathroom. Add to the equation thin walls and drafty windows and ear splitting drilling and heavy construction that began early in the am, and you've basically got a nightmare on your hands. After I saw the room, I immediately went back to reception to ask if they could switch my room. They said they were full. I asked if they could move me the next morning, but they said all the rooms had been assigned for the following night. (This contradicted what I was told when I arrived, that rooms were assigned to new guests by midday.) All that they offered me was air freshener that didn't even begin to help. I have to say that the reception people were really nice, and it did look like the second floor of the hotel - where reception was - had been freshly cleaned and painted ( I did not see rooms, just the hallway). Also the location was great. This place definitely has potential, for a basic hotel, it could be easily refreshed by simple and easy to vacuum rugs and an Ikea run, but alas.. I left as soon as construction woke me, and later called the manager who credited me about half back. Even so, its beyond wrong to not warn travelers of construction, that will affect their stay, to say the least. Having to find a hotel at 8pm for a last minute stay in new york is a nightmare too, something i wouldn't wish on anyone. I did end up walking over to Hotel 17, which was the other place i was considering for my stay. I WISH i had chosen that place, set up was very similar, small rooms and shared baths down the hall, but the room they showed me was what the Amsterdam Hotel could be: clean, stylish, no frills but comfortable and a definite find for an \"affordable\" hotel in manhattan.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI'll keep coming back.\u201d", "Author": "boogieshoes10", "ReviewID": "UR83929422", "Content": "I've stayed in the Amsterdam Inn twice in the last 5 years, and I will continue to do so until my legs can't carry me up the steps anymore. Yes, this property is a walk-up. But for the price, you will not get a better value in a good neighborhood in NYC. The rooms are clean and safe, and the staff is exceptional. I'm guessing they ask you to leave the key at the front desk because they still actually use KEYS not key cards, and they can be expensive and time consuming to replace if they are lost by guests. I don't understand the reviews saying mattress pads were not on mattresses and sheets were thread-bare. We had mattress pads and clean, soft, high quality sheets on both occasions my husband and I have stayed. The biggest reason I would recommend this hotel is the professionalism, courtesy, and integrity of the staff. My husband dropped his wallet in the room right before we checked out. TJ, the front desk attendant, called us within an hour after our leaving to let us know that the housekeeping staff had found it. With her help, we received my husband's wallet back the next day. We can't thank TJ, the housekeeping staff person, or the Amsterdam Inn enough. So if you can stand the walk-up, a good neighborhood, clean rooms, courteous staff, and a great value, I'd highly recommend the Amsterdam Inn for your stay in NY.

The room was also extremely noisy, we could hear conversations that people were having at the bar downstairs.

After having a bit of breakfast in a 24 hr diner across the road, we made our way to macys for the black Friday sales. We had made the decision to check out of the hotel in the morning. I would give this hotel a wide birth especially if you are stay for a long period of time ( we were in Nyc for 11 days.)

I had real little expectations about the hotel, as other reviews were pretty scaring, but I decided give the hotel a chance, as it was the only non-shared bathroom hotel room in Manhattam for less than U$ 200 per night (my rate was U$ 143 per night, before taxes). The neighborhood is nice two blocks away from the subway and 4 blocks away from the AMNH. The dakota building is even closer. Nice places to eat near the hotel and a market to buy food to use in the microwave or store in the room fridge. The reception area is really small and the steep stairs to reach it are kinda scary when you first met. Be prepared to carry your luggage as there won't be anyone to help you. But they'll keep your luggage if you arrive too early to check in or if you're going to leave late. So, it's not big deal it being so small. Maybe the only problem is if you stay in one of the rooms just next door to the reception, it can be a little noisy as the other guests necessarily will have to call in reception for their keys. My room was on the same floor as the reception and I really had no problem. The room itself seems brand new (despite the 80's decoration) and had a nice queen size bed, cable TV (21 inches tube), microwave, fridge, a place to rest your luggage and a chair. The bathroom is great, not big but not the smallest I've ever seen, with a really nice shower with all hot water I needed. Complimentary bath amenities were unexpected as it's a 1 star hotel. My only complaint as that the room and the bathroom were really clean when I arrived, but was not well cleaned every day - or not cleaned at all. The rubbish was collected everyday as the towels and bed linen was changed, but there was no real cleaning during my stay.

It was odd that they made you leave your room key at the desk every time you left the building, but maybe they have their reasons. The rooms are super old and not at all luxurious, but for people who just want to see New York as cheaply as possible (without full-on hostel environment) this is a great place for them. We just made sure we were locking up our suitcases every time we left the building. It was a great hotel for us because we literally left at 8am every day and returned 11pm or later, just to sleep. The beds were clean and the rooms, while very very old, were sufficient. There were shared bathrooms and it seemed like the staff spaced people out so there were a few people on each floor, meaning the bathrooms weren't crowded and the floors weren't noisy. I was comfortable there after the initial shock of the room passed. If you look at the Amsterdam Inn's website you will notice they boast \"Newly renovated rooms with kitchenettes\"...this was certainly not the case when we stayed there. Maybe SOME rooms have kitchenettes, but we sure didn't. It was unfortunate because we had hoped to have breakfast food at the hotel every day to minimize eating out. This hotel does not provide facecloths. You get towels, you get soap, but no facecloths. There was a sink in the bedroom which was actually really nice. The outlet in the room (there was only one) was extremely loose so charging our phones or plugging in a curling iron was almost pointless, as they would keep flicking on and off. If you want a hairdryer here you have to LEAVE your identification at the front desk while you have the appliance. Not joking. I asked if they could just photocopy it, they said no. The person I traveled with actually found a cockroach in their bed one night. I understand that bugs sometimes just find their way in there, but it was gross. Another night someone used the shared shower on our floor and left his underwear and towels in the washroom for HOURS. You had to climb over them to get to the toilet. When I asked the person at the front desk to have someone come up to take care of it, he said nobody works in the evenings. So basically we had to wait for that person to re-visit the bathroom and realize they left their things. This hotel starts on the second floor of a building, and they have multiple floors, and NO elevator or escalator. So you could have to lug your things up to the 4th floor. They say wireless internet is available, so I called the front desk to order this internet service, and the guy at the desk told me I had to call a company called Natural Wireless to have it set up. It seemed ridiculous. On our floor there were 2 showers...one in the main bathroom and one in a single shower room.

My room was a single with full bathroom (toilet + shower). Although modest, as I already expected, it was comfortable enough for one person and this was a good surprise. The room was cleaned every day and the towells were changed also on a daily basis. It had a TV set with not many channels (ESPN, USA, TNT and Weather Channel were some of them), but enough to entertain and keep informed a tired guest at the end of a day in New York. I found Amsterdam Inn a very clean and quiet hotel. The corridors floors were usually shining and only once in while I would hear the voices or steps of another guests -- and the hotel was not empty. Just out of curiosity, I checked the toilets and showers outside the rooms and found them also clean. Some reviews here mentioned the stairs. In fact, climbing the stairs may be a little hard, especially if you are carrying heavy luggage. When you arrive at the address of Amsterdam Inn, you have to ring a bell. The recepcionist opens the front door remotely and then you have to climb a fairly steep flight of stairs. You get to the front desk and, depending on the number of your room, maybe you'll have to climb one or two more flights of stairs. The latter was my case: I stayed in the fourth floor. Was that a problem? Not at all. My luggage was realy heavy only when I checked out, as I had bought lots of books. By then, I had a little trouble to carry the suitcase, but it was something far from unattainable. I have only compliments to the staff. They were attentive and helped me when I had to solve a problem back in my hometown, in Brazil. They were very patient too trying to understand me when I spoke my broken English. The hotel provides the guest every day a voucher, which entitles its holder to have a cup of coffee (or juice) and a bagel with white cheese or butter (or jelly? I forgot what the second option was) in a coffe shop one block away. I found this great, since I\u00b4m not used to really have a breakfast. Usually, I have only a cup of coffee in the morning. So, it was a great deal for me to have for free a cup of coffee and a bagel, which was very tasty, by the way. Those vouchers saved me some precious dollars. The Amsterdam Inn location is great. It\u00b4s a few blocks away from some city atractions, like Central Park, American Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, Riverside Park etc. There are at least two subway stations nearby. It\u00b4s also a great neighborhood, with good and cheap places to eat, like Artie's, at Broadway (where you can also find Zarbar\u00b4s), good bookshops and beautiful residencial buildings. For those people who really like to walk, like myself, the hotel is at a walking distance from some other interesting places, like Columbus Circle (where you find a Whole Foods store), Apple Store and so on. I found the neighborhood quite safe. Many times I returned to the hotel late at night and saw nothing suspicious. Finally, I paid an average rate of US$ 109 per night. It was my first time in New York. I loved the city and I am highly satisfied with Amsterdam Inn. PS.: Two more informations that may be useful for another travellers. From JFK Airport to Amsterdam Inn, I got a van from SuperShuttle. The trip costed US$ 21 (US$ 19 + US$ 2 driver\u00b4s tip). It took a little longer than a cab would, I guess (one hour and 15 minutes, it was raining and the traffic was heavy), but I have no complaints. I was the second passenger to be dropped off at the hotel. When I left New York, I flew to Orlando early in the morning. To avoid any problems, I hired a private car with driver from a transportation service recommended by the Amsterdam Inn front desk. I paid US$ 40 from the hotel to La Guardia Airport.

After reviewing other hotels in NYC that one seemed like a good choice for the value. We booked a double bedroom with bathroom share. At arrival, the guy at the reception was very nice. The room was not big but just the good size and very clean. You have TV, two big mirrors and a sink. The toilets/ bathroom on the same floor were also very clean. They remained clean for the rest of the week, which shows that the cleaners were doing a great job all day long.And you never have to wait to go to the loo or the shower room.Our bed was done everyday and the towels changed daily as well. The hotel informed us before booking that some building work was currently taking place and it would start at 7am. To be honest, yes there was noise, but that didnt stop us from sleeping properly, even until 10am one morning. The hotel location is ideal. The upper west side is very calm and a nice neighbourhood. Three subway stops are available around the hotel within 10 min walk. The area offers a great choice of restaurants and diners for the breakfast. And the icing on the cake, there is a pub below the hotel where you can go back in the evening to have a nice diner for a reasonable price rather than wondering where to eat in this huge town. At the reception, the guys were always smiling and ready to help. So really, i would defenitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to spend some time discovering NYC, and doesnt want to spend hundreds in a hotel where you will only a few hours per day, but dont want to end up in a nasty B&B either!

We even had a TV! If you're the type who would rather spend money on a great restaurant than on a hotel room where you'll spend 8 hours, tops, then this is a good option.

My son and I travelled to the USA in April of 2008 (holiday of a lifetime so far for me) starting in LA then to SF across to Boston then down to Martha's Vineyard and finishing in NYC at the Amsterdam before heading back home to Australia. This hotel was the worst we stayed at during our 3 weeks. But I need to qualify a few things. NEGATIVES: There is massive construction still taking place next door and it will continue for some time. Construction work starts exactly at 7.00am however, the workers turn up much earlier and start making a LOT of noise. The Amsterdam is literally about 3 feet away from the construction. It is very, very noisy during the week because of this. Trust me on this!!! But, to be fair, there is construction taking place all over NYC. Rooms are very small and the sheets and blankets are thin. No elevator, tables, chairs, air-conditioning or coffee making facilities. No elevators at all so you must haul your luggage up at least one fight of steep stairs POSSITIVES: Location. Everything and I mean everything is just a few blocks away. Subway, diner, grocery store, laundromat, tons of other places to eat, Central Park, bar, museum, Broadway, drug-store and on and on and on. Bathroom was very clean and the cleaning staff were efficient and approachable. I found all the staff friendly and helpful. If you have had negative experiences, then maybe it was your approach. CONCLUSION: I would not stay here again UNTIL the construction work is finished. This is a very noisy place currently. Then again, you do not travel to NYC for peace and quiet.

The Amsterdam Inn is part of a boutique(?) group called NYInns which have 3 small hotels throughout Manhattan, one in Murray Hill, one in Union Square and this one on Amsterdam Avenue. I had been to NYC in February 06 and stayed at the Murray Hill Inn, which at that time, I found to be a great low budget option. So naturally, when I returned to NYC in November 07, I decided to stay in Murray Hill Inn again which also proved to be a big dissappointment (see my Murray Hill Inn review). I briefly left NYC and returned to stay at the Amsterdam Inn as the Murray Hill was booked out (all bookings in November for both hotels were done in advance being too late notice to change hotels without incurring huge cost). To my horror - the hotel is currently balancing precariously on the edge of a massive construction site next door. I suggested to the receptionist that there should be a warning on the website about the fact that there is a construction site next door, to which he responded, \"there is!\". I said, \"there isn't, otherwise I wouldn't have booked!\". As of today (31st December 2007) there still isn't! There is however, an A4 sheet paper sign at reception advising guests of the construction site. Gee whiz, how considerate. As the property was constantly overheated (about 85F (30C)) due to the archaic Manhattan steam heating system, we needed to crack a window open in order to bring the temperature down to a more livable level - rather than the desert-like conditions we were experiencing in the room. Lucky for us (sarcasm), we were on the side of the building next to the building site. So there was no need for an alarm clock and bang on 7am the construction workers started hammering away. I had anticipated this, and requested a change of room the night before to which I was told they were booked out and there was nothing available. To add insult to injury, the sheets were so worn that they were practically transparent, the bed squeeked when ever you made the slightest movement (same problem at Murray Hill Inn) and the showers barely broke the luke warm barrier. All in all, one of the worst hotel experiences to date. I understand it is not the hotel's problem that there is a construction site next door, however I do expect that they have a responsibility to inform their potential guests when they are making a booking. I suspect their reason for not doing this is the loss of business, however they could offer cheaper rates to encourage people to stay. Anyway, on complaining to the hotel in writing they offered me a reduction from the $173 I paid for the privlidge to stay in the hotel to $99. What a joke. I won't ever stay in this hotel again, nor any of the other NYC Inns. They really need to take a look at themselves. Despite the fact they position themselves as budget botique hotel - this should mean compromising basic amenities such as hot water, sheets in good condition, a quiet bed and some degree of climate control. I would strongly suggest people consider staying elsewhere - at the very least for the time being.

I was on the top floor in a 'Double bed room' with a private bath. Many of the rooms here have shared shower facilities. The room itself was clean, but very basic. Old beds, terribly uncomfortable pillows. Surprisingly, the bathroom looked like it had been somewhat renovated. Bathroom facilities were fine. There is quite a lot of noise from outside traffic and the windows are not double glazed, so it can be a challenge to sleep. Also, there is a lot of construction going on in the lot directly next to the hotel, so that adds to the noise. Staff were friendly and the included breakfast at the cafe up the road was basic but ok. Overall, if you're looking for a place to sleep with only the basics, the Amsterdam Inn is ok, but don't expect too much or else you will be disappointed.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bracknell", "Title": "\u201cJust what we needed\u201d", "Author": "elw3", "ReviewID": "UR7364724", "Content": "After reading some reviews we weren't sure what we would find but the Amsterdam Inn was just what we required it was nice, clean, friendly and cheap .

The location is good - maybe a little far out for some of the places we wanted to go but if I was on a budget I would stay here again. Central Park is close and a nice walk through the Park soon gets you to the start of the shopping on 5th Avenue. We had a twin room with en suite shower which was lovely, I'm not sure how much less the shared bathroom is but that looked clean and tidy as well ( our room was opposite). The breakfast voucher was good - choices of bagels and pastrys, we felt like proper New Yorkers. There are also lovely diners which offer some great breakfasts. The only problem we had was when we arrived at the airport and getting a taxi. Coming from the airport the taxis have a flat rate of $45 plus toll to anywhere in manhattan - we had a guy pounce on us to tell us that the taxis were metered and it would cost us $160 and he could get us there for $78. We also ordered the car service from the hotel which was OK - I didn't feel particuarly safe when we were going down some side streets (I've read too many horrors!).

Considering the prices for a hotel room in New York, we consider it a real bargain although don't expect the Ritz. On the Plus side: 1) Great location close to public transportation ( 1 and 9 lines as well as B and C lines) 2) Pleasant staff who do their best to accommodate your needs. TJ was especially helpful in trying to find us a room with a refrigerator and a longer bed. 3) Price (about $130 a night for a bathroom with shower) is terrific for New York at around the holiday time, which is when we went. 4) Clean -- i.e. not roach infested like other places we've been (!!!) with decent furniture and a TV. On the minus side: 1) It's in an old tenement building, so it looks forbidding and there is no elevator. YOu must walk up all the steep steps -- probbly not good for older folks though we felt we were just burning off calories! 2) Small -- we stayed in Room 401 (larger with a nicer queen bed) and Room 304 for the last night (small with a bath, but only full sized bed) and there's not a lot of lounging room -- not that you're paying for lounging room. In room 401 you will not be able to simultaneously sit on the toilet and close the bathroom door if you're over 5'5\". 3) Occasionally noisy as you can hear other hotel guests in the hallways. No traffic noise in our rooms though. Altogether a perfectly nice place to stay as long as you understand that it's budget.

However, I wasn't willing to pay over 250 dollars per night for a 8-night stay, so I decided to have a go with this hostel, which cost me 109 dollars per night. And worth (almost) every single penny, I think. Let me start by saying our room was just like any normal hotel/motel room I ever slept in during my extended holidays in The States. King size bed, airco (noisy but sufficient), lots of closet space, mirrors, a tv, a fridge and a microwave. The bathroom is smallish, but nice: great shower! We got clean, thick towels every day, and our beds were made with clean sheets as well. As an European I didn't have a clue about the tipping; we left the (friendly) housemaids/men 2 dollars each day. Hope I didn't offend them. I'd never book one of the dorm rooms, because they seemed very small; the shared showers were just big enough to step into, not to turn around in once you're in there. But then, I'm probably not used to these kind of amenities anymore, and they were (like everything) absolutely clean, when we took a look around the hostel. I'm just not a very poor student anymore (lucky me). The hostel itself is hostel-ish: flight of stairs straight from the street (camera/doorbell), a tired receptionist (the black guy and the white weird hair guy at night really friendly, sort-of-chief TJ wasn't) and a flickering tv in the background. Some posters here mentioned \"the noise\", but I honestly must say that the only noise I heard sometimes was coming from Amsterdam Avenue, where our room was looking out onto. The traffic seemed to go on all night, but I'm used to that at home and hey, it's the city that never sleeps :-) You may ask for a room on the 76st St side, in stead of Amsterdam Av. There was absolutely no noise in the Amsterdam Inn itself, which didn't surprise me once I saw the hostel. The shared rooms are so small and there's no meeting area or anything, so everyone just comes to 76st St to sleep. And eventhough we had quite a big room, we never spent more than 8 hours there :-) I loved the area: nothing touristy like downtown, its a relatively quiet residential neighborhood. It takes 10 minutes on either the subway (B, C ,1, 2, 3) or the bus (5, 7, 10, 11, 57, 72, 79, 104) to go almost anywhere. However, it's only two blocks from the most interesting parts of Central Park (incl. Natural History Museum), just across the park you'll find the famous Museum Mile and Madison St shopping district. Nice walk! There are literally dozens of nice restaurants, deli's and supermarkets in crawling distance. We spent quite some time just sitting on a bench, munching on our salami rolls from the deli, sipping our coffee, looking at all the foreign nanny's taking care of their Bugaboo toddlers. No need to go to semi-hot quarters like the Meatpacking District when you've got all this. I'll be back here. Just make sure you book directly with Amsterdam Inn. We booked at hostels[--] and lost our 10% deposit when we booked an upgrade (private bath), which wasn't possible at hostels[--]. Amsterdam Inn wouldn't give the deposit back themselves and made us pay all over again.

My partner and I stayed at this hotel from April 14 through April 22nd, when New York seemed to be going through a heat wave, which to us Englishmen seemed more akin to sub-Sahara temperatures. The problem with the heat was made worse by the fact we had no air-con, although we were assured prior to arrival we would be blessed with such. In addition, we experienced frequent bouts of an overwhelming aroma of world cuisine ranging from Italian to Asian delights. This made us somewhat nauseous at around 9.00am on most mornings. We were on the top floor (albeit at our own request), but I think this added to the smell what with the rising stench. In respect of the staff, I do not believe they were even slightly pleasant or helpful. The staff consisted of two women who dished out dirty looks and one with such long finger nails she could barely hand you a breakfast voucher - and when she did I couldn\u2019t help but feel she begrudged it (they don't actually tell you of this 'perk', one must seek out the information and bear the looks of distain). The third member of staff was an older grey haired man who was strange to say the least and spent his time mumbling to himself like Jack Nicholson in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\". Be aware this hotel is not equipped with elevators - it has four floors that actually equates to eight (plus the first) flight of (very steep) stairs. If you are enjoying your trip with a passive partner like me, you will need some bulging biceps and a good life insurance plan to deal with this feat. Again, don't expect help from the staff. The room, whilst very clean, I do have a few issues. We paid extra for a 'Queen' sized bed. When we arrived, it looked more like a UK single. The decor, whilst basic and a trifle dated, was still pleasant. The toilet was more inviting and very clean. There was some peeling of the paintwork in the bath and we had problems with the shower door falling from the hinges once or twice. Again though, nothing a pair of bulging biceps couldn't fix so weaklings be warned. I have also developed a rash on my arms, which I cannot attribute to the bed linen directly (in fact my partner is rash free), I cannot help thinking it may have been the root cause. The towels, although reeking of bleach, still had a number of black stains on them. I would estimate you would get 3 stainless towels out of 4. On our departure, we had a glimpse of one of the rooms on the first floor and it looked much nicer than ours. I don't know what kind of room they paid for nor indeed am I certain what I paid for (how can anyone be sure, really?) but I would suggest you request the first floor. The plus points were that a maid attended everyday to replace the towels and make the bed - although we didn\u2019t have clean sheets for 8 nights which is a little long when you consider the sweat and garlic from downstairs. The location was great - 3 stops from Times Square and we had hardly any noise in our room from the outside but as others have said, it is New York and not New Haven! All in all, I wouldn\u2019t stay here again - probably because next time in New York I would prefer a different hotel for variety. Because New York is so expensive it probably isn't too bad. I do feel certain places probably play on this fact and offer accommodation on the level of which in other countries would be considered hostel or refuge like.
