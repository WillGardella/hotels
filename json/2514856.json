First off, we waited for about 10 minutes for him to appear; then he made us wait for another 5 minutes before offering us a table (most of the tables in the hall were vacant). He did not speak any English; fortunately, my companion spoke French. The waiter was brusque and nonchalant from the start:virtually every order had to be made twice as they were never executed on first attemt. Then, things got even worse as he imagined that we were staring and laughing at him (indeed, we looked in his direction occasionally trying to draw his attention -- mostly in vain). After i complained, informally, to some one who appeared by the end of our ordeal and looked his senior, the waiter came up to my companion (as he could speak to him in French) and, after a short exchange, threatened to beat us up after 11 o'clock, \"at the back of the hotel\" where he demanded we should show up.

We had a junior sweet on the first floor, and it was amazing. The bed was harder than most but we couldn't stop talking about how comfortable it was and how well we slept.

I've been to Paris many times, but I don't usually stay in luxury hotels (so, forgive me if the things I remark on are standard). First, location: it's always charming to stay in the 1er, and this is about as 1er as you can get. Right on Place Vendome, a two minute walk to the Hemingway Bar, kitty-corner to an Annick Goutal, two blocks down from Tuileries, 5-ish minutes from Colette, 10-ish minutes from Laduree r. Royal. Awesome. Easy access to big tourist destinations: Tuileries (as I mentioned), the Louvre, the Opera Garnier, and the Madeleine are all an easy walk away. Close to both the Tuileries and Concorde metro stops, you have pretty good metro access. Plus, between the hotel itself, and the Ritz just two minutes away, you'll never have problems getting a taxi. The rooms themselves are spacious, with pleasant views, offering maximal control over the amount of light let in. During our stay, our room was tidied twice each day. One of the nicest touches was a weather report for the next day which was delivered during the evening cleaning--including sunrise and sunset times, enabling you to plan your twilight activities (the Eiffel Tower, Bateaux Mouches, walks along the Seine, etc.) for optimum romance. There was also an international newspaper delivered daily. The staff was wonderful; they provided excellent suggestions for restaurants and places to go out. There was never any kind of concern that they might be sending us somewhere subpar, to dine and drink amongst the tourists. Rather, they sent us to places that, given our relative youth, had both excellent, innovative fare, and were rather \"branch\u00e9.\" They were always attentive, polite, and helpful, without being overly-assuming. In brief, the service was perfect. If you have the funds, I would highly recommend the Hotel de Vendome.

For comparative purposes, we also stayed 2 nights at the Nimb in Copenhagen; 2 nights at Bromoelle Kro in Denmark, site of the wedding; and 4 nights at the Hostellerie de Plaisance in St. Emilion, France. I was a little apprehensive about this property, given that we normally stay at Aman, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, and Relais and Chateau type properties--and because I was eager to try the Park Hyatt Vendome instead. We had previously stayed at the Pavillon de le Reine, but we wanted to stay more in the Vendome area of Paris. We settled on the Hotel de Vendome partly due to price and partly due to my usual preference of staying in a small luxury hotel when at all possible as opposed to the many grand hotels. We absolutely made the right choice! We booked the Deluxe Suite but were upgraded to the Presidential Suite on our arrival. As this was our first time at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised--and were awestruck by the Presidential Suite. While we have stayed in bigger suites (the Presidential Suite at the Four Seasons Prague comes to mind), we really were impressed with its size, layout, and its impeccable French design. There was no doubt that this was Paris. One of my hesitations about the Park Hyatt (and Four Seasons) is that those hotels can sometimes feel slightly less authentic. The Hotel de Vendome felt inimitably French--while still retaining all of the high levels of service and luxury that we crave. The Suite was almost perfect--it even had its own huge sun deck looking into the courtyard of the Hotel, with almost complete privacy since all of the windows on the other side were shuttered. It had a lovely drawing room leading to another entry vestibute opening into the main living room and dining area, with a separate couch area to the side opening into the bedroom. French doors and natural light abounded, with the walls slightly sloping inward as we were on the top floor. The bedroom had automatic shades that provided complete blackout conditions for sleeping, something we cherish at home. The master bathroom was the only caveat to a perfect room--it was a bit small for the size of the suite. But we still found it more than functional and beautifully designed. Service could not have been friendlier or more efficient. It definitely felt like we were in a high end boutique luxury hotel as opposed to a major 5 star masterpiece--a plus for us. We had dinner at the hotel on our last night--1 Place Vendome is absolutely French again, beautifully designed and with a very lovely 4 course pre-fixe menu that we enjoyed tremendously (though you could also order a la carte if you wished). Service was excellent and prompt, and the food was outstanding. We took note that the restaurant was almost full on a Friday evening, even though this is obviously a small property with a less known restaurant, and we also noted that we seemed to be the only Americans present. We enjoyed that immensely, even when we had a minor translation challenge or two. Our only real gripe is that their complimentary wireless internet constantly required us to re-authorize every day. That was a bit annoying. But that's it--a smaller bathroom and good internet that needed me to put in a code once a day. Those were our only complaints! We did have drinks at the nearby Park Hyatt on our first evening. It is a beautiful property, and I certainly like its style more than that of the Four Seasons here in Paris. That being said, I was startled at how happy I was that we were staying at the Hotel de Vendome and not the Park Hyatt. The Presidential Suite certainly helped, but we would have been in a suite nonetheless at either property. I am curious as to how the Deluxe Suite would compare, but the hotel as a whole is wonderful. My husband and I agree that the Hotel de Vendome is our new address for Paris. Considering the price we would have paid for a Prestige Suite at the Park Hyatt, the Deluxe or Presidential Suites here at the Hotel de Vendome are a bargain.

I had my hesitations regarding the size (boutique hotel) and the cost. I can honestly say, I have never, ever experienced such an amazing overall stay at a hotel in my life (even since then). My husband and I try to do one luxury trip a year, and the stay at Hotel de Vendome in Paris is the marker that we hold all other hotels to moving forward. Just as a testament to the service level and ambiance of this luxury boutique hotel - we are going BACK December of 2011 for the Christmas holiday. The rooms are spectacular and elegant. We stayed in a Junior Suite overlooking Rue Castiglione (and Godiva). Floored at the size of the room - was huge compared to US standards and off the charts compared to European rooms. The living room furniture was exquisite, the bedroom was massive and the walk in closet - yes, walk in closet - i have goosebumps just remembering. The service is over and above what you would expect from a 5 star luxury hotel - they remembered our names every day (yes, in PARIS) everyone was spot on with smiles, assistance - from housekeeping, porter, concierge, front desk - and the most adorably sweet bartender in the restaurant who not only got me tasting the most amazing chips (they are purple), served us amazing drinks but told me which was better, Cafe du Magotts or Cafe de Flore for Hot Chocolate. As I mentioned - every hotel we stay at is compared to Vendome - and they do not live up, including the St. Regis in Rome, The Hilton Auckland, etc. I have stayed in many countries and in many hotels - including trying to find another place through slh.com (Small Luxury Hotels of the World of which the Vendome is a member) and *nothing* lives up to my expectations - the Vendome is the epitome of service and standards in Paris. Upon arrival, we received a bottle of Champagne in the room, a gift basket from Guarlain, and of course, the daily Godivas on the pillow. You are less than walking distance from the Louvre, the Tuelleries, metro stops, jewelry shopping at palace vendome and a block or two from Galleries Layfayette, PrinTemps and Opera Garnier. Across the street corner is a great little bistro, Le Castiglione - which had great food (especially Onion Soup and excellent wine selection).

Some distinguished addresses adorn this grand courtyard, but, in a quiet corner one remains, the most discreet. Number One, Place Vendome, the location of the 4 star deluxe Hotel Vendome. The hotel is somewhat of a surprise, neighbouring but not overshadowed by the imposing Ritz hotel just around the corner. On the contrary, this building has a pedigree that far exceeds that of its neighbor. Once the ancestral home of the Vendome family (for whom the historic place is named) built in 1727 and once the embassy of the Texas Republic, when it was first recognized as its own country. Imagine. Paris, Texas. You know you are in for an intimate experience as soon as you step through the door. The hotel's ambience envelopes you as you enter the quiet lobby, with its inlaid Italian marble floor, and crystal chandelier that sparkles above. The suites are all decorated in unique combinations of traditional French antiques and art. A beautiful corner room suite, with an elegant French master bathroom in Italian marble and a huge tub even has a guest bath for your visitors, just off the petite salon. The layout of the room, the historic views and the handsome bedroom in traditional French Blue Toile patterns is impressive. The entire operation is handled by its Chief Manager, Ms. Etiennette Clamouze. Like a quiet, yet commanding general she manages a diverse staff of professionals who work behind the scenes to keep the guest's experience seamless, enjoyable, with impeccable and personalized service. Location is everything in Paris and with this emplacement there is not a metro, bus, taxi or limousine service that won\u2019t take you to where you want to go. Shops, cafes and the nearby fashionable districts are so close, its dangerous (but in a really good, way). Executive Chef Dider Ani\u00e8s is at the helm with his award winning team, creating seasonal menus using fresh ingredients. The recently renovated Mezzanine bar and restaurant has local business people flocking there for lunch. For the fashion set, the d\u00e9cor in the restaurant is perfect: Michele Bonan, a designer who has already made his mark at some extraordinary hotels has taken what once was a rather stuffy atmosphere and made it fresh and chic. Soft dove gray walls and silk draperies accent the painted wood paneling to create the background setting that is dreamy and subtle. The restaurant windows overlook the famous rue Castiglione. The surprise of a black and white \u2018hounds tooth\u2019 club chairs with pink accents makes the d\u00e9cor both masculine and feminine, comfortable and inviting. There are no bells and whistles here to distract you from the comfort and quiet of the place.

At 1 Place Vendome you feel you are part of history, and even the hotel building itself gives you that feeling. The hotel staff are a major factor as well - not only do they greet you with a smile and a very warm welcome but are willing to help with anything you need and go even beyond the extra mile from restaurant and tour reservations, to even one of the very nice and kind gentleman, running down the street on the final day of our stay, helping us hail a cab to catch our flight. It was a Saturday and the cab company that was supposed to pick us up never showed up!! I would like to also single out Sophie (I hope I got the spelling right) who is a real gem. Moving on to the rooms, we were nicely upgraded to a suite that was very spacious, had a lot of storage space (we travel with a lot of luggage), equipped with all the amenities you can think of (down to a stapler, ruler, scissors, post it notes, etc) and spotless clean. Godiva chocolate at night was a real treat. The bathrooms are also spacious and very clean. The only drawback in our room, was the absence of windows that one can open and that could sometimes give you the feeling of being boxed in. They smartly try to overcome that feeling, with floor to ceiling mirrors. Free internet is an additional plus. All in all, if ever going to Paris again, this will be not only my number one but sole choice. The place is magnificent and certainly adds to your enjoyment of this lovely city.

We have been to Paris nine or ten times and whilst we have been very fortunate with our choice of hotels on each visit, we have rarely stayed at the same hotel twice, preferring to keep looking for that one hotel which meets all our requriements. Well at last we have found it! Three things really stood out for us: 1 Location - it was perfectly placed to make sightseeing in any direction easy. The Louve is only a few minutes away, ditto the Opera. The hotel is near the Opera and Tuilleries metro stations which means no tourist attraction is too difficult or too far to get to - same goes if you decide to walk as we do. 2 The staff - The most friendly hotel staff, they could not have been more helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble. As soon as we walked through the door we were made to feel totally welcome and this continued throughout our stay. 3 The room - Both the bedroom and bathroom came off a small lobby area in which there was a wardrobe and mini bar. We had a standard room and the room was perfectly adequate for our requirements, it was beautifully decorated with those final touches which made it just that little bit more special. The bathroom was also more than adequate and beautifully decorate. We did get a peek into a larger room across the corridor and next time we may upgrade, if only for the fact that they faced the road and we are avid \"observers\" of what is going on outside - however it would depend on cost. The housekeeping was excellent, towels used early evening were changed whilst we were out so that in the morning we had another set of clean towels. Finally we both agreed that the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept on - even better than our own at home and we had to really force ourselves out of it in the morning, especially after a long day walking the day before! In summary, this really is an hotel which should be tried, obviously our view is just that, our view, what another person may be looking for may not be what we look for, but if you are looking for polite staff, perfect location and comfortable rooms then this is for you. It is not a cheap hotel however, but for us it was really worth every penny.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "TravelSimBoston", "ReviewID": "UR8419934", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the small and beautiful Hotel de Vendome for 9 nights in August. This was our first visit to Paris, and we had a hard time deciding where to stay, but we were very pleased that we settled on this hotel. Although our room was small (we booked the hotel's smallest room) it was very clean and quite luxurious. The marble bathroom was a good size with a soaking tub (and a bidet!). All the lights were controlled by a central electronic box which worked very well for us. The staff was very attentive and helped us book restaurant reservations and confirm our transportation arrangements (we don't speak French). One day when it rained heavily, the staff gladly provided us with umbrellas for the day. The hotel is located right in the heart of Paris, very close to the Louvre. We were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit. If you like walking, you can easily walk to the Champs-Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe from the hotel. It's also located very close to many excellent shops and restaurants.

Had lunch at Le cinq - AMAZING !!! service , food, atmosphere was the BEST!. Ate at Senderens - expensive and very good but nowhere near as good as Le cinq!. Hotel is walking distance from the Louvre and location is very convenient - lots of local cafes and restaurants - concierge a bit disappointing - they did not seem to know the good restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommmend the hotel - small , intimate, nicely furnished ( happy hour in the bar - 2 for 1 drinks - check this out ! they make a great cosmo but it was not well publicised - we found out by chance!)

We did not use the restaurant (It is very cosy and cute) but we decided to eat elsewhere. One thing we did note - Breakfast is 28 Euros - Stop at any cafe, and there are many, and its breakfast for about 8 Euros - We ate breakfast at the Cafe! The hotel staff we very friendly and helped book our meals in Local restaurants - they called and made the reservation for us!

The hotel itself was lovely, clean and the staff were always professional. We booked into the classic double (the least expensive), so it wasn't huge but still big enough for Paris. The only criticism I have is that we stayed on the top floor, and the room only had one window and insufficient artificial lighting, so it was quite dark in the room. The highlight was definitely the marble bathroom, with how cold it was outside it was ideal to take long warm baths after the long days out. The bathroom was huge and gorgeous!

The photos posted here are of another lesser hotel and do not come close to the actual hotel. For a true representation see the \"Hotel Photos\" section. The Hotel de Vendome is situated on the Place de Vendome in Paris. An excellent location in the 1st arrondissment in the somewhat swanky right bank. A short walk across the Jardin des Tuilieres and you are in the left bank. You are central to everything and the area itself is exceptional. The Hotel is luxurious from the small lobby to the very well appointed rooms. Linens, the bathroom and overall comfort were exceptional. You got the sense of true quality and luxury.

This made directions or suggestions for restaurants difficult. The location was great, with proximity to the Lourve, Champes Elysees and wonderlul shopping.
