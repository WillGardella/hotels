Couldn't get a better location for transportation to/from airports and around Paris, one of the cleanest rooms I've ever stayed in (not a lot spent on decorations typical of many Paris two-stars, but very comfortable), building is well maintained, elevator is sized for hotel's size, very accomodating staff (had a very early flight and the guy got himself up early and made us coffee to have along with breakfast), good sit-down restaurants and sidewalk cafes just around the corner as well as ethnic hole-in-the-wall cafes on same street, and is situated in a pretty bohemian neighborhood.

The ceiling was beautiful and the stairs up and down the floors were nice to look at. The elevator was small but worked great. The Air France airport bus service has a stop one minute away, ditto for the Gare de Lyon subway entrance, and the train station itself is not much further. A bakery is on the other side of the building, or you can get breakfast eats and drinks in the train station for pretty cheap. Nothing beats a warm pain au chocolat and a cappuccino before you hit the streets of Paris! The area was safe at all times for us, as well, so no worries there. Downsides: (a) there's not a tonne of well-known things to do in the area around the hotel. Although the Place de la Bastille is not far, and neither is the Seine, in terms of atmosphere, this area is lacking. It didn't really matter for us but it's worth noting. (b) The breakfast is not worth the money, in my opinion. A quick walk to the yummy bakeries in the area gave me what I needed for almost half the price. (c) The bathtub/shower we had was odd. A shower curtain would have been nice. Note of caution: the one way street outside is always packed with cars so don't expect to get a parking spot, even if it's just to drop stuff off. We rented a car with EuropCar (through AutoEurope) at the CDG airport and later dropped it off at the Gare de Lyon, a great option if you don't want to go back to the airport.

The bathroom includes a tub and shower, however the shower only goes as high as 3' (maybe), and does not have a curtain or even a glass wall to keep water off the floor.

Whether you want to catch a taxi, bus, metro, or train, it is so easy to do from here. Even if you want to use the Air France shuttle to and from the airport, they all stop at Gare de Lyon. One tip though is to download a map of the metro lines, before you come, and take it with you everywhere! This made taking the metro so much easier and we never ended up in the wrong place!

At checkin, the first thing the lady said was that she wouldn't let us stay there - without even greeting us properly! She very rudely told us that we would have to get separate rooms for the children, no matter that a 3 or 7 year old child cannot stay without his parents! So our welcome to Paris after a long flight from USA was a woman rudely telling us we had no place to stay! She offerred no help as we carried our luggage into their temporary storage while I went looking for rooms at other Paris hotels. She even had the gall to tell us that no more than 3 of us could even _enter_ the room, even for a short time during daytime since the room only had 3 beds (I'm not making this up)! We eventually found another hotel close by that had no problems with letting us all stay in a single room, even though it did not have 5 beds. We split the first night at Palym and this other hotel, and moved out of Palym after the first night. Unfortunately, we went through a lot of pain and wasted a valuable day for the last minute hotel hunt and luggage transfer. I have never seen worse customer orientation than this experience. The lady was rude to us, lied to us and offerred absolutely no help or suggestions at all to someone who was traveling with little kids, with a lot of luggage and clearly new to Paris. I could see the lady was much more friendly to other French speaking customers (and the current rate at which she was booking rooms was much more than the advance reservation rate we'd paid, leading me to wonder if this was a contributing factor).
