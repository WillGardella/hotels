{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Do not be fooled by its fancy lobby This hotel was the worst place I have ever stayed at. The pictures on the website seem amazing but the rooms they pictured were definitely not the ones we stayed in. My family and I were sent to the lower wing, which was basically a confusing maze of a building that they made into horrible hotel rooms. The room had quarry tile floors(you know the ones you see in a restaurant kitchen); it reeked of smoke and the towels smelled like they have been there for quite some time. The water was yellow when it first came out and then we ran out of hot water after 10 minutes. I took a bath in lukewarm water and when i came out, i smelled like bleach for the rest of the night. When we tried to switch rooms, the very rude concierge said there was no other triple, which i find VERy hard to believe in the winter time when tourism was low. Then my mom tried to use the internet access downstairs and was told that there was wifi- but when she asked for the password, the same rude concierge told her that she was mistaken and the wifi will not work for another year. All in all, we had the worst night there but i was too tired to fight it any longer. I wanted to just sleep in the lobby. So my family and i just lived with it but I am writing this now so that you wont have to go through what we did.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768371045", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "AJsanfrancisco"}, {"Content": "Good hotel, good location       Ponte Vecchio", "Date": "Nov 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR460818506", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Blostin"}, {"Content": "quite ok Hi We stayed at the grand hotel med in Florence for a weekend.

All changes and updates were done perfectly and on time. And on the top of it, the same feeling about this hotel had my clients.

Staff were exceptionally friendly and when booking a taxi they arrived in about 3 minutes. I would recommend a taxi from the bus station as it would be too far to walk with cases.

After staying in a boutique hotel in Rome before this one in Florence, this was a big hotel - as far as size goes. The shower was bigger, which was much more comfortable. I even took a bath one night. The room had a great view of Florence since we were on the 6th floor. Location: is just slightly outside the hustle and bustle of Florence, but it's walkable. You don't HAVE TO take the bus to go to places. Santa Croce is actually a nice walk from the hotel.LIKES: (1) Again, the view from the room since we were on the 6th floor. We could see some of the Arno and then the many villas and mountains across the Arno. (2.) The big shower/tub, which we were not used to since staying in a small hotel in Rome. DISLIKES (2) The staff. After getting so much attention at the small, boutique hotel in Rome - the staff here were just not as friendly and willing to help. They had brochures and flyers of tour buses that you could take to explore the city, but I felt they knew little on how a tourist who is completely new to Europe should travel. (3). Internet use: OUT OF SERVICE was the sign posted on each of the 6 or so PCs in the lobby until the very last day when I saw that 2 were working. Come to find out though that you had to pay 5 Euro just for 30 minutes! What a ripoff. I know you don't go on vacation just to get on the computer, but it's nice just to have access to email and write to family and friends. A good tip on how to travel through Florence: pay for the one-day double-decker tour bus (16 Euro each person). It runs 24-hours so you can literally go all day. You can get on and off at sites as you please and there is audio playing as you pass by sites to give you history.

There is a small American bar .coffee shop and terrace outside which my daughter and I found pleasant to sit outside in the evening and enjoy a pasta dish or similar.

Breakfast was a good selection of croissants,pastries,cold meat and cheeses ,cereal yoghorts, juices,bacon ,eggs etc enough to keep you going all day.

This is our second trip to Florence using it as a base to travel around Tuscany. I heard about this hotel from an Italian friend who uses it when he goes to visit his daughter at University there. We booked thru Venere.com and got a special offer. 1 night = E.140, 2 nights = E121 pn, 3 nights E.100 pn including breakfast. The rooms were decent sized for Italy with the largest king-sized bed I've ever seen. There was also airconditioning. TV has channels in French English and German as well as Italian. Bathroom was small especially the shower but acceptable and spotlessly clean. The hotel was full but we heard no noise in the corridor or from our neighbours. We looked out onto an apartment building so kept the curtains draw . I understand these rooms with this view are kept for the special offer but it really was not a problem.Breakfast was mixture of continental and North European with various brioches and teacakes, fresh yougurts, muesli and cereals, fresh fruit , canned peaches, cheeses, cold cuts of all types, pate' , hard boiled eggs, and even bacon (italian style) and scrambled eggs. There were 6 types of bread and rolls to select from which you could toast if yoiu wanted. There were urns with hot milk, coffee and hot water and a selection of tea bags but the staff were happy to bring you proper cappucino , espresso or a pot of tea. After breakfast we sat in the large comfortable reception / lounge area to plan our day. There were free Italian newspapers and free newsheets in English with the main headlines. The reception staff were helpful and friendly. They sold us tickets for the bus in Florence but said they would buy them back from us if not used, which they did. they also supplied us with a great street map of Florence, free. There is Internet in the lounge but it costs E.5 for 1/2 hour which I thought was a bit steep.It is a 20 minite walk to the centre but you can get a bus from the street behind the hotel. It still takes about 15 minutes but you can save your feet. We walked back along the Arno and it only took 15 mins. We had a car and although the hotel says free parking there are only about 6 places for the hoteland we never got one of them. There are paying parking places all along the road outside the hotel at E.1 per hour until 8pm and then again from 8 am. You do not pay for Sundays or holidays.I was really impressed by this hotel especially because 2 years ago we stayed in a small hotel in Florence, Hotel Cordova which cost E.90 per night. It was clean but really really spartan and faded to the point of actually not being welcoming, and breakfast was coffee/ cappucino and a cornetto from the bar in the reception area. Our friends stayed in the Hotel Panama 2 years ago and paid E.80 p.n. It was much like the Cordova but the rooms were even more basic. This hotel also compared favourably to other hotels in this price range all over Italy.All in all we would really recommend this hotel to any age groug if you are looking for quality/price..", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR512955230", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "picchio42"}, {"Content": "Lolved the breakfast On first impressions the entrance and reception area are vert grand.

While the hotel facilities are really more 3 star, I gave it 4 because of the great deal we got through their website. During a heavy tourist weekend in Florence (first week of September) when hotels were pretty solidly booked or were going for well over 200 euros a night, we were able to get a 95 euro per night rate including breakfast. For that price, this review gets 4 stars.Like others have mentioned, this is (American) tour group central. There were at least 5 groups while we were there, but we only really ran into them at breakfast, and like another poster mentioned, the hotel treats everyone pretty much the same, tour group or not. While I fell in love with Florence, I found Florentines to be a bit curt. However, the front desk clerks were always helpful and friendly. The lobby and room decor is classic 80s, I guesss I'd call it. You can tell it's probably from that era, but it's an 80s look that doesn't really go tacky (i.e., completely safe). We were fine with paying 5 euros to use the computers in the lobby for 30 minutes.Breakfast is only average, but if you pick the right items, you can fill up at least 'til a late lunch. Generally, stick to the breads, cereals, pastries and cold meats, and avoid the eggs and bacon, neither of which looked like the real thing. Our room, 121, was standard and on the small side. It was, however, very clean and even had a flat-screeen tv with about 20 channels (mostly Italian). Our bathroom was big, with two wash basins, a toilet that was a little too high and a space-age type shower. We didn't have problems with noise from neighboring rooms but we were out all day and didn't get back until late at night, when we showered and went right to sleep.Now, as to the location issue-----the hotel is not in the center of Florence, and is more on the perimeter of where central Florence begins. If you find the right streets, Santa Croce is only about 5 minutes away and you can make it to the Ponte Vecchio in about 15 minutes. As the hotel is located behind a meridianed street that faces the Arno, one way to walk from the very center to the hotel is to follow the river-- a beautiful walk. We were actually happy to be staying just a little further as we perhaps got to see some views that visitors staying closer might miss. The only real distant place is the train station. We did make the 45 minute walk once at night, but the taxi was only about 8 euro which was well worth the price when we left early in the morning.My only complaint about this hotel is the lack of irons; there was none in the room and when we called the front desk, we were advised there was no ironing room and no irons to deliver to the room and we'd just have to send clothes out to their ironing service. This is really a cheap and unnecessary way for the hotel to make a buck.As for dinner, we ate twice at Il Giardino delle Follie Estive, the restaurant right next door to the hotel. It's an informal, neighborhood place with basic Tuscan staples (except the pizza) done very well. Despite being next to a large hotel (and therefore, a captive audience), we liked the fact that locals outnumbered tourists, prices were reasonable and the food was very good. Another good (and cheap) option is Negroni---cross the bridge in front of the hotel and walk about 4 (long) blocks going toward the Ponte Vecchio (it's in a little crowded square with about 2 or 3 other bars). Negroni lays out food to nibble with drinks like at many US happy hours, except that this is Italy and the nibbling consisted of a delicious risotto, penne, mixed vegetables, salads, breads and a few sweets. For 8 euro, we ordered a glass of wine each and filled up on the food and better yet, the place was full but without a tourist in sight.Although it's not the lap of luxury, I would definitely stay at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo again. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not and actually does very well at being what it is.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719608867", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "islington3164"}, {"Content": "Large, Busy but very efficient.

Saying that, overall the hotel is very efficient in dealing with this constant guest turnover, and we were more than pleased with the selection and presentation of the breakfast, which set us up for the day exploring the sights of Florence. Yes, the hotel is a walk into the central part of Florence, but to be honest, with the noise and bustle of the town centre, a quieter location may be preferable to some ( although the front of the hotel does face a busy road ).We ate in the hotel restaurant twice, menu was quite limited but we enjoyed the food, and the staff were pleasant and professional. We had a airy room at the front of the hotel, which was very clean and modern with air conditioning, we didnt have a problem with the bathroom as other reviewers have, quite adequate with a bath and shower, although take your own hairdryer as ours blew cold air!

It is a large, modern hotel that really does have a ton of group tours staying there. The location is quite far from central Florence, unfortunately.

The buses in Florence are very confusing but we were able to find a stop a few minutes walk from the hotel that takes you to the Duomo. (Note: the stops and bus numbers are different when going into the city and when coming back.) Walking places from the hotel was ok at first but after a busy day sightseeing and shopping, that long walk back was annoying and tiring.Our room and bathroom was VERY small but fairly clean. Beds were exceptionally comfortable. The maid did not restock any of the toiletries we used for the entire three days but I am sure she would have if we had bothered to ask. The front desk reception was usually busy but helpful and friendly for the most part. Breakfast was excellent, with scrambled eggs, bacon, cold cuts, breads, cereals, fruit and yogurt. The hotel is located on a very busy street and our room faced that street. While we had a lovely view, even with the windows closed we heard cars and ambulance and police sirens constantly all night.

Contrary to what other reviews have said, I was able to walk leisurely down the Arno River to the main sights (the Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, etc.) in about 15 minutes. Thus, while it is not right next to the city centre, it was close enough for me, and the walk was very nice as I got to take in the sights and sounds of Florence. In addition, I did not find the neighborhood unsafe at all, even at night (and I went to college in South Central Los Angeles, so I know a bad neighborhood when I see it). I was lucky to stay in a triple occupancy room, so my review might be a bit different from others, but my room was spacious and comfortable. The bed I slept on gave me a great night's sleep as well. It was also quiet, which was very important for me as I am a light sleeper. While the bathroom was small, it was clean and good enough for me since I was out most of the day sightseeing. While this hotel is certainly not a luxurious hotel, it provided a very comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Feb 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR933155143", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "USCgirlie"}, {"Content": "Grand Hotel Mediterraneo Florence This is a clean and well presented hotel facing onto a nice view of the river.

This was reported within minutes of my arrival into my room but when leaving three days later it had still not been repaired. The buffet breakfast was fine and caters to all tastes. However, my wife and I had dinner here the first night. The quality of the food was no more than average and certainly what not I would have expected.
