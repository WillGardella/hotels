I requested a king bed instead of two queens and the very friendly front desk employee said they had reserved a king bed room for us.

That was a nice touch. I am not super picky with cleanliness of rooms. Basically if there's no mold or bugs, I'm happy. I was happy with the room. The bed was sufficiently comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet. I expected noise because the airport was so close but we weren't bothered by any noise in the room.
