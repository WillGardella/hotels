We stayed in a \"surf-pad\" which is a deal for such a generously-sized direct oceanfront room. It truly is a swanky place to stay -- nothing else like it in the San Diego area -- very sleek and minimalist decor, but elegant at the same time. We've been up and down the California coast and stayed at places that cost as much or more, but dollar for dollar, this is the best hotel. The hotel's restaurant, JRDN, was superb -- dined there twice and recommend eating outdoors by candlelight. The hotel staff was very professional and courteous. The only con is that the Pacific Beach area can at times be somewhat rowdy (but not unsafe). Will definitely stay there again when we visit San Diego and highly recommend to our friends and family!", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cRetro-class in Dan Diego\u201d", "Author": "WanderlustTour", "ReviewID": "UR129040074", "Content": "Very chic hotel in the Mission Bay area.

Upon arrival the Hotel provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne which was very thoughtful and it was a nice touch that they recognized our honeymoon celebrations with this gesture. The room was 212 a 'skypad', which overlooked the upper courtyard with a sea view. The room was very clean and very spacious. The highlight of the room was the large tempur bed, we have both never had as good a night sleep as we had throughout our stay here. The hotel location is fantastic, right on the beach and close by to local transport, restaurants and bars. The area is relaxed and chilled a perfect place for long walks up the beach and a good base to travel to the city centre and also nearby La Jolla (a tip that we learnt is to pay for an all day bus pass at $5.00 each, with this you can travel all day on the buses and the No 30 takes you straight into the city centre and also the opposite way to La Jolla, a taxi to the city costs approx $30.00 each way so a massive saving if you want to travel a lot during your stay. The bus stop is also very close to the hotel). The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us. We were travelling to San Francisco after here and the hotel staff (Alyson and Vinnie) pre-booked our Alcatraz tickets for us, which sell out fast. This level of guest service is excellent and we thank them for going this extra way to alleviate the requirement for us to book this so we could concentrate on enjoying our holiday. We loved our stay here and loved our stay in San Diego, the American people were very friendly, from waiters in diners to bus drivers to our hotel staff, we would definitely consider going back to San Diego in the future and if we did we would be staying here.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "woodside", "Title": "\u201cClean,Wholesome,Friendly.\u201d", "Author": "ellegirl727", "ReviewID": "UR128488549", "Content": "Hotel Tower 23 is newly built and its very clean.

It's located in Pacific Beach and either you will love the its edgy-funkiness (like Venice, California 20 years ago) or you will wonder what a sexy-cool hotel is doing in a neighborhood like this. If you have a large sense of entitlement, and seeing some grit and edge will just ruin your martini or G and T, do yourself a favor and stay in La Jolla just up the road. In PB, you are far more likely to score a tattoo than a designer boutique. That said, the hotel is a modern minimalist gem. All glass and white walls. A video loop of surfers plays endlessly on a small monitor the unpretentious lobby. The action here is in the Bar/Restaurant JRDN (pronounced a little surprisingly \"Jordan\", not \"jardin.\") Serving mostly very good food and a lively scene, it's particularly packed on weekends when the weather is good. The other great space is the Tower Deck on the second floor where white-towel covered lounge chairs surround something resembling a wading pool. I think it's six inches deep and I have never seen anyone so much as put their foot in there, so, hey, maybe it's just a water element or something. Nomenclature aside, it's a great place for a hang or a tan or to watch the joggers, surfers, runners and homeless people walk, run, or waddle by. The rooms are clean and uber-minimalist, almost sterile if it were not for the drop-dead views. I recently stayed in a Sanctuary Suite and loved the extra space and the jacuzzi tub looking out over the crashing waves of the Pacific. The bathroom also sports a small sink, a stand-alone shower and small slightly depressing room with a toilet. I am hoping it's fluorescent lighting is a green gesture and not a design choice. Yikes. Most if not all of the rooms have terraces on which you can see and/or hear the crashing of the Pacific. With \"art\" like that, who needs art in the rooms? This is not a place you come for white glove service, but the staff is young, attractive and happy to be helping you in any way they can. They try really hard, but sometimes you can really feel them trying and the strain shows. Bottom Line: This property is my first choice when I come to San Diego for any reason, business or pleasure. It's perfect for a romantic weekend, or whenever you want to get-away from it all. A recent four-day stay undid months of work/life stress. And if it worked for me, it might just work for you.

The staff at the front desk were friendly, helpful and prompt. We asked them for recommendations on several occassions and their advice was useful. The good: The beds/linens/pillows are very comfortable. Some rooms have direct access from the room to the terrace on the 2nd floor overlooking the beach and boardwalk. It's a great place to people watch, relax and read, or just share a drink while watching the waves. The location of the hotel is close to restaurants (Kronos is great for breakfast!), bike rentals, and the beach. We didn't need a rental car. The not-so-good (these are minor in my opinion): It's a popular spot for going out so the bar is always full--day & night. Fun if that's what you're looking for, but it can be loud and crowded. We were awakened on two nights by yelling and loud noises from the hall or the terrace. Probably not the fault of the hotel but if you're a light sleeper, you may go home tired. Neither the room nor the bathroom have much storage so if you like to unpack and put out your make up, hair products, etc. in the bathroom, you're going to have to improvise.

We arrived wearing sweatpants after traveling all day to be greeted by a valet asking \" are you here for dinner?\". I believe it was more than obvious we were there to stay. True, my husband and I are young ( 25 and 26) but i think it was assumed we were just local young party people rather than guest paying 1100+ for a 3 night stay. We then arrived to our room. Absolutely wonderful view however furniture appears very Ikea like and the shower ran water all over the floor. Bed was very comfortable however and room was kept very clean. We did receive one bottle of Champagne complimentary for our anniversary and a second was sent Up by family with roses for my birthday which was very nice. However, after receiving these 2 bottles of Champagne and a 3rd to the room for NYE, we were carded by 3 different people before being allowed to be seated at our dinner reservation! The same people that had checked Us in and sent up champagne made my husband walk back up to our room to get my ID, then issued us a wristband. Even with the wristband now in place , a bouncer then came to ask us again for identification. Finally , the hostess seating us asked if we had our wristbands and if we were of age. I understand there are rules/ laws However there is a point where it is just rude. Finally, we were in and out of the hotel multiple times over our stay and other than check im and check out never received so much as a \"hello\" from the front desk staff standing right beside the elevator. From other experience, I would say friendly and respectful greeting and treatment of guests is something that helps to make a place a \"luxury lifestyle\" hotel.

The air-conditioner must be goverened during the night, as it does not cool as much (and we like it cold when sleeping). There is no coffee pot in the room.

Long story short - she has a form of neuropathy that makes it impossible to sleep on a bad mattress. Trying to find a better hotel bed in Seattle eventually led to the discovery of a list of hotels in the US that offer Tempurpedic memory foam mattresses. This list led to our discovery of Tower 23 in Pacific Beach, or 'PB' as it's known by the locals. Our first visit to this little boutique hotel was in February 2011. It was a short visit, but the impression it left on us convinced us to come back for another, longer visit in September 2011. Let me state right up front, this hotel is not for everyone. It doesn't have a pool - this will turn some people off right away. We didn't care. We didn't come to San Diego to swim in a hotel pool. I've read other reviews on this hotel and noticed a few complaints about the homeless folks who pass by on the beachfront walkway. Pacific Beach has homeless people. You just can't get around that fact. We didn't find it intrusive or offensive in any way. They did not camp out near our hotel. On to what we liked. The bed, of course. If only every hotel had quality, memory foam mattresses, our trip planning would be so much easier and offer so many other choices. A definite win for Tower 23. The restaurant (JRDN) is great. Depending on the time of year, you can get breakfast there, but lunch and dinner are year-round and of high quality. One thing to be aware of when booking a room is that about half of the beach-facing rooms are directly over the restaurant / bar area. The restaurant has an outdoor patio as well and this place can get noisy when it's crowded. Weekend nights are worst. From our room on the third floor at the south end of the hotel, it wasn't too bad. We got a beach-front room and loved it. Being lulled to sleep by the sound of the surf is my idea of heaven. The bathroom is modern and well appointed. Nice big shower and a wonderful tub. The water runs into the tub from the ceiling, which is a little disconcerting at first, but it's OK. Just don't stand next to the tub for the first minute, or you'll get splashed. But it is a great tub. The rain shower is a nice touch. Tower 23 may not have a pool, but they do have a nice Sky Deck, a second floor outdoor deck overlooking the beach with lounge chairs and sofas and a fireplace for night-time. It's a popular spot and is often full of sunbathers in the afternoon. If you have a car, you may as well splurge on the $20 per day valet parking. Taking a chance to find parking on the street is taking a big risk, as the neighbourhood is very popular and I found it almost impossible to find parking near the hotel. It's just easier with the valet. I particularly love the location of the hotel, because you're right on the ocean, minutes from trendy La Jolla, a short drive from Fashion Valley Mall and easy access to the freeways that get you all around the San Diego area and up the coast to towns like Encinitas and Del Mar. We saved some money not renting a car at the airport and getting one in PB. So we're very glad we found this hotel.

The design of the overall hotel is pretty cool, a glass box over looking the ocean. Our room however was a big eh. I did not see the other rooms but based on the lowest priced room they're not really worth the price they are asking. The room itself is fine with a nice little balcony...unfortunately the balcony faces other people's rooms. They call it a courtyard view...but in actuality it's more like a voyeurs view. Our room abutted up another's balcony....enough so that their cigar smoke came into our room. Noise travels as well. If you craned your neck out the window you could see the ocean. The service, while friendly, was a little lax. When we arrived to check in (after a long flight) there was a gentlemen in front of us asking silly questions for what seemed like forever. There was only one person at the front desk, and instead of calling for help or answering questions while checking us in...we waited 10 minutes to check in. Clearly there should be a concierge person and a check in person...not just one person. We also returned home to find the valet parking closed at 10pm on saturday night. The gate was down. We came down to hang out on the deck in the afternoon, only to find no cushions or anywhere to sit. We had to run around to the front desk and get security to come open it. That's a little strange. All of these little glitches are understandable but at the price they were charging should not have happened. This is clearly a smallish design hotel but that doesn't mean they have to be small on service. That being said, the sunsets from this location are absolutely stunning. All in all I wouldn't discount a stay at the Tower23 but I can't say it's worth it for the cheapest room. If you want to stay at the beach then pony up the cash for the direct ocean view rooms.

It was quiet with no noise from the rooms on either side. The restaurant was perfect. We had lunch one day and breakfast the next, both enjoyed at an outside table looking at the surfers and waves. The prices were extremely reasonable and the food very good. The service there was also a 10. My partner and I are very picky when we travel, and we travel a lot and prefer to stay in 5 star hotels.

The hotel is a modern boutique style. Perfect for a couples get away. We had a partial view on the North side 2nd floor which gave us a view of people on the boardwalk and the sunsets over the ocean. Both very entertaining. We were in the room no more than 20 minutes when a knock on the door came. A plate of wonderful brownies with rasberries and a happy birthday card was delivered by John (also smiling!) as a gift from the hotel. The restaurant also provided creme brulee as a birthday gift and tasty treat at the end of our meal. Try a sampling of the oysters... they are great, as are the scallops. In the mornings, you coffee/tea drinkers will love the Keurig in the lobby. We also recommend running just next door to Kona's for breakfast, but be sure to eat it on their \"hidden\" deck right above the beach. Even though we did the running to the zoo and sea world, it was great to come back to Tower23 early each day. There is no having to walk to get to the beach -- you're on it! The valet service is quick and friendly. Jeremiah, at the front desk always so it seemed, is a great resource and help. We didn't use this, but I heard him helping another couple with bike rentals.

There is a comfy chaise lounger in the room that is very comfy to lounge on. The bed is like sleeping in a cloud with lots of pillows and a comforter. The AC works well and the shower has good pressure and is roomy. The view was beautiful, and the hotel is literally right on the boardwalk. We ate at the hotel restaurant which was amazing. The food was great, and we ate outside where the temperature was perfect, and the view was fantastic with lots of people and pet watching. They have valet parking and a garage. On our return stay we had a room without the ocean view, but it was just as nice. The only differences were instead of a shower stall we had a shower/tub combo and the view. Now the view was not of the ocean but it was interesting. Our room had sliding glass doors that looked right out onto the hotel's patio. It was a little disconcerting to have people right there while we were in our room. I think the windows were probably tinted and once the sun went down we closed the curtains so it wasn't a problem, it was just odd. The night of our second stay we walked down the boardwalk to World Famous. The food was really good, and we got to see the Fire Lane guys put on their fire juggling show as we were leaving.

I was looking for a luxury, upscale hotel that was on the beach, yet close to late-opening bars and night life. It was quite hard to find this. A lot of the resorts are either on the bay or miles from anything. Tower 23 is a modern, small and recently refurbished hotel in a prime location. It's right on Pacific Beach and has wonderful views from its terrace and bar/restaurant. It's a short walk away from a whole host of bars and restaurants in the casual Pacific Beach neighborhood. A cab to the classier Gaslamp district was $35 (in general I felt the taxis were very expensive in San Diego). The staff were mostly all excellent and tried hard to help us have a good stay. On the first night, the hotel manager made an exception to hotel policy by turning on the fire-pit on the roof for us. It was appreciated and he didn't have to do that. Another staff member brought blankets out for us. The drinks service on the terrace was also good. The hotel's bar and restaurant is excellent. It has great views of the ocean, very good quality brunch and the ambiance is perfect. I noticed a lot of locals go there for special occasions - birthday parties or weekend nights out. I booked the Sanctuary Suite at the hotel. This room was first rate. It was spacious and modern with a wet bar and comfortable bed. The signature feature, however, was the giant spa bathtub with a tap in the ceiling that fills it. Colored lights and powerful jacuzzi jets also make for a relaxing soak. DOWN SIDE: My hotel suite was very expensive and for the money I have experienced far more. It's basically a Peninsula or Four Seasons rate without a resort that even comes close to those type of hotels. Tower 23 is nice and well run -- but it doesn't have the scale or world class service of a true luxury hotel. It's more of a well put-together local hotel with a modern edge. Aside from the expensive price, my only other disappointments were: -No hotel pool - surprising! -They couldn't give us a late check out, and the normal check out time is a rather early 11am Otherwise, a great, relaxing and enjoyable experience.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Beachfront Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "mwd05", "ReviewID": "UR90956178", "Content": "My husband and I recently spoiled ourselves with a night at Tower 23.

Tower 23 touts itself as a four star - following our stay at the Four Seasons, I can assure you it is not. This hotel is an old Best Western with a fresh coat of paint and very poor service. The staff at this hotel made us feel like unwanted house guests. We were greeted by an apathetic valet that needed to be coaxed to remove our luggage from the trunk. The front desk people were nice enough but had no local info to offer us and never followed up when we asked. We asked for help getting a cab and the front desk wasn't able to accomplish this. After waiting 25 minutes, we had to go in, ask again, and make sure the front desk staff picked up the phone and actually dialed this time. There is no pool and the room amenities are low to none (no lotion at all.) The room was small and mediocre; the bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were rough. To top it off, we were kept up all night by the nightclub below us. Our complaints and request to check out later that night were answered with a \"sorry, you booked here for three days, you can't check out.\" (WHAT?!) Never once was there any question as to why weren't happy or if there was anything the staff could do to improve our stay through the night. When we confronted the manager early the next morning and asked to be absolved of our three night check-in, we were told that, \"The hotel is not for everyone and you are free to leave.\" We were prepared to list a number of reasons for our dissatisfaction, but we were never asked. There was no inquiry as to why we were displeased, any apology about our experience, or remorse at losing business. Defining yourself as a trendy, boutique hotel does not mean that you make your guests feel like an unwanted outsider... This hotel is a complete waste of time and money. We took off as soon as we could to the W downtown. My husband and I no longer speak of our 12-hour stay at Tower 23 - it was a dark time for us and we've tried to block it from our memory.

We ate 2 dinners at the hotel and the food was out of this world. RYAN & Jessie were a great help with our heater situation the second evening we ate at the hotel. The first evening, the waiter was less than concerned that I was cold. .. don't remember his name. We met Ryan the first evening meal and snagged him for help our second evening meal because he had been so nice to us the first evening. They could use a few more \"portable\" heaters on coolish evenings. The service was excellent both evening meals, except that the first evening I think they were a bit short of staff and the service was a little disjointed. The second evening more than made up for any deficiencies the first evening meal. Parking and hotel access was very easy. They could use a porter to help with luggage, but the management did provide assistance. We were a little confused whether we should have tipped the management for luggage assistance or not. We had previously read that sleeping at this hotel was difficult from the noise level. We didn't hear anything after we shut the arcadia doors. Our room was stone silent at night. I'm not a good sleeper, but my husband and I slept like \"the dead\" at this hotel. The beds & linens are just scrumptuous (sp?).

We were there mid January, and the boardwalk between the beach and the hotel was not too busy until Sunday when the locals turned out for \"Sunday-Funday\".

We split our time between T23 and the Loews in Coronado. I was hesitant to stay at the hotel because there was no pool , however I liked that it was right on the beach. I think my husband was a little shocked when we pulled in since the hotel is literally in the back of a parking lot. After checking in we were told that there would be a party out in the deck area. What the front desk failed to mention was that the \"small party\" was basically an open party to all of pacific beach. So after a long flight from NY we couldn\u2019t even relax on our balcony because there was essentially a wet t-shirt contest going on below us. Needless to say not the kind of thing you expect from a hotel that charges upwards of $250 a night. We kindly asked the front desk to move us just for the night to an ocean front room. This way we could at least relax without having to deal with the blaring music, since our room overlooked the deck area. They told us of course we would be able to do it for another $80 a night. That really set me off because they should put the comfort of their guest first., as the money wasnt the issue for us. When the party finally ended after 6, we went back up the deck area which was by now a mess and it seemed that all of the other hotel guest began emerging from their rooms also. Our next few days at T23 weren't as bad, they sent us up some free champange which was a nice effort. The food at JRDN is very good and, the view from the deck of the beach is A+. The server on the deck Drew was great and extremely attentive, he was as attentive as I thought the rest of the staff at T23 should have been. The hotel is close to La Jolla which is nice if you want a change of scenery. My last complaint about T23 is that on our last day there was a foul mouthed hotel employee who was getting wasted with one of her friends on the deck . Apparently it was her day off and she was using her discount ... I wasn\u2019t listening to her conversation she was just that loud that I couldn\u2019t help but overhear.

We could not believe that a hotel with this price tag did not even have shower units, just an over bath shower with a pull around curtain! The room was clean, however furniture looked old and delapidated, not fitting in with there \"chic, modern\" style it was trying to achieve. On first checking into our room we found that our \"partial sea view\" in fact meant looking onto the roadside. Unhappy with this we called down to switch rooms, they offered us another Sky suite (which is what we booked) or an upgrade to a Surf pad, for the EXTRA COST of $40 a night. We swtiched to the other sky suite not wanting to waste more money on our stay, which looked onto the patio deck, which looked onto the sea.

We slept at night with the windows open listening to crashing waves all night. Heavenly! Don't know what kind of bed it was (should have checked) but it and linens just perfect. Seldom when travelling do I feel at home as much as I did in their bed. The scallops served in the hotel's signature restaurant JRDN are amongst the best I've ever had. The room service breakfast equally wonderful. I might suggest doing what it takes to get a room with the ocean view. The interior rooms without just didn't appear anywhere nearly as compelling. The location of the hotel is perfect too. Literally just a few steps to the beach. The hotel is right in the middle of the action too. Just behind it is a supermarket for mixes, wine, whatever.

Valet parking quick and courteous. Check in informed and efficient. We had a package affair with my name personalized onto each appropriate voucher. Nice touch. As it is a popular night spot as well if you want to take advantage of sleeping with balcony doors open I'd also recommend requesting a room on the beach south end of building as the noisier action below is at the north end of the hotel building.

Tower23 is literally beachfront property; the view from your room is the Pacific Ocean, the pier, and the boardwalk. San Diego is captured right from your window or deck. The architecture is a new, modern, and gorgeous building. The rooms are crisp, clean, spacious, and soothing. The beds and linens are so exceptional that many of our guests jumped online to try to purchase the same mattresses and linens for their homes. You can literally melt into the beds for hours. The decks have a clean uninterrupted view of the water, full of lounge chairs, a fire ring, and wading pool and waterfall next to you. It is so spa like and tranquil there, a true vacation. Sure there is La Jolla, and Coronado Island, but really I feel like Pacific Beach gives a much more authentic San Diego experience to travelers. The swimming (and surfing) portion of the beach is directly in front of Tower23, and the hotel in \u00bd block from Garnet Avenue, which is the best street to hit for restaurants, bars, retail shops, and an authentic beach community. The food at the JRDN (Tower23\u2019s attached restaurant) is awesome, we had the sushi, calamari, steak and fries, and the goat cheese dip, our table was very pleased, we loved everything. Oh, and the drinks, the cocktails are so good, make sure to indulge at least one night on your stay! I want to also make note that the staff at Tower23 was amazing. Erin Brady helped us, kept us updated, reassured me as \u201cthe day\u201d approached, and accommodated even our most last-minute guests every step of the way. She was available anytime we needed her. The staff at the front desk accommodated many very unusual last minute needs or ours, and were always very willing to help in any way that they could. Just days before our wedding day we ran into a problem with our hired caterer for our reception at Crystal pier, my mom scrambled last minute to find a back up venue and caterer in case issues worsened, and sure enough Erin was there, ready and willing to help if we needed her. She was the only piece of mind that we had at that point. We had all of our guests come up to us at one time or another to tell us how friendly and helpful the staff at Tower23 was. And again everyone ranted and raved about how clean, beautiful, and comfortable the rooms were. My new husband\u2019s exact words are, \u201c we will never stay anywhere else.\u201d Thank you Tower23, we cannot wait to come back and visit you.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york,ny", "Title": "\u201cthe beach house\u201d", "Author": "NYonline", "ReviewID": "UR13767425", "Content": "i am staying at Tower23 every time i visit San Diego (about every 2-3 month).the hotel provides this certain \"summer in California\" vibe,regardless of the time you visit it. the place combines impeccable style,proper degree of luxury and comfort and friendly service all in the same package.the food at JRDN is well adiusted for modern day call of \"light and healthy\".views can be graded from interesting to exciting,depending on the room{i think i pretty much covered the whole variety by now}.the location is defenitely a huge bonus,since the hotel is equally close to amasing beach towns of LaJolla,Del Mar,Solana Beach and,of course,San Diego proper,not to mention it is sitting right on the nicest stretches in the area, with all the regalia applied{breeze, Pier,boardwalk...).the maintenance is truly beyond excellent and they really know to make you feel at home right from the first visit.

The restaurant took very good care of our group and the food and drink was very good. We sat outside and, by adjusting our seats, there was just the right combination of radiant heat and fresh air to suit everyone. This hotel is probably the best hotel in Pacific Beach (certainly not in San Diego), but there were several small things that a hotel in this price range should do better. We had a \"surf\" room that meant the room overlooked the Pacific Ocean. Although the San Diego area isn't overly warm in mid-December, our room was too warm even with the heat control turned all the way down. The central system apparently didn't allow for cooling at this time of year. So our only choice for sleeping was to open the large sliding doors and curtains. This arrangement won't suit those who don't like the sounds of the surf, and the Saturday night boardwalk scene, to drift in. Since our doors were open, unfortunately, our peaceful Sunday morning sleep-in was marred by the sound of passing skateboards on the concrete sidewalk outside. Others in our group had \"surf\" rooms also, but with the added feature of overlooking the second floor outdoor social/firepit area. At least one of these rooms was too warm also but opening the large sliding door allowed in too much of the noise from the crowd outside until the bar/restaurant closed. Our room was clean and modern, if a little spare. The only chair was the straight-back chair for the desk. The shower drain was clogged so much that we had to stagger our showers to give the water time to drain. The lamp over the smallish wash basin hung down directly in front of the narrow mirror so that anyone over about five and half feet tall needed to look to one side or the other to use the mirror. The separate bathtub's water supply entered directly out of a chrome fixture (basically a plate with a hole in it) in the CEILING. (Alternate guess: someone had removed the shower head that might have been there originally). As you might imagine, water falling from the ceiling into an empty tub splashed out onto the floor until the tub acquired an inch or two of water. I've included a picture of the tub's water outlet in the ceiling with the water running. This is a personal preference, but in mid-December we found only an arrangement of red amaryllis in the lobby that might be called a Christmas decoration. Nothing more was in evidence. Overall the Tower23 Hotel is a very nice place.

We get away about 5-6 times per year and all we look for is to truly get what we pay for. We want cleanliness and we aren't into the \"tourist\" stuff that others seek. We both have very demanding jobs and just like to get away to get away from the rat race and do \"nothing\" for the week. Our trip started in L.A. as we wanted to take in two hockey games there (tickets at home are just impossible to get). Our plan was to leave right after those two games and then get down to the San Diego area to watch the waves crash on the shore from our oceanview room and spend some quality time together. When we arrived at the Tower 23, the experience could have taken a horrible turn. The original check-in was done by a male (who shall remain nameless for now) who really obviously couldn't have cared less and who really shouldn't be part of the Tower 23 team!!! He lied to us and tried to give us a room just immediately over the bar/restaurant although we specifically asked what was below us. He advised \"a room\" and fluffed us off and sent us on our way asap! We were extremely early and there was really no reason why he couldn't just put us in a quiet room right off the bat. He told us he could only do it if we agreed to switch rooms during our stay and this was not something we were about to do for the price we were paying. After returning from a nice long walk (rooms are guaranteed by 4pm), we saw that the front desk person had changed and thankfully, we approached Nancy. She immediately took charge of the situation. Having told her that we were looking for quiet time and would be spending a lot of time \"in\" or on the balcony, she quickly changed us to an amazing room on the top floor...just what we had paid for! From that point on, the visit was flawless!!! The rooms are very clean, the amenities are lovely and there are housecoats and lovely linen and towels for guest use. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant downstairs, it looked to be quite well attended by all. There is an amazing rooftop lounging area off the 2nd floor which overlooks the ocean. We saw many people there who spent the entire day and early evening (when they light the firepit and heat lamps) just relaxing and taking in the view. Quite simply, we tried to do what the locals do and ate where locals eat and often picked up and brought the food back to the room so we could eat on the balcony, sip nice wine and listen to the wonderful ambient sounds on the room music player. During the day , we walked down the boardwalk and took in 2 hr strolls. We went out for a couple of \"nice\" meals but Toronto is such a cosmopolitan city that there was really little we could get there that we couldn't get at home. That wasn't the purpose of the trip. This spot is amazing. You can blend in or rent a car and go into the city. We did both and had an incredible time. Once again, cudos to Nancy at the front desk for being so professional from the time we arrived to the time when we checked out!!!

We couldn't have picked a hotel that was more hip and fun than T23! We reserved a \"Surf Pad\" room that had a gorgeous view of the ocean and boardwalk. The evenings were cool the first weekend in December, but we still sat out on the balcony and enjoyed a glass of wine and watched the sun set over the Pacific. The staff was very helpful, even assisting us in renting some bicycles early one morning before most of the shops had opened. We made an advance reservation for dinner the first night of our stay, and enjoyed the food and lively ambiance of \"Jordan\" - in addition to the wonderful food. The only catch I can see is that the room has very lively acoustics, and the table next to us had 8 guests who were having a very good time (maybe more than a little tipsy) and it was VERY loud until they left. If you are looking for a fun place to share dinner and drinks with friends, I'm sure you will love it. If you are a family with small children - maybe not so much. I also would not consider our dining experience intimate and romantic - at least until the loud table got up and left! To the credit of the wait staff, they seated us in the back corner of the restaraunt next to the window looking out onto the ocean, and after the other party left we had a wonderful dinner. All in all, the Tower 23 hotel is a gem. Our room had an Xbox game system, plasma TV, a very cool radio with an Ipod dock which was playing a digital loop of some very hip mood music when we entered our room for the first time. The room is very modern-looking, white bedlinens (down or synthetic down comforter in a duvet); super comfy bed, big tile shower with glass doors (no tub) very modern and stylish feel to the room, and the entire hotel. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of Pacific Beach - there are lots of places along the boardwalk and nearby - cafes, bars, shops and so forth.

I had a rental car which costs $20 per nite to park at the property. The rates per nite are pricey so I was expecting an experience consistent with such a rate. I arrived at about 2:30 PM after two long flights ; i travel a great deal and this was the end of a busy travel season . It was a Saturday afternoon and the front desk person indicated that the room was not ready and that they guarantee the room for 4 PM. This is approaching the late side for check in as most hotels are for 3 PM check-in. She asked for my cell phone and said she would call me when the room was ready. She did not do this and I returned after 3:15 PM and asked about my room and another gentleman indicated that my room was ready. While waiting, I saw that there was a wedding party readying for a ceremony /reception apparently at a different venue; but people were milling about by the small courtyard looking out over the beach. When I returned from a dinner meeting at 11 PM , the wedding revelers were now congregated outside my bedroom on the courtyard having drinks and making huge noise which continued until nearly 2 AM despite several calls to the front desk. This is a charming , small property and simply is not designed for such a real time celebration at the expense of guests' sleep. The nite manager was thoroughly inept and the daytime manager with whom I reviewed the matter was very gracious and abated one nite's charge by 50%. But the experience fouled my sense of the place. The bar is hopping and I enjoyed being out for drinks with colleagues on one nite. The restaurant is simply outstanding with beautifully prepared food and staff who are professional across all domains. Rivalled any restaurant experience in great dining places around the country. But the management has to decide whether this is an upscale boutique hotel or whether it is a function hall . The manager made a decision to sell drinks through the nite on the private courtyard the remnants of which I captured on my cell phone camera in the early AM and to ruin the experience of others versus asking the party to move to the very large bar at the other end of the hotel.It was a bad decision on the manager's part and which he never addressed.

When I had a very rowdy crowd keeping me awake next door, the hotel clerk and the security guard came to the offender's door and took care of the problem right away. The restaurant is excellent, particularly for breakfast and lunch. My only complaint is that they should ban cell phones in the restaurant. I do not need to hear people's personal business while I sit with my morning paper and cup of tea. The location is great, too. Also, the weather is perfect in August.

We couldn't do another trip until about 9 months later, and actually, we weren't sure we wanted to go back, even for free. But we did and man, have they improved. Both visits we stayed at the sweet suite...and it is. The best beach view, wonderful bed and the coolest bathtub. Everything was really clean, and that's important, I hate dirty hotels, especially the bathroom. The Jordan restaurant is directly under the balcony, makes for good people watching but does get a bid loud at night. We were traveling with two very young kids so we were in our rooms by around 8:00 every night, so the noise was a little annoying, but really not that bad. Jordan really fills up at night, looked like fun. The food there is great, try the filet, yum. Being so close to the beach was great, I highly recommend the Tower. If staying there try the sweet suite. If not that room be sure to get one with a beach view, they are limited. Some of the views/patios are in a common area, I personally wouldn't like that, people can stare right into your room. Overall, love the place.

The view from our Surf Pad room was gorgeous. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I loved the modern look. However, it was sometimes a case of form over function. The bath shower was somewhat broken when we arrived and the handle on the shower came off. The toilet paper holder was angling toward the ground so the roll wanted to slide off. Nothing was wrong that an allen wrench couldn't fix and when I reported the issues they fixed them promptly. Well, all but the toilet paper roll holder as I didn't report that. I really wanted the shower working properly and didn't want to confuse the issue. The lighting looked nice but it really wasn't bright enough to do makeup. I think all the minimal hard surfaces also allowed sound to travel as we could hear the neighboring rooms more than I would have expected. The Tower bar was ultra cool and there was a long line to get into the restaurant bar downstairs on the weekend nights. We only had breakfast in the restaurant and it was another ultra cool spot. I had to laugh when the waters came with mangled chucks of lemon hanging to the side. All that look and they cannot slice a lemon. I suppose it is more likely that mangled lemon is the new new thing and I am just behind. The staff was amusing. It was like watching kids play dress up.

I needn't have worried -- it was up there with the best hotels at which I've ever stayed, and most certainly was the coolest of them all. The TOWER23 hotel is an anomaly, an ultramodern hotel set in a bit of a funky beach town (the Pacific Beach area of San Diego). There's nothing nearby that's like it -- accomodations in the area range from mid-range condominiums to dilapidated cottages set on a pier. But the setting doesn't detract from the TOWER23, and in fact seems to bring it into sharper relief. I had an oceanfront room, a \"Surf Pad,\" which was delightful. The bathroom was stylish, the shower large and equipped with a rain-style head. The bed was one of the two or three most comfortable I've ever slept on. The flat panel TV was great, and I used the Xbox to play DVDs that I had brought with me (you can borrow movies from the front desk, or there's a Blockbuster next door). The room had both wired and wireless connections to the hotel's free Internet service. But the star of the room was the view -- a third-story, top-floor view of the boardwalk, the beach, and the ocean. Sunsets were absolutely spectacular. The TOWER23 has its own ocean-view restaurant, JRDN. I had excellent sushi rolls there on two occasions, and my companion and I both thought that the breakfast we had was one of the best we could remember, and reasonably priced. At night, JRDN becomes a very hip club, and we took advantage of this almost every evening during our stay. Bring stylish clothes! The hotel has a second-floor deck with comfortable seating and a fire pit, the modern style with flames dancing over sand. We spent some very pleasant evenings there drinking cocktails brought up from the club below. I wouldn't recommend the TOWER23 for people who want a very quiet hotel. Although the rooms are soundproofed quite well, once JRDN becomes a club at night, it becomes fairly loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. This wasn't an issue for us, as we were making use of it, but I can see some people having problems with it. Nor would I recommend the hotel for people with small children -- the beach is really the only place for them to run around, as there's no pool or playspace of any kind -- it's just not that kind of hotel. To travelers looking for a beachfront hotel, a trendy place to stay, or a hotel where one can party into the wee hours, I can't recommend the TOWER23 highly enough. It's less expensive than many of the dull mega-hotels in the city, but with better rooms and polite, boutique-style service.
