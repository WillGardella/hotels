Such a lovely boutique hotel with very pretty, comfortable rooms. My husband was on business and joined my 18 yo son and me for pleasure after work. The Concierge, Patrick, is a GEM of a person and resource. Always smiling and eager to help, Patrick found us amazing, HOT NEW restaurants to enjoy with our 18 yo son. Naomi, at the front desk is equally kind and helpful. There's a lovely breakfast each morning in a beautiful, quaint sitting room, where you may choose off the sumptuous buffet or from the menu. Everyone is so eager to help with a happy attitude. Lovely rooms for great rest and modern TVs. To find taxi's, either they will be phoned and appear within moments or you may walk down the block to Champs Elysee where taxis and Metro are right there. We loved this location for walking, Laduree and high end shops nearby, not to mention the beauty of L'Arc de Triomphe so close you may touch it. Spectacular at night. The hotel has wireless internet and the only reasons I did not give the Hotel an \"Excellent\" are: 1. the room internet did not work for 4 days (though the lobby & hallway wireless did work.) & 2. the evening we wanted dinner room service, only had 3 poor choices -- disappointing after an exhausting day. We absolutely will be returning to Hotel Balzac. Our trip was absolutely a joy in a large part to the great, relaxing accommodations and staff.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cTop Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MarsbarUk", "ReviewID": "UR126535588", "Content": "Stayed her with my husband recently and booked via Eurostar package. I had read previous reviews on this site and based my decision on those. The hotel is situated at the top of the Champs elysee very near to the Metro (Charles De Gaule) it took around 20 mins from the Eurostar (Gar Du Nord) and one metro change. We found the metro really easy to use very much like the London Underground. Ticket machines were available at the station, we got 10 at a time which was a little cheaper, I found out later that you can buy them on the Eurostar which would have saved us queuing time. 5 mins walk to the hotel it is situated up a side street and very quiet compared to the bustle of the main road, the reception is beautiful, very ornate decoration. There are plenty of staff about and our check in was quick and efficient, most of the staff speak good English. we booked a de-luxe room whichi had a huge bed, lovely bathroom with walk in shower (if you want a bath you must request when booking) TV channels etc were available but other than Sky news etc they were chargeable, we also paid 17e for Internet access for 4 days. Room service was avaliable but not sure who would pay those prices! It seemed a quiet hotel on the whole I think we were the only English people there, quite a few Americans though that was generally the case in Paris. We found all the staff to be extremely helpful especially the Conceigere Patrick who made all our dinner reservations and helped with directions, he was a mine of information and definitely is an asset to this hotel. Very easy to get around the main tourists attraction from here, we did a boat trip on the Bateaux Mouch to orientate ourselves which was a good idea this was only about 10/15 mins walk away. Couple of things I wish I had know before we went....eating out, tables can be a lot closer together than we are used to, a lot of restuarants close on Sunday/Monday although there are many Bistros open. Book your Effiel Tower tickets beforehand as the queus are huge, we gave up but when it is lit up at night it looks amazing so worth going down just to appreciate the shear size of it. Lots of buskers on the metro which was very entertaining. We ate at Chez Andre the first night, great atmosphere, friendly staff. best meal was L'Affriole (see my review) amazing food and value still can't quite believe what we paid! As part of our deal breakfast was included, it was lovely with loads of choice, fresh cheese,meats, pastries etc...although I see it would have cost 29e if we had paid so if you can get it included it's a good deal. In summary I would highly reccommend this lovely hotel to any couple looking for a bit of luxury in a quiet hotel but centrally located.

Lovely staff !

So, of course I referred to Tripadvisor, where Hotel Balzac was at or near the top of the league of fellow Tripadvisor's member's recommendations for hotels in Paris ! Nevertheless, it was with mild apprehension that we arrived at the hotel, having read the virtually guaranteed, occasional poor review of any widely visited hotel. Well, no complaints from us ! As we pulled up in the taxi, a porter was there immediately to help with the luggage.Close to the red carpeted exterior steps up to the entrance, there was even a lift to enable people experiencing mobility difficulties up to said entrance. Once inside, what struck me was the plushness of the decor and the availability of staff who were polite, pleasant and efficient, with English widely spoken.The porter and bar staff were helpful and fun, as were the concierge staff, with the reception staff being efficient and friendly. The bedroom was the real highlight though. Our room on the fourth floor had a great view of the Eiffel Tower; also because it was on a quiet street, the French Windows could be kept open by day OR night without significant noise or disturbance. The bed was large and comfortable, and the bathroom incorporated a bath-tub, high quality toiletries, and even a combined loo and bidet, complete with permanently heated seat ! The room was also spacious, decorated in a sophisticated and thoughtful manner, so that even the excellently placed, and large high quality television, was unobtrusive when not in use. There was also room service available 24 hours a day.A special thanks then to the room servicing/cleaning staff, who made the room attractive and spotlessly clean for us ! By the way, I had requested, on the hotel's website ,a room that was as peaceful as possible, with as good views as possible. That's exactly what we got ! The lounge bar was lavishly appointed with a magnificently draped set of curtains concealing a small dining area beyond where breakfast and a room service style daytime menu could be enjoyed. The lounge had a glass roof with the internal facing rooms therefore having an opportunity to people-spot those down below ! Another noticeable feature was the efficiency and timing of the service provided by the staff. The room service breakfast arrived bang-on our requested time, as did the taxi that the reception booked to take us back to Gare du Nord station. The staff also told us that the hotel was a \"four and a half star\" rating, and they were waiting for news on whether or not they would soon achieve a 5 star rating. Good luck in that quest ! A great hotel with the lovely staff contributing towards a memorable stay.

The room had a view onto the central void of the hotel (2nd floor) which let in plenty of natural light. The bed was more like a single and a half (two could sleep in it, but you'd want to be on good terms!) and there was a compact, but well appointed shower room/toilet. The main room had plenty of space, including a desk you could sit at in a chair (not on the bed like some!) and there was a small anteroom with the wardrobe in. The general decor of the hotel was traditional, but light and of high quality. The whole feel of the Balzac, from the entrance to the rooms was of quiet luxury. The breakfasts were good and the serving staff friendly (I found the reception staff a little frosty, though). I'm not sure my company would choose such an expensive hotel for me again, but I'd happily stay at the Balzac anytime and if you want a centrally located hotel you can't go wrong as it's literally a stone's throw from the Champs Elysee.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Amanda T", "ReviewID": "UR118743920", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Balzac for 4 nights during our visit to Paris in September.

Even though this was my 8th trip to Paris and know the city quite well I wanted a hotel in this part of Paris for a number of reasons. The location was great. And even though it's only one block from the Champs Elysee it was very quiet. You would never know you were in the middle of this busy city. And the hop on and off bus was just a block away as well. We had a deluxe room, and it looked just like the picture on the hotel web site. We found the hotel to be spotlessly clean, and the staff eager to assist whenever we needed them. And whilte we didn't have a view to speak of, as our room over looked the interior courtyard it was pleasant and nothing to complain about. We also found the breakfast, which was included in our room rate to be more than adequate. Some have complained that it was the same every day. But the offerings were many and with eggs cooked to order along with the buffett we enjoyed our breakfast in the well appointed and comfortable room. This is not a large hotel, but that's not what we wanted. It was totally Parisien - and lacking for nothing at all. Right outside the front door is a row of the bicycles that can be rented with a credit card. So you can just pick a bike and go. And while this is an upscale area, the Publix market just a block away on the Champs Elysee was great for quick and delicious food. There were many places to eat at reasonable prices all around the area. We didn't have dinner at the Italian restaurant on-site. The only thing that I found odd, was at night the bed wasn't turned down, but made up with the sheets tucked tightly underneath the mattress. Not a big deal.

Staff was very helpful and friendly. We stayed in a Deluxe suite with a view of the Eiffel Tower....stunning. The view from our small terrace was romantic and well worth the extra money per night. The room and bathroom were both spacious and well-equipt (bathroom had an awesome toilet seat cover with built-in bidet!). There were macaroons and water waiting for us upon our arrival in the room. We ordered room service twice and received quick service. Breakfast was not included with the price of the room and we were quite disappointed at how expensive it was- 28 euro for a continental breakfast and 38 euro for an \"American\" breakfast. Now, I know that we Americans have a bad rap for eating a lot but who could eat 38 euros worth of breakfast??? Overall great place to stay. Very well situated to many \"attractions\". Food overpriced even for hotel standards. I suppose this is typical for Paris. Lastly, the only odd thing that happened was that on the last morning that we were there, I went to take a shower and reached for my face scrub and found a used bottle of French brand shampoo (specifically for oily hair) in our shower...weird.

Our room had an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower, which was even better at night when the lights flashed every hour. We were enthralled our first night there watching this beautiful sight.

It was such a pleasant little extra to have the hotel recognize our special celebration in Paris. The bathroom was elegantly decorated with marble and one of the most upscale bidet/toilets we've ever seen in our travels. And I absolutely loved the drape over our bed that included a crown accent. We definitely felt like royalty! Daily breakfast was included with our room, but we were a little disappointed that it was the same choice every day.

As is customary when arriving from the U.S., we appeared at the hotel just before 11 a.m. and were happy to learn that our accommodations were available and that we had indeed been upgraded to a Junior Suite which was a generous size even by European standards. A tip from our Air France flight attendant that we followed - we took the AirFrance bus from CDG to the L'Etoille stop at Arc de Triomphe and walked the few blocks to the hotel. Cost was 15 euros each and it was fun to walk down the Champs Elysees. An immediate confirmation that we had arrived in Paris! The bus stops at all the CDG terminals and is not limited to AirFrance passengers. The similar cab fare is approx 60 euros. Our suite (303) had a living room, bedroom, walk-in closet and large modern bathroom with deep tub, separate glassed shower with rain shower head (and hand held) and ample lighting. The linens were the best - pressed and high quality that complimented the bed. Flat screen tvs in both rooms. Wi-fi also available and easy to use but not free. Great heavy doors and quality hardware in all fixtures. The A/C was so quiet that one could not hear it, but totally efficient. A thermostat in the living room and one is the bedroom. Same with any plumbing sounds - heard nothing. Nor did we hear people or street sounds. Clean and well-managed by the housekeeping staff. The hotel is one block off the busy Champs Elysees and in a totally cool area. The world's largest Louis Vuitton store is just across the Champs Elysees and a walk to the Seine can be accomplished in 15 minutes by strolling down Avenue Georges V past the Four Seasons. Hotel Balzac is in the RIGHT place. The staff was totally pleasant (a fact we find throughout Paris) and Patrick, the one of the concierges was most helpful and fun. We'd booked restaurants via email with him prior to leaving the U.S.. We ate breakfast there daily as well as had a cocktail in the small bar one evening.

It was a good thing the restaurant was listed in our Fodors guide and we did not actually go to it. We booked three rooms through American Express travel. The rooms were prepaid, but upon checkout, the hotel staff tried to make us pay the bill a second time and only after much hassle did we get everything straightened out. Also, they had minibar charges for all of the rooms that were clearly not ours; the charges were dropped from our bill but I think a hotel of this caliber really should not have these issues. Not only that but on the day we checked in, our minibar had a bottle of water that was already open and half empty. I think the hotel stay was mostly enjoyable, but the service in the hotel does not meet the standards of a fine boutique hotel of this price range.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, poor service\u201d", "Author": "Hen-nyTN", "ReviewID": "UR24079281", "Content": "The Hotel Balzac's location is wonderful, and the rooms are beautifully decorated.

This was the first leg of a 3 city European tour and our stay at the Hotel Balzac was by far the best hotel of the whole trip. Everything from the perfect location to the beautiful lobby was stunning. We were greated right away and felt instantly as if the staff knew us. The staff was so helpful and helped us for everything to cabs to a dinner reservation (which was by far the best and most romantic restaurant we ate at on the trip). These guys truly were the best and made our stay so much more enjoyable because of it. I had also requested a room with an Effiel tower view and was so happy to get our room with a direct view of the Effiel tower - ait's wesome at night. The hotel bills itself as the most romantic hotel in Paris and it totally seems to be. It had a charm and an air of romance that could be felt immediatly from the incredible huge fresh flowers in the lobby and restaurant to the cool purple and red colors that dominate through out the hotel. Oh and talk about service - I ordered some roses and champage to be placed in the room before we arrived and they provided 3 dozen of the freshest roses. The details were incredible!

The nighttime light show on the tower is spectacular. * the room was big and well furnished * we got a reservation to pierre gagnaire and it was sensational. now the bad points: * the staff seem to have a fetish for entering your room even when the do not disturb sign is on the door. On at least 3 occassions that we returned to our room there was a staff member in the room!!!! Not a cleaner but someone just standing there!!!! other times we would be in the room and they would just barge in without even knocking and then see us and leave without talking. Very strange!!! I rang the front desk once to check that one of the people was actually a member of staff. * The rooms should be equipped with an iron and ironing board. I know lots of places in france (for whatever reason) do not have them in the room but when you are catering for an overseas market they are essential * Be careful about breakfast. Continental breakfast was included in our rate which normally includes juice, coffee, cereal and fruit and normally does not include hot food, meats or cheeses. Well one morning as we were leaving we were told that we had to sign the bill for the \"buffett breakfast\" We said we did not have any hot food, well the staff member quite rudely told us that he watched us have fruit and yoghurt and that is not included in the continental breakfast. Well if that is the way the Hotel runs their breakfast that is fine but they should have explained what was and wasn't included. Would we stay here again? Probably not.

Reopened in mid-July, we arrived here on July 28th and will leave, sadly, on August 3rd. This is THE PLACE to stay if you are looking for romance or a convenient location to the Champs-elysees. One short block - at Rue de Balzac, will lead you to all of the sights and sounds of the avenue near the Arc de Triumphe. 1 short block from the George V metro. This gorgeous hotel starts your stay off with a greeting and offer of beverage and treats (including macaroons from Lauduree), while awaiting the check-in. Personnel personally escort you and show all of the features available in your room. We took advantage of a special offer, booking a junior suite and getting upgraded to the one bedroom suite. It is to die for! The first room includes a honor mini-bar (which isn't cheap) leading into the living room. Decorated in purple, green and french white, it includes a very comfortable sofa, chair, chandelier, gorgeous silver and glass lamps as well as a flat screen TV. The bathroom offers a stand alone shower with rain shower head, a bathtub with and-held shower spray, a beautiful ornate silver and marble sink and a toilet that also acts as a bidet. It even offers a first for us - a warm toilet seat!!!! It was a little too funny when we first sat on it. Toiletries are offered by Molten Brown. The adjoining bedroom contains a real king bed, two end tables, writing desk and a huge closet. Strangely there is no dresser but we're making do with the drawers in the bedside tables. A safe is also available as well as slippers, bathrooms, shoe protectors and hair dryer. A very small balcony is offered in both the living room and bedroom. No view unless you are on the top floor. The airconditioning works great. We were treated wonderfully so far with a welcome tray of chocolates and macaroons from Laduree and La Maison de Chocolate. Also received a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit. Room service feels like it is literally minutes from response and that's probably because there are only about 70 rooms in the hotel. There is a small dining area but we haven't enjoyed the offerings yet. The only negatives if I were to find them, are the lack of a shelf in the shower for toiletries, hardly any television shows (including old movies on the pay-per-view), no drawers for stowing some items - but really no problems to speak of. There is no doubt that we will always return to this hotel. In some respects we feel out of our league among the clientele but I wouldn't trade what is offered for any other hotel. I loved the convenience, decorated rooms and the comfort in knowing things are taken care of. For those with physical problems, they had a luggage life to bring the luggage off the street into the hotel and I noticed that it is also used for strollers and wheelchairs. There is also an elevator and air conditioning. Turn down service, complete with yet more chocolates, is available. Some of the other services included such things as special cleaning services for your couture items, a butler, concierge services and parking. Decadent? Perhaps, but it is being marketed as one of the small luxury hotels in the world and for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
