Some days they had scrambled eggs or a cheese omelet, and some days they had bacon or sausage. They also provide a free newspaper and apples at a table near the front desk. The hotel had free wi-fi. There is also an elevator and a 24 hour small grocery/supply store. I believe it is a smoke free hotel. The shuttle bus service was wonderful. They will pick up from the airport (until 11 PM, I believe). They also take people to the airport as early as 5 AM, but let them know a day ahead of time. If you sign up for the shuttle a day in advance, they will take you to the zoo at 9:30 AM and pick you up at 4:30.

Old Town is a straight shot on San Diego Avenue. Some people may even want to walk there. The San Diego Transit system has a stop in Old Town. You can use the Coaster rail, the Blue Line or the Green Line there. The Old Town Trolley also has a stop located in Old Town. I definitely picked the right hotel for us.

When I looked at reviews for many of the other hotels in San Diego, there was a general consensus that you got fleeced for Valet parking, then you had to wait forever to get your car. Not so at this hotel. Parking is free and self-serve. The breakfast was not 5 star, but I really didn't expect it to be, it had reasonable variety and I didn't have to pay extra for it. We paid less than I expected, given the proximity to downtown and Old Town, overall excellent value. The staff were warm and friendly. The guys at the desk at night were courteous and fun and answered questions knowledgeably. There is a shuttle that can take you to Old Town, the Zoo, Seaport and the airport... pretty much everywhere we were interested in going. We could probably have skipped getting the car. If it's your first trip to San Diego, you can get away with no car if you are flexible about waiting for the shuttle and are going to the regular tourist stops. You can also take the shuttle to Old Town and hop onto the trolley ($34) to get into Coronado for excellent beaches. Cons The layout of the hotel is odd, there are two sections to the hotel, and you have to walk outside to get to the breakfast room and the front desk. The room we stayed in overlooked the pool and was outside of the secured door, the only thing between you and the main street is the pool, no locks or keycard access doors. Initially that made us feel a little unsafe, but it is really a quiet neighborhood and we eventually got over it. You can walk to Old Town, but it's a 10-15min trek. We walked 3 times, and it was a good walk every time, so I guess that's not really a con. The freeway is right there... really... right there... we had to change rooms because of freeway noise. The planes feel like they are directly over your head as they come into the city, more noise to contend with, but it became white noise at some point for me. Overall though, it was a great time.

Its location is convenient to the airport and has easy access to I-5, so getting to other area attractions is quite easy from the hotel. However, because it's immediately adjacent to I-5, traffic noise can be a problem for some rooms. Even the receptionist told me that he gave me a \"quiet\" room when I checked in (one facing away from the Interstate). There's not much in the immediate area of the hotel in the way of restaurants or shops; it has a bit of a commercial, almost industrial feel in the neighborhood. Check-in was quick and easy at 8:00 PM on a Saturday night, and it was easy to find a parking spot in the free underground garage. The room (single queen bed) was clean and updated, albeit a little small but just fine for a solo traveler. It had an in-room safe and had 12 available electrical outlets (two on the base of each of three lamps and a six-outet wall outlet) which meant I had no problem charging my laptop, cell phone, or camera batteries. The wireless Internet access was free (password required), but a bit intermittent. When I commented to the front desk, they checked into it and the service has been better since. One other thing that was interesting was the fact that the bathroom door had a spring-loaded door closer which kept the door closed all the time. This meant that the heat couldn't get into the bathroom so it was a bit chilly in the morning. I had to prop the door open.

She emailed us one of the room info with the reservation # given by the hotel and our names under the reservation. When I got there right around 3pm, the check-in time, I gave them my name, my friend's name, and the reservation #. They looked it up and told me it's already being occupied by someone else, who's name I recognize as one of the people in our party. She tells me that since the reservation # is already used and that our name wasn't even on their system, she can't assign me another room because not everyone has checked in yet. This was all done next to whom I found out was their manager, who could care less what was going on. The two women had no desire to help or offer another option. It was one of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered when it comes to the hotel check-in process. Luckily, my friend who made all the reservations arrived 15 minutes later so she had all the printed confirmation with her. It turned out the hotel screwed up on the reservation and assigned the same, exact reservation # to two sets of different people! Of course by then, the manager already left so there was no accountability. Anyway, on to the hotel itself. It's not bad, but it is located next to the freeway so it can be a little noisy if your room is on the side of the freeway (which ours was). The room is actually a good size with comfortable beds and linen. The TV wasn't plugged in all the way so we had to figure out what was wrong with it for a few minutes. They have a nice size mini-frig and microwave. The shower had good water pressure although the toilet takes forever to flush. They gave three bath towels and three face towels, but no hand towels though. This is the first hotel I've ever been to that doesn't have all three sizes of towels. Standard soaps and shampoo and conditioner. The free breakfast was nice, had yogurts, bananas, juice, cereal, biscuits, gravy, sausage patty, and egg with melted cheese in it already. Also bagels/other breads and a machine to make pancakes. They also have a 24-hour snack shop that's pretty convenient. We didn't use the internet or wireless access but that's also available. Their pool is sort of small and their jacuzzi smaller but they open late. The workout room also has some nice machines to get a good workout. Parking is kind of odd especially when first parking to register. Since it's one way, you have to leave the hotel and make a u-turn to turn back into the driveway to park underground. The elevator to the rooms are accessed by the room keys but since the doors to the inside hallway aren't locked, you can still walk up the stairs to get inside. It's not a bad value (we paid $99 pretax) per night since it comes with breakfast but the horrible check-in episode totally soured the whole thing for me.

For the positive things to say about this place, I want to start with the staff. They were all very nice, especially the front desk, where they were always helpful and willing to answer every question knowledgeably and quickly. I would shout out everyone by name but the only name that I can really remember is James(?) from the front desk who kept getting us an extra towel every night because we only had three and we were four people. But the individual names aren't that important because they were all wonderful. I also want to praise the hotel's security. If you are not a registered guest with a room key, you cannot get into any part of the hotel with the exception of course being the lobby. Even the elevator in the parking garage required a key card in order to use it. It made me at least feel safe knowing that no one could just walk into the hotel. The breakfast was phenomenal each day, with fruit, cereal, pancakes, bagels, mini muffins, toast, eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuits with sausage gravy, and most importantly the cinnamon rolls which are to die for. Plenty of options, all delicious. The rooms are pretty spacious, and tastefully decorated. Ours was located on the freeway side so it's a little noisy at night when you're trying to sleep, but it's manageable. So the hotel's tragic flaw is honestly just its location. Wile it is conveniently only 5 blocks from Old Town, it is also not far from the air[port, so the immediate surrounding area isn't so great...we saw more than a few homeless wandering the streets near the hotel, which doesn;t speak well for the location.

Upon returning to our room, I noticed that our desk was covered with ants. I thought perhaps something was spilled, but when I went over to our nightstand, that too was crawling with ants. We called the front desk immediately and they did tell us to pack our things and come right down to the front desk. However, they put us in a room right next door to where we had been (where we actually found 3 more ants) and weren't exactly apologetic about the situation. The gentleman at the front desk only apologized after we actually showed him pictures we took. We felt that could have been handled a bit better. -Both the first room and our new room smelled old and musty. We tried to open our windows and turn on the air conditioning, but every time we returned to our room it still smelled pretty gross. -The shower heads were extremely low making for an uncomfortable shower. I am 5'7 and the shower head hit me at mid-forehead. I did not have it as bad as my 6'3 husband however! -I tried out the fitness center one day, hoping to run a bit on the treadmill. However, there was a big dip right in the middle of the running belt, which not only made it impossible to run, but also quite dangerous for anyone who tried. -We did have the continental breakfast every morning. Two complaints about this: 1. The toaster was extremely SLOW and didn't function very well. It literally took 8 minutes to toast a piece of toast. 2. To add to this, one morning a woman in a Comfort Inn uniform was using the toaster to make her own breakfast, so all of the guests had to wait until she was done to use it.

We were on a strict budget, but didn't want to sacrifice safety or location. This hotel is a great compromise for those who want a lower priced room and a decent location. It's not in the heart of the city, but pretty darn close and a great price. At first glance we were a little hesitant about the hotel. It is in an old neighborhood, there was a good amount of construction, and it's literally right next to the freeway. However, even when walking many blocks to Old Town at night, we felt safe. The underground parking was secure and FREE which is a plus in San Diego. Also, the elevator and all hotel entrances required a room key to access which made us feel secure.The windows overlooking the freeway were thick and there was little noise. I can't say much for the view, but we didn't come to San Diego to look out of our hotel window, so we didn't care. The fridge and microwave were great since we brought snacks and were able to store leftovers. The hot tub was wonderful and deserted (at least when we were there). The room and premises were very clean and the breakfast was adequate but nothing special. The 24-hr \"store\" was a great help when my husband got sick in the middle of the night, though the prices are about as high as any convenience store. The staff was very friendly, and the business center, although small, came in handy when we wanted to research local activities. The walk to Old Town may be daunting for some (about 15-20 min) but was ok for us since we're pretty active people. The drive to downtown and the oceanfront was VERY quick and easy.

We tried to ignore it, but it soon began to be like rainfall over the jacuzzi tub and in the door way of the bathroom! We contacted the front desk who told us they had another room for us in the other building, so in the middle of the night, we had to pack up our things while being rained on and move. The front desk person was not very nice about it either. It was a mess. I was crying the whole night and the next day. The suite they moved us to had a balcony which had spider webs (I HATE SPIDERS!!!) and sunflower seed shells all over it. It was disgusting but the story made for a memorable engagement (not in a good way). I would definitely NOT stay here again. The room was nice but the area isn't.

The noise was distracting while playing games in the room and even watching the Chargers-Broncos game. It didn't bother me or my 8 year old son as much, but it was pretty bad for my wife and daughter. The other disappointment was that even though the place was recently refurbished, several things didn't work like they're new, or perhaps they're cheap and just-for-show. I fixed the toilet's lift chain because it was set too short so it constantly flushed; the diverter valve (the knob that switches the tub from shower to faucet) was very hard to move; I fixed the closet door because it was off its slider and wouldn't open; the light between the beds was broken (the fixture was loose and jiggled, and one side worked intermittently); and the drapes didn't close completely so the room was never totally dark. Also, it seems odd that the only rooms at the hotel with two beds are on the freeway side. The rooms on the other side have only one bed, so we couldn't be moved unless we paid $10 per night per extra rollaway bed...and crammed two of them into the smallish rooms. The amenities are nice with a good breakfast selection: hard boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, drinks, etc. There's a pool, underground parking, and the staff was very friendly as long as you didn't bring problems to their attention. When I did, their response was average, but a little defensive. The rooms are clean and everything inside is new and nice enough. And having free Wi-Fi, and LOTS of HD channels was GREAT.

We found that it was a brilliant place to stay. As our trip was based around staying at budget accomadation where possible(hostels, campgrounds) we found that the extra we paid to stay here was well worth it. First of all a great plus for us was the fact tht they had free internet on 2 computers in the lobby. Though there were only 2 computers but i found they were barely ever occupied and could get on it when ever i wanted. Second was free continental breakfast with wafles if you could be bothered making them in the wafle machines(i dont fancy them so i stuck to cereal, toast and bagels). Coupled to this was the fact there was a little general food and amenities store in the lobby that had everything from beer, sandwiches, soap, crisps, etc. It was open at all hours as you took the items and paid for them at the front desk of the hotel. There is also a laundry and clothes dryers that you can use for a few quarters. The location was definitly the best thing about the place. Oldtown was only about an 800m walk to the west, were there was an assortment of bars/restaurants(mainly mexican) and shops. By far we found the Coyote Cafe our favourite and went there 3 nights for Tea. Also in Oldtown was the bus terminal where we could get on a bus and go to Seaworld, Ocean Beach, Mission and Pacific Beach, or jump on the trolley(train) to get into downtown Sandiego. From downtown San Diego it was then just a bus trip to the San Diego Zoo or a walk down to the foreshore area where all the ship museams and the USS Midway is. If you didnt want to walk into Oldtown to get the trolly into downtown S.D, there is a closer station to the Comfort Inn called Washington. The people at the front desk can provide you with a print out on directions to get to pretty much all the touristy places and public transport routes. As for the room we found them to be great. Had a fridge, a/c, microwave, cable t.v and really comfotable bed. There was also a pool and a spa/jaccuzi if you feel like having a swim.

The free wireless internet in the room was great, as was the plasma screen tv on the wall with a large selection of channels plus HBO. The king size bed was more comfortable than our own bed at home! I've never been able to say that about a hotel bed, but this one was springy and had a plush top - very nice. Our room had an in-room safe that was shoulder level - all other places put them on the floor so you have to bend way down to get at them, or don't have them at all in the rooms. The refrigerator allowed me to keep my special milk cold so that I could bring it down to have at breakfast each day. We used the microwave to heat some leftovers when we got hungry one night. While we were there, we could see maintenance people working on some rooms doing some minor repair/improvements during the day, so there is ongoing care given to maintaining this hotel. There's a 24 hour store in the lobby that has just about anything you could want in a pinch. The breakfast was great and had a large variety of food available which was kept well stocked. We were able to get a table every morning, but at crowded times you may have to bring up your food to your room on a tray. The hot tub was clean and nice and hot - and open 24 hours. The pool was heated so well that we were able to swim comfortably even though the outside temps were in the 50's, and it was open until 10 pm which allowed us to sightsee all day and then finish the day with a relaxing swim.

With a push of a button on the remote it becomes a 32\" plasma computer monitor. There is free wireless & wired high speed internet access, a 24 hour deli/shop in the hotel, a free all you can eat breakfast buffet and a trolley stop just a few blocks away. And this free breakfast isn\u2019t just a muffin and warm orange juice like other places. They had everything you could want. They even had a waffle maker set up so you could make your own fresh waffles. The room and bathroom looked recently remodeled. They both were very modern, nice, and big. The staff were all very friendly. When I asked how to get to the trolley stop they pulled a big color map out and gave it to me. It showed all the tourist spots and they even drew a path on it to show me how to get from the hotel to the trolley station. Above and beyond what most hotels would do. Most would just point and say \"Go down that way and turn right\". For complaints mentioned in other reviews about the noise: my window was so close to I-5 I could almost touch the cars, and I had no noise issues. The windows must be soundproof. I also had the A/C on all the time. If you have it on, even just on the low or the fan setting, you should not have any problems either. The hotel isn't in the best neighborhood in San Diego, but I never felt unsafe walking around. I had a great view of the San Diego skyline from my window and of the airport right across I-5. You are just 1 trolley stop away from the very nice Old Town area done up to look like the old west, and just a few trolley stops away from the San Diego waterfront with all the historic ships to visit and shopping at Seaport Village. I recommend this hotel if you are looking for an inexpensive, clean place to stay which is close to a trolley stop. This provides you easy access to all the other places in San Diego you might want to visit. You can even get on the trolley and go all the way down to the US-Mexico border and walk into Tijuana.

It's long, but you get a bunch of facts when you're new to this location and really want to know as much as you can! I'll try to keep this brief and at the same time, informative. We'd never stayed here before and basically chose this hotel because of price, location, and an average of the previous reviews. The biggest standout of those 3 is definitely the location. You'll find yourself very near everything that San Diego has to offer. However, in our opinion, not close enough that \"walking\" is always an option. Have car...will need it to travel. The area around the hotel as you arrive doesn't look great, but rebuilding is taking place. Enjoy \"riding\" the nearby steep roads as a thrill if you're not used to it. Some have criticized the parking...the re-marking of the main floor parking lot confuses the real spots. They're fine! Sheesh...don't be so fussy! And decent parking below with sufficient room for even this \"larger than average\" fella. The hotel looks fine, grounds are clean, building appears freshly painted and well maintained. Lobby is bright and welcoming. Dave at the front desk was EXTREMELY helpful switching us rooms. Problem with the first one? No...we just wanted to be closer to the central area of the hotel. Even provided an early morning \"check-in\" as we arrived during \"check-out\" time. They say the windows have been upgraded to deal with the highway noise issue. At first...the noise is noticeable. But pretend it doesn't really bother you, turn the a/c fan on, and it really isn't that awful. If you're a light sleeper or internally affected by highway noise, ask for a hill-side room or keep on truckin'. Breakfast was decent...fresh, varied items from breads, to pastries, to fruit, juices, milk, cereals, waffles and so on. The other guests generally seem pleasant. You'll find that in the cruisers that are staying a night pre-sail-off. Not enough tables in the breakfast area creates new friends and shared spaces. The rooms are decently sized for short stays, and functional. Some items like out-dated furniture or appointments, are starkly contrasted by the massive HDTV and computer system INCLUDED! Whoa! Wireless throughout the hotel and in the room is complimentary! And so what if the room isn't chi-chi. You're not on vacation to stay IN the room, are you?! Get over it...it's a Comfort Inn, you're not spending a whole lot of money, and you're probably not staying all that long. \"Deli\" is more like an emergency hunger saver, and there's definitely enough sundries and snacks in the lil store.

Having the store in the lobby was incredibly handy for snacks and drinks which saved us money at the attractions we visited. The free breakfast had the usual muffins, bagels and pastires, plus whole and cut fruit but also make you own waffles. A big hit with the kids and a nice quick start to the day. Staff kept the area clean and stocked. We liked the location alot. Being on the freeway actually gives you easy access to everything and it is a very central location being under 5 mi from the beaches or the zoo, even Mexico is not far. We walked to the Trolley Tours and really enjoyed that. You can see many major sites at your own relaxed pace and learn from the narration. The shops and restaurants in Old Town made for a great time. Especially Cafe Coyote, watch them make the tortillas and enjoy the mariachis.

I basically had to unload all their luggage for the evening myself, although there were bell hops around. That was fine. However, after unloading all the luggage from the motorhome, which was around 6:00ish, I came back to the room to find a flood in the bathroom of our room downstairs. By this time, I had already plugged in all my electronic equipment, i.e. Blue Tooth earpiece, Treo 650, Sony camcorder, etc. These things were placed on the floor and wherever I can find an extra plug -- which was right outside the bathroom and in the bathroom. When I asked for help, all that I was told was that they were short-handed and we would have to wait for someone to come up and apply towels to dry up the spill. OH, BUT FIRST, not after I had to stand by to hear all the accusations -- \"someone must have put too much paper down the toilet\", \"someone put something that didn't belong\", \"this happens to people in their own homes\", \"what do you want us to do about it?\" and so on . . . After having to remind myself that I didn't need to explain or apologize for something we did not do (after careful investigation), I requested another room, which should have just been offered in the first place, without any accusations. The next morning I asked to speak with the Supervisor, which I did, and she also was very defensive and stated \"We put you in another room! There is nothing else we can do.\" I reminded her that I had to request another room it was not offered, only after hearing all the accusations and how they didn't have time to help out. I don't know who sets the tone there at this location, but it was the worst experience I ever had at a Comfort Inn. I have traveled since I was 15 years old and I am 45 years old, I thought your staff was lazy and they sure have a chip on their shoulder. I was told afterwards, by the \"Supervisor\" that she would discount my room by 20%, which I haven't seen on my credit card as of yet.

But the drapes dampened the noise quite a bit and having the air conditioner on high speed helped even more. It didn't disturb our sleep at all, and we're not heavy sleepers. Other than that, there was absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel, at least for our purposes. We weren't there to swim or spend time in the hotel, so we were there only in the evenings and to sleep. Room was very comfortable with both a small fridge and microwave. The \"continental\" breakfast was better than most other Comfort Inns we've stayed at. They had the standard waffle machines, but their large selection of pastries and fruits was wonderful. I thought maybe they had a special breakfast for Sundays (which was our first morning there), but it was just their standard fare. There was a slight glitch in the room charge at first, because I had received a different rate than what was showing up on their computer. But they called the home office, which verified my rate and it was cleared up quickly. The two gals on duty when we checked in were very friendly and helpful and joked around with us. Our room was ready when we arrived. By the way, the large bowl of apples that they always have at the front desk for their guests is a nice touch. They also have a well-stocked convenience store there in the lobby which is open 24 hours. Since there is no restaurant on the premises, it was nice to have when the munchies hit later in the evening. Guests charge \"reasonably priced\" purchases to their room. Since we always travel with a lap top, the free wi-fi in the room was appreciated. The hotel, although not in the upscale part of town, was conveniently located to most of the attractions. We had a rental car, so proximity to public transportation was not a factor for us. The parking garage was under the hotel, well lit and reasonably secure. Neither of us felt unsafe at any time. If you're looking for a posh hotel, go downtown to the Hyatt. But if you're looking for a comfortable, affordable hotel, I'd recommend this one.

Stayed at this hotel, as many others have, as it was close to Marine graduation. Big deal. I would have rather traveled 50 miles that morning, than to have experienced this hotel. Number 1: We had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready, in spite of them having our reservation for weeks (in other words, they knew we were coming.) Then, we were informed very rudely that \"well, you know these rooms take 2 hours to clean!!\") They offered NO compensation whatsoever...no discount, no future stay at a Comfort Inn, no complimentary anything, not even an apology. 2. The clerks - every single one of them - had major attitudes. As if THEY were doing us a favor by \"giving\" us a room we had paid for!! The three girls that morning - very rude and not apologetic whatsoever for the fact that our room was not ready, and that we had to wait over an hour. My son arrived a little later, and was also treated rudely when he merely asked for a copy of his key to the room. The following morning when we checked out, more rudeness by the two front desk personnel. Obviously, NO customer service training whatsoever (Note: I worked for Hyatt Hotels for over 8 years, and have also been an avid traveler all my life, so this is not acceptable behavior from ANY hotel personnel, I am fully aware what customer service looks and feels like.) The sad thing is, my entire family - total of 6 rooms - were booked at this hotel, and not one of my 12 family members had a positive word to say about this hotel and its personnel and/or rooms. 3. The room was absolutely horrible. Cigarette butts visible on the ledges outside; cigarette burns in the carpet; Even the note pads were used and had water stains and were warped - such an easy thing to remedy. But the WORST thing was the EXTREME NOISE. Right on top of the very heavily traveled freeway, impossible to sleep, really impossible. So, unless you want to stay up and party all night and get no sleep at all, go ahead and book your room at this undesirable (understatement) establishment.

The fridge and microware were a plus, and we had all of the accommodations we needed. The free continental breakfast was good (yummy waffles!). I don't remember if anyone wrote any negative reviews about that, but how much can you expect when it's a free \"continental\" breakfast? I've been to places where they put out a coffee machine and some stale jelly doughnuts (who wants that for breakfast??). This hotel had a pretty nice selection - toast, waffles that you make yourself, fruit, juice, etc. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Regarding the user who claimed discrimiation of some sort, my boyfriend and I are an interracial couple and didn't see any evidence of discrimination at all. They did everything they could to accommodate any requests we had. I'd recommend staying here, but be sure to ask for a room not on the highway side if you think that's going to be a problem. If you're a heavy sleeper, then it won't matter. One other item to mention - we didn't get a chance to really experience Old Town except for going to dinner the night we arrived...what a cute little place!
