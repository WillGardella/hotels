{"Reviews": [{"Content": "the rudest experience I have ever had I have stayed here once before and it was ok. The place is very old and run down. I use the chain lock and put suitcases in front of the door to feel safe. I stayed here this second time because  The Great Highway Inn was booked. In addition this is where my grandparents use to stay when my grandpa had to go to the VA hospital. I believe it is not the same ownership though.I didn't sleep very well because I had forgotten my own pillows and their pillows are completely flat. When I awoke the following morning I got up and went to Ocean Beach, which was my whole purpose for being in the city. I lost myself in the walk as the ocean is captivating. As I arrived back to the motel on foot I was looking in the windows for check out time and so nothing posted anywhere. I looked in the room and on my receipt which was just my credit card receipt. There was nothing saying when check out is, nor was I told when checking in. I figured with most places it is between 11 and 12. It was 10:45 so I decided to jump in the shower. I thought I heard the phone ring while in the shower but was not sure. Once out of the shower did the usual girl thing and blow dried my hair. Once done I heard this knocking on the door and someone saying something about check out but could not quite understand. I called back that I wasn't ready yet. Within 10 mins there was another knock on the door by the lady manager, I presume. She begins yelling at me to open this door right now. I said, do you mind if I put my shirt on first. I open the door and she rudely says, it is past check out. Next time answer the phone. Check out was at 11 now get out. It is 11:45. I was shocked. I said, do you mind if I get my things first. She just looked at the cleaning person and said, she is done. I loaded my things, turned in the key, and got into my car. The clock in my car said 11:30. I will never use this motel in my life again. If I have to I will use Days Inn a block up.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794434999", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Barbi6"}, {"Content": "It's a beach Motel Get over it!!!! Well, maybe I am just not picky. This hotel looks really run down on the outside. I was pretty skeptical the first time we stayed there. The rooms are definately not fancy but have everything you need. We have stayed here with our family at least 5 times. We go once or twice a year. So there may be a few grains of sand in the carpet...what do you expect. It's two blocks from the beach. The zoo is across the street, and a great cafe next door. What I love about it. We don't have to drive, once you are there, everything we do is walking distance. My son is 6 and loves it there! We don't have to worry about him ruining the place because it is just a good old, down to earth, crashing place. Has cable and coffee, bed, and a shower. That's all ya need. The best rooms are upstairs in the middle. Can even get a glimpse of the ocean in betwenn buildings. I am glad the snobs can go stay in a fancy place and get ripped off, but I love Roberts and will be going back again and again. The owners are nice too, they let us keep our car there extra long, so we don't have to pay for zoo parking.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR757206470", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shellbell1404"}, {"Content": "Could use alot of improvement Many years ago I used to stay here on fairly regular basis. Some things never change...like a great location. Otherwise, since the place was taken over by a new owner, who doesn't seem the least bit interested in puting any money into the place it has deteriorated noticably. I just completed by most recent stay today. First when you check in the smell of curry from the resident manager/owners kitchen is overwhelming. The room is self was OK, but simply that. It was in many respects kinda rundown and shabby. The exterior is awfull and has not been painted in at least 20 years. The walls are paper thin and you can hear ever detail of what is being said, or done the the rooms next to you.Now I read one of the reviews hear that talked about hookers hanging around the place. Well Roberts is kinda dumby I've never seen a hooker around this hotel and this area and I know it very well.If possible you money could be better spent elsewhere.

It is awful. Very dirty rooms floors have not been cleaned in what looks to be years. They are nice people who run the place, they even allow the patrons from the zoo to park in the lot on free zoo day they charge them $5.00 to park while they are at the zoo. The only problem with that is that if you are renting a room you have to wait for a place to park. On the night of the 4th. I listened to a hooker yell the same line over and over to different clients all night. During one of her sessions her pimp even busted thru the door to let the guy know that he did not pay for that.

It is, in all senses, that sort of Raymond Chandler-esque sleazy dive that is only missing the gangsters and hard-boiled detectives. But it is a place to stay, reasonably priced, and no more outrageous than some that are far worse. My stay was shortly after the current owners took over, and they did their best, but it was clear that being hoteliers was not in their blood, and that their vision of running this place was flawed. I had stayed previously (2001-2002) when the previous owners, who had a clue, still ran it.Nonetheless, the night I arrived was the worst storm to hit the SF Peninsula in a long time, with Beach Avenue closed, and police clearing people off the beach for safety sake. Winds and rain, lightning and thunder, all crashing with the waves not 500 feet from my door and window.It was the most spectacular stay in a motel I have ever had. Second floor, watching California weather at its most magnificent, from a vantage point that I would have never thought possible.It is rundown, a bit dingy, and perhaps not a five-star luxury palace for those who wish to be pampered.But for those who want to experience a classic 1930s motel, in the middle of the Sunset District, with a western view that is to die for, there is little better than this.And for the full effect? Pick up a Raymond Chandler novel to read before bedtime instead of watching the tube, or book a room when you know a storm is coming.

Forget the money part of it for a second...the sidewalk would be cleaner...no less noisy...and actually less depressing. The rooms are dingy and moldy and dank. The beds are squalid...hair and dried fluids all through the bed and on surfaces and the carpet is foul, greasy, stinky and exudes particles into the air when disturbed by somethng as basic as walking upon it. These things however, pale when laid up against what ensued on my stay there. My girlfriend and i checked in for a week and after accomodating the dismal condition of the room...settled in unfortunately. On waking up the third morning we were both covered with what we thought were mosquito bites. Through that day...these bites kept increasing and encroaching in intensity and by the fourth morning...we were both in great duress and shock from these bites which had turned into aggravated welts. I checked the bedding more closely and found little points of fresh blood stains on the sheets and a little dead bug of a type which i hadn't seen before. The welts were running across my body in long staright rows that were deep and red and i was trying to control a feeling of panic. My girlfriend's face was covered with them. She ended up with around 200 bites and i had about 150. Upon doing some investigating...i found that this was a bed bug infestation. As someone who's made a living on the road for 35 years...this was the worst thing I've ever encountered in a sleeping establishment. We checked out on that fourth morning and i required medical treatment and steroids to overcome the danger of these bites. The physical scars are still with both of us six months later. If i had a choice between sleeping on a park bench or sleeping at Roberts By The Beach Motel in San Francisco...i'd take the bench with no second thoughts.

Bad!Bad! Bad! I think that a rating of terrible is too good for this hotel. I couldnt get a single minute of sleep because of the foul smell of mildew inside my room. I couldnt go outside either seeing that it was pouring rain. On top of that, the bed sheets were torn and stained, and I found already opened condoms underneath the bed. Upon entering the room, a rat came running out from under the bed into one of the holes in the wall. At around 3:30 in the morning the few people in the hotel that could actually sleep were awakened when a group of about 5 or 6 teenage kids came into the parking lot and tried to break into one of the vending machines with a baseball bat. I was almost scared to death in the morning when I went to fill up the ice chest and I found a homeless man asleep next to the ice machine.

Do NOT let the ocean nearby, sway you into this dump. I booked in advance, was later told my 'room' wouldn't be ready til evening, dispite my request and telling them my time of necessary arrival. Place was awful. Damaged carpet, holes in sheets, staff disregarded my reminding them I'd requested mid day arrival, to fit my schedule. DO NOT take any room before seeeing it first, ever. Shower water pressure was unstable, and weak. I had trouble keeping the temperature in balance, it would fluctuate from hot to cold to tepid, and it was scary and felt dangerous. Sheets had holes in them, one blanket on bed was ratty and old. Place looked like some slummy dump, but I had no time to request money back, or leave, as I had an engagement I couldn't be late for. Otherwise I would have done this immediately.I was miserable. There were other guests that disturbed me, and upset me greatly. I did not sleep at all, and was ill in the morning from such a bad experience and felt sick and left there sick. My schedule was pressing enough, and this, was a new and horrid nightmare. This place is very old and not kept up. I've traveled before and never had this kind of experience, ever. Motel 6 is five stars over this dump. Do not even think about this place, ever. My booking in advance didn't matter, and I was very specific about my time of arrival, and then left to kill time, til 'they' had my room ready. Which was hrs later forcing me to rush and be stressed even moreso, after traveling, packing, etc. One window was taped with clear postal tape, shut. The other side, was hard to open, to allow fresh air in. It was a dangerous to customer, neglected place, and the worst. I was in fear of my own safety, in fear of being broken into the room, during the night due to the postal taped window, which wasn't repaired, and subjected one to such fear. If I wasn't so pressed for time, I wouldn't have 'settled' for this.. and perhaps I shouldn't have and been late to my engagement, and gone elsewhere... and I sure do regret not doing that.

I could hear the couple in the room next door playing some strange game until after 11:00 p.m.-- she kept shouting, Seven, seven, seven!--and then they started arguing with one another at 7:00 a.m. The walls are so paper-thin that I could tell when the woman was speaking while brushing her teeth. I finally banged on the wall when I heard the man clearing the mucus from his throat, spitting it out in the sink, and then burping.All the information in the previous reviews regarding the noise of cars, trains, buses and diesel trucks is accurate. I was awakened all night long. But I don't think I would have slept anyway with the pillow on my bed which was about 1 1/2 inches thick.
