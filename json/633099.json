The hotel is very close to Gare Du Nord station and Poissoniere metro station so although a little out of the centre, it has good connections to the main tourist attractions. Our room was basic, but clean and tidy and a good size overall. Breakfast was good, with lots of choice. A couple of negatives - no tea or coffee making facilities in the room (we even asked at reception when we returned one day if we could buy a coffee from reception and were told no). Also the hairdryer in the room was not very powerful so girls, if it takes ages to dry your hair generally, its probably best to bring your own! The main disappointment was the situation we had with the safety deposit box. There wasn't one in our room so we asked at reception and they advised they had a safe box in reception we could use. We had a small \"boot bag\" sized bag with some items in that we put in the safe on our first day. We took the bag back to our room on the first night and on the second morning, went to return it to the safe but were told it was too big for the safe despite having it in there the day before! Bizarre. That night, before going out for the evening, we stopped at reception so that we could get some money and were told that the key was not available to the safe and that we would be able to get access the next morning! This really was not very helpful as my boyfriend and I had to then go out for the evening with very little money between us as we had put most of it in the safe! I would have rated the hotel 4 out of 5 had it not been for this issue.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N'Djamena, Chad", "Title": "\u201cA very nice stay for a good price\u201d", "Author": "Edouard D", "ReviewID": "UR124534586", "Content": "I spent 3 days there with my girlfriend to visit Paris and it was definitely a good choice.

Very difficult to find a better located hotel, for this price. The Metro is just 3 minutes walk. Rue de Lafayette is 3 minutes walk. Any direction you walk, there are lots and lots of restaurants. The location of the hotel makes it easy for you to walk and see the places around. We had walked all the way to Arc de triuphe and on another day to the Notre dam. The hotel is very clean and the staff very friendly and speak good English. The breakfast spread is good, may be the best you will find in any hotel who charges the same. But it is the same everyday, and since we stayed for 9 days, we found it a little boring towards the end. The only negative thing I can say is that the whole place is very small. Lobby is small, lift is supersmall, rooms are small and the showers, the smallest of them all! But everything is sparkling clean. By the end of the 3rd day, I had learned to stand so still and take a shower without a droplet coming out of the shower curtain! There are also slightly larger room with larger bathrooms with a tub ( my sis in law got such a room).

Made the hallway smell like a gym locker room. Got into our room and it was small. Shower is super small. Just a stall about 3ft wide and the curtain when wet sticks to your body.

We tried to explain ourselves about how his computer was downloading someone else\u2019s adware and they did not care because some other Parisian saw us do this to the computer, when we were looking for how to use our eurostar tickets to get out of paris since the city shut down. We than told them about how we tried to fix it because we work on computers for a living and he did not care. We told the manager that this was not the case and he did not care.
