{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Trully Novotel This Novotel located in the very heart of Wanchai with proximity to MTR and many attractions. The Interior is smart and efficient, very well representing the Novotel brand. The staff are dressed in smart casual and pretty helpfull in many aspects. The room size is rather small like most other hotel in HK, but the layout design were very smart. Me and my wife slept together with our 2 years old daughter, I dont really recommend children older than 5 years old to share the bed with their parents, the bed is too small. Dont ever think about having an extra bed, you'll get cramped in the room, ask for a triple room instead.The Bathroom has the clever lay out , tough it is small and no tub, but it feels roomy and provided enough space to put your toiletries. Absolutely would consider to stay here again for my future HK trip", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR794183125", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tuscanyid"}, {"Content": "Acceptable 4-star hotel.

I was attending a conference at the Hong Kong convention centre. The novotel provided a great base for doing this, there is an elevated, covered walkway starting across the street from the hotel that takes you straight to the convention centre (10min walk) past shops, an asian supermarket, bars, restaurants and banks. The walkway also takes you to the ferry terminal where you can catch the ferry to the other side of HK harbour and the shops in Kowloon The hotel is in wanchai which seemd a safe neighbourhood, there are some shops close buy and the wanchai computer centre ( a 3 storey hive of small cellphone, computer and electronic shops) is close by if you are looking for a new gadget ( but make sure you buy from someone offering an international warranty if making a large purchase). At night parts of wanchai seem a bit seedy and there did seem to be a few undesirable bars and nightclubs open up in the evening but this is typical of any large city and didn\u9225\u6a9b really put me off the hotel or the location. We got a taxi to Soho where the restaurants and bars are a bit more trendy. (Taxis in HK are VERY cheap in the city centre) The hotel itself was clean, the staff were helpful and the room was a standard well presented Novotel style room, double room with two very comfortable single beds, flat scrren LCD TV, desk with wired broadband (no Wifi in room), clean bathroom and AC. Most of the double rooms in HK seem to consist of 2 single beds so if you want a double bed you should make sure you specify this at the time of booking. The hotel restaurant served a reasonably priced breakfast with a combination of western and asian buffet and cooked to order selections. My only real critisism was the baggage storage facility while I was waiting to checkin for my room and after checkout while waiting for the bus to the airport, which consisted of tying the left luggage together with rope and leaving them in the main foyer \u9225?this needs to be worked on.

It's simple, clear, modern and very good with flat screen TVs, very comfy bathrooms with elegant design and a good scheme of colors.About the size, it's small but reasonnable because we booked a standard room and in comparaison with HK standards, it was OK, about 20 sq meters. However, even if the room was nice, the staff of the hotel is absolutely not helpful and not smily at all. Even if you arrive with a lot of baggages, nobody will help you to bring it to your room. They don't say welcome and they don't care if they disturb you. In the morning, even if you place the sign do not disturb in front of your room, they will call you if you need they make the room. It was totally disturbing because we wanted to sleep and we have been wake up. Nobody says sorry and it's not acceptable.We can complain about the soundproofing as well which is not good at all and you'll have the impression to live with your room neighbours. Depending of the kind of customers will saty close to your room, it could be OK but it could be much more noisy as well...However, it's a good adress because the location is PERFECT, in the middle of Wanchai and the design is very interesting.But the management should train better the staff because this is a four stars hotel...", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR840174074", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ccrr77fr"}, {"Content": "Wouldn't recommend it We booked 4 nights accommodation at the Novotel Century in Wan Chai during the month of April but was not very satisfied with the overall experience in this hotel. First of all, we made our booking a month prior to our stay and requested for non-smoking rooms. To our disbelief they gave us rooms on the smoking floor (Floor 9) which they did not apologise or try to make amends for. The room definitely smelled of cigarettes which is foul.We also paid $1400 HKD for a 'superior' double room but only to receive a room about the size of a shoe box. They were clean but absolutely tiny without enough room to put our luggages. There was cable TV but most channels were in chinese, otherwise they were business-related programs..Im sure most people would agree that having HBO or other movie channels would have been nice.Another major complaint is that the walls  doors in this hotel is paper-thin..You can hear almost every conversations taking place outside your hotel room..Nothing worse than being woken up at 7.00am because of noisy neighbours. However, the house-keeper shouting Excuse me, house-keeping at 9.00am is also inexcusable..Surely they can do it at a more reasonable time so as to allow guests on their holidays to sleep in a little!! Very frustrating as they ignore the Do not disturb sign.The location was good as it was almost midway between Causeway Bay and Central. The hotel is also situated next to the ferry terminal which allows you to take the Star Ferry to Kowloon. Overall though, we felt that the hotel room was over-priced and iwhen you include the other disadvantages such as noise levels, inappropriate timing of house-keeping, absolutely tiny size of rooms and poor window views of old apartments, then Novotel Century would not be a hotel that I would recommend to others.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR277284539", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fedfan"}, {"Content": "Very Nice Stayed here for 1 night on a stop over to mainland China.I was very impressed with the quality of the room and the value for money.Don't get me wrong it's a business or stop over type hotel (far better than a UK Travel Lodge type hotel) but it has everything you need including a very good breakfast.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR861234762", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TonyDeeEngland"}, {"Content": "Not Worth the Price My friend and I stayed at the Novotel for three nights. First off, the location of the hotel wasn't very conveinient, it was off the main street and was at least a good 10 minute walk from the MTR. Taxis were readily available and extremely cheap, but it was quite a challenge trying to explain where you want to go.  The outside of hotel and lobby area was very lavish, but plain. We stayed in a double room that was very small. The room was clean, the bathroom was large especially compared to the room, with a big tub and detachable/adjustable shower nozzle. the beds were stiff (which is supposedly typical for most Asian countries). The view from our room was depressing, overlooking dingy rundown apartments, so we kept the curtains closed most of the time. The air conditioning worked well. there was a mini bar, but like usual, the prices were rediculious so i wouldn't reccomend touching any of it. There was also a tv, but most everything was in Cantanese, except for the news. the pool looked clean, although i never took advantage of it, and the fitness center was very large.  Overall, i would say that our stay ranked pretty average, the place was overpriced for what it offered, and i would reccomend spending a few dollars more for a place with a view and more comfortable beds... the Renaissance was a lot nicer from what we heard.", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294023126", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "greeNOWl"}, {"Content": "Clean, modern, well located This hotel was well located, close to the habour and to the Wan Chai MTR station.

For this, I received a sizeable two-room suite, with a nice sitting room and a smallish but reasonable bedroom. Everything was spotless and clean. The sitting room was equipped with a quality Sony LCD TV and even a 5-speaker surround home theater setup. The bedroom had its own wall-mounted LCD TV as well. The layout of the room was a tad awkward, as the room had clearly once been two separate rooms - there were two doors to the hallway, still marked with consecutive room numbers. One of these doors led directly into the bathroom! Nonetheless, everything was comfortable.Furnishings were fine, but very European in their simple, function-oriented nature. The bed was very firm, the couches in the sitting room were minimalist and not at all plush, the coffee tables and desk were very plain. There was little in the way of luxury detailing, but everything was perfectly useful. The desk, in particular, was very nice in that it extended the full width of the bedroom, making plenty of space for work and storage. Bathroom water pressure and temperature were great and I experienced no problems. Ditto for the climate control, which was reliable and user-friendly. One minor bathroom complaint is the lack of a traditional shower curtain - a fixed glass shield only extends about half the length of the tub and shower. I consistently ended up with a soaked bathroom floor - annoying to later walk into with socks on.My executive room rate included a simple buffet breakfast in the executive lounge, as well as a complimentary afternoon happy hour with snacks. The smallish executive lounge is awkwardly furnished but I suppose it works. There is also a semi-public internet terminal in the lounge open to those who have paid for the executive rooms, and it is generally available. Breakfast was what I might term continental-plus, with a nice spread of fruits, yogurts, and breads, and a few small chafing dishes of scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, and hash browns. Everything was self-service. The afternoon tea/happy hour featured a few bottles of liquor, several unremarkable wines, beer, sodas, tea, and coffee. There were usually several plates of finger sandwiches and two hot snacks, such as dumplings, croquettes, etc. It's not the best selection in an exec lounge I've ever seen in Asia, but it's a nice perk and I'm not one to turn up my nose at free liquor and nosh.I am pleased to report that what was once my biggest complaint about this hotel was amended on this trip - Internet access is now available via hardwired ethernet cable. The previous wireless-only connection was terrible - slow, intermittent, infuriating. The new wired option is fast and reliable. Even better, it was included in my room rate. The old wireless connection had been an added charge.I love the location of this hotel - it's about two blocks east on Lockhart Road from the bustling red lights and expat bars of Wanchai. It's a short 15-minute walk to Causeway Bay and Times Square. Access to public transit is superb - the Wanchai MTR station is two blocks away, and you can reach the Wanchai Star Ferry Pier via flyovers above street level in about 3 minutes. If you don't feel up to the MTR, regular buses into Central (and other destinations) are less than 2 blocks away. I can't imagine a better location on Hong Kong Island that puts you so close to so many things, with the real, bustling Hong Kong right at your doorstep.Service was fine at the hotel, although I had little interaction with anyone, as I don't typically avail myself of concierge, bellhop, or other services. The front desk does seem very crowded most of the time, but executive room priveleges include the ability to check in and out at the executive lounge on the top floor, so I didn't even have to deal with that.All in all, unless something at the Novotel changes dramatically for the worse, I won't ever consider another hotel in Hong Kong (except perhaps the Peninsula, for my honeymoon.).

The taxis that have got prime position outside the hotel don't want small fares, and are looking for runs to the airport, so don''t be surprised if they don't want to take you just a mile of so. They will even get you another passing taxi so they don't get a small fare.Overall nice central hotel that isn't expensive. Good for tourists and business. P.S.

If you're on holiday and aren't pushed for time then a good way to get into Central is to take the Star Ferry from the nearby Wanchai ferry terminal across to Tsimshatsui and then another ferry back into Central. For only a few pence for each crossing it's well worth it.There are many nice restaurants (western and oriental), cafes, internet cafes and bars near to the hotel, many of which are accessible via the numerous walkways. The Italian restaurant in the hotel is also very pleasant with good food, friendly staff and reasonable prices.The hotel rooms are quite compact but I wouldn't say they are excessively small. They are clean, comfortable and with all the facilities that you would expect. The reception area is quite large and the staff were efficient and friendly.

The overall experience was okay because of the sight seeing but I was not impressed by the hotel staff. Asian tourists asking questions of lobby staff definitely not liked. The rooms were standard. It says alot that the most friendliest and helpful staff were the housekeeping cleaning ladies! Stayed at hotel for 5 nights-and each morning the buffet breakfast was almost identical. Had heard so much about HK dim sum and even their 2 type-dim sum offering was not interchanged with other types. It does not take a lot to be creative to inject some variety into the buffet spread-after all a number of guests there including myself were there for conferences (extended stay). The waitresses there were often curt and distinctly less attentive to us Asians, clear discrimination in obvious better service to the westerners (becos they tipped well?? or they paid more for their rooms??). We were made to wait for coffee while a waitress went about filling up their cups (skirting around our table) even tho our request was made earlier. The dining experience was well below par than most 4-star hotels I have stayed. Very disappointing on that score. The hotel location is convenient- short walk to Wan Chai MTR, HKCEC and Star Ferry.

We were put on the smoking floor, tho niether of us smoke. The room didn't smell smokey so I didn't ask to be moved. The rooms are small but clean. The bed was tiny and lumpy. Bathroom fine, shower really nice! The breakfast was dismal and definately not worth paying for - there are a few places nearby to grab something. Once you find you're way round you realise its a good location. The MRT is about a 10min walk and is clean, air conditioned and cheap (nothing like the London tube!!). The star ferry also has a landing dock at Wan Chai and is worth a trip over at night - around 15p a trip!! It can be a bit rough so beware! Times square is a good location for shopping. People raved about Nathan Road in Kowloon but we weren't impressed - I wouldn't advise people to buy electrical or camera equipment from the stores here, They seemed a bit dodgy. The are 2 floors in the Times Square mall devoted to electrical stuff. Be sure to open the boxes and try things before you buy. Nathan road does have a lovely Irish pub (about two thirds down on left hand side) which serves the most amazing burgers I've ever tasted!! We spent a day at Disney which was a really fun day out. \u62e218 entrance. It is small compared to Eurodisney so must be tiny compared to the USA but great craic. Very few queues. Only 1 fast ride but after 3 goes on it we'd had enough! We also went on the cable car to see a giant Buddha. Bit of a tourist trap, cable car took 30mins each way but was not a scary ride compared to some I've been on. Listen out for the annoying song they play on a loop the entire trip!

This hotel caters to a lot of tourists, and there was a group of tourists checking in at the same. * The toilet flush was a little slow... individuals are recommended to check this out once you get the room.* I was checked in to the 6th floor, and these rooms are not refurbished... so don't take the pictures for granted. Things for note:-* Pay Per View channels cost HKD 90/movie -- but you can watch the repeats of the same show the entire day (they charge per movie per day basis) Note: Wan Chai is quite centrally located if you want a quiet area.... peaceful from the hustling and busy streets of Causeway Bay and Time Square.

The local MTR station is also only 5 minutes walk away.
